Bob,

Give Konqueror a try.
If you have fast Internet access, I can recommend you just download latest 
release of Linux-Mandrake (LM) or SuSE and install it (it's available for 
FREE). 
For Mandrake, you can always upgrade to latest version of KDE/Konqueror using 
one of Cooker (development version of LM) mirrors.
Latest stable version of Konqueror is 2.2.2.

I, personally, use this mirror:
ftp://ftp.sunet.se/pub6/os/Linux/distributions/mandrake-devel/cooker/i586/Mandrake/RPMS
If you have CD-recorder, you can download 2-CD version of LM as ISO images 
and burn them.
It should be located here:
ftp://ftp.sunet.se/pub6/os/Linux/distributions/
(llok for 'mandrake-iso' folder)

To get Konqueror's features as close to Lynx as possible:
* disable JavaScript globally
* disable Java globally
* I recommend to set Cookie policy to "Ask", so that you can enable cookies 
for the sites you trust and disable ofr other sites (advertising bananers, 
etc.)
* increase Appearance->Font Size->Minimum Font Size from default 7 to, say, 
12, and
Appearance->Font Size->Medium Font Size from 10 to, say, 14
I guess than you will get all well-written web pages in rather big, easily 
readable letters.
(you need to set for Standard Font, Fixed Font, etc. either TrueType fonts or 
PostScript Type1 fonts, as having scalable font is abolutely necessary to get 
it scaled well)
* Plugins - disable Netscape Plugins globally (so you will not get Flash or 
other bandwidth-consuming content)
* if you have some special accessibility requirements - you may want to 
select custom Styleshhet in Stylesheets configuration dialog
* userAgent - you should leave "as is", as http://www.audi.de probably is 
just one of a few sites which really requires UA tweaking/faking.
BTW: for all people on the list, I recommend to try http://www.audi.de in 
your favourite browser to see what "browser discrimination" really means ...

Yes, I agree here that Mozilla is really slow. It takes Mozilla around 20sec. 
to start (on my laptop, while I have 128MB of RAM and Pentium III/500MHz!) 
and around 5-7 sec. just to open another windows! This is absolutely 
unacceptable, as MS IE starts in about 3 sec., and opens new window almost 
instantly (unless it's crashed or was hanged :-)

I browse usually with with Plugins disabled (as I don't want to watch crappy 
Flash animations, unless I really need it) and JS enabled, as it's really 
required on some sites.
I don't have Java as it's not free and was not in my Linux distribution, but 
from what I heard IBM's Java works very well on Linux and rather reliable. 
You may want to try it (but not Sun's JVM, as it's known to have some 
problems and glitches)
