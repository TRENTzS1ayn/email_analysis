Hi Ineke,

it may be that there is a bug in Bobby. It is only a piece of software, and
there is no reason to imagine it is a perfect one. I am sure they have a
feedback mechanism so you can report it, so they can fix it in future.

Also, Bobby does ask a user to test a number of things themself before adding
an icon, but there is no check that these things were tested - CAST doesn't
sue people who are misusing the icon...

cheers

  Hi Kynn, Chas and the others.


   I just tested  my fansite in Bobby again and it becomes even still more
  strange.

  In a few pages of the same site I coded songtitles in another language  as
   german like  <span xml:lang="it">Pizza Wundaba</span> and there Boby does
   not see any accessproblem.

  Only in <html  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
   xml:lang="de"> it gives an accessibility errror.

  I visited also some so called submitted approved sites. I did not think they
   were very  usable and in one site  I clicked a link and I got a page
  without
   warning downloaded.to my computer (what I really hate) .
   It that an approved accessible site??? I will eat all my toes when those
   site accessible  is...

   greetings
   Ineke
