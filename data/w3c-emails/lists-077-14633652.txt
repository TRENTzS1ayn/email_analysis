Hi Ian,

an answer that is very ahort, and one that is very long:

short: Yes, SVG should let you get the content out of a presentation, and
enable the same things as flash. Of course it depends how it is used, so it
is important that authors and tools follow approriate accessibility
guidelines.

long: There is a W3C Note that I co-wrote called "Accessibility Features of
SVG" that describes some of this and how to do it in detail at
http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG-access

cheers

  which is completely inaccessible correct? It obviously doesn't make sense to
  provide an actual alternative but if we could even get the information out
  then that would be an improvement? I recently came across 3 fantastic offers

  possible or likely to be possible to say get the text from such a book if it
  were in SVG format? I'm concerned that we might be missing an opportunity to
  possibly define specific standards (as opposed to the general guildelines
  given in the SVG specification on Accessibility) before SVG becomes more
  commonly used?

  I'm getting the feeling that my fundatmental lack of understanding of
  exactly what SVG is and how it works may be letting me down so apologies if
  the above is simply rubbish!! But my concern is genuine.

  Cheers

  Necessity to support PDF (Acrobat) is still questionable to me.
  PDF is not W3C standard/recommendation, and is based on PostScript which is
  good but aged technology.
  I think XML+CSS, plus SVG for vector-based pictures suites needs of modern
  desktop much better than PDF.

  Besides, missing PDF/PS support in Windows is not critical at all - as you
  can install GhostScript and it will do all this stuff for you.
  To prevent (possible) questions about Linux - GhostScript comes as standard
  with all major Linux distributions, and KDE/QT uses it for printing and
  "printing to PDF" (PDF generation)

  My major concern with Microsoft is SVG support. MS supports XML and
  (partially) CSS2, and there are even some CSS3 properties implemented.
  XHTML support is not listed among "available features" of MS IE, but so far
  it works ok.
  If MS is kind enough and can add SVG to MS IE - it would be great for
  everyone.

  That's what I was keeping in mind speaking about Microsoft.
  I wrote "plugin" but exact packaging of "SVG-enabler" application is not so
  important.
  Adobe's plugin for MS IE/Windows is an ActiveX control, if I remeber
  correctly. But it works also with Netscape6 if you copy 3 DLL's manually to
  Netscape's Plugins directory.
  Was my second mail (clarification to first one) is again not clear enough?..
  Than I probably should switch to Russian ;-)
