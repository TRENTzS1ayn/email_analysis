Well, golly. Yes, the Region 1 DVD of _Moulin Rouge_ contains audio 
description by IADA Ltd., that is, International Audio Description 
Agency (no Web site). Who runs IADA? Carol McGregor. Who is Carol 
McGregor? Mom of the lovely and talented Ewan McGregor, star of 
_Moulin Rouge_. An inside job!
