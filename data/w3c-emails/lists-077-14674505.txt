  Charles, thanks a lot for clarification!
  Of course, blind people do not need graphics being send over internet

  My point was that you can always disable images (via menu or via
  CSS: img { display: none !important } ) when you don't need them.

Sure. But that should also disable rendering of the text alternatives, and
very often I do need those. Lynx and links and emacs/W3 hhave good ways of
getting at the text altternative content, compared to graphical browsers.

  Now let's think about somebody who has visual disability (say, miopia, in
  -10..-5 range) and wants to use web.
  It will be quite logical to use *graphical* browser for a such person, and in
  addition *to increase font size* for all pages.

Absolutely true. For most people it is important to have a graphical
capability. Even when I use a text browser, I have it configured to be able
to show images if I think I need them. (Again, lynx is the best interface I
know of for only showing particular images and at the same time getting good
text alternatives).

  But does it makes sense to use such lines (9600 baud) nowdays?
  For example, I use PPP (dial-up), and if I can't connect faster than 19200
  (say, at least 28800) - I just make a break, drink a cup of tea (as I prefer
  tea to cofee :-) and try later.

Well, my mobile phone only has connections at 9600 baud. So if I am on a
train all day and need to work (this happens to me about 5 days a year)
that's as much as I get for now. Also, it is still the case that I get a
connection at something very slow on a PPP (which I use a lot) for several
days in a row - too long to have a break and try again. (Maybe I just need to
increase my coffee capacity <grin/>)

  WAP: yes, I know also about WAP and mobile phones. But WAP just sucks,
  it's dead format. I interviewed a lot of people about mobile
  communication (mostly - General Managers or other top-level managers),
  and most of them replied that they do not need it [ "I use phone to make
  calls, that's it"]. I know that this can sound very different from, say,
  Gartner reports - but I prefer to trust to real-world reports, not to
  synthetic ones. So, WAP is not excuse here at all.

I don't think the issue of whether WAP as a format is any good is the same as
the issue of whether people use mobile devices - many people I know use
mobile devices to get access for their normal services, and it is slow.

I don't think we can force "them" to adopt SVG in any area, but I think it is
happening anyway. And other than mobile devices I don't think there is a big
bandwidth problem. The other intersting problem is high-latency connections,
and that is still only research for people doing space travel planning.
