The funny thing about Mozilla is that some Mozilla hackers/users tell "you 
should swicth to Mozilla ASAP, it's very good!" while others tell: "it's not 
ready yet. You should wait 1.0 release".
Mozilla 1.0 was initially planned for the spring 2001, than slipped till 
autumn 2001. At that moment I got an idea - it can be that Mozilla will never 
reach 1.0 release :-)
And in fact I was not far away from the truth: now it's planned for April 
2002, but I doubt that they will be able to fix all outstanding bugs (not 
speaking about reducing startup time and improoving rendering speed).
I am, in particular, very much interested in CSS and how Mozilla renders 
*valid* CSS code. Last time when I was checking Mozilla 1_0 targeted bugs, 
there were around 500 CSS1 open bugs and about 60 CSS2 bugs.
I mean here *bugs targeted at 1.0 release*. Do you think that they will be 
able to close 550 bugs just in 4 months? I doubt it. But release *with* those 
bugs not fixed will be disaster. So I think Mozilla will slip by another year 
(or two) :-((
