Hello Michael!

What kind of browser do you use?
I launched
http://www.nbcolympics.com/,
everything was rendered fine.
than I was redirected to:
http://www.nbcolympics.com/x/f/frame.htm?u=/news/nbcomain_front.asp
which showed me ... empty white screen.
                                   ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
And there is no surprise with that, as this URL has following *source*:
- - - - - - -
<html>
<head>
<title>Olympics</title>
</head>
<script language=javascript src=/x/inc/get_guid.asp></script>
<script language=javascript src=/x/js/xtd_funct.js></script>
<script language=javascript src=/x/js/stdframe.js></script>
<noscript><p>Javascript must be enabled to view this site.</noscript>
</html>
- - - - - - -

This code explains why you (or in this case, me) see nothing.
//  I saved all three files to hard disk for further analysis

If you have JavaScript disabled, you should get 
"Javascript must be enabled to view this site"
But, they made an error in their code!
<p></p> tag should be inside <body></body>
and they even do not open <body>!

So there is no wonder that my standards-compilant browser rejects to display 
this crap!...
Anyone with Lynx: can you try those URLs?
Can you get through?

Now, I need to reboot to Windows from Linux and test this site with MS IE.
Have no further comments until it's done.

believe me, their code is crap!
You don't need special automated tools to understand that.

|
|   However, there is improvement, that is something.
|

Really?
Oh, yes. I have saved copy of nbcolympics.com site from Sydney 2000
(if anyone is interested, I can put it on ftp somewhere, zipped)
At least that copy was working.
Now it seems they have broken their site even further.  :-((

|   It should be noted, that is reported that the Olympic has cost 2 billion
|   American Dollars in Salt Lake City.  Between 300 and 400 million of that
| is coming from the American Taxpayer.  I think the Salt Lake folks can do a
| lot better.

Ah, can I get small amount from this money for redesigning their site? :-))
