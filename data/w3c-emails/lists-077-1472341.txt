The Validator currently uses a default DTD (actually, it uses a default
DOCTYPE IIRC) when the document in question does not specify one. This is
done to avoid confusing people more then necessary; it's hard enough to get
people to validate without throwing extra wrenches in the works.

The option to check against arbitrary DTDs is on the TODO and a patch to
implement it is in the queue, but hasn't been approved and applied to the
live service as of yet. IOW it's in progress and will show up eventually.
