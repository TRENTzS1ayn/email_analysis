In fairness to this site the Drop down menus are redundant as if you click
on say the SPORT link it takes you to a  page which has a text listing of
all the items on the drop down menu togeter with associated items.  This
means that it would be navigable by text alone.  Unfortunately they have
spoiled it by requiring javascript and by having moving items on this page
which cannnot be stopped.

I was using Opera 6.x and IE 6.x.

I am pretty well convinced both the NBC site and the SLC site were designed
by the same people...

It is interesting that the design was at least in part paid for with U. S.
Taxpayer Dollars....

Sincerely,

Mike Burks

Hello Michael!

What kind of browser do you use?
I launched
http://www.nbcolympics.com/,
everything was rendered fine.
than I was redirected to:
http://www.nbcolympics.com/x/f/frame.htm?u=/news/nbcomain_front.asp
which showed me ... empty white screen.
                                   ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
And there is no surprise with that, as this URL has following *source*:
- - - - - - -
<html>
<head>
<title>Olympics</title>
</head>
<script language=javascript src=/x/inc/get_guid.asp></script>
<script language=javascript src=/x/js/xtd_funct.js></script>
<script language=javascript src=/x/js/stdframe.js></script>
<noscript><p>Javascript must be enabled to view this site.</noscript>
</html>
- - - - - - -

This code explains why you (or in this case, me) see nothing.
//  I saved all three files to hard disk for further analysis

If you have JavaScript disabled, you should get
"Javascript must be enabled to view this site"
But, they made an error in their code!
<p></p> tag should be inside <body></body>
and they even do not open <body>!

So there is no wonder that my standards-compilant browser rejects to display
this crap!...
Anyone with Lynx: can you try those URLs?
Can you get through?

|   However now dropdown menus are being used with JavaScript and I do not

| yes, it appears it is going to be used for the Para Olympics.  But I
cannot

|

Now, I need to reboot to Windows from Linux and test this site with MS IE.
Have no further comments until it's done.

|

believe me, their code is crap!
You don't need special automated tools to understand that.

|
|   However, there is improvement, that is something.
|

Really?
Oh, yes. I have saved copy of nbcolympics.com site from Sydney 2000
(if anyone is interested, I can put it on ftp somewhere, zipped)
At least that copy was working.
Now it seems they have broken their site even further.  :-((

|   It should be noted, that is reported that the Olympic has cost 2 billion
|   American Dollars in Salt Lake City.  Between 300 and 400 million of that
| is coming from the American Taxpayer.  I think the Salt Lake folks can do
a
| lot better.

Ah, can I get small amount from this money for redesigning their site? :-))
