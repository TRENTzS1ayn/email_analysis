That's good - in this case, if we get them to change code on NBCOlympics.com, 
they can change code on SaltLake site (saltlake2002.com)

well, let's be constructive.
Olympics is 44days from now, so there is some time left to change code on 
that site.
 What actions can be taken by WAI people and/or W3C to influence NBCOlympics 
site design?  Charles, do you have any idea?
 
Further analysis of their code (userAgent _discrimination_) below.

* * *
site itself consist of 3 frames.
But look *how* they allocate/create these frames:

in stdframe.js:
-------------------
document.write('<frameset rows=65,*,30 border=0 scrolling=no framespacing=0 
frameborder=no>'); 
document.write('<frame src=/x/f/frame_top.htm name=header scrolling=no 
marginwidth=0 marginheight=0 noresize/>');
document.write('<frame src='+sPage+' name=content marginwidth=0 
marginheight=0 noresize/>'); 
document.write('<frame src=/x/f/frame_bot.htm name=footer scrolling=no 
marginwidth=0 marginheight=0 noresize/>'); 
document.write('</frameset>');

So, if you *disabled* JavaScript, you will not get to this site. And you will 
not get these frames displayed.
And it's even not browser-related (you can disable JS even in MS IE).

Therefor, my conclusion that NBCOlympics.com is not accessible at all.
(even for people *without* disabilities!..)

I loaded all 3 scripts into KWrite (text editor).
in stdframe.js found following:
-------------------
function UberSniff() {
????????var ua=navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase();
????????this.webtv = (ua.indexOf("webtv")>-1);
????????this.ie = (parseFloat(ua.slice(ua.indexOf("msie")+5)));
????????this.nn = 
(this.ie)?(-1):(ua.indexOf("netscape6")>-1)?(parseFloat(ua.slice(ua.indexOf("netscape6/")+10))):(parseFloat(ua.slice(ua.indexOf("mozilla/")+8)));
????????this.mac = (ua.indexOf("mac")>-1);
????????this.screenHeight = screen.height;
????????this.screenWidth = screen.width;
????????this.colorDepth = (this.nn>=4)?screen.pixelDepth:screen.colorDepth;
}

from what I see -> ?this site is discriminating Konqueror.
(and Opera as well;  Mike, have you beed using Opera 6.0 in _MS IE_ emulation 
mode? Can you try without it?)
Ok, I tweaked userAgent to fake as MS IE5 on Windows.
Launched site. It was rendered O.K. on URL above.
But than, after 1 minute (I was doing other tasks) I found that screen is 
empty. (white empty screen again, like without UA faking)

It seems that they are doing some interval-based update, and this is causing 
later desctruction of rendered page somewhere.
Needs further investigation :-((

|   But, they made an error in their code!
|   <p></p> tag should be inside <body></body>
|   and they even do not open <body>!
