Vadim, check the mailing list archives.  There was previously a thread
about the Olympics site.  One of the main points that _I_ would like to
make is that random selection of a "target" and continued public
criticism of that target site's web design and coding is not productive,
nor is it the appropriate topic for this mailing list.

Other people have expressed, in the past, a desire to create a frontier
justice style mailing list, where anyone who wishes to can put up a
site for public lynching.  I think that if such a project needs to be
undertaken, it should be done off the WAI list, which isn't really
suited for this kind of "shame them and talk about them behind their
backs" approach to increasing accessibility.
