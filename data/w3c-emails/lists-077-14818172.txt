yes, and it was started by Michael R. Burks on Dec.11, 2001.
Or do you mean that there were several threads on Olympics site?
I use as mailer KMail (check mail's header, look for 'X-Mailer' field)
X-Mailer: KMail [version 1.3.1]

and KMail supports "threads" very well.
So, Michael's mail in wai-ig folder is just 2 raws before my answer/comment 
;-)
I know things look like very much different in MS Outlook, and that's Outlook 
guilty in breaking threads on all mailing lists, including this.

well, I do not think that Olympics site (wether it's "official" 
www.olympics.com or "tweaked by NBC" www.nbcolympics.com) is a regular site.
It will be used by millions of people, not like some low-traffic web site.
So posting like 
"http://www.angryflower.com/ is not rendered correctly with JavaScript 
enabled, but after disabling JS it renders O.K." is most likely off-topic 
here (BTW: it was real bug report I was looking at, you may check at 
http://bugs.kde.org/ and search for bug # 35622), but I think problem with 
Olympics site accessibility is On-Topic.
Anyway, let moderator to moderate this thread, please... ;-)

ok, send them to http://bugs.kde.org/ and ask them to file a bug report.
[but they should check first with Konqueror that there is a rendering problem]
And, by the way, I already filed bug report and received acknoledgement.
You can check it at 
http://bugs.kde.org/db/36/36513.html
and send comments/extra info to  <36513@bugs.kde.org>

it's ok with me if creators of this site can show their face and post here.
Or at least to contact me off-list.
Most corporations do dirty work "behind your back", and in contrast to their 
dirty games, we are playing clean, fare game. And I post under my real name, 
with no fear that someone in Microsoft or NBC will dislike me.

And, until some companies put on web non-validated content, causing problems 
for web surfers, it's my *duty* to point out to those companies on these 
problems. And ask them to correct these mistakes.
