Someone's exaggerating. Lynx is merely less bad than was suggested. 
It's actually pretty good.

Actually, Lynx fails to support the HTML 4/XHTML components that the 
graphical browsers tend to fail to support-- unfortunately, it seems 
to to be mostly the accessibility stuff. Other components, like id on 
anything.

>Am I bashing on your favorite web access app?  No, I don't think so,

but you do seem to be flying off that handle. It is pretty common for 
Web developers to run multiple browsers-- even manifestly broken ones 
like Netscape 4. It's just that Lynx isn't even as bad as Netscape 4. 
Another arrow in the quiver, you might say. And you can*not* beat it 
for mailing Web pages to yourself (or anyone else) in stunningly 
readable text-only format.

The really annoying thing is that competing text-only browsers, like 
W3M or whatever it's called, do certain things Lynx has never managed 
(like true table display) while flubbing a whole lot else. I wish 
someone would invent a *really* good text-only browser. I suppose 
that would require someone to pay actual developers to do it.
