Right!  That's correct!  Very good!

It's not THAT hard to figure out that Lynx doesn't MAGICALLY become
a good browser just because other browsers also suck!

Only barely.  Netscape 2 was an HTML viewer.  Lynx is an HTML viewer.
Lynx has 5 more years of development than Netscape 2, but it's not
5 years more advanced, in my opinion.

What does "by concensus" mean in this case?  Are you saying, "W3C
recommendations" or are you not saying "W3C recommendations"?

Near as I can tell, the standards Lynx supports -- for content --
consists of HTML 3.2 and maybe HTML 4.01, although I'm not sure that
claim is particularly proven.  There's supposed support for XHTML,
but handling a <br/> correctly isn't really the same as XHTML
support.

No, because those aren't things Netscape 2.0 did.

I'm sorry if you don't.  In the future I will be sure to clear all
comparisons with you, so that you don't possibly take offense at
something as harmless as this.

How does "linearizing content" make it more accessible, and to
whom?  Please support your statements; I don't think you know what
you're talking about here.

The old rules are limited, however, and are based on an understanding
of the web when the web was 5 years younger.  Lynx is a terrible
guide, for example, for telling you if someone with a cognitive
disability related to reading comprehension can use your page.

Actually, that's not true at all.  The way a Braille terminal renders
a page may be completely different from the way Lynx renders it, especially
if that Braille terminal is hooked up to software which fuzzles with the
DOM or sniffs HTML attributes unrevealed by Lynx or whatnot.

Once again -- why am I continually having to disclaim my statements?
-- Lynx isn't a bad application for what it does, and I like it and use
it regularly, but it's at best a limited HTML viewer.  Why are so many
people afraid of facing the limitations of this particular sacred
cow?
