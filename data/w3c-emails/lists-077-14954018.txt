  On a laptop with a Pentium III (550Mhz) and 128 MB RAM, Mozilla 0.9.6
  starts in approx. 6-7 seconds at normal load. Opening a new window takes
  approximately 2 seconds.

  I really suggest you look into the memory management and load on your
  machine; alternatively the speed of your disk. I won't even suggest
  replacing the OS.
