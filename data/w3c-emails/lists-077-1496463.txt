Such a patch can be implemented on (at least) two levels.  A simple
hack in the CGI script can insert an arbitrary doctype declaration
before feeding the document to the validator: crude, but effective
if you're stuck with a Perl/CGI wrapper for nsgmls.

Alternatively, a DTD could be hacked up with marked sections to
include or ignore different DTDs.  I'm interested in this approach
because of the fine control it could (in principle) give to turn
individual fragments on or off in the context of validating for
accessibility.  If anyone's got a patch of this kind, I'd be
interested to hear from you, as it remains on my to-do list.
