I think answer is 'yes'.
But as many people expressed, they want (sometimes) text-only browser, not 
depending on any graphics library/GUI (wether it's X-Windowing System, MacOS 
or Windows)
I think that something like SVGAlib is also acceptable. And it can be that 
QT/Embedded is also ok, I have heard that it takes just 2.5MB of memory, and 
that's ok even for low-end PDA or hypothetical microwave owen with web 
interface.
To my best knowledge, Opera in Sharp Zaurus operates over QT/Embedded, and 
IMO it should be very good solution - fast and not consuming a lot of memory.
Besides, Opera5 is better than MS IE4 (which is inside Windows CE on WinCE 
handhelds). Worth testing :-)

I recall some time when I was doing some 2D graphics library/GUI on 286/16MHz 
with 2MB (? 4MB) of memory, and it was pretty fast.
In fact it was so fast that menus were disappearing *too fast* when I tested 
this program on 386/20MHz (I did mistake of hard-coding show/hide timeouts)
[ Hint: I decided to get rid from both Borland's graphics library (BGI) and 
Microsoft's libs, an programmed EGA/VGA directly, via ports and interrupts; 
this gave excellent results - drawing speed was about 10 times fatser than in 
Borland libs and 2-3 times faster than MS ]

So I think you can make browser supporting (basic) graphics and doing (core) 
layouting with requirements like this or slightly more.
Question is wether it worth developing: as even PDAs have 200MHz CPU nowdays, 
and about 64MB of RAM.

Anyway, all this doesn't answer question in subject: what should be "Minimal 
Browser Capabilities"...
