|   I can't View either at all in any way.

|

after further investigation I found a way to use this site without JavaScript

Here are URLs I tested: 
http://www.nbcolympics.com/news/nbcomain_front.asp
Sports:
http://www.nbcolympics.com/ats/index.html
Figure Skating
http://www.nbcolympics.com/ats/fs/fs_index.html

Links from the frontpage:
Variety is the spice of life
http://www.nbcolympics.com/news/633286.asp
(or try any other)

As it was mentioned already, Lynx doesn't have JS and therefor it doesn't 
need any special tuning - you can launch these URLs directly.
I was using Konqueror (and it has JavaScript), so I disabled it first 
(globally).
And those URLs I extracted from JavaScript and generated frame-page.
Launching them "directly" had no side effect.
(if you try these URLs with JS, JS will auto-redirect you to frame-based 
layout)
All images stored on (and loaded from) Akamai - do not have 'alt' property.
The rest is _typical_ FrontPage-generated HTML. 

It would be nice if someone (with good Lynx experience) can try these links 
and share his thoughts. After all, can blind people get at least something, 
or they will be completely lost in countless tables/TD/TR tags?
