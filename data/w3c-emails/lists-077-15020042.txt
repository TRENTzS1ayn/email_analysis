I don't anyone says Lynx is a "good" browser however you define "good"

is anything magical about the "5 year" line you keep drawing???  I have
been using what passes for the internet since 1975 (Univac 1108
mainframe) we've come a long way but while I doubt we need to support that
old Univac where do we draw the line at what we support.

understanding the reasons for the limitations is more important than any
particular browser.  I personally would set a standard more performance
based.

as a trial balloon and I am sure I am overlooking something whatever this
baseline is should be able to be viewed by

. any 8086 computer or higher, running any version of Dos.
. any Mac OS
. any comparable "command line" OS
. free, public and supported
. not require a PPP connection to the web

???? too basic ???
