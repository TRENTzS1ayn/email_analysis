  You suppose wrong - and it really would support your own position
  much better if you ceased making comments that presume on what
  others recognise or have opinions on. Them's spitin' woids, and I
  quite frankly can't see why you take such an agressive stance
  at every single crossroads.

  After all, you *did* start this yourself by making an incorrect
  comparison between Lynx and another browser.
