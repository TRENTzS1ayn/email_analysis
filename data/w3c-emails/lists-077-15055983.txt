Right, and that's why those people should have access to a text-only
browser that supports HTML 4.01, CSS, XHTML, XML, DOM, ECMAscript,
SVG, and more.

The solution isn't to say, "well, it's okay for those people to
continue to have limited access to the web!" nor is it okay to say
"we'll have to limit everyone else's access to the web!"  The solution
is to say, "this is what a browser _should_ support," list those items,
realize that it's NOT set in stone (unlike some people who believe that
1996's HTML is all we need!), and then encourage work on browsers to
meet those targets.
