  I assume this must be a cultural thing, but I am still sorry that you
  feel the need to be condescending.

  Nor is it hard to figure out that Lynx does not magically become a
  poor browser just because you say so. As has been pointed out quite
  clearly, Lynx have far better capabilities than you claim, and anything
  outside that is a matter of taste.

  You are entitled to your opinion, of course, but Lynx can quite easily
  be proven to be more advanced. I am sure you can conceive of a few
  tests that will prove Lynx to be a better - in your words - "HTML
  viewer".

  I suggest http://www.m-w.com/:

Main Entry: con?sen?sus <http://www.m-w.com/images/audio.gif>
Pronunciation: k&n-'sen(t)-s&s
Function: noun
Usage: often attributive
Etymology: Latin, from consentire
Date: 1858
1 a : general agreement : UNANIMITY <the consensus of their opinion, based on reports... from the border -- John Hersey> b : the judgment arrived at by most of those concerned 

  "By concensus" in this case should be taken to mean "By general agreement
   by the most of those concerned", ie. those people and organizations that
   together define standards for the WWW - such as Microsoft, Netscape, etc.

  The W3C.

  I suggest you try using the LINK element in various browsers including
  Lynx. This was introduced in HTML 2.0, and as far as I know only Lynx
  has so far gotten it right.

  Of course not - but the fact remains that Lynx handles <br/> correctly,
  something Netscape 4 - to keep comparing - does not. You might want to
  claim that this does not make Lynx more advanced in it's interpretation
  of markup languages than Netscape 4, but you would be wrong.

  Yet again - I fail to understand why you insist on this agressive
  approach to what was a simple correction of fact.

  There is a point to this insult ?

  The 'old rules' are quite good - and limited only by a lack of
  understanding by the amount of people who jumped on the WWW bandwagon
  in the last 3-4 years.

  Testing a product - and a webpage is a product - is a lengthy process
  that consist of several steps. Using Lynx for linearizing is one
  good such.

  Am I to understand that you claim, above, that a Braille terminal will
  present information - by its very nature textual - in a non-linear form
  to users ?

  It would be quite interesting to see the level of understanding a test
  subject gets from having various elements such as pop-up windows and
  menus brailled inbetween, on top of, or mixed in with the other
  information on a page.

  You've not considered that you might be wrong; and that the fear is
  squarely in your camp ?
