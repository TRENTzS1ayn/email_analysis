well put, I am mostly in this discussion concerned with maintaining
usability to the max number of users but how far back in OS, browser,

running COMit to access the web via Lynx and it still works, should it??
  I think so.

in my business we work a lot with "performance" based specifications, and
how you meet those performance standards is up to the vendor.  in this
case we (meaning W3C) need to decide what those performance standard
are.  how it is acomplished is up to the creativity of the coder.
