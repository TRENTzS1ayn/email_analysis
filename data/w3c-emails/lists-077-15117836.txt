but they don't and no one is running out to buy it for them. so what is
"desirable" and what exists is significantly different.  asking a person
in xxxx to go out and buy or even download a free browser that may or may
not work on the antique they run is not realistic.

even the most advanced website using all the bells and whistles avaliable
SHOULD be able to without user input, degrade to a very simple system
readable by the most archaic browser in use. 
  and believe me, 1996 HTML is a dream to many users. some would consider
it an improvement to get a computer with enough memory to run Win 3.1!!!

  these people have a right to use the World Wide Web TOO!

saying "they should have" whatever doesn't get them "what they should
have" and/or a computer that will even be able to run what "they should
have"   personally consider a baseline, a computer without a hard drive
running on floppies and containing 640mb of RAM. Lynx will run on that
machine.  what else will??
