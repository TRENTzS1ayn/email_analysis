Hiroshi,

Accessible chat software is one of the areas that comes under the Authoring
Tool Accessibility Guidelines most directly. Recently the group has begun
looking more at the range of tools we are addressing.

I would be interested in what results or thoughts you have from this project
- please feel free also to post them directly to the Authoring Tools working
group - w3c-wai-au@w3.org and read the archives at
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-au or join the list.

Cheers

Charles McCathieNevile

  The Japanese Society for Rehabilitation of Persons with Disabilities (JSRPD)
  is working on development of accessible IRC chat software to invite
  deaf-blind users to "the real time caption service of TV broadcasting on the
  net".

  "The real time caption service of TV broadcasting on the net" is an
  achievement of the disabilities community in Japan as a result of the
  revision of the Copyright Law in 2000.  Information Centers for the Deaf and
  JSRPD are officially entitled to distribute the real time caption of the TV
  program through IRC chat.

  If we could develop accessible IRC chat system for deaf-blind people, they
  may extend their currently most limited real-time information sources.
  I strongly suggest to include "accessible chat software development" as one
  of the target issues of WAI.
