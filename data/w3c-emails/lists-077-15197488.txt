No, I meant can post - if you own the original copyright (and most content
providers do, or have sufficient license to use it for publishing) then you
can post a different format.

  Did you mean can't post, rather than can post?

  This is a feature of PDF that may well make content providers reluctant
  to provide alternative forms with lesser technical imposition of IPR
  constraints.  (PDF, in general, has a lot of features aimed at commercial
  users.  The only real IPR support in browsers at the moment is that which
  requires downloadable fonts to be tied to a site - one reason why
  downloadable fonts aren't much used.)
