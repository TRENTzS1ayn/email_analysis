Yep, this is an important issue. How often is it reasonable to expect users
to upgrade their software, their hardware, or their knowledge?

In the discussion that took place in teh WCAG group, one of the points I
think was important was that it is at least as important to work out what are
the criteria for deciding if a feature is sufficiently available that we
demand that the user learn to use it. For example does it need to be
available in one free browser for each platform? Or does it need to be
avalable in IE (which is not a multi-platform browser - it is available on
two platforms and the versions are effectively different pieces of software)?
Or does it need to be available for at least two years?

etc.

cheers
