How many disabled users are there on the WCAG, I think you will find that
there are probably more people with disabilities and disability
organizations and developers with disabilities on this group than on the
WCAG.  If we are talking about making the web available for people with
disabilities isn't it important we give them a voice...and listen to them.

I think you were right at the start of the thread (and I was wrong);
the "minimum browser capabilities" discussion is a topic for WCAG and
not general IG talk.

I'll post a reply there.
