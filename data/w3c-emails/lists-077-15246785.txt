Kynn, you will then be as pleased as I am that the WCAG group is working with
a few organisations (notably in the UK) to empirically test the usability of
WCAG 2 in particular, following some research done and published on WCAG 1.0.

It is listed as an issue by the group - you should be able to follow it
there. http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wcag20-issues.html#14

cheers

  If Nielsen's work teaches us nothing else, it should teach us that
  standard empirical methods of research and study can be applied to
  accessibility and it's not just pie-in-the-sky hopes and personal
  anecdotes. [*]
