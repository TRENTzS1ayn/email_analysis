Hi Jim,

acn you explain a bit more what the code you are describing looks like?

If I am understanding corectly you are suggesting that instead of puttin the
headers in header elements, with id, and then referring to them via the
headers attribute, they should be plain table data?

So instead of having th elements in the first row are you suggeting having td
elements? Or have I misunderstood?

  Although it is heresy, the simplest and most usable solution is to take all
  the top material OUT of the table, so the actual headings, "Bezeichnung
  Portion KH BE" are in the first row.

  Now HPR and JFW will read the headings. Window-Eyes will too when it is set
  up correctly: Use CTRL+SHIFT+H to cycle through headings announcements and
  choose "Column and Row." Then Turn on table mode with CTRL+PLUS. When in
  table mode, use INS+Arrow to move around the table.
