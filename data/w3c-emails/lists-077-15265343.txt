Well, the IG doesn't have a mechanism that I know of for making a summary.
Anyone is free to try and offer one, and we can see what nobody disagrees
with, the point the EO group to what's left, as well as the discussion
threads here. But my personal feeling is that it would be more useful for
each person with comments to make them directly to the working group.

cheers

  been discussing this topic here can take a moment to read the draft of that

  Thanks for reminding us about this working document Charles. You are right -
  it would be good to return to this lively discussion after everyone has had
  time to read the document. I am sure there will be even greater debate then -
  based on the specifics contained in the draft.

  It would be good to follow-up with comments to the working group. May be some
  of the comments made through this forum could be captured in summary form and
  sent to the working group. What do others think?
