  Question:

  If you have an accessible HTML version of a document, do we need to make the
  PDF version of the document accessible too?  What if the PDF version is only
  made available for printing purposes (and marked as such)?

  In that case, I'd concentrate on making the HTML accessible and forget about
  the PDF.

  What does everyone else think?
