One thing I have noted in this is we continually talk of PDF.  We never
bother to say a pdf created by Acrobat distiller 2.0, a pdf created from a
scanned document by Adobe Acrobat 3.0,4.0,5.0 etc.  Each of these is a
totally different item, yes they may share the same file extension but the
accessibility of each will be totally different.  THe fact that Acrobat 5.0
has a degree of accessibility if properly used does not sudenly make all the
other "pdf" documents accessible.

I think that is a very sensible approach.

  Question:

  If you have an accessible HTML version of a document, do we need to make
the
  PDF version of the document accessible too?  What if the PDF version is
only
  made available for printing purposes (and marked as such)?

  In that case, I'd concentrate on making the HTML accessible and forget
about
  the PDF.

  What does everyone else think?
