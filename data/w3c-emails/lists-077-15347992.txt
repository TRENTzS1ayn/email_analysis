|   why aren't these URL advertised

this question is easy to answer :-((
They sell *banners*, every new hit displays new banner (or 2-3 banners)
Javascript on main page _forces_ you to see site _exactly_ in way they need 
(you see all banners, preferable search engine, link to MSNBC.com, joint 
venture of NBC and MSN.com, etc.)
Turning Off JavaScript you take-off their banners...
That's why it's said "JavaScript is required to see NBCOlumpics.com"
There is no other _technical_ requiremnt, as far as I can conclude from their 
code.

don't know about that. I think it was in "GAMES" section, don't remember.
