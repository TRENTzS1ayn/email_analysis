Kynn, it seems that web accessibility was borne with you if we are to
take what you say litterally.  I am going to take one statement and
paraphrase it and refute it.  If this statement is not attributable to
you, we can blame it on my screen reader and I would think you would
know better than to make such a statement so I am in doubt that I heard
it from you.
wcag was never tested.
As wcag was being developped, there was a lot of testing that went into
it.  In fact, you can see lots of test pages that were created aand lots
of techniques for following the guidelines that were developped based on
lots of feedback from lots of users under varying circumstances and the
addition is still going on.  I know this was not scientific but that may
actually have beena good thing because it would have cost lots of money
and taken 15 or 20 years to develop something we could at least start
with and we might never have seen the guidelines emerge and when they
did if they did, they would have een standards and someone would have
had to buy the document in order to become a member of that elete group
of people blessed with the knowledge.
