the danger I see in this is that the pdf will be updated and the html
will not.  The two must some how be linked.  I think though that
supplying an accessible version of a document is a good idea and has
merit in the hard copy world.  Many documents that are printed in hard
copy are marked up for braille before embossing and we would not want
them in print.

I think that is a very sensible approach.

  Question:

  If you have an accessible HTML version of a document, do we need to
make the
  PDF version of the document accessible too?  What if the PDF version
is only
  made available for printing purposes (and marked as such)?

  In that case, I'd concentrate on making the HTML accessible and forget
about
  the PDF.

  What does everyone else think?
