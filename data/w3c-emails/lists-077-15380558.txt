for the sake of contenuity of the thread and so that we can rip you
apart if need be in a neutral place as it were, I'd hope you would put
your statement here.  Other good reasons for this have already been
pointed out.  If you do not publish it here I hope someone will find it
and bring it to us.
Thanks <grin>

I think you were right at the start of the thread (and I was wrong);
the "minimum browser capabilities" discussion is a topic for WCAG and
not general IG talk.

I'll post a reply there.
