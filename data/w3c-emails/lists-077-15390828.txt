Excuse me?  I beg your pardon?

Okay, let's see that statement.  This is it?

I don't believe I said "WCAG was never tested", no.  And certainly if
you read it in context, I stated that there were specific types of
tests which have not been done in a vigorous manner.

Good, so where are the hard statistics in measurable numbers on how
much accessibility is improved if you follow WCAG 1.0 Single-A,
WCAG 1.0 Double-A, and WCAG 1.0 Triple-A?  Kindly point them to me,
or more properly, kindly concede the point that the type of testing
I'm _talking_ about has not yet been done, and these particular
bits of information are not available.

Please don't accuse me of thinking "web accessibility was borne
with me" as a way of avoiding issues.  Nothing annoys me more than
personal insults in lieu of addressing legitimate criticism and
identification of a valid need.
