it is your arrogance that brings this out and it is the arrogant
responses you make that re-oinforces this but I will not differ with you
on your clarification.  I will say though that it would take a lot of
money and a lot of years to come up with metrics and even they might be
worthless depending on how far reaching they are and how much the
technology has changed by then.  I'm not against metrics but I have seen
two things come out of metrics that scare me.  One is that attempts to
measure often distort what is being measured and thus the results are
distorted and two there is often a biass in the measurements that can
invalidate them.

Okay, let's see that statement.  This is it?

I don't believe I said "WCAG was never tested", no.  And certainly if
you read it in context, I stated that there were specific types of
tests which have not been done in a vigorous manner.

Good, so where are the hard statistics in measurable numbers on how
much accessibility is improved if you follow WCAG 1.0 Single-A,
WCAG 1.0 Double-A, and WCAG 1.0 Triple-A?  Kindly point them to me,
or more properly, kindly concede the point that the type of testing
I'm _talking_ about has not yet been done, and these particular
bits of information are not available.

Please don't accuse me of thinking "web accessibility was borne
with me" as a way of avoiding issues.  Nothing annoys me more than
personal insults in lieu of addressing legitimate criticism and
identification of a valid need.
