In the spirit of not trashing sites that seem to have made some effort I
will not detail the problems I had with the first page/frameset.  I do think
this site is a pretty good example of how passing Bobby does not tell you
much about the accessibility of a site.
What exactly does "winning a sponsorship" mean? Does this mean the site will
be considered a good example?
