Hi,

If I recall correctly, some of us were talking about the idea of how
to measure the increase in accessibility of web pages at the WAI
kick-off gathering in Santa Clara.    It is a very thorney issue,
one very similar to measuring usability.

There were some interesting comments.  One was how often disabled
people are "measured" by non-disabled people and there was some resentment
about that.

I tried to suggest bringing in HCI people to help with doing
some research in understanding why there were problems using web pages.
There seemed to be a fair amount of resistance to bringing in
people from outside of the disabled community (unless they brought
money).

Another comment was basically along the lines that who should know better
than disabled web users what their problems are.  The basic assumption
seemmed to that testing of effectiveness wasn't needed for that reason.

Perhaps, it is time to do some soul searching and review what the
assumptions (and culture) the group has in its work.
