Speaking as a disable member of the wai and having no bias one way or
the other about who does the testing, I'd say that if the
quallifications are their for the group who does the testing that I'd be
satisfied with who ever did the testing.  I don't think we need to put
outside thorns in this.  It's already thorny enough right here.  You are
dealing with a more open minded class of individuals here and most of us
have at least some knowledge of what the target is.
