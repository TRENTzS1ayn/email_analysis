  Previous tests with IE 6 for Windows have shown it to indeed be a 
  very good CSS 1 & 2 browser. However, it is still lacking in several
  important (my opinion) areas. I hope that new upgrades will bring it
  up to the level of support currently found in Mozilla and Opera; in
  particular for centering of block level elements and fixed positioning.

  Both Opera, Mozilla, NS 6 and IE 6 now use the DOCTYPE to determine
  whether to render information in compatibility modes.

  This is a quite common occurrence with new versions of old technologies,
  as experiences are brough on line.

  Naturally.

  Sadly, one of the W3C's servers are currently down, but I must admit
  that this confuses me. What is wrong with the CSS rendering model ?

  Centering a block element vertically - especially on a continuous media
  type - doesn't make an awful lot of sense, IMnsHO.
