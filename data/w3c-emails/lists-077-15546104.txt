  I could be said to be somewhat familiar with such concepts, yes ...

  I'm afraid I can't agree there. HTML 4 does not *have* a 'design', it
  doesn't "look" like anything in particular, but is a language for
  structure.

  HTML 4 is, however, rendered in different ways in different browsers, and
  that rendering can be influence (suggested) by CSS. This said, CSS is
  not in any way fundamental to HTML, nor a natural part of browser 
  design.

  CSS is a way to *render* content differently than the default way a
  browser presents it -- and nothing else.

  They allready do. The Adobe SVG viewer is bundled with MS IE 6, and
  since SVG plugins are now also available for Mozilla there is no real
  reason to not use it.
