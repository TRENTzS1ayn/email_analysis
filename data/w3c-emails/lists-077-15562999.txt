Hi,

There are some questions brought up by this mail.  The testing from what I
understand was often done with people who have a fair amount of skill
in using computers and access technology.  Much of the testing seemed
to be on small aspects of web pages rather than looking at the whole
process of using a web page.  The testing often didn't include timing
on how long it took for something to be done.

I'm a little bit surprise at the statement that scientific testing
would take 15 to 20 years and would like to see the test designs
this conjecture is based on.  Jakob Nielsen's work was done in about
6 months or so.
