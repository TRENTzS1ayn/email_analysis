Hi,

Some considerations about metrics include how well designed they are and
under what conditions are measurements and interpretations made.
The Heisenberg uncertainty principle of course is always an issue
and needs to be considered when designing measurements and metrics.

The conjecture that there is often a bias that can invalidate them
should not be used as an excuse to use no metrics.  That is similar
to saying that no program should be used because often they have bugs
in them.  Perfection in metrics or software is rarely achievable.
People learn to accept that something is useful if "good enough".

While it may be psychologically reassuring to lump all metrics together
as a way to dismiss them, the reality of metrics and measurements
is much more complex and subtle.
