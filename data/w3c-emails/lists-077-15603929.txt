All of this requires adjustments and changes which would be in my opinion
beyond the reasonably expected knowledge requirements of users.  Whilst I do
consider that a good knowledge of how to use the operating system of choice,
the vendor provided accessibility tools, and general functions used in menus
such as changing fonts and colours and using Find and documented accessibly
in the help system should be  a requirement the need to change browser
settings to suit different pages is unreasonable. Of course this is looking
at the view that the important thing is the user and not the technology
which is only the medium for the transfer of information.

Hmmmm....that will get some responses.

IE6 doesn't use DOCTYPE when it's HTML4 Transitional or Frameset
besides, MS IE tema doesn't claim to support XHTML

And in my opinion, layouting engine without possibility to center blocks
vertically is terribly broken.

But you still can have 10000 RPM or 7200 RPM hard disk.
I have 3500 RPM HDD, as it's quite common in many laptops.
