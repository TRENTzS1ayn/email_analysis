ok.

There is such a thing as "expected behavior" for rendering of HTML4.
It's mostly based on Netscape 4.x rendering and MS IE rendering.

But it's part of Konqueror, MS IE, Mozilla/Netscape6, Opera.
Yes, as we already learned, Lynx doesn't have CSS support.
And I can add to this that wget doesn't have CSS as well. :-)

Deafault way is based on default CSs stylesheet, that's my point.
To proove it, I sent default CSS stylesheet from Konq. You can also find 
Opera and Mozilla stylesheets in their respective folders on your hard disk.
MS IE has "hidden" default CSS stylesheet, and this indeed caused some 
problems for implementors of open-source browsers to emultae MS IE behavior.
But so far I can tell you that Konqueror mostly overcome even this limit.
 
Do you have something to proove your statement?

I have MS IE6 in Windows, and there is no SVG plugin bundled with IE6.
(I installed in separately, though)
Mozilla doesn't have Adobe SVG plugin bundled, and it just can't be bundled 
with Mozilla, as Adobe plugin doesn't have open-source license, and there are 
no sources available for this plugin.

You are taking wrong assumptions here.

|     Indeed - and what I said above.

I mean: it's up to browser not to render broken content.
The fact that MS IE and Netscape render broken content doesn't say anything 
good in their favour.
