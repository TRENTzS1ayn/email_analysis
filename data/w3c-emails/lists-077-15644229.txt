Harry,

If you refer to changing DOCTYPE or layouting blocks vertically in CSS 
(quoting my mail) - it is not related to end-user.
Changing DOCTYPE should be done either by web master when he creates web 
page, or by Authoring Tools (software)

As about layouting blocks in CSS vertically: it was question to W3C CSS 
Editors, and W3C CSS Working Group (WG), with cc: to www-style mailing list 
(<www-style@w3.org>)
Both Web Developers and Developers of Web Browsers are very curious how to 
overcome this shortcoming, but so far there is no solution for this.
CSS3 specification also doesn't offer answer to this question.
 
As Tina stated that she understands browser design internals, I think we both 
understand what we are speaking about :-)

|   |     Centering a block element vertically - especially on a continuous
|   media
|   |     type - doesn't make an awful lot of sense, IMnsHO.
|
|   And in my opinion, layouting engine without possibility to center blocks
|   vertically is terribly broken.
