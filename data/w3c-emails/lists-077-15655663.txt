IE for PocketPC / Windows CE is, in fact, MS IE 4.0.
There were rumors that MS will update it [Pocket IE] to MS IE 5.0, but AFAIK 
this hsan't happened yet.
Anyway, as Win CE PDA's do not have Ethernet or Radio-Ethernet connectivity 
built-in, I doubt they can be counted as a Platform.

And I can add to Jim's list another 1.5 platforms.
1) WebTV - which is also based on MS technologies
2) AOL browser. AOL (still) uses MS IE codebase (some kind of OEM version of 
MS IE), but some web marketers treat it as a separate browser.
So my opinion is that AOL browser should account for 0.5 of "platform" :-)
