  Indeed there is - but what that expected behaviour is depends on who
  you are, what you have used in the past, and a whole range of other
  issues - including your physical and/or mental disabilities or
  difficulties.

  It is also part of Amaya, Galeon, and a range of other browsers. Even
  Lynx has support for what they call 'Lynx Style Sheets', and one can
  hope these will become compatible with CSS soon.

  Nor does telnet, but you can still get at the content if it is properly
  packaged.

  I'm sorry ... which statement ?

  My choice of words were unfortunate - Adobe has an SVG plugin that works
  with IE 6; strike 'bundled'.

  I'm - again - sorry, but I don't understand you. I never claimed that
  Mozilla came with, or could come with, Adobe's SVG plugin. There is,
  however, A SVG plugin available FOR Mozilla. See also

    http://www.mozilla.org/projects/svg/

  for more information.

  A 'minimum requirements' browser should allow access to the content; and
  not break it. That remains my opinion.
