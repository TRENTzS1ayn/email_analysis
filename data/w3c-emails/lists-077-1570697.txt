This section includes resources dealing with US legal issues and 
disabilities. It is divided into sections and these resources may appear in 
more than one place. The information will include papers, case law, and 
various US laws that cover people with disabilities. The Center intends to 
create a section for each country that has laws dealing with disabilities. 
If you know of such laws or resources on the Internet that deal with this 
subject, please contact us, at: icdri@icdri.org.
