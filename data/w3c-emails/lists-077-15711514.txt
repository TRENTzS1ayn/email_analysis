v2.83 (win32)downloaded s days ago allways connects on startup to
lynx.browser.org it then allows you to connect to other sites.
However....as I found out when I connected to my university site which
allows net access to our intranet and other university sites in WA but
without opening the gateway and paying for access blocks sites ouside PARMET
it attempts to connect to lynx.browser.org and then reports cannot connect
then closes.
With the gateway paid for it works.

Your old version may not do this but this does. If you dont believe me
download it yourself and try.

well since we are also talking about many places in the world where they
are using discarded and free hand me down computers, it would mean
"FREE" as in not one plug nickle cost to the end user.

define "Major"  micro$haft defines it as WinXP and nothing else.

you must be loaded in money, have you priced a some screen readers
lately??

far too new and "advanced" to be considered a baseline for a "WORLD" wide
web.   visually impaired folks in the Sudan, or wherever also need access

unfortunately AOL is the largest internet service (sort of) provider

it must be included

????? huh???  I use Lynx in all sorts of places and it is never even
connected unless I tell it to, and have used it on dial up lap top
connections.

some (many) people will accept the advertising to get access, as long as
it renders properly or does not crash the screen reader (yahoo has pulled
off accessible advertising, darn it)

not sure what you mean here, self install as in "it's loaded in a OS
bundle" or if it is in an RPM and you execute it, or it has to be unzipped
and then manually installed

true

I don't think a lot of people on these committees realize what many folks
with disabilities are actually operating with, even in this
country.  we're talking folks who may live on the less than $500 a month
from SSDI and paying the rent, phone and food bills consume most of it.

and in other countries as little as $5 a month.

BUT even on these budgets some internet access is still possible, but it
sure isn't a pentium anything.  I know folks who are trying to get enough
memory to install windows 3.1 but are on the internet and it is their only
source of outside information,  we cannot disenfrancise these folks and
then call it "access"

The whole world cannot upgrade twice a year!

  one of the advantages of Lynx is that it will run on dang near anything!

I recently logged on with lynx from an old Victor 9000, with an 8086, dial
up modem, and DOS 3.1 and it worked, the internet software was COMit, and
it was a UNIX link to the web.    the result was nothing fancy but it did
get information from sites that are considered accessible.  slow, yup it
was a 1200 baud modem, you sure don't want graffics at 1200 baud!!!

 now I am not saying this should be a minimum standard but I am saying
that there is a lot to be said for the versatility of lynx!
