|     I must ask - how would you like a browser to center content vertically
|     on a continuous media type ?

<html>
<style type="text/css">
 #a { width: 500px; height: 500px; border: 1px solid lime }
 /* now I want to center DIV 'b' both horizontally and vertically, but can
    do only horizontal centering  */ 
 #b { font-size: 14pt; fornt-weight: bold; color: navy;
        margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;
        width: 150px; height: 80px; border: 4px solid navy  }
</style>
<body>
<div id="a">
  <div id="b">center me</div>
</div>
</body>
</html>

I apologize in advance that I do not make this example accessible to blind 
people - to my best knowledge, problem is really specific to Visual media.

Compaq Presario 1800. and, as I said, 3500 rpm.

BTW: I forgot to ask. What version of Linux you are running?
Have you compiled Mozilla with -O3 and what exact parameters you have in 
'hdparm' settings?
you can check wether hdparm is installed using
# locate hdparm
note: I needed Root (superuser) access to get it, as it's located here at:
/sbin/hdparm

you can check speed of your disk using following command:
[root@localhost root]# hdparm -tT /dev/hda

/dev/hda:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  0.99 seconds =129.29 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  8.44 seconds =  7.58 MB/sec
