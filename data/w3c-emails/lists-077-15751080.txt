as this is 3rd or 4th message saying "let's take old computers and donate 
them to the 3rd world", I guess I need to express my opinion.

I was working around 5 years for leading distributor of computer & office 
equipment, and can tell you that *cost of the unit* is sometimes nothing 
comparing  to transportation costs.
For example, simple inkjet printer costs, say, $50 FOB Netherlands. When I 
deliver it to Russia (and it's also valid for many other Eastern-European 
countries), I need to add transportation cost. And it will be ... around $20 
per unit! So, cost will be already $80. Add taxes, and unit is already close 
to $100!
 This is also very visible with monitors. Their boxes are much bigger than 
for ink jet printer, so you need to add $25-$30 per unit for transportation 
only.
Now imaging that you add another $10-15 for shipping this printer from South 
Korea or Taiwan to Netherland - and you will get an idea what %% 
tranportation cost accounts for.
Same is valid for used (old) computers. Transportation always costs money, 
you can't get it for free unless you use own car.

Anyway, here is my solution.
All computers (system block) should be small, really small - with a size of 
typical book or a little bit bigger. Anc cheap, damn ceap! I see no reason 
why such packaged unit, with no expansion slots (but USB available) should 
cost more than $200. And, in fact, VIA (Taiwan) is very close to produce such 
unit.
Key factors to be successfull with price reduction:
* own (or 3rd party but cheap) processor
* graphics adapter integrated on chipset (VIA already has it)
* common memory (available already for several years)
* memory - is already very cheap
All this packaged on one small motherboard gives both very attractive 
form-factor and low price. As transportation cost for it will be quite low, I 
believe it has better chances to be *affordable* on different world markets.

As about software - of course there is no room for $70 MS Windows98 (it's 
price or OEM version, IIRC). Indeed, Windows has to be skipped.
Linux, QNX or FreeBSD can do the job - browser, ftp client, mail client are 
already there, and available for free (only media cost, but it is around $1)

So my understanding of problem [computer for developing countries] is that we 
need to push technologies and vendors forward, and to push them ASAP - using 
out buying power. We will just waste our time trying to re-animate old 
computers.
