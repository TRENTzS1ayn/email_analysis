BRLSPEAK: a Braille and Speech Mini-Distribution of Linux

 Accessibility: 
Too much blind computer users believe that only M$ OSes are accessible for 
them with braille or speech: this is not! There are alternatives, and one of 
it is called GNU/Linux. If you are looking for a free, powerful, 
blindfriendly, stable, open source, network-enabled, multi tasking, multi 
user and commandline-minded OS, then you must absolutely learn more about the 
Linux system, and for example read: 
The Linux Accessibility-HOWTO document, at: 
http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Accessibility-HOWTO/index.html 
 
 Objective: 
BrlSpeak is here to make life easier for blind persons who wish to install a 
Linux distribution on their computer WITHOUT ANY assistance from a sighted 
person. 
The objective is to create and develop a blindfriendly Linux distribution, so 
that it should be possible for a blind user: 
a) To preconfigure the braille driver config-file before running Linux 
b) To compile the braille driver without having to see (/to hear) 
c) To have the braille display immediately operational when booting Linux for 
the first time 

 Technical option: 
To be able to realize this performance, the distribution have been based on 
an UMSDOS Linux version.
 Why? Simply because each braille display runs under MS-DOS, and this 
property can be used to insert a preconfig facility before starting Linux.

Hope this information will be useful for all visually impared users!
