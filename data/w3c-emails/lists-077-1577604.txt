Hmm - I guess I sounded more derogatory of Bobby than I really meant to be.
I think it is a very useful tool, the problem I see is not so much with
Booby but with the way it is mis-used, mis-understood. It seems to me that
the manual checks portion is often ignored, or least not taken seriously,
leading to sites with the Bobby logo that are not really accessible.

Feb 2001 15:11:22 -0500Subject: Re: bobby compliantI have to agree with Kynn
on this one.  Bobby is a useful tool, but toooften mis-used and
mis-understood. Wouldn't it be nice to have a short,clear explanation of why
passing Bobby does not mean a site is accessible?Marti
