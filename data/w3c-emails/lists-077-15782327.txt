  You are quite right there, and - might I add - it is also only specific
  to visual, continuous, media types in which you use CSS to create fixed
  sized blocks. However, can you explain why - since you have a fixed
  box and thereby is in the 'know' of it's size - you cannot 'center' it
  by inserting a

    margin-top: 210px ;

  in the rule-set for #b ? Whilst your problem is clear, there are
  several viable solutions. 

  Do you know whether CSS 3 has including any 'easier' means of
  centering block elements ?

 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  6.57 seconds =  9.74 MB/sec
