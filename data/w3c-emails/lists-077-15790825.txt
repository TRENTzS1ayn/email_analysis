|     You are quite right there, and - might I add - it is also only specific
|     to visual, continuous, media types in which you use CSS to create fixed
|     sized blocks. However, can you explain why - since you have a fixed
|     box and thereby is in the 'know' of it's size - you cannot 'center' it
|     by inserting a
|
|       margin-top: 210px ;
|

some DTP-like programs (Quark XPress, Adobe InDesign, for example) export 
HTML formatted exactly in this way - all blocks are absolutely positioned, 
with exact values for left, top, width and height.
But this is definitly limits document portability.
It would be much better if you could something like this for any block 
element: 
{ vertical-alignment: center } 

I used some px values for DIV just to illustrate problem. You can have much 
more complex examples if you use display: inline-block (which is inline block 
but with possibility to define width and height)
first inline-block can take same 500px in height, while second can be just 
200px in height - and you want to align it vertically...

No, to my best knowledge this issue is (still) not addressed in CSS3.
