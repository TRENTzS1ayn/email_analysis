body is an optional tag (although not an optional element).  The only
outright errors in the code you included are: 

- no DOCTYPE;
- no type attribute on script;
- missing quotes on src attribute of script.

<!DOCTYPE ....>
<title></title><p></p>

is, I believe, a valid HTML 4 strict document, syntactically.

HTML, HEAD and BODY elements can all be inferred from context.  This is
probably not safe with NS4, as it tends to act on tags, rather than
elements.  (I didn't have time to check the full DOCTYPE line.)
