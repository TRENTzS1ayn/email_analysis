> BTW: what are advantages if using text-based browser?

They are much faster to use on information rich sites.

The ability to use them on a site is a good indication as to whether
the site author actually has something to say.  The main problem sites
for Lynx that I actually need to use, other then Microsoft, are e-commerce
sites, where the information content is essentially price and availability -
it is rare to have useful information about the products.
