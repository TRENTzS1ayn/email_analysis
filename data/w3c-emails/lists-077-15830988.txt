Rendering broken content is commercially sound.  It avoids people blaming 
your software for what are really authors' mistakes and it reduces your
support costs.  The evolutionary pressure is to cope with at least as 
broken content as your competitors.

It is also compatible with one of the core internet principles, which is
that you must be correct in what you send (authors should produce correct
HTML) and tolerant in what you accept (browsers should work with broken
HTML).
