At least for PCs, 3 years is a realistic turnover time for computer
technology based companies.  For other organisations, particularly public
service organisations, the turnover time is likely to be much longer.
My GP's system is character cell, not windows.  I would suggest that you
need to support at least 7 year old hardware if you really want universal
access in the developed world.  (Charitable uses are likely to start
with 4 year old machines.)

For Net TV based hardware, I would expect a 15 to 20 year turnover time,
although they haven't been around that long, or course.
