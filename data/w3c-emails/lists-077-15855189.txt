The prices you quoted to me were too high for a UK developer unless they
had a strong accessibility mandate.  The average UK commercial organisation
would not buy at those prices, and would certainly not buy the site licence -
they might consider having one person as an accesibility checker with a 
single user license, but probably not even that.
