Faking User Agents is very common in Lynx because there is a strong 
view that it is discriminated against.  This is in part true, because
browsercap databases don't track minor browsers well and some US financial
organisations want to identify the browser before initiating a secure 
connection.  There is also a tendency to say:

NS 4+:  one version
IE 5+: another version
default: "please upgrade your browser"

Note that this logic fails for NS6!
