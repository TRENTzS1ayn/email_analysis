Why I like Lynx just the way it is.

Why I tell others to use Lynx as is.

Since it doesn't do Javascript, DOM, Flash, and has limited support for frames, 
it will show me the site in the same way as a search engine robot or 
spider 'sees' the site.  Lynx is the best way that I know of to get this 
effect.  As an added bonus, it is easier to check that my alt text makes sense 
in context and that something happens when there is no javascript.

I recently installed the latest lynx on a computer to ensure that my personal 
web site was doing what was expected in text-only mode.

Lynn
