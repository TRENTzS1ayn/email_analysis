  Personally I *strongly* suggest giving NS 4 users a fully separate
  stylesheet[1] with the same elements/classes, but with restricted
  use of properties known to cause problems.

  That helps quite abit ...


 [1]
  NS 4 has a particularly useful bug in the way it handles media types
  which allow for the specificaly of what becomes in effect a NS 4 specific
  CSS file without the use for server- or client-side scripting. Very
  useful.
