What becomes difficult is ensuring that the linearised order and
the sensible reading order is the same.  Determining the actual 
linearised order is still simple; it is necessary to be able to 
do so in order to hand code HTML (and, often, in order to construct
the skeletons for database generated HTML).

Also, the problem generally only becomes serious when tables are used
to construct a layout grid, not when they are used as tables.
