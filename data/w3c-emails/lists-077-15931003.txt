actually it is the exact opposite, maybe I miss-explained because I was
basically saying the same thing as you differently.  The very reason that
folks in these countries have such old computers is the cost of shipping
newer computers there, so it is a cascade effect, one person gets a new
computer and passes the old one down, and down and down so forth til the
disabled group or CIL end up with an old first generation MAC.  mostly
because  it is already there

which is part of how we're getting stuff to these places, when I traveled
to Nicaragua I and my wife put all of our stuff in one suitcase and
carried 3 duffel bags worth of "Stuff" with the rest of our baggage
allotment, unfortunately computers are only a small portion of what has to
be carried, one duffel bag was full of drugs (??taking drugs TO Central
America) mostly antibiotics.

nice, I would probably get one but the third world would only get the hand

no money in the third world, profits are in selling loaded to the gills
hyper overloaded computers to folks in the developed countries to use as
word processors and game boys!
