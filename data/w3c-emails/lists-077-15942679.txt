it has things like Accesskey (I've yet to find out if you can access them
on iPaq or similar "pen" PDA's, do you have some definitive reason for
believing it to be IE4's codebase?

My PC doesn't have any internet connectivity built-in, indeed, I use the
same mobile phone for both PC and PDA access (exclusively palm, I find my
iPaq to slow.)  In any case AvantGo or other "Channel" technology whereby
you download websites through a local connection to a PC and read
disconnected are very popular and still require the content to be
accessible.

WebTV as a brand is indeed based on MS code, internet through your TV as a
concept is certainly not, the UK internet TV access (of which there are
many million of capable boxes - actual usage I don't know, but UK cable
and satellite digital boxes have browsers within them (Risc OS "Fresco"
browser in general I believe.)
