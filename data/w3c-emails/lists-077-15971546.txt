Exactly!
And, by the way, this explains why Netscape6 and Mozilla have so bad 
acceptance  (~0.75% of all browsers, less than 1% - and that 1 year after NS6 
release!)
Mozilla sacrificied document.layers DOM (which was present in NN 4.x series), 
and offered no sound replacement.
And while W3C standards' support in Mozilla is very good, product itself is 
not "commercially sound" (I use your words :-)
  
Just to clarify my position a little bit: I wish success to Mozilla.
But I doubt it can be successfull in its current state.

Hopefully, even MS IE bombs you on broken (not well-formed) XML.
So, the real chance for all of us to come away from "broken content" is to 
accelerate transition to XML (not XHTML, which is *again* intermediary 
solution!) and sacrifice all HTML 4.0, 3.2, etc.
So, I would love to see "XML support" in "Minimal Browser Capabilities", and 
all browsers not supporting XML falling into "non-conforming" category :-))
