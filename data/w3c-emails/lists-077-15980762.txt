I think Peter-Paul Koch wrote to me about this (IE4 in WinCE).
Peter-Paul, do you have more info what kind of browser is built-in in WinCE?
Discussion about "Minimal Browser Capabilities" is happening on WAI-IG 
mailing list (Web Accessibility Initiative Interest Group), and people in 
particular interested in accessibility options in different browsers.
I invite you to participate in this interesting thread ;-)

|   My PC doesn't have any internet connectivity built-in, indeed, I use the
|   same mobile phone for both PC and PDA access (exclusively palm, I find my
|   iPaq to slow.)  In any case AvantGo or other "Channel" technology whereby

|   WebTV as a brand is indeed based on MS code, internet through your TV as
