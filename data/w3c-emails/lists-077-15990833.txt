The fact that IE does not crash is correct behavior.
Browsers should forgive the mistakes of the page writer after all the user
didnt make them and presumably the author did try to convey information..
On the other hand authoring tools should not allow you to make bad code.
A BMW car has an extremely good ABS system to make up for the driver's
braking mistakes,it does not crash if the driver makes a minor mistake, this
does not mean that the driver should drive badly.
If you want browsers to crash on bad input do you also want cars to?  :)))))

Exactly!
And, by the way, this explains why Netscape6 and Mozilla have so bad
acceptance  (~0.75% of all browsers, less than 1% - and that 1 year after
NS6
release!)
Mozilla sacrificied document.layers DOM (which was present in NN 4.x
series),
and offered no sound replacement.
And while W3C standards' support in Mozilla is very good, product itself is
not "commercially sound" (I use your words :-)

Just to clarify my position a little bit: I wish success to Mozilla.
But I doubt it can be successfull in its current state.

Hopefully, even MS IE bombs you on broken (not well-formed) XML.
So, the real chance for all of us to come away from "broken content" is to
accelerate transition to XML (not XHTML, which is *again* intermediary
solution!) and sacrifice all HTML 4.0, 3.2, etc.
So, I would love to see "XML support" in "Minimal Browser Capabilities", and
all browsers not supporting XML falling into "non-conforming" category :-))
