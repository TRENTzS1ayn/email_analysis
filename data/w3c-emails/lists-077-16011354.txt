I've never run an online network.

It is possible that I'll want to run linux, apple,and ms simultaneously 
on three machines, to check and beta test site development.

Have you seen a good and simple HOWTO for setting up a decent 
accessibility workstation such as I propose?

I can currently check about 20 browsers, in a matter of minutes, however 
it involves a reboot, and no apples.

I don't want to get involved in samba, transferring files, etc, rather 
just be able to view pages at the same time. mind you I already seem to 
have enough problems with cache-ing....



thanks
