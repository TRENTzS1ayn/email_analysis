What a nice message! :-)
I really LOVE this list! :-))

(hell-knows-what-inside-it?) to cars (which have engine, wheels, body and a 
lot of other interesting stuff).

Anyway, I hardly believe you can compare MS IE to BMW - MS IE is much more 
close to FIAT or Daewoo, which are good cars, but not luxurious.
And Mozilla reminds me Ford F-series pickup - it does its job but car is 
heavy enermously and fuel consumption can kill almost every budget.

I think you misunderstood me.
I wrote "MS IE bombs you on broken (not well-formed) XML" - there is nothing 
said about crash.
You can check - try to render broken XML in MS IE, it will just display you 
"error processing blah-blah-blah". I attached small example (good+bad XML) 
for your reference.

And, as we started comparision to cars:
Do you know that some cars in Japan *reject* to start engine when driver is 
completely drunk? So, what's bad when good browser rejects to render broken 
content? (replace it with good one, pleeaaase...)
