There is a mail messaging and call center product called eshare.  This has
an HTML interface option for chat.   If the HML were designed properly this
would seem to be accessible.  Need to consider the tools the call centers
are using such as, egain, kana, siebels, clarify.  If they can render HTML
and I think they can, then they should work for chat - as long as the code
is compliant.  The beauty here is the contact information is maintained and
less agent time is required as well as it can provide integrated cross sale
and up sale functionality
