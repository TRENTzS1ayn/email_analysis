Clearly it is always a concern in the use of different versions of content
that the versions are synchronised. But I think it is sufficiently understood
that there are many techniques available for making sure this happens.

  the danger I see in this is that the pdf will be updated and the html
  will not.  The two must some how be linked.  I think though that
  supplying an accessible version of a document is a good idea and has
  merit in the hard copy world.  Many documents that are printed in hard
  copy are marked up for braille before embossing and we would not want
  them in print.

  I think that is a very sensible approach.

    Question:

    If you have an accessible HTML version of a document, do we need to
  make the
    PDF version of the document accessible too?  What if the PDF version
  is only
    made available for printing purposes (and marked as such)?

    In that case, I'd concentrate on making the HTML accessible and forget
  about
    the PDF.

    What does everyone else think?
