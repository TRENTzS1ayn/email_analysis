Marti,

There  is:

Bobby is only one step in the process of making a site accessible to as many
people as possible. Since there are some important aspects of accessible Web
page design that can not yet be tested by Bobby, CAST recommends that Web
developers use Bobby only as a first step to ensure accessible Web page
design. Please review the How-to section and the Bobby Documentation for
more information.

I have to agree with Kynn on this one.  Bobby is a useful tool, but too
often mis-used and mis-understood. Wouldn't it be nice to have a short,
clear explanation of why passing Bobby does not mean a site is accessible?
