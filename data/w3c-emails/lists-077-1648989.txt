Absolutely,

The Bobby icon represents an achieveable standard and a tangible, cost
effective reward for efforts made towards web accessibility by people
working in government or similarly placed organisations. It may be difficult
to displace the presumption in their minds that attaining the well renouned
Bobby Approved Icon means sufficient accessibility has been achieved. In the
absence of a complaint, CAST does not actively regulate the use of the Icon
and there seems to be abuse in some instances. It strikes  me that it could
be difficult to create such an achieveable and accepted stamp of
accessibility especially when many issues as to priority 2 (and 3)
compliance are still to be universally ironed out.

Regards
Frank

Hi Kynn,

Quote
The problem we face is that "Bobby Compliant" may become more
important than "accessible."  (Note that I think there is also a
danger with "WCAG Compliant" in the same way, but at the moment that
risk is smaller than the Bobby problem.)

In other words, people get confused and they think that what they are
trying to do is get a Bobby logo for their front page, when really
what they -should- do is try to make their web pages more accessible.

Pleasantly surprised to note we are singing from the same hymn sheet on
this, ( did I really use that expression? sorry) Ten-20 recently lost out on
a lucrative contract/web build because I stupidly mentioned in the tender
that a Bobby compliant logo was not a vital requirement and did not always
signify accessibility anyway. The contract went to poptel whose own website
is totally inaccessible. Hypocrisy rules it appears. I am totally convinced
that well meaning people in large charities and Government circles are too
convinced of the infallibility of Bobby.
