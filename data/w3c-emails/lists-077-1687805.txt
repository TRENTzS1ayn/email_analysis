No, that's not correct.  It's better to say "failing Bobby _is_ a
fair test for inaccessibility!"

If your web site can't pass Bobby, then I am pretty sure it would
meet _no one's_ standard of accessibility.  If your site _can_ pass
Bobby, then it may or may not be broadly accessible.

It's good as an indicator of problems, but bad as a guarantor of
"no problems."
