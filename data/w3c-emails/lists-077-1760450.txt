It really comes down to two simple facts.
1. Do you have an quality assurance and testing process in place?  The
question in most web groups is NO.
2. Do you have an effective training program?

But everywhere I have been, this is one of the first things I institute.

I don't think anyone has claimed CAST is doing anything wrong.  But
the problem still remains that Bobby is being misapplied and the
instructions for use ignored, which has a net effect of making the
web less accessible due to over-dependence upon Bobby as the sole
metric used by many for measuring accessibility.
