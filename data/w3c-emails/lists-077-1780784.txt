I think we are scratching the surface here and that is why I feel that
it is important to use a broad a brush to paint with as possible.  use
title for those that can pick it up and make sure it can still
bepicked up by the rest of the 9 10ths that cannot.

This sounds to me like a user agent problem, not a markup problem.
The markup is done properly, but the assistive technology fails
on it; whose responsibility is it to correct this problem?

In my opinion, it's on the shoulders of the JFW people -- but if
someone is specifically designing an interface for JFW (such as
an edaptive system that recognizes JAWS), the optimal code for that
user agent should be delivered.

Sure it is -- the user agent is not respecting the spec, and neither
is your humble opinion, so why should we listen to either?  Title is
meant to be used, potentially, EVERYWHERE, and a user agent which
breaks on such a circumstance is a faulty user agent.

The question then becomes whether or not you should compensate for
that problem in the user agent (in my model with an edaptive
interface, I would say yes), but you surely should not condone this
type of faulty behavior by suggesting that _only_ links can have
titles, because JFW got it wrong.
