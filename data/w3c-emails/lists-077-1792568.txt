I agree that this particular problem is a bug with JAWS.
As you know, I am a big fan of spec-compliant coding and UA.
As far as browsers go, we've got maybe IE on the Mac and Netscape/Mozzilla 6
that come close to rendering HTML 4 tolerably well.  What behavior would be
reasonable for a browser for code like:

<a href="foo.html" title="Big World of Foo."><img src="foo.png"
alt="Come to Foo!"></a>

The current state of the art is, I would argue, fairly reasonable and
predictable.  With a screen reader, the link title and graphic alt are read
in sequence.  It is actually clear which belongs to which.  Screen reader or
not, I can preview the link title before activating the link.  Graphically,
a mouse-over pop-up has a choice of two content pieces and, quite
reasonably, the title of the link takes precedence (and this additional
information is rendered rather subtly).  Oh yeah, I also have the image or
the associated alt -- depending if graphics are loaded or not.  Okay then,
with screen reader or not, my browser has unobtrusively presented me with
(1) a graphic or ALT content, (2) URL and associated (title) text.  Life is
good.

Now, suppose I want to be on the bleeding edge.  Or maybe I am confused
about what makes good ALT content -- and I am trying to make everybody
happy.  I mistakenly figure that more is more, so I code something like:

<a href="foo.html" title="Big World of Foo."><img src="foo.png"
title="Foo Globe Icon" alt="Come to Foo!"></a>

Sure, this is perfectly logical and valid.  But face it, this gives me THREE
textual associations for the graphic.  As the author, there is no way I
could guess what the user is going to get!  I cannot come up with a scenario
that would reveal all three (or even two out of three) in any natural way
(with out requiring extra keystrokes on the part of the user, or some other
artifice) for a graphical user agent.  Can you?

Please Kynn, if you think titles should be included everywhere, please
explain how they might be revealed in the graphical user interface!  It gets
even more complicated, since the above example could be inside a P or DIV
with its own title!  Yeech!

TITLE is largely superfluous, except on links and ABBR and ACRONYM.  Until
user agents figure out how to handle the attribute, it should be avoided.
This IS a practical, real world, accessibility issue.

Kynn, depending on the weather, you are frequently in favor of backwards
compliant coding and even minor code tweaks to make up for idiosyncratic
behavior of Assistive Technology.  I would argue that this belongs in that
category.  Unless you are certain of the resultant browser behavior, avoid
TITLE.

-- Bruce

P.S.  One _could_ make the argument that the behavior of JAWS is NOT broken:
TITLE is a newer attribute than ALT and therefore an author is more likely
to put more thought into TITLE (if present) than ALT (especially since we
know how bad ALT tends to be).  Besides, IE visually renders TITLE in
deference to ALT -- so that is the one people pay more attention to.
Therefore, if both are present, TITLE must be the more important one -- so
that's the one that should get read by the screen reader.
