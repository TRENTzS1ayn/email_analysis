Are there actually any practical (e.g. acessibility) reasons for using
<abbr> instead of <acronym>? As long as people can understand what the
phrase has been shortened from, they can probably work out for themselves
if it is an abbreviation or an acronym. Maybe using <span> would be better.

Am I joking, or what? Well, XHTML has a certain amount of semantics
attached to the elements... although a lot have been transfered over to
CSS. However, I think it is useful if some of the semantics were to remain
with the elements. Note that I am using the term "semantics" to include all
meaning: presentational as well.

Anyway, I don't think this is one of the most important XHTML topics, only
a very small part of one of the more larger debates (that of presentation
vs. content, which I'm not going to argue right now).
