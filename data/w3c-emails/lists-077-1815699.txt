Sure, IE "explains" ABBR (via mouse-over pop-up) but does nothing for
ACRONYM.  Like everyone else, this is helpful for people with learning
disabilities.  I choose between ABBR and ACRONYM based on a faint irrational
hope that the next generation of screen readers will make some distinction
(spell-out vs. pronounce-as-word) between the two.

As unlikely as the screen reader vendors are to be on recognizing a
difference between ABBR and and ACRONYM, I think widespread support (by
vendors, let alone authors) of speech-oriented CSS is even less likely.

Agreed.
