Your last sentence should read:

"...if it is an abbreviated form or an initialism."

Because the <abbr> tag is for "abbreviated forms" (of all sorts), and
the <acronym> tag is for "initialisms."

There may be an argument which says that all initialisms should be
marked with the appropriate tag for initialisms (<acronym>), but in
all honesty I think that's stretching it, and the HTML spec itself
gives examples where <abbr> is used for initialisms, and thus it
cannot be considered -incorrect- usage.

Frankly, it all boils down to "the HTML 4.01 (and XHTML 1.0) spec
is broken", so just use <abbr> anyway.
