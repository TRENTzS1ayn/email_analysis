The difference is clear in ENGLISH, as well, but the HTML 4.01
specification does not use either the English definition or the
Spanish definition.  It make up its own definition, which are:

1.  ABBR - any abbreviated form of a word or words
2.  ACRONYM - any initialism (a subset of "abbreviated forms")

That is the HTML 4.01 definition and natural language definitions
are irrelevant.
