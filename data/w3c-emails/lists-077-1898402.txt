Hi all,

Yes, WWW and SNCF are initialisms, and from the point of view of HTML 4.01
and of the natural language they are acronyms, and non abbreviations, but in
the example they appear marked as abbreviations.

Maybe the definitions of the natural language are irrelevant in front of the
definitions in HTML 4.01, but I suppose that the authors created the two
elements with the intention that they completed different functions and I
suppose that will have been based in the existent difference in the natural
language.

If the authors sought that the abbreviations included to the acronym, for
what reason to create two different elements?

They're initialisms.

The difference is clear in ENGLISH, as well, but the HTML 4.01
specification does not use either the English definition or the
Spanish definition.  It make up its own definition, which are:

1.  ABBR - any abbreviated form of a word or words
2.  ACRONYM - any initialism (a subset of "abbreviated forms")

That is the HTML 4.01 definition and natural language definitions
are irrelevant.
