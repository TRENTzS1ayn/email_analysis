I'm not sure if the HTML/XHTML working group is willing to do that,
though.  As a party without control over the W3C spec, we have
two choices:  interpret, or ignore.

I guess we can petition, while still doing one of those two.

I'm not sure about that.  What exactly do you call "CIO" or "HTML"?
Do you say "See Eye Oh" or do you say "Sigh-Oh"?  Do you say "hutmul"
or do you say "Aitch Tee Em Ell"?  Or are CIO and HTML neither
abbreviations nor acronyms?

Pronunciation, as identified in the HTML 4.01 spec, is an issue for
stylesheets.  "WAI" may be "dubya ay eye" to some people and "way"
to others and "why" to yet more folks.  SQL and URL are examples of
ambiguity cited in the HTML 4.01 spec.

Exactly:  As defined by the HTML 4.01 spec, the ACRONYM element is of
no use.
