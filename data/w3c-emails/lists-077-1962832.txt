Margita Lundman is the Program head of the IT program for the Swedish
Handicap Insitute. She is also the current moderator of the eEurope mailing
list, in line with the policy of having a moderator from the country holding
the European Union (EU) presidency (I think that is the office - it is a
rotating duty spread around EU members).

So I think that she is probably a reliable source for the policies of the
Swedish Handicap Insitute.

Further information about them can be found at http://www.hi.se or if you
prefer english and don't want to wade through a page of swedish to find the
link to "English Materials" you could go direct to

  Cynthia, do you know:

  1.  What concept of enforcement do they have?
  2.  Do they have legislative backing?
  3.  Are they adopting the WAI guidelines as policy?

  Cheers, rob

  Hello,
  Since 1997 the Swedish Handicap Institute, SHI, has
  published recommended guidelines for accessibility
  of the web in the Swedish Society. SHI has now adopted
  the WAI guidelines (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0)
  in order to promote an accessible web in a manner which fully
  complies with international standards, and with the eEurope Action
  Plan. This was announced in a Press Release of January 26, 2001.
  Best regards,
  Margita Lundman

  Hi Kynn,

  Quote
  The problem we face is that "Bobby Compliant" may become more
  important than "accessible."  (Note that I think there is also a
  danger with "WCAG Compliant" in the same way, but at the moment that
  risk is smaller than the Bobby problem.)

  In other words, people get confused and they think that what they are
  trying to do is get a Bobby logo for their front page, when really
  what they -should- do is try to make their web pages more accessible.

  Pleasantly surprised to note we are singing from the same hymn sheet on
  this, ( did I really use that expression? sorry) Ten-20 recently lost out on
  a lucrative contract/web build because I stupidly mentioned in the tender
  that a Bobby compliant logo was not a vital requirement and did not always
  signify accessibility anyway. The contract went to poptel whose own website
  is totally inaccessible. Hypocrisy rules it appears. I am totally convinced
  that well meaning people in large charities and Government circles are too
  convinced of the infallibility of Bobby.
