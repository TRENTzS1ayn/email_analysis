Hi all,

The difference between an abbreviation and an acr?nimo doesn't rest in that
this last one is pronounced like a word. The difference rests in that is of
the contraction of a name or of a word or words.

Abbreviation = contraction by word of mouth or words. Example: " Mr." is
pronounced "Mister", that is to say, like a word. The abbreviations are
pronounced as the word or words that abbreviate.
Acronym = contraction of a name: F.B.I. is pronounced each one of the
initials. "Radar", is pronounced like a word.

And IE5 expand <acronym> and not <abbr> like it has been said repeteadly
here. I believe that the reason that he makes it it is exactly because the
abbreviations in a language are usually picked up in the dictionaries and
they are more or less of use common, on the other hand, the acronym is born
day by day, some are very well-known as "N.A.T.O." but like it is names of
things, they arise new day by day.

I believe that it would be important that in the documents that somebody
explains the use of the elements <ABBR> and <ACRONYM> it is explained well
and for it maybe is necessary that who edit them they have the advice of a
linguist.

Regards,
Emmanuelle

I am on shaky ground here. I believe what Charles has said is correct, but I
am also inclined to go and look at the greatest source I know on what the
English language means to the people who use it.

Some more comments inline...

  I'm not sure about that.  What exactly do you call "CIO" or "HTML"?
  Do you say "See Eye Oh" or do you say "Sigh-Oh"?  Do you say "hutmul"
  or do you say "Aitch Tee Em Ell"?  Or are CIO and HTML neither
  abbreviations nor acronyms?
CMN
They are definitely abbreviations. As I understand it, since they are not
pronounced as words they are not acronyms.
KB
  Pronunciation, as identified in the HTML 4.01 spec, is an issue for
  stylesheets.  "WAI" may be "dubya ay eye" to some people and "way"
  to others and "why" to yet more folks.  SQL and URL are examples of
  ambiguity cited in the HTML 4.01 spec.
CMN
WAI may also be double-you ay eye, as it is to me. And there are examples of
ambiguity. So it seems to me that what Charles is arguing is that it is
helpful to mark up abbreviations, especially including an expansion for them
(ABC is a classic - often used, and has plenty of meanings...). For the
class
of things which are abbreviations that are names formed from the beginnings
of words (that's what the greek words that acronym comes from imply) it is
helpful to mark them as such. Providing further information about exactly
how
to pronounce them (which of course varies between languages, even languages
as close as american and australian english) is probably best left to
languages that are suited for presentation - CSS might or mioght not have
the
power, or it might be better to use SSML - Speech Synthesis Markup Language,
currently under development by the W3C Voice Browser working group, and just
finished last call.

  Exactly:  As defined by the HTML 4.01 spec, the ACRONYM element is of
  no use.

As I have argued above, the specification may be deficient, but the element
is potentially very useful.
