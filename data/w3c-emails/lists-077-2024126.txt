This was an outrageously succesful twenty minutes for our group of adults
with moderate to severe learning difficulties. The most enjoyable activity
we've had on the computer in a long while.
Everyone navigated themselves there, from the 'pussycat' icon on their
desktop, and remembered from last weeks demo, what to do, and did it
unaided, apart from one student in a wheelchair with very limited hand
movements, who gave guidance to his aid.

Our only dissapointment was not being able to print off the various designs.

another game
provides a print button, when you've finished.

Is there a generic means to print these shockwave images, print screen
misses the point. ie5.5 or worse, in win98. or perhaps another browser?

any ideas please?

tx again
