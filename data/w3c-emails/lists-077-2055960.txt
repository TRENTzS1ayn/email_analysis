Jonathan,

You should be able to print from the File menu in the browser.
I tried these in Netscape and the print preview looked fine.

If that doesn't work for you, then a screen capture will.  Download
WinGrab 1.22a or other free screen capture software.  It's easy
to use, and you can print from there.  Email me directly if you'd
like some assistance.
