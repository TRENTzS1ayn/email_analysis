I have put up a public website/online demo for a new Site Valet product,
which I hope to commercialise.  It is designed to help companies enforce
standards in Websites and Intranets, including most importantly (though
not limited to) standards for accessibility.

I'd like to solicit comments/review from WAI members and supporters on
this product: do you consider it useful, and what further developments
would you wish to see?  I know there's (always) a lot of work to be done,
and your feedback at this stage should help prioritise the various tasks!
