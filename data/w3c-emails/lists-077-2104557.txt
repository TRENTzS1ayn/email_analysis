Can you make a Javascript "Pop-up Window" accessible to screen readers (for 
those visually impaired) by including the "noscript" tag containing the text 
of the window?  A co-worker saw this on the WC3 site and says that it will 
allow  a screen reader to access the content.  However, will it still be 
confusing for the visually imaired as indicated in the cnet artile?

Should the use of pop-up windows be avoided all together?
