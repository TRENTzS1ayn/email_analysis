Yes, I imagine this would work.

Probably. The difficulty is that the new pop-ups grab the focus without 
warning, so the user ends up on a screen that s/he didn't expect, & 
inexperienced users might not know how to navigate around or out of the new 
window.

I have also run into the opposite problem, where I hear advertising 
material start, so I hit ALT+F4, thinking, "Ha! Got you, my pretty little 
pop-up!" But then it turns out it wasn't a separate window, & I have 
actually closed the browser completely, so I have to start all over again.

Usually, however, it's just harder to keep track of what's what as more & 
more windows get opened on the screen.

The other difficulty is that the usual pop-up scenarios violate the WCAG 
checkpoints on offering maximum user control. If they tell you in advance 
that a separate window will open (as they occasionally do), this aspect is 
taken care of.

I wouldn't shed any tears ...
