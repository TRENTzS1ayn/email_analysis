Hi,

It is natural that people feel confused regarding the correct use of <ABBR>
and of <ACRONYM> since the examples used to explain to it contain errors,
for example in:
http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/struct/text.html#edef-ABBR

<ABBR title = World Wide Web">WWW </ABBR>
  <ABBR lang = " fr "
        title = Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Nationale gives Chemins of Fer">
     SNCF
  </ABBR>
  <ABBR lang = it is title = Do&ntilde;a">Do&ntilde;a </ABBR>
  <ABBR title = Abbreviation">abbr.</ABBR>

Both first (WWW and SNCF) they are acronyms and "Do&ntilde;a" it is a word
in Spanish, it is not neither an abbreviation neither an acronym,, if they
want to give an example in Spanish of abbreviation they can use: "Ud.",
abbreviation of "Usted" (third person of the singular) or "Sra." that it is
the abbreviation of "Se&ntilde;ora" ("Mrs." in English)

In many documents of the World Wide Web Consortium is marked "W3C" as
abbreviation and it is not it, it is an acronym, at least in Spanish it is
an acronym.

I don't dominate English, like it is evident, but I can assure that in
Spanish the difference between an abbreviation and an acronym is clear and
its functions and senses are not interchangeable for what is important that
these two elements stay.
