I'm afraid this comes from anecdotal evidence. People who visit a lot
of sites that are either hosted on free servers which use pop-up
adverts or else a lot of illegal software ("warez") sites, which
often have the same, but are prepared to host pornographic adverts
(presumably they pay better), say this to me.

Advertisements are certainly the association in my mind from looking
at geocities sites. Users who prefer amateur sites (fan sites,
minority interests, amateur computer sites, small non-profits) would
presumably be more likely to make this connection than mainly
corporate users.

A proper study in emotional response to pop ups (and many other web
techniques) would be useful, and no doubt exists somewhere.
