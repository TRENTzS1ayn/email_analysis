Here in the UK the frustration with pop-ups among the general population
seems to be that you cannot use the back button on your browser to return to
the previous site, although this is the most-otfen used function of a
browser.  Companies often use pop-ups to link to other sites, reasoning that
this makes it easier for consumers to return to their own site when they've
finished browsing, but we recommend our clients against doing this.  Not
that it always works...

But speaking as a UK user, I don't associate pop-ups with advertising or
porn at all - that may be just a US thing.

Check out http://www.useit.com/alertbox for Jakob Nielsen's take on this and
other issues.  He is right about a lot of things, although he sometimes
takes a somewhat extremist view.
