Can anyone explain to me how screen readers handle images?  I was under the
impression that if an image doesn't have an alt tag, the screen reader would
read a file name or something similar.  Is this correct, or does the screen
reader simply skip the image as if it were not there.

Thanks,
Jeff Isom
