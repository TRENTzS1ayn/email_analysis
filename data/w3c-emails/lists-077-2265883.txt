Does Amaya treat it as a link without an area (linking the whole
image), or as no link, or worse?

The definition of the <a> element for IE5[1] doesn't list coords or
shape as attributes. Since IE4+ is the most commonly used graphical
browser their absence on the msdn site would suggest that the <a>
element can't be used in this way by this browser.
