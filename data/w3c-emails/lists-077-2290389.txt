*What's Your POV?

What Should Sites Do for People with Disabilities?

In Internet World magazine's Feb. 1 Policy Watch column,
Doug Isenberg writes about new federal laws that require
government agencies to redesign their Web sites to
accommodate people with disabilities. Though no one has
argued that the Americans with Disabilities Act should apply 
to all Web sites, Isenberg thinks most sites could benefit 
from such changes, which might indirectly help users who log 
on with slow connections or while on the road. 

What do you think of Isenberg's opinions regarding this
legislation and his advice for Web sites? Has your site 
taken steps to accommodate people with disabilities? To 
read this column, go to http://www.internetworld.com/POV/,
and then let us know what you think. (Responses will be
considered for publication in our newsletter and magazine
and may be edited for length and clarity.) 

Use the subject "Disabilities" and write to
