Hi Jimmie,

I'm glad those example were useful for you.

I don't understand though why they make you think that you shouldn't use 
nested tables.

Also, I hope people don't think I was saying to avoid tables altogether... 
just that you need to be aware of reading order when you use them.

At least, that's what you need to get to double A compliance.  To reach 
triple A compliance, you need to either avoid layout tables altogether, or 
have a linearized alternative, e.g. on a separate page,  per Guideline 10.3.
