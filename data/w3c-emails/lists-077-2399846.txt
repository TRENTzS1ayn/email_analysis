Here is a very interesting article on using Flash with XML, referred to me 
by someone nice.

www.flashkit.com/tutorials/3rd_Party/Flash_5_-Chris_Sm-213/index.shtml

I assume by this method one could provide a Flash interface or use SVG 
tools, as well as create text or basic html via XSLT as well. Or PDF via FO. 
All with the same set of content. Isn't that kind of the point of all the 
furor over the possibilities of XML?
