iCab, available only for Macintosh, also offers this. You can validate with
the W3C validator or via BBEdit (a Macintosh authoring tool that validates).
For HTML there is also auto-validation built in, via a small smiley/frown
icon.

The browser is available from http://www.icab.de and claims to be the first
browser that fully supports HTML 4.0. It is the only graphics browser I have
used that shows up accesskeys, abbreviations and acronyms, and a few other
features by default. It does HTML, Java/Javascript, but doesn't support CSS
in the current version. That is apparently on their to-do list.

Other tools also have validation - HomeSite, an authoring tool from Allaire,
Amaya, a browser/authoring tool from W3C, asWedit, an authoring tool from
alvasoft (not the same people as alva, who make screenreader and braille
technology) are some of them. And there are a couple of other validators on
the web, too.
