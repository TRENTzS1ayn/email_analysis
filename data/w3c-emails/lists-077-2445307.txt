Using this technique properly in HTML 4.01 will propvide for a text-based set
of alternative links, as well as image map links.. HTML 4.01 was altered from
HTML 4.0 to make it legal to provide both area elements and a elements as
content for the map (something which in pratice worked already).

I don't know how many or what browsers implement the attributes shape and
coords on the a element. It works on the iCab browser for Macintosh, and a
test is available from their website - http://www.icab.de/test.html - as part
of the tests they offer. (They are using object, and hide the map as part of
object content).

  Does Amaya treat it as a link without an area (linking the whole
  image), or as no link, or worse?

  The definition of the <a> element for IE5[1] doesn't list coords or
  shape as attributes. Since IE4+ is the most commonly used graphical
  browser their absence on the msdn site would suggest that the <a>
  element can't be used in this way by this browser.
