We are seeing a growth of "fusion" services - Web sites in which the content
comes from a variety of sources (e.g My.Netscape).

Has any work been done on the accessibility of fusion services.  If
individual fragments are accessible, with the fusion site be accessibility,
or could different approaches to ensuring the fragments are accessible
result in the final site being inaccessible.

Some areas to consider:

  o Mixture of formattiing ion HTML and CSS
  o Different apporaoches to use of CSS
  o Tab orders
  o Use of ABBREV and ACRONYM
  o Colour schemes
  o Different approaches to use of ALT and TITLE atrtributes
    etc.

Thanks

Brian
