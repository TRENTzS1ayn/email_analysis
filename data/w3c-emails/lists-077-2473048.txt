This question as been discussed in the WCAG group over the course of perhaps
two years. My personal thoughts are that there are two basic requirements -
that each component is accessible, and that the means of choosing between
them is accessible.

I realise that I have not said to whom - my approach would be to assess each
component against WCAG and claim a conformance level for each one, and then
the site would qualify overall at whatever the lowest level it made was (or
not if some component failed to meet any level). It is also possible to say
that "these things meet one level, and those meet another".

Cheers

  We are seeing a growth of "fusion" services - Web sites in which the content
  comes from a variety of sources (e.g My.Netscape).

  Has any work been done on the accessibility of fusion services.  If
  individual fragments are accessible, with the fusion site be accessibility,
  or could different approaches to ensuring the fragments are accessible
  result in the final site being inaccessible.

  Some areas to consider:

    o Mixture of formattiing ion HTML and CSS
    o Different apporaoches to use of CSS
    o Tab orders
    o Use of ABBREV and ACRONYM
    o Colour schemes
    o Different approaches to use of ALT and TITLE atrtributes
      etc.

  Thanks
