AG::

There are vague statements in WCAG 1.0 about providing clear and consistent
orientation and navigation, and using consistent styling.? These are topics
that are "less than half solved" by these statements, and are areas where
sites
that do content aggregation from disparate sources are likely to perform badly
without a lot of work in these areas.

One positive sign here is that commercial aggregators, at least, are
looking to
use XML data formats at the OEM service tier and only inject presentation at
the webserver where this will all be controlled by the retail/portal site.

It takes a more subtle blending theory than CSS provides to deal gracefully
with a mix of ideas from the source domains of components together whith
additional ideas from the domain in which compontents are juxtaposed.

This question relates directly to the "better tools for representing
structure"
issues that Jon Gunderson raised concerning XHTML 2.0 requirements based on
lessons learned from writing the User Agent Guidelines.

The Grid Computing Environments Working Group of the Global Grid Forum is
undertaking a data-gathering exercise in search of consensus best practices
for
what they see as their domain of operation.? I want to leave "their domain of
operation" as a variable, here, because I believe the scope is not clear until
the practices are laid out and one can discern the right kinds of boundaries
within the neighborhood.? But they operate Web-to-something portals, and so
their activity is one place where an industry doing the sort of thing you are
asking about, Brian, and they are trying to figure out what works and what
doesn't.

If someone you know or from DESIRE is involved in the European Data Grid
project and will be at the Global Grid Forum meeting, It would help if they
can
spend some time with the Computing Environments group.
