AG::

Second question first:

What people put in a data cell is frequently incomprehensible by itself,
without the orientation provided by relevant headers. 

First question:

The SCOPE attribute works without requiring IDs for each data cell.  If the
graph of data to header associations is complicated, you may need to use the
HEADERS attribute which will require IDs in the headers and HEADERS in the
data
cells.  YMMV.

See the techniques for WCAG 1.0 for some examples:

Review these features of HTML 4.01 and come back to w3c-wai-gl@w3.org with
further questions if you need more help.
