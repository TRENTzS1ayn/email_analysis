I've just visited Bobby for the first time in - I forget how long.
What a ghastly mess!

The first thing that happened was a long wait for Netscape to display
the page[1].  This was repeated later whenever I used the back button
to return to <URL:http://www.cast.org/bobby/>, indicating that the
page's labyrinthine construction is the main culprit.

When the page finally displayed, it showed most of the symptoms of a
poorly-written 1997 kool-deziner page.  A look at the source confirms
a wealth of the worst legacy markup: tables-for-layout, liberal use of
<FONT>, spacer GIFs, etc (as well as several hundred blank lines at
the top: is this some stupid hide-source trick?).  

Furthermore, not only is the HTML a mess, but the backend is broken.
Many of the options there, including the "Change Interface" link
and the "Site Tools" select box, generated internal server errors
whenever I tried them - for example:

Error Diagnostic Information

 An error occurred while evaluating the expression: 

 "#session.LastPage#"

 Error near line 34, column 20.

 Error resolving parameter SESSION.LASTPAGE


I've put a screendump of what Netscape 4.7 displays at
<URL:http://valet.webthing.com/bobby.png>
Lynx is a little better, but still looks extremely silly.

Conclusion: what can I say?  How can anyone take this seriously?


[1] This is a FreeBSD box, and doesn't have enough RAM to run Mozilla -
so I'm a mild case of requiring accessibility myself.
