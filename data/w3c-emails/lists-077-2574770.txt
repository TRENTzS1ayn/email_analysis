Here's what you're asking about:

Here's my take on a "reasonable interpretation":

I think this is a poorly worded way of saying, "if you use
Javascript or other scripting language, provide a textual
equivalent for the function."  But it seems obfuscated in so
many details that it's hard to tell if that -is- the correct
interpretation.

Is this specific wording intended to highlight any of the
following interpretations?

* The mention of two specific uses of "scripting languages"
   may mean that is _only_ restricted to those uses, (a)
   displaying content, and (b) creating interface elements.

* Does this only refer to client-side scripts?  I guess so,
   because it doesn't make sense otherwise, but who can tell?

* Is the operative part 'information provided by the script'
   meaning this only applies to information?  Or does 
   'functional text' mean that it's refering to the function
   of the script?

* Is this asking that information be -identified- as missing,
   and that identification be accessible?  In other words,
   "This javascript, could you see it, would tell you the 
   current date and time" -- is that acceptable?

* It refers to 'assistive technology' but I am not sure if that
   is defined -- does that mean that, if current versions of
   JAWS for windows support limited Javascript, that's the target?
   It's very unclear whether or not this applies to, say, Lynx
   being used with a screenreader.

So those are the issues -- which is why I say it's poorly
worded.  Putting wording aside and looking at likely intent --
based on my understanding of accessibility issues -- I would go
with the interpretation that this means:

"If you use client-side scripting languages, such as Javascript,
to provide information or to create interface elements, you
must provide textual equivalents (accessible by assistive
technology) which provide equal functionality."

Note that this does NOT seem to cover another very common use
of Javascript, which is to provide form interactions such as
validation, except as applies to information display or interface
elements.  Part (n) covers the requirement of forms.
