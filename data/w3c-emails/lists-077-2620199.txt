To the extent that this is accurate, it is claiming that IE5 is largely
a generation 3 browser, i.e. most of the references are to the HTML 3.2
specification.

HTML 3.2 was largely an after the fact formalisation of what the big 2 had
done, so that would tend to confirm the idea that area originated as a
way of supporting people who couldn't configure web servers.
