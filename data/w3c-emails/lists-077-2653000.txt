Yeah, that's a pretty big assumption (and honestly, a very bizarre
requirement).  Isn't this the federal government that just sued
Microsoft for being a monopoly, and now they're demanding the use
of IE?

Wow.  If this really -is- the case then it's obvious that someone
at the access board has their head in an inaccessible location.

Actually there's a lot of holes in Section 508 requirements, and
while this is an important one, it's far from the only one that's
missing. :)

Thanks for the information, Reidy!
