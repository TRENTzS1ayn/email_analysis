Dear WAI Interest Group Members:

There will be a meeting of the WAI Interest Group (WAI IG) on Saturday
March 24, 2001, from 1:00pm to 5:30pm, following the "Technology and
Persons with Disabilities" (CSUN 2001) Conference in Los Angeles.

Pre-registration is required. Information about the WAI IG meeting and
registration is now available at:

http://www.w3.org/WAI/IG/2001/03-agenda

The WAI IG meeting will consist of reports from and discussion about the
various WAI working groups and interest groups; general discussion on WAI
issues; and a question/answer/input session on Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines 2.0 Working Draft currently under development.

Please note that a room block under the name "WAI with CSUN" is still
available at the L.A. Airport Marriott hotel, (only) for registered
participants of either the WAI IG meeting or the all-day Education and
Outreach Working Group meeting on Sunday, March 25 (for which a separate
page of meeting information is available, at
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/2001/03/agenda ), even though the CSUN block
itself may no longer be available.

Additional WAI events during CSUN include a presentation on Thursday March
22, in the morning, at the "Linux Accessibility Conference at CSUN," Hilton
Hotel Plaza D; and a presentation on "Web Accessibility Initiative:
Guidelines Implementation, Standards Harmonization, Advanced Development"
on Friday, March 23, 2001 at 8:00 a.m. in the Atlanta-Boston room of the
Marriott Hotel (listed in the conference addendum). If you are intending to
participate in the WAI Interest Group meeting, it may be helpful to attend
one of these sessions first, for background. 

Regards,

- Judy
