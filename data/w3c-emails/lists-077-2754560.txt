the answer to your question is simple.  Lynx woulde have to be
rewritten from the ground up and called something else.  when will we
see a truely accessable browser?

If or when lynx supports standard open JavaScript then it should be
considered.  When did "free and open-source" become a criteria for
accessibility?  JavaScript, and it's international standard
ECMAScript,
was invented to solve some real problems.  Why can't lynx "get with
it" and
support JavaScript?  This reminds me of the days when people were
ranting
and raving about GUIs being in-accessible.
