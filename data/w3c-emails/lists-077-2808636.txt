the lynx 1 percent is a bit off because if lynx hits a sight that it
cannot access, it is not even logged.  the intent here was to possit
access solutions not to field domenance.  Sure, it is a lynx problem,
but it cannot be solved as easily as the solutions currently at hand
can be implemented by authors.

Sounds familiar, like what some are asking developers to do if they
have
JavaScript on their pages, or worse yet, applets.

Last I checked [1][2]

     Lynx was less than 1% of browsers

     JavaScript was used on 37.45% of sites


Sounds like a lynx problem to me.
