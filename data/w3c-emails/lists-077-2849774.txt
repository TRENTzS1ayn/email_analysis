Hi Graham
Here is the answer from Doug Wakefield at the Access Board  who put the
regulations together
With his permission I am reposting here  and on the SEC508 list


Gregg



Hello Gregg,

In response to the question on the list concerning functional text in
scripts:

When a script has no associated text or label, the screen reader often reads
some content of the script itself in a jumble of letters and words. We have
chosen not to forbid the use of scripts, by rather to require that script
functions provide text that will accurately tell a user the purpose of the
script or action.

Although there are some event handlers in JavaScript's that can pose some
tricky access problems, the bigger problem is the manner in which scripts
write to the screen.

Doug Wakefield

Hi
I have tried to get to some sort of understanding of
this on the Section 508 list at Trace, but am still in
the land of confusion!

The thread starts here
http://trace.wisc.edu:8080/guest/archives/SEC508/sec508.0102/msg00000.html

I have been asked to write an article on accessibility
which covers Section 508 so would like to give a
reasonable interpretation of this regulation.

Anyone care to have a go?

Cheers
Graham Oliver
