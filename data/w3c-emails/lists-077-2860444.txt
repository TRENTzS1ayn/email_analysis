As I've said before, we are more concerned here with 508 than we are with
WAI from the W3C.  With that in mind...

Does anyone have a page/site/snippet of code demonstrating JavaScript or
VBScript for accessibility?

I'd like to see a page with DHTML writing some dynamically created content
with a script and an explanation of how and why that isn't accessible.  I'd
then like to see the same page made accessible without sacrificing the DHTML
portion of it.  If that can be done.

I've seen lots of talk about this and the 508 is not clear on it at all but
I've not seen anyone post url's to examples or anything like that.  Maybe I
just missed it?

I am all for accessibility but unless I can see some hard evidence related
to script issues such as the one I am asking for here, I'll be inclined to
continue scripting my little heart out.  I suppose I am failing to get the
point on why Lynx or Script-less browsers are considered in the arena of the
ADA.  American Disabilies Act right?  Not BDA (Browser Disability Act).
Sorry if I sound a little insensitive here, not trying to be.  Just confused
on all this talk about browsers.  Aren't we trying and really only trying to
make sites accessible to *people* with disabilities?  Thought I had a clue
about all this last week and this week, I am feeling pretty stupid about it
all.

Hi Graham
Here is the answer from Doug Wakefield at the Access Board  who put the
regulations together
With his permission I am reposting here  and on the SEC508 list

Hello Gregg,

In response to the question on the list concerning functional text in
scripts:

When a script has no associated text or label, the screen reader often reads
some content of the script itself in a jumble of letters and words. We have
chosen not to forbid the use of scripts, by rather to require that script
functions provide text that will accurately tell a user the purpose of the
script or action.

Although there are some event handlers in JavaScript's that can pose some
tricky access problems, the bigger problem is the manner in which scripts
write to the screen.

Doug Wakefield

Paragraph (l)

Hi
I have tried to get to some sort of understanding of
this on the Section 508 list at Trace, but am still in
the land of confusion!

The thread starts here
http://trace.wisc.edu:8080/guest/archives/SEC508/sec508.0102/msg00000.html

I have been asked to write an article on accessibility
which covers Section 508 so would like to give a
reasonable interpretation of this regulation.

Anyone care to have a go?

Cheers
Graham Oliver
