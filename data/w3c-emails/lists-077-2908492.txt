Big issue!  I just got the word  Doug Wakefield of the Access Board, this
morning. 

At least for federal websites, which is what we were talking about, so
presumably true for the rest of the 508 standard.
Any foreign language that is made available on a US government website will
be covered under section 508 for accessibility. Meaning, that alt text must
be available for all images of text - in the language it is portraying, etc.
In other words, avoid the use of images of the font, it should be use the
actual unicode or ascii code for that particular language.
(There is information on this in the Internationalization area of the W3C
website)

The font for the language must be made available to the assistive technology
devices used.  Where the text is character based, Japanese and Chinese, alt
text of comparable content of the image, must be provided.
Apparently, screen-reader's Braille Language Tables, are not standardized
across the differing vendors machines.  The Braille Language Tables are
mapped-to the high-bit ascii characters. The safest way to ensure
accessibility for Braille displays is to have the high-bit ascii text
available in the page. (This info is from a Braille expert at the Library of
Congress, Judy Dixon)
