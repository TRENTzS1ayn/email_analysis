Yes, they are ripping off Cari Burstein, but they have a few cool free
gimmicks, like a utility that brings a page up limited to what would show in
a standard 14" (640x480) resolution monitor.  Others tools include a html
validation and compatibility tests that others have been doing for some
time.
I am embarrassed to say that I couldn't quite figure out what these people
are selling (except for banner space)!
