How correct is correct?

If every time I do something on my computer it acts in the way I
want, I have found the correct way of doing it. If one day it doesn't
react in the way I expect it is the programmer who is at fault.

This is true even if the convention may not have been the best one in
the first place (yesterdays considered-harmful is unfortunately often
today's best practice - take the poor choice of blue underlined text
to represent a link on a colour-enabled graphical browser; a hard to
read colour and underline already implies emphasis, but nowadays you
know straightaway it's a link, so it's best to have all links blue
and underlined).
