no, Jon, in my opinion you are not off topic. 

<snip>Another definition of "accessibility" is making sure that
everyone can see the page. </snip>

as a web developer, i consider it to be my job to continue to learn
and apply what ever i've learned, not to stay closed minded.  if that
means having to go back and clean up all those pages i did way back
when (and there are a ton of them) , so that they will be useful to
all people, then so be it.  if the result is that maybe my pages
aren't going to look like they used to, i can deal with that, too....
that's what happens with change. 

Also wanted to note that on the javascript issue, i agree with Paul
Bohman's email:

<snip>Until javascript matures, go ahead and use the onMouseOver menus
as long as the same menu structure is
available in a redundant text format.</snip>
