WAI Interest Group Members,

Reminder, review comments are particularly requested for the Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 Working Draft through next Thursday, February
22nd.

For details, please see original call for review on the WAI Interest Group
mailing list, at:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/2001JanMar/0372

Nothing like having an early impact on a document -- get your comments in
while the draft is young.

Thanks,

- Judy
