Some people insist on creating pseudo lists with small images at the start
of the line (and don't use CSS either). I have previously advised them to
sue ALT=" " or ALT="*", but have seen other recommendations such as
ALT="bullet" for the ALT text for the graphics on these lists.

I have just done some testing with JAWS3.7 and find that, in a UL, JAWS just
reads one list item followed by the next with no indication that it is a new
LI.

Can anyone advise what do other screen readers 'say' when they encounter
lists, and what advice do any of you give developers wrt ALT text for
graphics used to create pseudo lists?

Thanks,  Andrew
