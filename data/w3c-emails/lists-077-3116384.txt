and what advice do any of you give developers wrt ALT text for
> graphics used to create pseudo lists?

Ideally use a real list and use the list-style-image CSS attribute
rather than an <img /> or <object> element, this has (in theory) the
same visual effect, but it's a real list.

If the list could be an ordered list (there are a few times where a
list could be either ordered or unordered at the authors discretion)
I would recommend to use 1 2 3... or a b c... etc. as it would be
clearer.

If the list makes sense as a non-list then alt="" would make sense.

Otherwise I have used alt="&middot;" but I haven't been altogether
happy with this choice; it makes sense for sighted users of text-only
browsers, but I doubt it's of much use to sound users, and I've no
idea about how Braille readers cope with this.
