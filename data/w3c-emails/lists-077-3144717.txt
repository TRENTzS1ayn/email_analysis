[IMHO:] Animated GIFs can feature moving, blinking, or scrolling, so if you
use them and do not have an adequate form of control, you are in violation
of the guideline. I suppose you might be able to have a link with some
scripting hack to turn off the animation, but that wouldn't work in some
browsers, so you still couldn't cionsider that you have passed the
guideline.

I bleieve the rationale is that some people can't focus on moving images,
or blinking lights cause them discomfort, or even seizures (flickering is a
P1, everything else P2). Animated images are a nuiscance to many, and you
have to ask yourself if there is anything to be gained in having them in
your Web page. Is there information in there that can *only* be displayed
using an animation? Can't you link to it?
