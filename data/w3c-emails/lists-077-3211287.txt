Do you know of any work-arounds for the disorientation problem? Is there anything web designers can do to help re-orient you, or is it just a limitation of the currently-available technology?

in answer to your question of whether or not we can find the skip

internal links, using jfw 3.7 and ie5.5sp1 I become disoriented as to
where I am on the page when I follow them.
