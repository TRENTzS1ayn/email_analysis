No.  Ideally, if popup menus are essential to successful web
navigation, rather than a way of showing off, you should campaign for
a popup menu style, that could be applied to lists, in the next version
of CSS.

Menus are really lists.  In fact, the original version of HTML had
rather more variants of lists, but the GUI browser designers failed
to implement them!  (One of them might well have sensibly implemented
the very first sort of non-standard menu:  [ xxxx | xxxxx | xxxxx ].)
