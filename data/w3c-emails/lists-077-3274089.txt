Hi

I'm new to this list so apologies for a simple question.  I'm interested in
accessibility of web sites, but I have never tried screen reader software.
What are the 'best' ones (not sure how to define best at this point), where
can they be got hold of and how much do they cost?  I'm just interested to
see how they work and how good they are.

Thanks for any help

Jo
