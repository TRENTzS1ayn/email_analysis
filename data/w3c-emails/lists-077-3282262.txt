As some people have already said the problem isn't
ECMAScript/Javascript/JScript. The problem is the object models that
different browsers expose. The scripts manipulates members of the
objects from these object models, and it is this that is the problem
both from the general problem of writing working javascript code, and
the problem of making it accessible.

The various browser vendors/distributors document these object
models, so you will have to look at the developer pages of Internet
Explorer, Netscape, Opera, WebTV, etc.

The obvious compatibility problem of this situations also affects how
difficult it can be to write accessible code.
