My main struggles are unimportant.  I was only pointing out an issue and one
which I believe affects us all.  Every post I make seems to result in sales
pitches for consulting or other services.  We are NOT interested in anything
like that.

Guess I should just unsubscribe.  Should solve the problem nicely.

Jimmie, what are your main struggles?  My company specializes in
accessibility testing and consulting.  Perhaps I could help.
