>
>Draft Digital Talking Book Standard Released for Public Review
>
>A committee of the National Information Standards Organization (NISO) has
completed a 
>document entitled *File Specifications for the Digital Talking Book.*
NISO has posted this draft standard on its web site 
  www.niso.org/Z3986.html 
>for a thirty-day public comment period ending March 20, 2001.   The
committee, chaired by NLS research and development officer Michael Moodie,
is made up of representatives from nearly two dozen organizations committed
to making print materials available to blind and physically handicapped
readers in an accessible form.
>
>*File Specifications for the Digital Talking Book* defines the formats of
the many files that will make up a digital talking book (DTB).  It is a
technical specification intended for use by developers of DTB playback
devices and authors of software used to produce and distribute DTBs.
Following the public review period, the specification is scheduled to be
updated based on comments received and then sent to NISO with the request
that it be accepted as a national standard.  The standard will guide the
development of the next generation of talking books at NLS and other
partner agencies.
