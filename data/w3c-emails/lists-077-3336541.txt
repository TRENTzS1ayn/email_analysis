Having failed to find anything I went ahead and wrote the article.
It's at http://www.spin.ie/jon/textonlyharmful.html

I'd be interested in any comments, additions, counter-arguments "hey,
your page on accessibility issues isn't accessible to <insert group
here>" etc. especially since I'm not very well qualified to write
this, but decided to grab the bull by the horns rather than wait
around for somebody who is.
Note that the group it is written for takes accessibility to include
able-bodied users of browsers lacking features others have etc. as
well as disabled people.
