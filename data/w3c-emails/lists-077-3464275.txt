With JFW 3.5 I was not able to identify the "this page" link, it could be my
settings but the 'title' part about skip navigation was not read and it
wasn't clear that Accessible Web Design as a link would give you a 'skip
navigation' action.
Using pwWebspeak the skip navigation title was clear and worked well.
