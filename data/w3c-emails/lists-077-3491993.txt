Here's a strange one:

Using JAWS 3.7 & IE 5.5, I got the same results as Marti -- JAWS read "this
page link, Accessible Web Design Course". I checked JAWS setting for how it
reads text links; it _was_ set to the default "read alt or title" (other
choices are to read the link text or the longest of the two).

The surprise? I copied your source code to a local file, and it worked just
fine (i.e. read the title, "skip navigation").

David, have any ideas?

Thanks, Marti!

Hmm, okay, we have one positive data point (from software which, sadly,
is discontinued) and one negative data point.  If anyone is using any
other assistive tech, let me know -- can someone with JAWS 3.7 test it,
or IBM's Home Page Reader?

Although, with that negative point for JFW 3.5, it's looking like I'll
have a trip back to the drawing board soon...

PS:  This would all be easy to do if I'd just convince myself that
      Idyll Mountain can afford to license Reef's edapta technology,
      but unfortunately we're not -that- rich yet. ;)
