Kynn,

IBM Home Page Reader picks up the link (of course) "Accessible Web Design
Course" but doesn't read the title of that link.

Since that link skips the navigation I think there is no question that it
satisfies the Skip Navigation standard for 508 - a method is provided. How
does anyone know that that is what the link does?

I know some say "titles" on links are useful (IE displays them as pop-up
text) but I am "shocked" to find that JFW reads the title and not the link
text. By the way, JFW 3.7 does not read a skip navigating link assigned to a
small image (as on CNN and IBM and ...); a situation that is going to be
corrected by Freedom Scientific with a patch shortly.

Window Eyes, Like HPR reads the link text - as I think it should. I believe
it is mistake to rely on the title to carry crucial information. The ONLY
way this can be useful is for title text to always be read, and though it
seems JFW is doing that, I wouldn't recommend it to IBM for HPR. How can we
tell web developers to write in the title where the link really goes? What
should the link text say? Why not use "course content" as the link text in
your case? In fact, why note use "skip navigation?" I know the answer to
that!

Hmm, okay, we have one positive data point (from software which, sadly,
is discontinued) and one negative data point.  If anyone is using any
other assistive tech, let me know -- can someone with JAWS 3.7 test it,
or IBM's Home Page Reader?

Although, with that negative point for JFW 3.5, it's looking like I'll
have a trip back to the drawing board soon...

PS:  This would all be easy to do if I'd just convince myself that
      Idyll Mountain can afford to license Reef's edapta technology,
      but unfortunately we're not -that- rich yet. ;)
