The real problem with animation is that it causes the human brain to
lose its focus.  Most of the eye (the rods) is optimised for detecting
the movement of predators and there are deeply embedded instincts to
switch ones attention to any source of movement in the visual field.
This is why banner adversts particularly like animation.
