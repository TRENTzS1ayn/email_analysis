I'd just like to endorse Kynn and David. Having recently started working
with visually impaired people and doing some user testing with them, I am
surprised at some of the "assumptions" I had previously made, and the little
"gotchas" that show up with user testing.

I now do a quick check with JAWS first and get the obvious things fixed,
then retest with a 'Jaws' user and a 'ZoomText' user to pick up usability
issues - and we always find some.
