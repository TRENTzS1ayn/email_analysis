Perhaps someone on this list can assist with the following access
question.

I have been approached for information regarding use of frame
"title"atttribute in relation to JAWS or Window-Eyes. While WAI
recommends inclusion of "title" it doesn't seem to be picked up in the
list of frames generated by either of these products. This has lead to a
few questions:

Is "title" intended to have this function?
Is the "name" attribute the one that is generally the context identifier
for screenreaders?
Is it a question of verbosity settings in the screenreader?

Thanks in advance for any input.
