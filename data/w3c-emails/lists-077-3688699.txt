Sure. The law that requires that the service available (filling out forms) be
accessible in general may or may not come under a provision of 508 on a
different basis.But if you mean "are the regulations only meant to apply to
stuff that is designed for online use?", the answer is that the bit of them
that deals with online use is.

If this webmaster manages to convince the complainant that someone else in
the department is responsible for this proble, then they will have to take it
up with the someone else. I would suggest it is a high-risk strategy, as well
as basically foolish, since it would probably be easier to allow for online
form filling, even if that form subsequently has to be printed and posted.

Just my 2c from the foreign peanut gallery.
