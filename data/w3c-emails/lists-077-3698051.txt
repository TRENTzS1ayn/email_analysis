Well, I try to avoid going "head-to-head" with people, since as I understand
it that means the sort of confrontational approach where neither side is
intersted in giving ground. But I have, as part of my work in the Authoring
Tool Accesibility Guidelines Group, spent time engaging in what I hope is
productive dialogue with some of the Publisher Team, among others at
Microsoft. So have their own accessibility deaprtment, as I understand
things.

Part of the reason why the Authoring Tools group is looking for organisations
who are publicly prepared to say "we want to buy things that meet the highest
possibe conformance to ATAG" is that this provides a lever that can be used
by engineering teams who have to negotiate their priorities with marketing
departments and various other parts of an organistation. (Or can be used by
marketing departments as a lever when etc...)

(If anyone from Publisher is reading this, I am happy to come back and look
some more at things that can be done, as I am generally to  talk to
developers of Authoring tools).

Cheers

  Please, has anyone gone head to head with the makers of these products?
  Don't they pay attention to W3c at all?  Maybe I am na?ve, but I want them
  to explain their thinking to me and how they will address the very important
  ADA issues.

  Thanks for any and all responses as I get ready to write to them directly.

  in answer to your question of whether or not we can find the
  skip
  link, yes.  I can click on it but for some reason as with
  many
  internal links, using jfw 3.7 and ie5.5sp1 I become
  disoriented as to
  where I am on the page when I follow them.

  Animated GIFs shouldn't be a problem, since they can be
  stopped by any
  browser that can display them (at least among the major
  browsers - I'm
  not sure if this is true for WebTV or other "internet
  appliances").

  On the Bobby site, listing the sponsors wouldn't be
  appropriate for
  the ALT text, but would be appropriate for a LONGDESC. The
  designers
  may have decided that since the image is a link to detailed
  information about their sponsors, that wasn't necessary. I'd
  say it's
  a judgement call, and an defensible choice. However, running
  Bobby
  against that page, in the Priority 1 User Checks it says:

     "Do you have a descriptive (D) link in addition to
  LONGDESC?"

  which - regardless of conformance with the WAI guidelines -
  suggests
  that the site doesn't actually implement what the Bobby
  designers
  consider to be "best practices." There are several other
  areas, such
  as in the extensive use of tables for layout, where the site
  appears
  to move away from theoretical ideals. On the other hand, the
  site
  seems to work, which to me is by far the most important
  concern. The
  WAI guidelines, are, after all, guidelines. They're intended
  to help
  people develop accessible sites, but if the focus becomes
  adherence to
  every checkpoint, instead of the overall goal of
  accessibility,
  they've failed in their purpose.

  Another question related to that site - they've got a link
  to skip the
  navigation stuff and go directly to the content, which is
  great. The
  link, however, is a transparent gif, with the ALT text
  providing the
  description of how it's to be used. Will screen readers
  currently in
  use pick this up properly?

  >>> Brian Kelly <b.kelly@ukoln.ac.uk> 02/15/01 04:08AM >>>
  Guideline 7 at
  http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/
  says
  "Ensure that moving, blinking, scrolling, or auto-updating
  objects or
  pages
  may be paused or stopped."
  and
  "Until user agents allow users to freeze moving content,
  avoid
  movement in
  pages."

  How does this apply to animated GIFs?

  Does it apply, for example, to the animated sponsorship ads
  at, for
  example,
  http://www.cast.org/bobby/

  I understood that movement on screens could cause screen
  readers to
  lose
  their focus.  Does this happen with animated GIFs?  If so,
  is this a
  concern?

  Also, while looking at the Bobby page, the alt text for the
  GIF simply
  says
  "Scrolling list of sponsors, without mentioning their names
  (IBM,
  Microsoft,
  etc.).  Again does this conform to the WAI guidelines?

  Like Nick, I don't want to pick on the Bobby site or the
  CAST staff,
  but it
  is a Web site that those with interests in accessibility
  will look at.

  Thanks

  Brian (hoping this isn't an FAQ)
