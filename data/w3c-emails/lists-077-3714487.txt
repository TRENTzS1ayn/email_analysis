I think the goal is stop, restart, step-through. The user agent guidelines
http://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG10 or group drafts publicly visible from their home

  I dunno, I feel that only "stop" and "restart" are not sufficient
  interface controls _if_ the GIF is going to be used to display
  information, especially textual information.  I think that's the main
  problem with the Bobby sponsor GIF.
