Greetings,

I have been invited by the esteemed Sean Palmer to post an announcement =
on WAI for the initiative Human Markup Language.  The fundamental =
purpose of our language is to increase the quality of human =
communications, and reduce the amount of human misunderstanding.  This =
is done by explicitly conveying internal qualities through markup, =
including 'attitude', 'emotions', 'thought', 'gestures', and =
'flexibility'. =20

We are approaching this as a modularized approach--the modules span the =
entire range of human communication, from specific human gestures (such =
as smile, wink, nod), to complex scenarios (speeches, debates, meeting). =
 Through the creation of different sets of namespaces, we can allow =
different applications to utilize elements of these standards in a =
pragmatic fashion.


----------
Based on a review of the WAI initiative, we determined several tie ins =
with WAI that may be very useful to look at:

1) Conveying human emotion and expression, through textual and =
non-textual
means, can be based on the HumanML standard emotions/expressions. =
Currently, we are using smileys for this purpose, but certainly these =
are limited.

2) HumanML guidelines and protocols for standard sessions of =
communication
can be applied or shared with WAI.  These protocols may include specific =
guidelines for communication during monologues, meetings, and =
interviews.  At this moment in time, very
little of human communication is standardized, which leads to unclear
communication.

3) Internal structure in terms of *human communication constructs* such =
as
'mainpoint', 'purpose', 'questions', and 'commands' can be marked up in =
a data
model.  This isn't an obvious data model like 'chapter', 'subtopic', and
'paragraph'.  This is because much human communication is flexible,
spontaneous, and fragmented.  Thus, it may be interesting in determine =
how the
new XML Fragment Interchange (just announced) could work with the =
HumanML
specifications as well.
-----------

We have just formed a group within Yahoo at =
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/humanmarkup and all interested parties are =
invited to join.  Further, we are scheduled to begin an official OASIS =
Discussion List and Technical Committee in the near future.  We would =
like to invite all interested parties to contribute and discuss ideas in =
this endeavor.  Our hope is that WAI, along with other web initiatives, =
can work with us in very meaningful ways.

Thanks for your interest.
