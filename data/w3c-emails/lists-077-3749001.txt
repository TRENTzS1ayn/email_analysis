A comment about lynx.  unless you test your site using lynx with a
screen reader whether it be unix, linux, dos or windows, you may still
run into stumbling blocks because some characters that look fine in
lynx do not necessarily translate to screen readers as I have been
discussing with someone off list who is pretty sharp on this.  We were
discussing using certain symbols for bullets in an marked up list and
the fact that screen readers do not recognize or read correctly some
of the mark up.
