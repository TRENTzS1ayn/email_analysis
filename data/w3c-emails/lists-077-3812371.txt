Dear David (and others),
What is the CCS technique for centering a table over all on a page WITHOUT
causing text in each cell to be centered?
I was trying to upgrade a page to HTML strict, but could not find an
equivalent for the table attribute <Q>align=center</Q>.
Thanks.
Bruce

I suspect that even some ofthe uses of width are only un-deprecated because the corresponding CSSfeature was not introduced until CSS2.
