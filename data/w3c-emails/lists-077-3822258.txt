Dear Marti (et al.),

As I understand it, they may have "wiggle room" with (n), but where they
caught is (m):

(m) When a web page requires that an applet, plug-in or other
application be on the client system to interpret page content, the page must
provide a link to a plug-in or applet that complies with ? 1194.21(a)
through (l).

It seems to me that this covers ALL proprietary file formats, including
.doc, .wpd, .pdf., .xls, etc.
But maybe that's just my interpretation!
