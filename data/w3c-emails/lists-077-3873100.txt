I have been asked to summarize the current state of screen-reader support 
for the attributes alt, title and longdesc.  I believe the following three 
statements are true as of today's date (but I admit to a good deal of 
confusion over the second statement ).

1) All current Web-aware screen-readers (or Web page readers) expose 
"alt"  text by default if it is present.

2) All current Web-aware screen-readers (or Web page readers) will expose 
"title" text if it is present only if "alt" text is not also present in the 
same element.

3) No current release of screen-reader (or Web page reader) exposes the 
"longdesc" URL.

I would appreciate hearing from users or developers who could 
confirm,  deny or refine these statements.

Regards,
Chuck Letourneau
