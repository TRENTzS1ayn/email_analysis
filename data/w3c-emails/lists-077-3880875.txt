At least with JAWS, it's the other way around, i.e. JAWS will read the "alt"
only if the "title" is not also present (including the "title" of an <a>
which contains the image). This is not necesarily the best practice, but it
is "current" practice...

Subject: ALT - TITLE - LONGDESC?

I have been asked to summarize the current state of screen-reader support
for the attributes alt, title and longdesc.  I believe the following three
statements are true as of today's date (but I admit to a good deal of
confusion over the second statement ).

1) All current Web-aware screen-readers (or Web page readers) expose
"alt"  text by default if it is present.

2) All current Web-aware screen-readers (or Web page readers) will expose
"title" text if it is present only if "alt" text is not also present in the
same element.

3) No current release of screen-reader (or Web page reader) exposes the
"longdesc" URL.

I would appreciate hearing from users or developers who could
confirm,  deny or refine these statements.

Regards,
Chuck Letourneau
