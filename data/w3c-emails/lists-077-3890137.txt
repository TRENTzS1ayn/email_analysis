It should be noted that it would be relatively trivial to make a
proxy server which exposes longdesc appropriately for users who
need it.  So the fact that longdesc is not CURRENTLY widely
supported should not be a disincentive to doing this.

It's even easier to do this if you're serving up XHTML pages; just
run a simple XSLT to convert <img longdesc="url" .../> to
<img .../> [<a href="url">longer description</a>].
