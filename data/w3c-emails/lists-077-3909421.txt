Great Kynn,

You asked whether or not this is an "ideal usage" of the NOSCRIPT element.
My question was whether there were real life "effective" uses.

I really didn't expect any, and good for you for finding a "real life" use
of NOSCRIPT. This one at http://www.section508.gov, of all places, is
certainly real life and it is effective. What it does is provide text at the
top of the page that in effect says "we use JavaScript for XYZ and since you
don't support JavaScript you are out of lunch as regards XYZ."

I really think that is kind of an ingenious idea. "We're using JavaScript
and you don't get the benefit of it, so TOUGH!"

I guess I would say the instance is certainly not ideal. The prescription
for NOSCRIPT is that authors will provide alternate content when scripting
is not available. This example does not do that because I read "alternate"
do be in some sense equivalent.

Do you agree?

The government's Section 508 web site -- http://www.section508.gov/
-- uses a <noscript> element.  This might be an interesting point of
discussion as to whether or not this is ideal usage.

Here's the content of the <noscript>:
