I don't understand how you can say that they are providing "equivalent
content" with their NOSCRIPT tag. The NOSCRIPT content says that when you
leave the site with scripting enabled you will get an alert. You don't get
that alert when scripting is turned off. The scripting content is the alert.

It does NOT provide that "alert" content in alternative form --- or I am
missing what you are trying to say?

Please note, I do not think the site has accessibility problems; my
assertion on this, so far the only real life NOSCRIPT instance, is that
accessibility is NOT improved with the NOSCRIPT content.

Actually I am not entirely sure it says that.  It looks like they
are trying to say "if you had javascript, you'd see <x>, but since
you don't, we will tell you the content you are missing; in other
words, the content of the popup."

Hmmm.  I've seen sites that do that, I don't think this is the case
though.  I think they are trying to do it right, even though I think
they don't do it particularly well.

Not really.  I think they are well-meaning but they did not consider
overall usability, just accessibility.  Surely this does indeed provide
the content in an alternate form; it's just awful clumsy.  I think a
better idea would have been for them to provide the same functionality
in a different way; for example, making each link go to the page in
question with a pop-up (as now) if javascript is enabled, and making
it go to an "exit page" if javascript is not enabled.  That might
work better than this <noscript> message, which I honestly would have
put somewhere near the bottom of the page.  But at least they allow
you to skip it, I think.
