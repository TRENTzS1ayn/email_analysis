Hi David,

There is nothing in the Section 508 Standards that rules out the NOSCRIPT
tag. They have said that if you do depend on JavaScript then that better be
accessible by assistive technology. If you don't depend on JavaScript, i.e.,
if you used NOSCRIPT effectively, then you are home free.

By my accounting I have not yet seen an effective use of JavaScript,
effective in the sense of providing content that replaces and is (in some
sense) equivalent to what the script would provide.

ah, but that is the crux of the matter.  I'd like to seem them do the
right thing for us all, but this raises the question and now I am as
confused as jimmie.  I had thought they were ruling the noscript tag
out with their rule.

Actually I am not entirely sure it says that.  It looks like they
are trying to say "if you had javascript, you'd see <x>, but since
you don't, we will tell you the content you are missing; in other
words, the content of the popup."

Hmmm.  I've seen sites that do that, I don't think this is the case
though.  I think they are trying to do it right, even though I think
they don't do it particularly well.

Not really.  I think they are well-meaning but they did not consider
overall usability, just accessibility.  Surely this does indeed
provide
the content in an alternate form; it's just awful clumsy.  I think a
better idea would have been for them to provide the same functionality
in a different way; for example, making each link go to the page in
question with a pop-up (as now) if javascript is enabled, and making
it go to an "exit page" if javascript is not enabled.  That might
work better than this <noscript> message, which I honestly would have
put somewhere near the bottom of the page.  But at least they allow
you to skip it, I think.
