It is also easy in horrid HTML using a sed script or similar. And it can
probaby be done as a javascript extension in browsers.

Find the image, find the attribute value, add a link to the value of the
longdesc attribute.

  It should be noted that it would be relatively trivial to make a
  proxy server which exposes longdesc appropriately for users who
  need it.  So the fact that longdesc is not CURRENTLY widely
  supported should not be a disincentive to doing this.

  It's even easier to do this if you're serving up XHTML pages; just
  run a simple XSLT to convert <img longdesc="url" .../> to
  <img .../> [<a href="url">longer description</a>].
