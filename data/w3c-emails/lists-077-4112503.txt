It's probably not that useful for people with a primary concern for
accessibility, but it does allow accessibility features to be completely
hidden from those people who do have scripting on, which may mean that they
get past marketing department concerns that they spoil the look of the
page.

Unfortunately, they also hide them from other maintainers of the page,
and if used in this way, may well be introduced by a member of the team
who has a personal interest in accessibility, rather than as policy, so
may decay rapidly once maintenance shifts to another person.
