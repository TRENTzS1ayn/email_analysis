From the Chairman's Foreword, opening paragraph:

Roughly 20% of adults - that is perhaps as many as 7 million people - have more or less severe problems with basic skills, in particular with what is generally called 'functional literacy' and 'functional numeracy':
"The ability to read, write and speak in English, and use mathematics at a level necessary to function at work and in society in general".
