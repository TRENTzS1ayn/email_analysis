"Please upgrade" messages can appear very condescending (especially when
you get them on a non-standard configuration of the latest big 2 - but
that's not the case here).  Upgrading may not be an easy process for
people who are not particularly computer literate and, if attempted 
blindly might run the machine out of useable disk space (e.g. my 
parents have been given an old PC with Windows 95 and IE3; currently
they lack confidence to use it at all (GUIs really are not as 
intuitive as their proponents claim, even without the thousands of
different web site user interface paradigms), but if they did, it would not
have the free disk space to run recent browsers).

Also many people now have WebTV type solutions.

If you are going to give this sort of warning, you should start by pointing
out that you have worked round the problem.  I think you should also advise
turning off CSS support as an alternative (although just following a link to
download a new browser version is likely to be easier than this for people
who are not comfortable with computers).  In my view disabling broken CSS
support makes the browser fit the CSS graceful degradation model properly,
so will result in sensible behaviour on well designed pages.
