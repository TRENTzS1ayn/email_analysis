I am slightly confused about how to mark up tables
where there is only 1 logical level of headers.

Checkpoints 5.1 and 5.2 would suggest that it is
_only_ necessary to identify the headers, and yet in
the 'coffee' example given here
http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-HTML-TECHS/#identifying-table-rows-columns

it would appear that both checkpoints 5.1 and 5.2 have
been applied even though there is only 1 level of
headers.

Is the approach taken in the 'coffee' example required
in order to be Single A compliant, or do only the
headers need to be identified?

Which is preferable to screen reader users?

Regards
Graham Oliver
