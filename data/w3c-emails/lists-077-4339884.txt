adam,

do you have a list of 'how to stop' animated browsers with different web
browsers?

browser that can display them (at least among the major browsers - I'm not
sure if this is true for WebTV or other "internet appliances").

ALT text, but would be appropriate for a LONGDESC. The designers may have
decided that since the image is a link to detailed information about their
sponsors, that wasn't necessary. I'd say it's a judgement call, and an
defensible choice. However, running Bobby against that page, in the Priority
1 User Checks it says:

the site doesn't actually implement what the Bobby designers consider to be
"best practices." There are several other areas, such as in the extensive
use of tables for layout, where the site appears to move away from
theoretical ideals. On the other hand, the site seems to work, which to me
is by far the most important concern. The WAI guidelines, are, after all,
guidelines. They're intended to help people develop accessible sites, but if
the focus becomes adherence to every checkpoint, instead of the overall goal
of accessibility, they've failed in their purpose.

navigation stuff and go directly to the content, which is great. The link,
however, is a transparent gif, with the ALT text providing the description
of how it's to be used. Will screen readers currently in use pick this up
properly?
