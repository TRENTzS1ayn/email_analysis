Charles,

The problem I have seen with lotus notes tables is that they are free form
by design.  there is no standard tempplate to follow.  One table can be
neatly set up with columns (which indicate the field names of the table)
and unique rows that show each interation of the data contained within the
table itself.  The next table can have its fields located anywhere on the
screen, multiple line formats which make a very big headache for screen
readers to follow.  I really think that Lotus has to standardize its format
of table representation in order to make it accessible for people using
screen readers.  

This falls in line with the many database developers I find writing custom
forms that are visually pleasing, but hell on a screen reader.
