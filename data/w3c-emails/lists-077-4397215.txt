Hi all,

I don't know much about Lotus Domino but this post seems to suggest that if
you use it and it doesn't support th, then it is not possible to use Lotus
Domino to create web pages that are WAI compliant.

Is this correct, or am I making a big assumption here? Are there any other
accessibility issues that one should look out for if using Lotus Domino?

Anthony

Hi,

I asked the Lotus folks and they said Lotus does not supprt th. So they are
interested in documenting why it is important.

As a start, it is the feature most easily used by tablin and other software
to extract
information based on being able to find the headers.

Ay other thoughts?
