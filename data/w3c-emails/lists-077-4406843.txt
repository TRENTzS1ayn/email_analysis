No, I don't have a list. With Netscape and Mozilla on Windows and Linux/Unix platforms, hitting the Esc key does the trick (or "Stop Animations" under the "View" menu). Esc seems to work for IE as well. With Netscape on a Mac, it's whatever keystroke stops loading the page - after the page is loaded, it works for stopping animations (I rarely use a Mac, so I'm not sure of the keystrokes involved). On both Windows and MacOS, IE also allows you to turn animated GIFs off completely in the "Preference" or "Internet Options" settings (look under "Content" or "Advanced"). Opera also has an option in its "Preferences", at least under Linux (I don't have a recent version of Opera for Windows).

So, in terms of allowing animated GIFs to be stopped, all major browsers seem to be OK. Of course, as has been pointed out here, there's still a problem of those GIFs that provide information that way. But I don't see any real difference between an animated GIF and a static one, or another form of multimedia content - reasonable alternatives should always be provided.

adam,

do you have a list of 'how to stop' animated browsers with different web
browsers?

decided that since the image is a link to detailed information about their
sponsors, that wasn't necessary. I'd say it's a judgement call, and an
defensible choice. However, running Bobby against that page, in the Priority
1 User Checks it says:

the site doesn't actually implement what the Bobby designers consider to be
"best practices." There are several other areas, such as in the extensive
use of tables for layout, where the site appears to move away from
theoretical ideals. On the other hand, the site seems to work, which to me
is by far the most important concern. The WAI guidelines, are, after all,
guidelines. They're intended to help people develop accessible sites, but if
the focus becomes adherence to every checkpoint, instead of the overall goal
of accessibility, they've failed in their purpose.

navigation stuff and go directly to the content, which is great. The link,
however, is a transparent gif, with the ALT text providing the description
of how it's to be used. Will screen readers currently in use pick this up
properly?
