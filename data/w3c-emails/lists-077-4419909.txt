No, you are making a big assumption here. Lotus Domino provides for
"pass-through" code which is added by the author explicitly, as a way of
extending what the system itself supports. You can certainly use that to
provide th elements.

  Hi all,

  I don't know much about Lotus Domino but this post seems to suggest that if
  you use it and it doesn't support th, then it is not possible to use Lotus
  Domino to create web pages that are WAI compliant.

  Is this correct, or am I making a big assumption here? Are there any other
  accessibility issues that one should look out for if using Lotus Domino?

  Hi,

  I asked the Lotus folks and they said Lotus does not supprt th. So they are
  interested in documenting why it is important.

  As a start, it is the feature most easily used by tablin and other software
  to extract
  information based on being able to find the headers.

  Ay other thoughts?
