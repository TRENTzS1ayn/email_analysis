I'm assuming that you are talking about the Domino designer tool. 
 
According to the documentation, one can either use the tool to 
generate html code, or one can insert pre-written code.  

For the latter instance, the <TH> tag is supported.  

If the issue is pass through HTML, thats a horse of a different 
color.  Many tools let the developer/designer get away with not 
writing alt tags, etc. Front Page is such a tool, and given that
the Microsoft platform is the most proliferate at the government 
level, it seems a more problematic issue.

Hi,

I asked the Lotus folks and they said Lotus does not supprt th. So they are
interested in documenting why it is important.

As a start, it is the feature most easily used by tablin and other software
to extract
information based on being able to find the headers.

Ay other thoughts?
