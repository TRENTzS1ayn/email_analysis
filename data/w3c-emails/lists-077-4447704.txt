Joy,

thanks for the clarification. Graham Oliver wrote the intial request, so I
will defer to him. But as I read it his original request was specifically
whether it was possible to get the th element _without_ hand-coding such as
inserting passthrough code.

see the begining of this thread at

  I'm assuming that you are talking about the Domino designer tool.

  According to the documentation, one can either use the tool to
  generate html code, or one can insert pre-written code.

  For the latter instance, the <TH> tag is supported.

  If the issue is pass through HTML, thats a horse of a different
  color.  Many tools let the developer/designer get away with not
  writing alt tags, etc. Front Page is such a tool, and given that
  the Microsoft platform is the most proliferate at the government
  level, it seems a more problematic issue.

  Hi,

  I asked the Lotus folks and they said Lotus does not supprt th. So they are
  interested in documenting why it is important.

  As a start, it is the feature most easily used by tablin and other software
  to extract
  information based on being able to find the headers.

  Ay other thoughts?
