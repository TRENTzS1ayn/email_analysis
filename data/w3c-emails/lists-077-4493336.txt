I would personally favor using CSS to transform/reposition a navbar located
at the bottom of a page. But, apart from issues of CSS-P support, is it a
general rule that a screen reader will read content in its order in the HTML
source vs. its visually rendered order (when they are two different things
due to CSS repositioning)??

Disclaimer: the following example is something I've only meant for IE + JAWS
(in-house demo, working on fixing it up for NS etc.).
