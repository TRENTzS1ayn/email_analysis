I have built a form which has a submit button on it.
If the user activates the button and hasn't filled out
the form correctly, a javascript 'alert' pop-up is
presented to the user, giving more information.
This appears to be in breach of checkpoint 10.1
http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/wai-pageauth.html#tech-avoid-pop-ups
Would it be acceptable to provide a warning message,
something like 'Submitting this form may result in a
pop-up dialog being displayed' before the submit
button, in the same color as the background?
Thus (I believe) making the text available to screen
reader users but not to sighted users?

Regards
Graham Oliver
