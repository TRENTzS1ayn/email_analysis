This will show up on any device that cannot display colours or
doesn't understand the styling used to set the colours.  It is
a known trick for stuffing keywords for search engines and may 
result in the site being boycotted by major search engines.

One is expecting a major change in content when one submits a
form, so one of the main reasons for avoiding popups doesn't apply.
