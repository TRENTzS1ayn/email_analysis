Hi Suzanne

not sure where to look for a job. But for more info on browsers you might
like to look at "Alternative Web BRowsing" at
http://www.w3.org/WAI/References/Browsing (Note that it is a bit out of date
- there is a demonstration version of EIAD now available.)

As well as browsers, there are systems that people use for their whole
computer. Eyeball tracking is one of those (others include all kinds of
input devices - speech, specialised keyboards of different types, etc. Some
of this stuff can be done in software, and there are free versions of some of
it (for example, I use a half-keyboard on my macintosh that is a free
product, and a talking keyboard that is too. I got them via a download site
called tucows - http://www.tucows.com where accessibility things are listed
as a category of educational software - go figure.

Cheers

  Hi.  I'm still on my quest for 'free to developers'
  alternative browsers.  (or at least free for a trial
  period)  I loaded Jaws and got it to work, and it
  seemed very nice, and reliable, but I have nothing to
  compare it to and I'm sure there are other browsers
  out there.

  I have heard about 'eyeball browsers' (at least that's
  what a Human Factors engineer called them) where the
  movement of the eye is detected.  Has anyone heard
  about these and/or know about developing for them?

  What other browser types are there, besides, voice
  synthesizer types (like Jaws), Mainstream (like IE),
  and the eyeball browsers?

  Also, I'm job hunting, where would I find job listings
  for web developers with an interest in creating
  accessible sites?

  Thanks for your help,
