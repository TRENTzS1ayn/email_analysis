I am new to the list and Web Compliance. 

I am trying to find out what the feeling is toward online forms...that is,
forms that can be filled out online. 

I don't see any reference to forms in the information I have read. 

Are these a No No, or does it depend on how they are presented?

Thanks for any information on this subject.
