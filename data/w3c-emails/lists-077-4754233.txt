My recent studies show an ignorance of accessibility and usability in
most published books addressing preparation of materials for the internet.
These affect the means for learning about or training for web accessibility 
and usability. See:

     www.tiac.net/users/bingham/accessbl/softpro.htm   15946 bytes
         (covered in 39, ignored in 314 of 353 from Softpro Books)
     www.tiac.net/users/bingham/accessbl/quantum.htm    6744 bytes
         (covered in 10, ignored  in 128 of 138 from Quantum Books)

I propose these results justify a significant education and outreach
task.
