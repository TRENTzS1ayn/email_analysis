Hi All,

You could try using a spacer image and then put your message in the alt
text. I don't know how that will behave in the screenreader but it may help
get around the problem with the search engine.

This will show up on any device that cannot display colours or
doesn't understand the styling used to set the colours.  It is
a known trick for stuffing keywords for search engines and may
result in the site being boycotted by major search engines.

One is expecting a major change in content when one submits a
form, so one of the main reasons for avoiding popups doesn't apply.
