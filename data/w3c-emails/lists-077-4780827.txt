Perhaps not, since putting spider-bait in alt attributes is just as
old a search-engine as hiding stuff using colour.

On the other hand there isn't really anyway I can think of for
spiders to know whether they are being baited unless there is a lot
of repetition of words other than "a", "the", etc.

Spider-baiting in itself is quite a problem for users of text,
whether sighted text-only users or users of enabling technologies.
I've quite often come across sites with little for a text-only user
to read but the keywords they want to be listed over repeated 50
times.
