May I add the following from personal experience:
I wrote an eBook in 1998/9 on HTML, CSS, XHTML with reference to WAI and
strictly following the W3C recommendations. The eBook is used successfully in
training - both private colleges and university. When I contacted publishers for
a paper-based version, nobody was interested.
The eBook is still available - although it now needs a good revision. It
consists of more than 800 HTML files with about 50'000 links, with hundreds of
examples of what is supposed to happen as opposed to what does happen (ie
browser interpretation).
Regards
Jacques
