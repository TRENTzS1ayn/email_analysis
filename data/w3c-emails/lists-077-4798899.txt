I did some editing of a couple of chapters for a book called "How to Program
in XML" or something like that. Although it didn't have accessibility as the
overriding concern they were interested in comments on it (specifically
requested it) and a number of accessibility things did get included. (I was
looking at the chapters on CSS and HTML - I don't know how much got into the
later stuff on XML).

I know that other ublishers have approached accessibility people looking for
at least a bit of accessibility review.

Cheers

Charles

  May I add the following from personal experience:
  I wrote an eBook in 1998/9 on HTML, CSS, XHTML with reference to WAI and
  strictly following the W3C recommendations. The eBook is used successfully in
  training - both private colleges and university. When I contacted publishers for
  a paper-based version, nobody was interested.
  The eBook is still available - although it now needs a good revision. It
  consists of more than 800 HTML files with about 50'000 links, with hundreds of
  examples of what is supposed to happen as opposed to what does happen (ie
  browser interpretation).
