I tech edited an XHTML book last year and the author was very interested
in issues of accessibility, and was glad each time I pointed out a
snippet of code where the <img> tag lacked alt attributes.

I don't think it's as dismal a situation as many people think, and I
believe that most authors _are_ receptive of accessibility issues.  The
idea that they will all be mercenary and say "we only do what is
commercially viable" is far too cynical; most web book authors are
_not_ commercial web mercenaries, but are rather semi-jaded idealists
who like to learn, teach, and write.

My point is that they are our allies, not our enemies.  I will see what
I can do about following up on my contacts within those communities and
raising awareness of accessibility issues.
