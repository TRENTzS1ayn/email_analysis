Given that you shouldn't be using images of text, you will
need a text version unless the image is a universally recognized
icon (these are extremely rare as images in real web sites).

If you are foregoing a high level of compliance and using text
as images, you will need a text link if the text in the image
is not in a clean font with good colour contrasts.
