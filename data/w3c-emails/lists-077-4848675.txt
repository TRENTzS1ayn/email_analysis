Right - for level A conformance it's fine, but for higher levels you should
not be using images of text (contravenes checkpoint 3.1

  Given that you shouldn't be using images of text, you will
  need a text version unless the image is a universally recognized
  icon (these are extremely rare as images in real web sites).

  If you are foregoing a high level of compliance and using text
  as images, you will need a text link if the text in the image
  is not in a clean font with good colour contrasts.
