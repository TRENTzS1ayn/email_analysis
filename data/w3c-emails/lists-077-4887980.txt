Hi --

Adobe officially announced the release of Acrobat 5.0. The complete press
release and product description can be found at:
http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/main.html and additional information
at: http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/solutionsacc.html

I've extracted the information concerning Acrobat and PDF accessibility
below:


Make Documents Accessible

Acrobat 5.0 software lets you create Adobe PDF documents that are accessible
to those with disabilities.

Support for high- contrast- Acrobat fully supports high- contrast settings,
which enable workers with low vision impairments to more easily read Adobe
PDF documents.

Support for screen readers- Acrobat 5.0 lets you create documents that are
compatible with third- party, Windows- based screen readers, such as Henter-
Joyce's JAWS and Window- Eyes from GW Micro, Inc. Screen readers synthesize
text into speech.

Keyboard shortcuts- Acrobat Reader software enables functionality to be
controlled through keyboard shortcuts, making it easier for people with a
broad range of disabilities to take full advantage of Acrobat.

Regards,

Mike
