Surprise, surprise: I have signed a contract with New Riders to write 
a book on the topic of Web accessibility. Title undetermined. Due out 
in October, assuming I keep up with the not-unaggressive writing 
schedule.

I've got an entirely new approach to teaching accessibility. Any 
developer, of any level of expertise and with any budget (including 
none), can learn new techniques. And will also learn what doesn't 
work in the real world. Expect a few trees to be shaken, and don't be 
surprised if some of the coconuts hitting the ground carry W3C 
labels. (Kidding. Kidding!)

More news as it happens. <http://www.joeclark.org/book/> is the 
homepage. I expect to maintain an entire Weblog on the whole process, 
assuming I can produce a design that isn't total shite.
