I'm not aware of any tool that supports this functionality.

My opinion is that we need to approach the creation of accessible PDF
documents the same way we did in the documentation publishing industry --
and that is simply to insure that every image contains an associated
caption, label, or title. In situations where the image requires additional
explanation, then an appropriate longer description should be contained
within the surrounding text. This places the responsibility on the writer,
the rightful owner.

When we created ICADD several years ago, we included an element called
<FIGDESC> for this very purpose. That element is part of the ICADD-22 DTD
which itself is part of the American Association of Publishers DTD for
creating books of any form.

We allowed for the possibility that writers and editor might not include
<figdesc> and the required explanation. As a result, specific instructions
to braille transcribers are included within the DTD.
