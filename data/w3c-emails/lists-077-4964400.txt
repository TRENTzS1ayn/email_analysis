My Espanol is pretty weak (20+ years since my high school classes) so I
can't offer a content critique, but I would request that you use the charset
declaration. I'm in Japan and work in a bilingual environment
(Japanese/English) and often find Kanji characters in the middle of
non-Japanese text. It's easy enough for me personally to switch character
set in my browser, but it's even easier for authors to declare it. I think
it's good practice.
