Hi everyone --

For my online class in Accessible Web Design (taught through the
HTML Writers Guild), I'm looking for people who would have an
interest in being an "invited expert" for one class "session".

Basically, the way it works is that each week of the seven-week
course focuses on a different topic, as listed on the info web 
site at http://access.idyllmtn.com/d201/#syllabus .

As part of each week, in addition to the reading assignments,
project assignments, review questions, and other class activities,
I would like to invite (at least) one "expert" per week -- meaning
someone who has experience with the subject matter -- to come in,
post a short (maybe half a dozen paragraphs) "essay lecture", and
be available to discuss the topic and answer student questions
on that essay by logging back on at least one more time during
the week.

You won't be expected to teach the class -- that's my job and
Liz's job.  You won't be expected to answer OTHER questions or
to grade people, track students, monitor the classroom, etc.  You
just have to give a perspective that's uniquely yours, so that
my students can get a broader view of the subject matter than
just the items in the textbooks and the answers I provide.

Please note that I am asking for -volunteers-, and that I myself
get paid for teaching the course (and the students pay $50 or
$80 enrollment) -- so I'm asking you to do a little free work, and
all I can offer is my gratitude.  If this bothers you, please do
not write to me. :)

However, after all that, if you are interested in sharing your
thoughts on one of the seven topics listed in the syllabus, please
send me email at kynn@kynn.com.  Thanks!

--Kynn
