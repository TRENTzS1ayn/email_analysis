seems like there is a lot of adobe page mill stuff going on here to me.
Tables for wonders what and jfw will not access it hardly at all but yet
there are lots of html only forms on the web that it does fine with.

Hi.

I am working with a friend of mine to improve visually-impaired
accessibility of WWW pages under my domain and he suggested that I
submit this question to you.  He's using JAWS as his reader and a
member of this support group.  I am copying to him on this query.

My question deals with JAWS' ability to read forms.  He's able to
successfully navigate a javascript-based form on another homepage
(see http://www.wistv.com/Global/Category.asp?c=2470 for a link to
form he can use) but unable to deal with a straight html-based form
on my server (see
http://chemistry.clemson.edu/chemdocs/apps/domesticapp.html for one
of mine).  Is there any special encoding I should be aware of to make
MY page readable to him, or is JAWS limited to javascript?

He will forward replies to me or I would be glad to hear directly.

Thanks.

-Dave
