I would like to provide a 'skip navigation' link at the top of a page, yet
want it to be as unobtrusive as possible. I know that making the font color
the same as the background color is a no-no due to the the current crop of
paranoid search engines thinking we are trying to fool them. 

Is it, however, acceptable to make the link text extremely small (using CSS
of course) so that it is actually almost invisible and include a link title
saying 'jump to main text' or some such? Here is an example of what I mean
(work in progess):

If not, can anyone suggest a better solution?

Thanks
