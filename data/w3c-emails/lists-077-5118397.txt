Of course I am sure someone on the list will recommend the best way to do 
it...but I figured I would take a guess. 

what about if the link had the appearance of no text such as an underscore

[ _ ] nzhistory / governor / other /

maybe just to save space you could use an underscore and in the href itself 
use the title attribute

[<a href="#bypass_navigation" title="Use this link to bypass the navigation"> 
_ </a>]

could also place in a map and include the name attribute too...

Let me know what you come up with because it is obvious that I need that same 
question answered.

I would like to provide a 'skip navigation' link at the top of a page, yet
want it to be as unobtrusive as possible. I know that making the font color
the same as the background color is a no-no due to the the current crop of
paranoid search engines thinking we are trying to fool them. 

Is it, however, acceptable to make the link text extremely small (using CSS
of course) so that it is actually almost invisible and include a link title
saying 'jump to main text' or some such? Here is an example of what I mean
(work in progess):

If not, can anyone suggest a better solution?
