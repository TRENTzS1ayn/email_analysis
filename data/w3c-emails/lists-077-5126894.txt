Jamie,

The skip navigation you have provided is great, the same technique as
www.acb.org, the first site I know of with a skip navigation link. I don't
understand your worry about search engines. Will they ignore you because you
have white on white (ala www.firstgov.gov) or black on black ala
www.assistivetech.net? Another easy option is pick a small invisible gif in
an Anchor tag in front of NZHistory with alt text "skip navigation," and the
obvious target. Lots of examples of this like www.ibm.com and www.cnn.com.
Good work.

Subject: Skipping navigation tactics


I would like to provide a 'skip navigation' link at the top of a page, yet
want it to be as unobtrusive as possible. I know that making the font color
the same as the background color is a no-no due to the the current crop of
paranoid search engines thinking we are trying to fool them.

Is it, however, acceptable to make the link text extremely small (using CSS
of course) so that it is actually almost invisible and include a link title
saying 'jump to main text' or some such? Here is an example of what I mean
(work in progess):

If not, can anyone suggest a better solution?

Thanks
