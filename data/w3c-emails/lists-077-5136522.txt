Two techniques I found most effective and with little visual impact.

First the single pixel gif with the appropriate alt attribute:
<A href="#content">
<img src="nada.gif" height="1" width="1" alt="Jump past all these repetitive
links">
</A>
This is easy to implement, has little impact on the page, and has been
around since the dawn of HTML.

Another easy solution is to take the first image on the page, normally an
icon in the upper-left hand corner, and have it link to the content.  I
think this makes a good use of the logo (e.g. www.ssbtechnologies.com) and
relieves the user from having to hear "Company Name" on every single page.
The one exception to this might be the home page, where you let alt="Welcome
to company name.  In the future follow this link to jump directly to the
content of a page bypassing the navbar."

Hope that helps-

Subject: Skipping navigation tactics


I would like to provide a 'skip navigation' link at the top of a page, yet
want it to be as unobtrusive as possible. I know that making the font color
the same as the background color is a no-no due to the the current crop of
paranoid search engines thinking we are trying to fool them.

Is it, however, acceptable to make the link text extremely small (using CSS
of course) so that it is actually almost invisible and include a link title
saying 'jump to main text' or some such? Here is an example of what I mean
(work in progess):

If not, can anyone suggest a better solution?
