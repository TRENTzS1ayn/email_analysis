  Two techniques I found most effective and with little visual impact.

  First the single pixel gif with the appropriate alt attribute:
  <A href="#content">
  <img src="nada.gif" height="1" width="1" alt="Jump past all these repetitive
  links">
  </A>
  This is easy to implement, has little impact on the page, and has been
  around since the dawn of HTML.

CMN THis works for me, since I use a browser that lets me know what the alt
is (actually I normally use a visual browser, but with keyboard control). I
am not sure if it is still a problem for people - it is mostly orientation
(knowing that you hit a link that you didn't see anywhere).

Tim again:

  Another easy solution is to take the first image on the page, normally an
  icon in the upper-left hand corner, and have it link to the content.  I
  think this makes a good use of the logo (e.g. www.ssbtechnologies.com) and
  relieves the user from having to hear "Company Name" on every single page.
  The one exception to this might be the home page, where you let alt="Welcome
  to company name.  In the future follow this link to jump directly to the
  content of a page bypassing the navbar."

CMN Not sure. Using this visually I would get confused - I expect something
that looks the same to do the same thing (which it does) but I also expect
the logo to be the link to the company, i.e. the front page. This is by
convention, but it is one of the conventions I rely on more than any other on
the web - even more than standard link presentation.

  Is it, however, acceptable to make the link text extremely small (using CSS
  of course) so that it is actually almost invisible and include a link title
  saying 'jump to main text' or some such? Here is an example of what I mean
  (work in progess):

  If not, can anyone suggest a better solution?

CMN This is kind of like the image solution proposed by Tim above, except
easier to have it not apply. (Another reason why constraint-based CSS was a
cool idea.)
