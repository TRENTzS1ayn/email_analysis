If this is a typical table layout, are you aware of the this tactic:

<table..>
<tr><td>...logo....
    <td rowspan=2>..... real contents ......
<tr><td>....Left hand navigation .....

This meets linearised reading order guidelines, whereas skip links don't.

If it weren't for NS4, positioned divisions would be better.
