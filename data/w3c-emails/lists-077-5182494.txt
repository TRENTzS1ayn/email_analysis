Personally I'm more in favor of the first of these two options.  It
associates specific information with the action that will be taken.

The second option requires that the user remember that on a site that's
what the company name link will do.  This is far less obvious, especially
if a user doesn't enter from the front page where this action might be the
only place it is spelled out.
