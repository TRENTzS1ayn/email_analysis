I wonder if hiding the "skip links" from graphic browsers--which I've done
on a couple of sites with the invisible gif trick--is really a good idea.
I'm starting to have second and third thoughts about it. What about folks
who can't use a mouse? Isn't the "skip links" useful for them?

Just wondering...
