WebABLE launches first-of-its-kind technology to make Web content
accessible to
people with disabilities.

New system provides immediate solution for Section 508 compliance.

BOSTON, MA   March 20, 2001 -- WebABLE (www.webable.com) the world's
premier
developer of accessible Web infrastructure and emerging software
technologies
that enhance the lives of people with disabilities announced today the
launch
of the WebABLE Enhanced Accessibility Personalization System that will
dynamically convert Web content into a format accessible to people with
disabilities.

This first-of-its kind ASP provides an immediate solution for Web
publishers
needing to comply with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act.  Section
508
of
the Rehabilitation Act states that all Federal agencies' electronic and
information technology must be accessible to people with disabilities
by
June
2001. Faced with the fast approaching federally mandated section 508
accessibility deadline, one web master said that the concept of an
accessibility ASP service is the only way to truly resolve the problem
of
web
and internet accessibility and is the only solution for a web site to
become
accessible and to maintain accessibility as new content is added.


"Our goal is to create an application server environment that performs
personalization on-the-fly for people with disabilities," said WebABLE
founder
and chief technology officer Mike Paciello. When any Web page is
accessed
through WebABLE's Enhanced Accessibility Personalization System, that
page
is
automatically converted to a format that is accessible to people with
disabilities. The WebABLE service will allow government agencies and
businesses
to dynamically deliver accessible content to users with disabilities
without
having to re-create or re-design their Web sites thus ensuring Section
508
compliance."  WebABLE plans to use Reef EveryWare as a core component
of its
system.

Over 50 million Americans today live with disabilities. Due to
technological
obstacles, many of these people are blocked from information services
and
products provided through the web and Internet. Government agencies,
businesses
and organizations that look for a presence in the global; digital
economy
can
not afford to ignore the importance of e-accessibility.

WebABLE through its new Enhanced Accessibility Personalization System
and
its
traditional consulting services addresses all e-accessibility
challenges
faced
by a wide range of industries from government agencies, banking and
financial
services, to manufacturing and health care.
