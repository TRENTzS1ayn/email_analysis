These are all good questions.

We contacted Barnes and Noble, but they never responded. I plan on trying
again. I'd kind of like for them to see for themselves what their site looks
like in an accessible format.

Your recommendation is a good one for the skip nav links.

The accessibility fixes themselves took about 20-30 minutes. However, it
took me a couple of hours to make their HTML valid and to tweak the layout
once the code was valid. Most of the accessibility errors (maybe 85%) were
inside of areas that are probably templated, so once these areas are fixed,
there would be no need to spend that same amount of time fixing every page.
(I'm sure that this is what your question is hinting at.) Barnes and Noble
could fix their template in a couple of hours, then they could let the
individual content editors enter in the alt tags and other attributes, which
would amount to an extra 30 seconds or so per book (or per CD, or whatever
else that they're putting into the database).

I guess the conclusion is that once you fix the template, the rest is
relatively easy.

Of course, I didn't push the limits of accessibility with my B&N makeover.
It isn't triple-A compliant, but it is much more accessible than it used to
be. I'd say it's somewhere near Double-A compliant.
