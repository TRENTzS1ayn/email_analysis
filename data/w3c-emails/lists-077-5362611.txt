One of my main goals was to ensure that I didn't change the 
look and feel of the site too drastically. That was my main 
consideration for not converting the graphics into text. 
However, after taking another look at those graphics, I 
think that I could probably convert them into a font 
without too much trouble, and without sacrificing the look 
and feel. I may decide to do this at some point, but 
probably not right away (I have some other documents that I 
need to prepare for the web). It is a valid concern, and 
you're right, it is a priority 3 violation. I wasn't trying 
to make a priority 3 compliant document, but with a little 
effort I probably could get closer by converting the main 
tabs on top into text.
