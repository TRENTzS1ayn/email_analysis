Hello,

Below is a copy of email sent on 27 March to the W3C chairs 
mailing list as part of scheduling a third last call
review of the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0.

--------------------------------------------------------
Original message follows, with Member-only links removed.
---------------------------------------------------------

This message is an early request to help the User Agent
Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (UAWG) schedule its third
last call for the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0. The
UAWG has not yet decided to return to last call, but we are very
close, and I would like to get a jump on scheduling the review.

While we will welcome review from all interested groups, we
request review specifically from the following groups:

  Protocols and Formats WG
  Web Content Accessibility Guidelines WG
  Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines WG
  CSS/FP WG
  DOM WG
  HTML WG
  Internationalization WG/IG
  Mobile Access 
  SYMM WG
  Voice Browser WG

Please indicate your commitment to review the document and, if
so, whether either or both of the following three-week review
periods fit your schedules:

  10 April 2001 - 1 May 2001
  17 April 2001 - 8 May 2001

The W3C Advisory Committee meeting is scheduled for 30 April - 1
May (in Hong Kong), and WWW10 is scheduled for 1 - 5 May. I
recognize that these scheduled meetings may make it more
difficult for you to schedule a review. But then again, they may
not.

DEADLINE: 5 April 2001

By 5 April, please send email to w3c-wai-ua@w3.org 
(archives publicly visible) indicating your commitment to review 
the upcoming last call document and your preferred review period. 
If neither review period works for you because of the meetings 
in Hong Kong, please let us know. Even if you don't intend
to review the document, we request a reply stating this.

Thank you,

 - Ian
