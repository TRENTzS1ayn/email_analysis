A new book on Web accessibility

It isn't much to look at right now, but you are reading the homepage 
for my new book on Web accessibility, to be published by New Riders 
in October 2001.

I just signed the contract on Friday and have only now begun writing 
the damn thing, so days are still early. What's the title? There are 
a few contenders up in the air. What's the focus? Teaching 
developers, of any sophistication and working with any kind of budget 
(including none), how to improve the accessibility of online media.

Give me a week or so to firm up details and check back here. Later, 
you can start reading the Bookblog regularly: I'll be starting up a 
whole new Weblog on the book-writing process. (No link yet.)

Join in the fun.
