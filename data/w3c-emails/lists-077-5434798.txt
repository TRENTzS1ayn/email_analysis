I was just reading over messages Online.  I have been trying to find a way to 
use a longdesc or an Alt tag to list a paragraph of information.  The idea is 
that if the user has there images turned off they can still read the text 
presented.  My problems have consisted of one long line of text in the NAV 
4.75.  Please if you could help me it would be well appreciated. 

Sincerely,
