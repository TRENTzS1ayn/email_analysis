The reality is, unless the request gets to board level, as might happen
if there was a threat of legal action, accessiblity changes don't get made

requirement.

I agree entirely. But I think that the point of Paul's makeovers is to help
convince those still hesitant about accessibility because they think it will
tie their hands aesthetically. I doubt that he expects to sell Barnes &
Noble on the changes (not that it wouldn't be nice) - he can't even get a
reply out of them.

There are many up-and-coming developers, however, who - unfortunately - look
at sites like the B&N site as standards by which to measure their own
efforts. It can do nothing but good to show that these sites can be equally
attractive and still be "accessible" to (though not, as Kynn points out,
optimized for) people with disabilities.
