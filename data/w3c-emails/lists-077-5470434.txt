Opinion, but a relatively informed one.  There's precious little
research on this particular topic -- I don't know of any usability
studies of screenreader users using "accessible" web designs
(compared with them using "inaccessible" designs or with
user-centric dynamic web interfaces).

Now, if one of you enterprising research geniuses out there wants
to work on this, I'll be glad to contribute as much help as my
schedule allows!
