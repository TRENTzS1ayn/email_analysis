Yep, I think in such a crazy scenario there are only crazy answers, and I
would put the text into alt text. Alternatively you could summarise - it
depends how relevant the message is in the first place <grin/>

Well, actuallly I would just change it to real text and be done with it, but
I am fairly tough as a contractor - my rate increases 20-fold to do things
that I think are crazy, although even then I have had people pay it. <sigh/>

cheers

  Here is a scenario I am currently grappling with. I am 'fixing' a
  website for a company that has the entire front page rendered as images
  (without any alt text!). One of the images is simply a text welcome
  message about 40 words long. Once the site has been properly redesigned
  of course this text will be rendered as, well, text. But in the
  meantime, as a short-term fix, I have provided a 'D' link which spells
  out the text in the 'welcome' image.

  My question is, would this be a situation where it might be 'better'
  just to write the text contained in the image as alt text? Are there any
  other situations where longer alt text can be justified?
