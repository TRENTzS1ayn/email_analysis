It seems that Adobe Acrobat 5.0 will preserve Alt text associated with images under some circumstances and not others. It can also be used to manually add Alt text. Here's what Adobe Tech Support said in July of 2001: 

". . . I don't believe that the Alt text will be preserved if you pass through the PS file stage on the way to making a PDF. Instead, you can use WebCapture (File > Open Web Page in Acrobat 5.0) which will preserve Alt text when converting HTML to PDF. Alt text can also be carried across from Word 2000 files which have been converted to PDF using PDFMaker 5.0 (a macro which comes with Acrobat 5.0). Acrobat 5.0 can also be used to manually enter Alt text (using the Tags palette). " 

I found this document on the Adobe site to be helpful in regard to Acrobat 5.0 and accessibility: http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/pdfs/Sect_5085.pdf

I found this document on the WebAIM site to be a good intro to D-links, but an intro may not suit your needs:  http://www.webaim.org/howto/graphics2f
