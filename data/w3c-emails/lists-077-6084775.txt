If search engines are a concern with the  site you are working on, I've 
read, but unfortunately can't find the citation, that we should keep alto 
text to no more than 5-7 words, because longer ones "confuse" some search 
engines (some of them do index the alt text).

Also, if they are wider than the size of the image, they don't show up on 
the screen when the graphic is loading or if the graphics are turned off in 
Netscape 4+, though they do in N3 and IE.
