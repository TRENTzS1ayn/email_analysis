This is browser dependent, and for GUI browsers should follow the 
host operating environment's user interface guidelines.  For
Windows 98, it is the space bar once the control has focus, and the
tab key to give focus.

Alt is operating system and hardware dependent; only PCs normally have
ALT keys.  It is also potentially browser dependent.

If the wording was purely for this posting, I would argue that focus and
textbox are programmers' terms, not users' terms.
