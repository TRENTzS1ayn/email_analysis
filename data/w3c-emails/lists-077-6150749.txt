As a partial answer to your question, you may want to refer to an article
written by Jeff Isom of WebAIM entitled "To Embed or Not To Embed - A
Comparison of Media Player Technologies ". This can at least help you with
the technicalities of the accessibility of the actual plug-ins that handle
the audio. You can find the article at:
