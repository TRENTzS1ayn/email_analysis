Assuming it's coded sensibly, it's roughly neutral, but tends to be more
of a "help" than a "hindrance".  It's usually true that most users with
special needs have assistive technology, but not always.  There are certain
user groups -- e.g. people who can't read as well -- who could benefit
from what you describe.

The whole trick is in the "coding sensibly" caveat. ;)
