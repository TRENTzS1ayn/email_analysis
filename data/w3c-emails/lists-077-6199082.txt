It's even good for blind folk under certain circumstances.  those who
have other print disabilities in some instances can be reinsforced by
this as they read the page highlight or not.

I won't claim to be an expert but would be interested in hearing the
opinions of those with more professional/experiential backgrounds in the
areas of folks who can't read the text for reasons other than blindness.
The biggest thing folks in this category have told me is that they want
the text highlighted as it is read.

Do folks think this sort of audio reading would be good for a portal as
was original described I believe or for longer narrative texts.
