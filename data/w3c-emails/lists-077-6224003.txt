That's my main thought -- especially if you are able to deliver a
diverse multitude of user interfaces (oops, I sound like a Reef ad
again!), then you don't want to throw away ANY techniques which
could conceivably help _someone_.

You might throw them away based on cost or ROI issues, of course,
but that's a different topic and wasn't -- I believe -- the question
asked here?
