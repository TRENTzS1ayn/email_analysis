I am an engineer over 50 who has used a computer for over 30 years and in
recent years I was having more and more problems.
 well diagnosed with ADD at over 50 years old.  BUT graphics enviorenment

BTW, I use PINE as my e-mail client and LYNX as my browser.
still run either MSDOS or LINUX, and occasionall UNIX  (don't do windoz or
macs).
