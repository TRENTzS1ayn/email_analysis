This would be helpful for a lot of folks on any kind of text. It is the link
between the spoken form and the written form that makes the difference.

When teaching kids to read a common strategy is to follow the words with a
finger, to reinforce the connection between something they half-understand
(the text) and something they may understand better, such as voice.

Interesting(?) aside: Reading silently is a fairly modern invention. Medieval
scriptioria (where books were copied by hand) were proably not the silent
places we imagine, as monks would typically read aloud for the same reasons
(although not at full volume necessarily <grin/>).

  Do folks think this sort of audio reading would be good for a portal as
