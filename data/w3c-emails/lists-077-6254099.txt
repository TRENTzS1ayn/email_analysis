I am sympathetic to Bob's point of view, and so I use PINE and LYNX mostly
too, although I also use graphical browsers and WYSIWYG editors (I hate
reading source code because I get lost in too many characters at the same
time that aren't relevant to me).

It makes well-designed accessible media-rich sites into simple text sites
without distractions, which suits me fine. (If only there were more of them)

cheers

  BTW, I use PINE as my e-mail client and LYNX as my browser.
  still run either MSDOS or LINUX, and occasionall UNIX  (don't do windoz or
