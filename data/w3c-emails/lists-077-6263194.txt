Nope, you're doing stuff right except assuming that alt+key makes accesskey
work - for example on Amaya it is usually some other modifier, and for iCab
the key on its own is used (and activates the link it is attached to - this
is according to specification, which was a bit vague on whether it was a good
idea...). (iCab actually shows the accesskeys itself, as any sensible
implementation would enable, for example by using CSS.

There is a key to select checkboxes and radio buttons - in Netscape I think
it is space but I am not sure.

  Hi--

  I'm trying to make my forms accessible, but I can't figure out how to make
  the radio buttons and checkboxes keyboard-accessible.  I've tried the
  accesskey feature, but that technique doesn't work in Netscape 4.7 (example
  is at
  http://158.72.80.241/development/HelpDesk/home_version/testAccess.htm).

  What am I doing wrong?  Do I need an accesskey, or is there a keyboard
  command to select form items that I don't know about?


  Here's the source code:

  <HTML>
  <HEAD>
  <META NAME="GENERATOR" Content="Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0">
  <TITLE></TITLE>
  </HEAD>
  <BODY>
  <form>
  <label for='text1' accesskey="1">
  Press Alt+1 to set focus to the textbox.
  <P><INPUT id=text1 name=text1 tabindex='1' size="20"
  maxlength="20"></label></P>

  <p>
  <label for='radio1' accesskey="2">
  Press Alt+2 to set focus to the radio button.
  <INPUT type="radio" id=radio1 name=radio1 tabindex='2'></label></p>
