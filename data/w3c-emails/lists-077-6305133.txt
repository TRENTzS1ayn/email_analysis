Well, there was some work by the Web Characterisation Activity in W3C, who
produced a glossary draft that attempted to define some of this stuff, but
I guess W3C members decided that they weren't keen on that piece of work, and
the activity is no longer happening.

As far as I can see it doesn't fall in the scope of WAI work. When there was
a Web Characterisation Activity we were intersted in its work, but it doesn't
have big direct relationship to accessibility that I can see - it is a
broader activity than that.

Cheers

Charles

  Thanks Charles.  I was aware of the EARL work, and it has some
  relevance. However although it will allow you to make statements such as
  "The entry point is 50K which is within the x guidelines" in a
  machinereadable way, the meaning of the size of a page does not yet
  appear to be defined anywhere - i.e. does it mean the orgin of a
  redirect page, the destination, or the sum; what does it mean if
  user-agent content negotiation occurs; etc.

  I'm not sure who should be involved in this work.  Is it within scope of
  the WAI group?  If not, is there any work going on in, say, the Web
  auditing communities - I know there is some standarisation work going on
  in that community.

  Thanks
