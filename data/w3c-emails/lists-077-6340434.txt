There is a question of business justice, here.? It is not fair to rely on the
free Web-interactive services such as Bobby at CAST for survey purposes.? 

Bulk work such as surveys should be performed with resources provided by the
activity doing the survey.? This is partly where our clunky 'robot control'
system came from.? There have been problems with U.S. activities bringing the
free over-the-Web Bobby service to its knees in a de_facto denial-of-service
attack by putting production loads on the web-published service.  Use the free
service for samples, please.  Not for surveys or other production runs.

Those who wish to survey should reasonably expect to pay.  There is no excuse
for assuming that people will render you great gobs of service for free.  That
which is appropriately _de rien_ is in the eye of the service provider, not
receiver.
