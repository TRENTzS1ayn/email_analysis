Interesting point.

At the last W3C AC meeting I suggested that W3C should flag their
various services (e.g. HTML and CSS validation, XSLT transformation
services, etc.) as to whether they were intended from production use or
as pilots.  I don't think that's been addressed yet.

I don't think you can say that just because something is for free, it
shouldn't be used intensively - the open source lobby won't like you for
saying that!

Also the services are funded somewhere - and it may be that the funding
is to provide a global service.  This is the case for W3C's validation
services.

Other free services may encourage survey use, if it increases traffic to
their site, and therefore advertising revenue.

So I would say it was for the service provider to define their usage
conditions.

Note we should propably distinugush between automated use by programs,
and embedded URLs which are initiated by humans.  I was referring to the
latter use - e.g. see <http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue28/web-watch/>.
