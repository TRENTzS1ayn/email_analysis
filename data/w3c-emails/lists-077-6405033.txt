Regarding EARL, there's been an activity at the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) on developing an Industry USability
Reporting (IUSR).  There could be some interesting synergy between these
activities.   Currently, IUSR has an open comment period until Sept. 10 on
a standards proposal through National Committee for Information Technology
Standards (NCITS):

Thanks for your message Al.  Excellent points as always!

I'm involved in some related work - statistics for measuring use of
e-journals, in which you the publishers wish to agree on standards for
filtering hits from robots, double clicks in a short period, etc.

I've been looking for bodies involved in standardisation in this area.
I've found two main bodies - the Advertising Community and the Auditing
Community.

Links to resources in this area are available at:
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/usage-processing/links

The following seem to be the main standards bodies.  However it can be
difficult to tell just be looking at Web sites how authorative and
international they are.

ABCE's definitions

IAB UK's definitions
Definitions of advertising impressions and insertions

Ireland) home page
