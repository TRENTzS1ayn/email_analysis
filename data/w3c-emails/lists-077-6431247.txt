Hello All-

We are always interested in reviews of our applications, however we
recommend that people try the software for themselves and look for all
reviews.

Here are two others reviews of HiSoftware products, AccRepair and
AccMonitor:

Hi. This might interest some of you. I found reviews for two products on
HiSoftware AccRepair and SSB Technologies InSight 4.0 and InFocus 4.0.
Both didn't get high scores. Here's the URL:
