FYI.  We, at NIST, have been following the development of EARL and are going to 
try a couple of examples of the output of our WebSAT tool ( that does some 
usability checking) represented in EARL   The Common Industry Format for 
Reporting on User Tests (from the IUSR project, another project in my group) is 
a format for report on testing that a usability engineer does with users, not 
for automated checking, so the format contains information such as the user 
demographics, the tasks, the metrics (such as time on task, and number of 
errors), the data collected about these metrics,etc.  So, the CIF reports more 
on the process and data analysis from testing with users.  You can read more 
about it at http://www.nist.gov/iusr  and please feel free to email us for more 
info. on the CIF.  I'm not sure what the synergy would be except that something 
analogous could be build to report on testing for accessibility, but to report 
on the output of automated tools testing, say 508, would be very different that 
anything in the CIF.  Sharon
