I found this article very informative, even though it deals more with why not to make mailto: the action of a form. Many of the reasons apply to the topic at hand and echo the concerns raised.

Note particularly the failure of encoding a subject for the mailto messages. When it fails, it tends to do so in the worst way, in that the sender believes the mail was sent but the recipient does not get the mail or know that the message was lost (and remains ignorant that his/her form has this fatal flaw).

Regards,
