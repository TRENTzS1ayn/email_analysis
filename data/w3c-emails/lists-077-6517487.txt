The only reason why we are using an adjective in front of language is 
to avoid ambiguity with computer programming languages.

A case could be made that, on Web sites, nearly everyone will 
interpret "language" as "human language." We could then drop "human" 
or "natural" altogether.

But is it the case that, with media other than the Web, there would 
still be that kind of confusion?
