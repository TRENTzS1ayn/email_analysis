This is ear candy.  It's unlikely to meet the requirement of adding
understanding.  It's also sort of thing that a glossy site producer would
do without prompting if the perceived technical, financial and time
scale constraints permitted it.  By perceived technical constraints,
I include the need to use HTML; HTML was not designed as a multimedia
language and should only be used to link together true multimedia
(computer) lnaguages, where they are needed.

To a non-literate, user, the sound carries the message "might be a 
barbecue", whereas even a picture would carry the equivalent of many
words of much higher quality information (if it was a picture of the
event, not a stock picture).

I'd say the sizzling sound has more to do with maintainig the "viewer's"
attention and pure entertainment, than to actually communicating.  That
again is something that advertising agencies do without prompting.
