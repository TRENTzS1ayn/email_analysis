The problem with only linking to the content is that fails to achieve the
purpose of having the content there in the first place - to enable someone
who cannot easily understand a plain text page to have an idea of the main
topics of that page.

I recognise that there are concerns such as copyright and trademarking, and
in some areas (like where I live) of bandwidth. There are emerging
technologies in the area of the semantic Web that we should expect to use in
the medium term (several years before I imagine it being deployed in browsers
that have been spread into schools for example) which will provide much
easier techniques for doing this.

In the meantime, we are still struggling to get the principles in an agreed
explanation, so we may find the technology overtakes us in development pace.
Without agreed principles, or even well-expressed ones that are there as
straw-man proposals, we are several steps away from being ready to address
concerns of whether implementation details are so important as to negate the
principle.

(But I think we are making some progress, which is encouraging <grin/>)

cheers

  Why not a link to the performer's page - many of which have song samples on
  the page. That won't pose copyright concerns and will keep the page
  uncluttered. The first bullet in 3.4 allows us to "provide a graphic
  equivalent or link to content that contains a graphic equivalent". Can we
  specify linking to any alternative content - not just graphics?
