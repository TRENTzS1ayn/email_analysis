Right. I guess the thread got cross-posted somewhere, which is generally poor
list etiquette. In particular W3C mailing lists are archived, so if there is
one public archive it is helpful not to remove the discussion to a different
forum, but if relevant to provide a pointer in that other forum.

  My intent is not to exclude anyone on IG from participating -- after
  all, the WCAG archives are public -- but thought there was a specific
  working group mailing list for a reason.

  This is my long way of saying:  Let's use the right mailing lists,
