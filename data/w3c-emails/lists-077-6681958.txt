Our university faculty often want to use the same videos for their distance
learning courses that they use in face-to-face classes. Our multimedia
specialists can convert videos for streaming or CD-ROMs. They can even add
tracks for captions and audio description. One thing we're trying to figure
out, though, is how to get the captions and descriptions.

The things I've read from the Caption Center and from Joe Clark lead me to
believe that we need skilled professionals to describe and transcribe
videos.

Unfortunately, people here seem to think we should teach students to do
captions and audio descriptions. Other proposals include not allowing video
for distance learning courses at all, or only allowing faculty to use videos
that come captioned and described.

Does anyone know of schools that have faced this issue squarely and that
could serve as good examples for how to support accessibility for videos
used in distance learning classes?
