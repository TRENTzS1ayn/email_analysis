Hi, Jeff:

NCAM, based at WGBH, is currently working with MIT to make an on-line physics course accessible to blind, visually impaired, deaf and hard-of-hearing users.  The on-line course is called PIVoT (Physics Interactive Video Tutor) and contains hundreds of multimedia clips.  You can read about the project at

http://ncam.wgbh.org/webaccess/pivot/index.html

Read all the information here first and take a look at the multimedia clips, then visit the MIT PIVoT Web site at

http://curricula2.mit.edu/pivot/

MIT students are are writing all the captions and descriptions using MAGpie.  You can download your own free copy of the software from

http://ncam.wgbh.org/webaccess/magpie/

Let me know if you have further questions.
