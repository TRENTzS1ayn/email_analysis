Of course they do!  It's cheaper! :)

I suppose if they are dead-set against professional captioning, you
-could- pay for the skilled professionals to come in and provide
expert training on a periodic basis, to your underpaid student
workers.  It  -could- inspire some of them to further explore the
field and spark their own interests.  And that would mean more
audio description professionals in a few years...

Or, at least, one could always hope.
