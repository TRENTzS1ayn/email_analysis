I've never understood the attraction of PDF.
I am sighted (near 20-20 with glasses) have a good monitor, have good
muscular control of the mouse (enough to hold my own in a game of
Quake) and keyboard (touch-typist), and I still find PDFs to be
inaccessible!
Sure they print out nicely compared to many other formats, but they
are a pain to read online and the files are quite often coffee-files
(A file which gives you time to make a fresh pot of coffee while it
downloads).

In most cases the choice of PDF is just a plain bad decision before
you even begin to think about accessibility issues.

(Yes, there are times when PDF is suitable, I'm not looking for a
flame war :)
