Compliant to what?

As far as I know there are no screen readers that have access to Flash
objects, so the best that can be done is whatever is provided by the
alternative version of the content. I may be wrong, and I believe that
Macromedia are working on Flash so that new players will provide direct
access at some point and new content will be able to include the required
information for it to be accessible. But for timelines and so on you would
need to ask Macromedia.

cheers
