Dear All,
I thought that this link might help those with concerns about
accessibility and Flash.

http://www.macromedia.com/software/flash/productinfo/accessibility/

I am afraid that I know of no flash websites that offer accessible
content, which is a shame.

Hope this is of help
Sime

Compliant to what?

As far as I know there are no screen readers that have access to Flash
objects, so the best that can be done is whatever is provided by the
alternative version of the content. I may be wrong, and I believe that
Macromedia are working on Flash so that new players will provide direct
access at some point and new content will be able to include the
required
information for it to be accessible. But for timelines and so on you
would
need to ask Macromedia.

cheers
