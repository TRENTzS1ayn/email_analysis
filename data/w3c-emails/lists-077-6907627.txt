when i was at the united states mint, we had two programs for the
interactive maps, the 50 states quarters and golden dollar.  They used the
techniques where an ALT tag was generatd that described the object, which
was a map, as well as data fields option in that represented the
information.

Dear All,
I thought that this link might help those with concerns about
accessibility and Flash.

http://www.macromedia.com/software/flash/productinfo/accessibility/

I am afraid that I know of no flash websites that offer accessible
content, which is a shame.

Hope this is of help
Sime

Compliant to what?

As far as I know there are no screen readers that have access to Flash
objects, so the best that can be done is whatever is provided by the
alternative version of the content. I may be wrong, and I believe that
Macromedia are working on Flash so that new players will provide direct
access at some point and new content will be able to include the
required
information for it to be accessible. But for timelines and so on you
would
need to ask Macromedia.

cheers
