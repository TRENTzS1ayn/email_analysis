Hello Sime and all:

     Although the conversion link is a step in the right direction, post conversion assessment for accessibility is essential.  Instructions are easier to convert than the forms.
Try f1040.pdf  to see what I mean.  I found the resulting conversion completely incomprehensible. 
     Can anyone clarify Sec 508 paragraph M of 1194.22 on this?  Is it sufficient to provide a link to a plug-in or conversion link or is an alternative accessible version on the site required?  I would hope it is the latter.

Steve
