Interpretation of Section 508 is a legal question relevant to a particular
place, not a general accessibility question, and so is porbably off-topic for
this list.

Best place to ask for legal advice is a specialist legal advice service like
a lawyer or the relevant office of the relevant government. I am neither, and
will stay out of that bit.

There is an accessibility question implicit, which is whether a link to
another site that does conversions is the same as having the conversion done
on the original site.

As far as I can tell, a link is a link (although some of them go faster than
others) and so it doesn't make it a high-priority accessibility issue. The
big question as this applies to WCAG checkpoint 11.4 (my paraphrase: if after
best efforts you don't make your stuff accessible provide an accessible
version) is whether whatever you get from the link is in fact accessible - if
it isn't, then clearly it doesn't meet the checkpoint requirements.

If people are using this strategy then it is clearly important that they
check the results - assuming that an automatic service will do a good job
when one has no real control of it and one doesn't know how it does the job
can lead to making big mistakes.

  Hello Sime and all:

       Although the conversion link is a step in the right direction, post
  conversion assessment for accessibility is essential.  Instructions are
  easier to convert than the forms. Try f1040.pdf to see what I mean.  I
  found the resulting conversion completely incomprehensible.
       Can anyone clarify Sec 508 paragraph M of 1194.22 on this?  Is it
  sufficient to provide a link to a plug-in or conversion link or is an
  alternative accessible version on the site required?  I would hope it is
  the latter.
