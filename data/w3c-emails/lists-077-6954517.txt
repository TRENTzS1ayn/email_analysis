Well, I think you had two questions. The WCAG one is fair game for this list.
(Actually I think that part of it is an important question for this list and
the WCAG group). Interpreting laws is a whole different ball game, and while
it is a valid question there are better places to get the best answers.

I don't think you need to phrase it in terms of WCAG specifically, although I
tend to do that by instinct if I think that WCAG covers something well enough
and also if I think that a question reveals a problem in using WCAG. Phrasing
them in terms of accessibility impact is a good thing though.

Cheers

Charles

  Hi Charles:

       Thanks, you are probably right, sorry about going off topic.  I should have phrased my question the way you did in terms of WCAG checkpoint 11.4.
