Cross-posted information:

WebAIM is offering a course in web accessibility again this Fall, either
with or without college credit. The class begins August 27, 2001 and
finishes December 7, 2001, so interested individuals should sign up soon.

More information can be found at http://www.webaim.org/courses/.

Past sessions of this course have received positive reviews for the hands-on
approach and individualized instructor feedback. This semester's course will
increase the student-to-student interaction and allow students to put
together a portfolio of accessible web design by the end of the course.

Strong HTML skills are highly recommended as a prerequisite.

College students, administrators, professional web developers, and anyone
else with an interest are encouraged to enroll.

Feel free to share this email with others.
