At the suggestion of Wendy Chisholm, I made a first attempt at 
rewriting just the checkpoints of WCAG 2.0 in much plainer English. 
My rewriting of some points is the first rendition that actually 
makes sense. Other points cannot be simplified because the intrinsic 
concepts are more advanced-- or, seen differently, fixing them 
properly would have required intervention far earlier on in the 
process to alter the underlying thinking.
