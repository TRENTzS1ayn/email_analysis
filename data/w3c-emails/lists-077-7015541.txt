Graham,

I can't say "yay" or "nay" to your proposal, however, I would suggest 
putting up a simple test page and publlicize it to the list.  those of us 
who use screen readers can then go in an truly see if what you hypothesize 
can really be accomplished.  By doing this, it allows for numerous screen 
readers to test out the web page.
