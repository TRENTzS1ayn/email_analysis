Hi All,

Is anyone aware of accessible bulletin board / discussion forum software
which can be moderated and are also accessible? I imagine that email based
lists are best from the accessibility point of view but perhaps not the most
manageable from a moderator's point of view.

I'm thinking of an "out of the box" solution, something like UBB or
thereabouts. Basically, a facility which can be added to a site and will
take branding etc to maintain continuity with the look and feel of the site
it sits on but it has to be accessible.

Thanks in advance,

Anthony
