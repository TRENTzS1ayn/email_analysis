Bob,

there are Real PLayer solutions which I believe work under command-line
linux, and you can certainly attach Realplayer for linux to lynx if you are
running an Xwindow system.

More details on the command-line stuff is in the archives of the blinux list,
which I believe is still hosted by RedHat.

cheers

Charles
