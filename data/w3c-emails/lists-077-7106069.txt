Anthony,

I have had pretty good luck with UBY. I have done a few minor tweaks at
the one for
http://www.halftheplanet.org/cgi-bin/Ultimate.cgi?action=intro.

Note: I am well aware that this opens me to "corrections" to my above
statements, but I am prepared to incorporate all meaningful feedback. :)

Thanks,

dc

Subject: accessibile discussion forum?

Hi All,

Is anyone aware of accessible bulletin board / discussion forum software
which can be moderated and are also accessible? I imagine that email
based
lists are best from the accessibility point of view but perhaps not the
most
manageable from a moderator's point of view.

I'm thinking of an "out of the box" solution, something like UBB or
thereabouts. Basically, a facility which can be added to a site and will
take branding etc to maintain continuity with the look and feel of the
site
it sits on but it has to be accessible.

Thanks in advance,

Anthony
