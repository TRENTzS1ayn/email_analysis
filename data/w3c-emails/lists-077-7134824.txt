The better question to ask is

<quote> What causes a screen reader to stop? <end quote>

Yes, a period in the punctuation will always cause all synthesizers (as far
as I know) to stop or pause longer than a comma.
But some screen readers can also be configured to stop or pause at other
times:
end of a heading?
end of a list item?
end of meta information?

For example, a user can configure Home Page Reader to "add trailing text -
such as a period" after headings, list items, meta text, etc.  So now every
list item will "full stop" at the end because the synthesizer will stop
when it encounters a period. I would recommend against an author adding the
period since it isn't recommend in most modern grammar books.
Interestingly, if the author adds a period, and the user configures the
synthesizer to stop at each list item, the second period encountered may be
spoken as a "dot".

   list item with two periods..

In my opinion, authors should NOT be making accommodations that are clearly
in the realm of responsibility of the synthesizer and screen readers.
