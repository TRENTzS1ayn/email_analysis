Listserv is very convenient to moderate, not that moderated mailing 
lists are really the way to go.

Just this morning I read on some Weblog or other (I could not find 
the mention later on-- it is quite possible to lose things when you 
read a dozen Weblogs twice a day) that UBB now has a version that is 
fully XHTML-compliant. I cannot get <http://www.infopop.com/> to 
load, however, to test this theory. XHTML compliance is a very big 
step toward accessibility; among other things, every image has an alt.
