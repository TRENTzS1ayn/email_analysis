Excellent webcast of keynote presentation by Mike Paciello for a
MacroMedia workshop on Section 508. Mike introducing accessibility,
ICADD, WAI, WCAG, to show precedents for Section 508. Audience was
government attendees. Mike has consented to my posting this.

I played it on Real Player running on Windows. Even the real-time
visual-only captioning is readable at 2x magnification.
