Bob -
Other than the annoying banner ad and the generic "click this to play this
video with the Real Player" ALT tags that should be modified to identify
specifics about each of the 5 choices available, the site seems quite
accessible.   I'm sure I could easily find sites that are much more
inaccessible than this one.
