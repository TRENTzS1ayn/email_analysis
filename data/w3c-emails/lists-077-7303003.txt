Quick question -

But isn't AOL currently the focus of a class action lawsuit because the
service is not accessible? How will any actions / assistance with their
beta
testing effort affect the lawsuit (if there is one)?

Not saying that I won't be participating, simply that I would like to go
in
with 'open eyes' to this...

Thanks!

Denise
