Hello All:

Can screen readesrs read inputted text that users insert into online forms?  Specifically, once someone has entered information (personal, etc) into the form, hit "Submit" and had the form returned with a "You haven't filled out all of the required fields."  Would the screen reader read both the field names and the text within the fields as the person scrolled through the form to determine what is missing?  Anyone had experience with this?

Thanks.
Brooke Dine
