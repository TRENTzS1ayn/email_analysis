This *usually* works the way you describe. I.e., screen readers can read 
text in the input fields, status of radio buttons, etc.

The best way to handle form errors is a different topic.

The coolest thing would be to get a page with only the error fields listed. 
In other words:

"We're sorry, no data was entered in field(s) which is/are required for 
this form:

Zip Code: _____   "

This would be Much much more efficient for a screen reader user than having 
to hunt thru the entire form to try to figure out what went wrong.

On the other hand I can think of situations where one might want to read 
the full form in context. For that situation, maybe the fields with errors 
could be marked with a unique (text) character or string.
