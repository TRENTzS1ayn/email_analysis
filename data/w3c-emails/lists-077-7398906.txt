they are used to avoide the word image popping up all over the place
when images are not loaded or when a text browser such as lynx is being

Subject: empty alt tags


Hello,
Can anyone tell me the purpose for using empty alt tags for unessential
images like spacer gifs?

In researching accessible web design, I came across this recommendation
but
could not find an explaination for it.

Thanks in advance.
