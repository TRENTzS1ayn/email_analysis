But, is there a reason to use an empty alt tag of "" as opposed to simply
omitting the alt tag alltogether?

The basic idea is to avoid bombarding screen reader users (or other 
non-visual users) with extraneous information.

If the items in a navigation bar have "This is an empty placeholder with no 
meaning" interspersed several times among the active links, the 
intelligibility can drop dramatically!
