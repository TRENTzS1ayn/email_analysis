Marti,

Yep.  Just checked that on the w3c site and it is a required
attribute for img and area elements but it is optional for input and applet
tags.

I've not witnessed first hand the file name being read if no alt is
present but concur that it would indeed be distracting.

Both good points.  Thanks for you reply.

Jim Fitzgerald

1) Valid html requires a tag
2) the file name maybe read if there is no alt tag (very distracting)
