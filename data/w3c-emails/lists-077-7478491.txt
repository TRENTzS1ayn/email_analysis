Subject: Rendering of ALT text in table header cells


We're building a web-based application for a US Government client, and
we
will have a few tables that display honest-to-goodness tabular data.
Our
visual designer would like to use images in the column headings, and he
asked me if the ALT text for these images would render the same way as
ordinary text would if there were no images (i.e., as header text).  Can
anyone provide this information?

Thanks.
