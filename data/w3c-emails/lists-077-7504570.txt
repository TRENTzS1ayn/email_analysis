Elizabeth,

It should, as long as you put the images between TH tags.

Does your graphic designer want to use pictures of text in the 
headings? If so, bear in mind that visually impaired users cannot 
resize non-vector-based images, nor can they override the designer's 
color and contrast choices for greater readability. These are good 
reasons to avoid using images of text to convey important information 
where plain text would do. (If this is not the designer's plan, 
please ignore my soapboxing!)
