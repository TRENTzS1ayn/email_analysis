I must be missing something. Unless claiming the bullets are red when
they
are actually blue is a joke.

What this page seems to be to me is a perfect example of how NOT to use
the
alt attribute.

I found the fact that the color was wrong in the ALT to be hilarious. Not to
mention what you sd - this is NOT the way to do an ALT attribute. And you
have to love that its our NATIONAL Zoo's website!

Cheers!

Denise
