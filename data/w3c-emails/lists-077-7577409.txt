Hmmm, with Jaws I didn't notice anything too unusual.  There must be strange
visual things going on?

For the record, as a person with blindness  (non-darkness-impaired reader,
etc.) & screen reader user, I did not know that the bullets were actually blue
until others pointed it out. I was warning people about the red ones because
there are so many of them. I think it's a highpoint of Web comedy that they
are
in fact blue.

For the record, the Jaws "Link List" command (or similar command in other
screen readers) let's one navigate easily through the links without the
red/blue bullets (although it does not help with the "This is a large
navigation button that goes to ..." problem (I paraphrase")).

In defense of the National Zoo, I found their questionnaire / feedback form to
be very accessible. So we can send our requests for improved ALT tagging
fairly
easily (though it is tempting to preserve the site as part of a Menagerie of
Poor Design Practice).
