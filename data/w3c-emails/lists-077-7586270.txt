Hi Patrick,

The section I referred to (animal feeding and interpretation:
http://natzoo.si.edu/hilights/animaldemos/index.htm) contains a large
amount of information about feeding times and interpretive activities - the
catch is that this information is all provided as GIFs (img1.gif &
img3.gif) with no alt text or other means of getting to the information
except visually!

Andrew

Hmmm, with Jaws I didn't notice anything too unusual.  There must be
strange
visual things going on?

For the record, as a person with blindness  (non-darkness-impaired reader,
etc.) & screen reader user, I did not know that the bullets were actually
blue
until others pointed it out. I was warning people about the red ones
because
there are so many of them. I think it's a highpoint of Web comedy that they
are
in fact blue.

For the record, the Jaws "Link List" command (or similar command in other
screen readers) let's one navigate easily through the links without the
red/blue bullets (although it does not help with the "This is a large
navigation button that goes to ..." problem (I paraphrase")).

In defense of the National Zoo, I found their questionnaire / feedback form
to
be very accessible. So we can send our requests for improved ALT tagging
fairly
easily (though it is tempting to preserve the site as part of a Menagerie
of
Poor Design Practice).

Patrick
