Joe,
  yes, a text transcript would be most helpful.  I need to examine our logs 
to see if one exists, if not, then that is an item to be done.  I am sure 
that I am guilty of having other videos up with either captioning or audio 
description, but lack the text transcripts.  We will worked toward making 
this more complete as time goes on.  Thanks for the vote of confidence in 
what AbleTV does.
