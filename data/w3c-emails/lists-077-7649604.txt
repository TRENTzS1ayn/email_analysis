I wonder why her company deemed voice recognition software "not 
viable." VR software makes computer work possible for so many people 
afflicted with repetitive-stress injuries, including journalists and 
writers like Macworld's David Pogue.

Denise, if you find more information on the case, would you mind 
posting the references here on w3c-wai-ig? Thanks.
