Jo,

Here's more information that Len Sandler was kind enough to send. Its a bit
long, but is an interesting read & brings up some good points. Len sd that
the case is not as damaging as it first appears, but I definately still have
questions. I would love to know what everyone thinks.

I am attaching it as a Word doc as well as a .txt. I hope everyone is able
to read it okie.

Best regards,

Denise
