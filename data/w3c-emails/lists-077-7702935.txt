Hi,

I have a couple of questions related to the W3C wcag v1.0.

Checkpoint 1.1 advises "Provide a text equivalent for every non-text
element".  This includes: 'Graphical representations of text' and 'Frames'

1.Can you please explain how this checkpoint relates to 'Frames' as I'm a
little unclear as to what the text equivalent should actually be, is it a
frame 'title' or should you provide a completely different non-frames page
with the same content?

2.I fully understand that all graphics/images etc should have Alt-tags for
screen readers etc.  However, is guideline 1.1 also saying that graphics
used to display text should also have an alternative provided as text?  I
presume this would be aid users who need to enlarge or change the colour of
text and those whose systems cannot interpret graphics?


Thanks
Russ
