Russell,

The Techniques for Web Content Accessibility page addresses the 
subject of frames in more detail and provides code examples. See
http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-HTML-TECHS/#frame-text-equivalent
and
http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-HTML-TECHS/#noframes , which says, "links 
to descriptions of a frame should be provided along with other 
alternative content in the NOFRAMES element of a FRAMESET."

What you will need to put between your NOFRAMES tags to ensure access 
for people whose user agents don't display frames will depend on the 
content of your site. A set of navigational links that duplicates 
your top (or side) navigation menu may suffice.

(And as you mention, frames and framesets must also be given 
meaningful titles.)
