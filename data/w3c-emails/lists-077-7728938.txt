Scott,

By Oracle forms, do you mean the application or are you speaking about 
forms in a general sense, such as forms within an HTML document?  if it is 
the latter you are speaking of, they can be made accessible, however, it 
comes down having a programmer write good coe that can be accessed by a 
screen reader.  However, given just the SQLPlus environment, a screen 
reader can access the information that is being displayed, you will have to 
use the alternative mouse key commands within your specific screen reader 
to do so, but it is accessible.  I do it every day of the week.
