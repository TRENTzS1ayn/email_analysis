All,

there is interesting new technology to help people who are deaf or hearing
impaired communicate with people who are not...

There is a press release at
http://www.icdri.org/signtel_interpreter_press_releas.htm

and, the site can be found at www.signtelinc.com

I have used it, it is pretty amazing and they are very easy folks to work
with and are looking for new ways to apply the technology.

We are working with them to bring up some Internet applications.  There is
great potential here to help read web pages, email and other applications.

Sincerely,

Mike Burks
