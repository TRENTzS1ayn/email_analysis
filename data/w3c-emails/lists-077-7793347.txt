For those interested in Flash, I also recommend the notes from 
Phillip Kerman's August 1st presentation at Web Design World Seattle, 
entitled "Where Does Flash Fit In?" The handouts are now available on 
his website at http://www.phillipkerman.com/wdw2001/ . 
(Interestingly, I found Phillip's Flash presentations _more_ usable 
via keyboard-only input than via mouse input.)

I have not spoken with anyone who knows the estimated release date of 
a Flash version that works with screen readers. I will try to find 
out more. If anyone on the list has more information on this issue, 
or knows someone at Macromedia who might provide that information, 
please let me know. Thanks.
