I've just installed netscape 6.1, and it seems to present a problem for my
clients...
I cannot get it to plain open....

one has to select a 'profile'
then 'activation' starts, and one has to either, type in a user name and
password, or click cancel
it is very insistent about allowing cookies.

Has anyone else tried this version?
any views on its accessibility, is this something for UA?
is it perhaps a sign of the times??

thanks
