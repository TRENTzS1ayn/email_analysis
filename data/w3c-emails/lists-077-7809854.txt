Jonathan;

The process you're describing is a process that will create a local
directory for users. This stores user preferences and data (like password
remembering data) unique to the user.

After that is complete you'll be asked to activate a membership at the
Netscape portal, though this can be cancelled.

Mozilla.org has an accessibility coordinator, but I'm unsure of the priority
accessibility has in the development there.

Subject: netscape 6.1


I've just installed netscape 6.1, and it seems to present a problem for my
clients...
I cannot get it to plain open....

one has to select a 'profile'
then 'activation' starts, and one has to either, type in a user name and
password, or click cancel
it is very insistent about allowing cookies.

Has anyone else tried this version?
any views on its accessibility, is this something for UA?
is it perhaps a sign of the times??

thanks
