Well, not exactly that bad <grin />.
 
BugZilla is reporting 12 active bugs, half of them assigned to developers.
Two have triggered errors with support for the ATAG and the UAAG, there's a
few for Microsoft's Active Accessibility. 
 
There are also a couple where folks have noted errors on the mozilla.org
site using the WCAG 1.0.

Mozilla.org has an accessibility coordinator, but I'm unsure of the priority

accessibility has in the development there.



My bet says "absolutely no priority". 

That's skeptical, and more than a bit cynical, but probably closest to the 
truth.
