Jonathon -
 
Yes, that's right. All the releases of Netscape 6.x that have been made
available on the Netscape.com site are taken from mozilla.org builds. In
fact, all releases on the netscape.com site are actually pre or beta builds
from mozilla.org.
 
The problem you're noting is largely to keep users seperated. Netscape 6 has
some nice privacy features (such as they are) as well as some very specific
user-settings that impact how the web is browsed and displayed. By forcing
the creation of profiles at startup Netscape 6 keeps the users seperated so
settings don't get confused.

I just checked mozilla 0.9.3 and it has a similar problem, selecting a
'profile'
thankfully the cookie and activation problems are currently not.
