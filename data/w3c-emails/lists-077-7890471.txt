  Hang on for a moment. I've not tested this in Netscape, but in
  Mozilla 0.9.3 (which is the latest stable release), the command

     mozilla -P profilename

  starts the browser without prompting for a profile. This should solve
  the described problem, yes ?

  I am making the less-than-ideal assumption here that a visually impaired
  user is not sharing her/his machine with too many other people in the
  same situation, and in such a case defaulting the profile with -P should
  work.
