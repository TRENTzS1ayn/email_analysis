actually, there are many situations in which a scren reader user may be
using a shared system but let's put that asside for the moment and talk
about the original question which was pointing out the fact that the
profile box did not work with a screen reader.  This should be over come
not swept asside.  As to who is talking to who, I think when the dust
settles on this one, it should be fairly accessible although I cannot
understand why we had a fairly accessible netscape through 4.75 and now
suddenly the wheel is being re-invented.

  Hang on for a moment. I've not tested this in Netscape, but in
  Mozilla 0.9.3 (which is the latest stable release), the command

     mozilla -P profilename

  starts the browser without prompting for a profile. This should solve
  the described problem, yes ?

  I am making the less-than-ideal assumption here that a visually
impaired
  user is not sharing her/his machine with too many other people in the
  same situation, and in such a case defaulting the profile with -P
should
  work.
