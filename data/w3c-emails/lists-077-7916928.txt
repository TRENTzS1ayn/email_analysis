Open source projects tend to be [*] notoriously bad when it comes to
usability and accessibility.  Usually they are written by programmers, for
programmers, and there's never anyone with any sort of "QA" or "UI
design requirements" who can enforce those on the rest of the project.

[*] = "tend to be" means "almost always but you can find exceptions"
       so please don't post to describe an exception -- I know that there
       are such things, but the generalization still stands.
