  A quick dig in Mozilla's documentation gives me

 http://www.mozilla.org/quality/browser/front-end/testcases/cmd-line/index.html

  which does list -P as a Win32 option as well. Granted, it also states
  that "NOTE: Several of these features still haven't been fully implemented,
  so expected results might vary from build to build" but that isn't
  uncommon for works-in-progress.

  In addition to -P, it lists a few other options - like -nosplash - that
  seems to be useful for more streamlined use of Mozilla. The quoted option
  is used under Win32 only, and removes the 'splash' screen at startup.

  I don't run Windows myself, so I never tested these, however.
