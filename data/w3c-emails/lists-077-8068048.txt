I am interested in choosing effective shortcut letters
for AccessKeys.
By effective I mean ones that don't interfere with
either

1. Keyboard use of a browser
2. Keyboard use of JAWS and WindowEyes

As an example I would rule out using

F
E
V
A
T
H 

becuase these provide access to the main menu bar in
Internet Explorer 5.5

Also 'D' because this provides access to the address
bar.

Does this seem reasonable?

If so, if anyone would like to post or send to me
other shortcuts that are good not to use then I will
post the results on line

Cheers
Graham Oliver
