Well, the W3C (the people whowrote the specification to start with) are
working on it. There are two pieces to the puzzle - one is getting the
specification better, and the other is getting good implementation.

In terms of fixing the specification, SMIL 2.0 which recently became a W3C
recommendation has what I think is a better version than the original HTML 4
specification did.

  The post by Charles brings up a good thought. Has anyone ever thought of
  doing something like trying to get this issue worked on by the ISO or IEEE?
