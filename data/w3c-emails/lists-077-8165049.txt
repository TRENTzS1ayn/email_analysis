It isn't made clear on the page mentioned, but these keystrokes (combinations
with the Alt key) are used in the Jaws keyboard assignments for laptops only.
They are not part of the default Jaws keyboard command set.

I'm not sure if this point makes a difference to the current discussion, but
users of laptops do have to deliberately choose this configuration with the
extra Alt key commands.
