A quick tour through the browsers on Windows on this
page 
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/tests/accesskey3.html
provided the following :-

IE 4
Support for accesskey worked.
Link was immediately triggered

IE 5.5
Support for accesskey worked.
Link was *not* immediately triggered

Opera 5.11
No Support

Netscape 4.7x
No Support

Netscape 6.1
Support for accesskey worked for A through Z
Link was immediately triggered

Support for accesskey worked on number 0 to 9 when I
used the numbers on the top of the keyboard but not
when I used the KeyPad (Yes I did have Num Lock
enabled :-)

Cheers
Graham Oliver
