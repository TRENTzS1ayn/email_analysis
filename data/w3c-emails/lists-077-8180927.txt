perhaps this is the time to review an experiment I am testing?
our current home page http://www.peepo.com
uses javascript to capture keystrokes, though one can still 'type' in forms.

comments please, don't hold back.

I find the system very useful, my students have learnt to use it, and do so
frequently, though not all the time.

you'd have to try it to explore it's functionality, (or lack of).

thanks
