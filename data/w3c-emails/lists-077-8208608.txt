Dear All,
I have just caught up with this thread, so apologies if this has already
been mentioned.

I believe that any AccessKeys that are used should be made explicit for
any one viewing the website, that way there can be no confusion
whatsoever. IE will allow the use of all numbers for access, but letters
are a problem for reasons already highlighted...

Hope this helps.
Sime

From a practical point of view, because everyone implements a different
set
of AccessKeys, we have found that the blind staff and clients at Vision
Australia Foundation tend not to use them. They can't rely on on a
consistent combination being the home-page key for instance from site to
site, eg Alt-0, like they know that Ctrl-P is the print key with in
_any_
Windows application.

IMHO it will only work, and be widely adopted and utilised, when we can
get
some sort of standard for what a (minimum) set of AccessKeys correspond
with.
