Haven't thought this through, just throwing the idea in to see what
people think.

Maybe a better method for defining access keys would be something
like:

<a href="whatever.html" keytype="normal">blah</a>

keytype could be one of a defined list of common uses for a
focus-able element (e.g. "home", "up", "contact" for links, "name",
"password" for input elements) or "normal" to mean it is outside of
that list.

Browsers could then mark elements up as best they could to match the
access keys already defined by the browser and underlying OS, a list
of repeated access keys that users of the browser would become
familiar with, and finally assigning the remaining keys as best it
can.

It would be a lot of work for the browser, but seems a sensible
enough method at this stage ("this stage" meaning between cup of
coffee no. 1 and no. 2).
