There is a problem with how to make it clear what accesskeys are available.

iCab actually allows you to show the key next to the link. (It directly
activates links, and it uses just the key, without any modifier). However,
the SMIL 2.0 approach is slightly different. It allows the user agent to
re-assign keys, since a user agent may not have an "aleph" key, or may
reserve the "shi" key for some other function (as for example windows does).
In the case the User agent Must show the revised mapping, although in any
case it is the user agent that should show the list of accesskeys available.

This is the price that they pay for the freedom to specify exactly how the
accesskey function is triggered, and it is a sensible arrangement. Explorer
uses the Alt modifier, which of course is not available to DoCoMo whose
browser typically runs on a mobile phone. Opera uses most keys already, so
could not take the iCab approach of having no modifier at all. And Amaya
allows the user to choose (to some extent) the modifier used.

For browsers which support CSS2 (there are a couple) you can use the
following in a user style sheet:

 *[accesskey]:after { content: "<" attr(accesskey) ">" }

to get the same as what iCab gives. But a list  of available accesskeys in a
page, like some browsers give a list of links or "table of contents" view,
would go a long way to making it a more useful function for more users.

(By the way, blind users are not the group for whom accesskeys  are most
important, so given the current implementation state it isn't surprising they
don't use them a lot. Things are worse for those people to whom accesskeys
are really important - people who have very limited input devices or for whom
input is very slow).

  Dear All,
  I have just caught up with this thread, so apologies if this has already
  been mentioned.

  I believe that any AccessKeys that are used should be made explicit for
  any one viewing the website, that way there can be no confusion
  whatsoever. IE will allow the use of all numbers for access, but letters
  are a problem for reasons already highlighted...

  Hope this helps.

  consistent combination being the home-page key for instance from site to
  site, eg Alt-0, like they know that Ctrl-P is the print key with in

  IMHO it will only work, and be widely adopted and utilised, when we can
  get
  some sort of standard for what a (minimum) set of AccessKeys correspond
  with.
