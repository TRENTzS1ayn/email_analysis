but when the "testers" are forced to subscribe to a service (run by the
test creators) to be able to test the product they are then going to try
to sell you seems a bit "catch 22"ish.   They should get good results
because those that can already use the service are likely to be those who
take the beta test and those who can't will not even access the test to
take it. (does this make sense??)

sort of assures good results!
