ANNOUNCING RETROACCESS (TM) FOR WEBSITE DEVELOPMENT & EVALUATION
----------------------------------------------------------------

Try out the free demo version of RetroAccess, an automated website
evaluation and correction tool that helps to ensure that your website
complies with established standards for accessibility.

Once a website has passed through the RetroAccess process, it will be
compliant with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the
Federal standard for website accessibility effective June 2001, and
the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) produced by the World
Wide Web Consortium (W3C).

RetroAccess is both accessible and user-friendly with easy to
understand reports.  The free demo version of RetroAccess is
available at:

The full commercial version of RetroAccess will be launched in October
2001.
