Basically I throw snippets together to get a working prototype and then
refine...
the homepages only really worked in IE5.5 and then I added on a little code
to get it to work in a few others.
the beta site is being built up from scratch supposedly as 'fully'
accessible, anyway as best as I can get it with my skills.

for about 3 weeks I've been on holiday, and Phoebe is back to school middle
of next week, then I have a couple of weeks supposed down time and hope to
incorporate a few more modules.
sound, and keyboard navigability have high priority, and might actually get
done...
the linking is currently down, can't remember why, but an attempt to fix
some problem.

thanks again, I didn't realise people liked it as much as they do.
