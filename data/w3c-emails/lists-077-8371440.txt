I had a play with it again. It is starting to make sense, with the audio
clarifying some of what is going on. (Could you add a musical backing to
the
word "music" ?) I realise that it is a development project, but I was sorry
to see that the keyboard navigability had gone again.

Nice ideas. It is a shame that multimedia doesn't work in a more standard
way
at the moment.

Cheers

Charles

      I phuzzed around with it but if I were actually looking for something
      particular I'm not sure I would have been able to find it easily

  I do hope yahoo or someone else might be able to cover this problem...

  thanks for your encouragement
