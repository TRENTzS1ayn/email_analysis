Hi all,

In the Dutch newsbrief "accessibility. nl". I read for the "Disabled People"
the expression "PEOLPLE WITH LIMITED FUNCTIONS". I think this expression is
more appropriate in this time of emancipation.

Personally I prefer to speak about "PEOPLE WITH SOME LIMITED FUNCTIONS"  to
make clear that this people are not limited  in all their functions . Though
this often is thought as I have heard.  I never found disabled a nice word,
but I am Dutch.

I read the haiku of Charles Munat and the flames war mail on the gl-list (is
puiblic, is not it) It inspired me to the following poem:


The right flamelight???

When there are more than one on a list
there is always one  who insist
to have the right  flame in the night
but what does happen when it is the wrong light ?

The others cannot see any light and say
do you see: this was not the right way
you must change all your mind
we love only peaceful mankind

Is there some-one on this list who can write the guidelines in  a poem.
I think that will better stick as a sea of words.

Cheers
