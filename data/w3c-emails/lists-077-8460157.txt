       It's honest, though. And frankly...speaking as someone who IS 
disabled...Why NOT? I personally find the new emphasis on political 
correctness ("Physically challenged", "People with Limited Functions", etc.") 
pitiful.

       Frankly...This is bitter, but hey. If you normals want to make like 
you're so damn caring...Do it with actions. Not with revisionist vocabulary.
