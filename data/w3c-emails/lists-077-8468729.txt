Hi John,

Thank you for your reaction.

What are you calling normals?

Did you ever see a normal human being and did you like this?

I can understand your opinion, but when you know that in the Netherlands
nearly one million of people are declared medically unfit to work  and get
social security money their whole life long  because they have a handicap,
is my question Why can anybody who has
rsi for instance, don't do other work? We have 16 million people in this
country and nearly one million people cannot work anymore?????  And many
branches need more personal...

That is of course a social/political question. But makes me clear there is
something wrong in thinking about disabled people.. That's why I try to find
another name. But you are right an other more clear name can perhaps change
something in mind, but only action is the right way. Though a more specified
name can change perhaps something in peoples mind...  it is only a
begin.....  and finally  action the end?

Greetings
Ineke

In the Dutch newsbrief "accessibility. nl". I read for the "Disabled People"
the expression "PEOLPLE WITH LIMITED FUNCTIONS". I think this expression is
more appropriate in this time of emancipation.

Personally I prefer to speak about "PEOPLE WITH SOME LIMITED FUNCTIONS"  to
make clear that this people are not limited  in all their functions . Though
this often is thought as I have heard.  I never found disabled a nice word,
but I am Dutch.


      It's honest, though. And frankly...speaking as someone who IS
disabled...Why NOT? I personally find the new emphasis on political
correctness ("Physically challenged", "People with Limited Functions",
etc.")
pitiful.

      Frankly...This is bitter, but hey. If you normals want to make like
you're so damn caring...Do it with actions. Not with revisionist vocabulary.

John
