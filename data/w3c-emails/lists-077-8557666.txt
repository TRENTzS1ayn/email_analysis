Kynn,

Thanks for bringing this up (and for your comprehensive data breakdown).

It does seem that the Section 508 guidelines are targeted especially
towards access for users with visual disabilities.  A clear sign of this
is the Access Board's guide to Section 508 -
http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/guide/1194.22.htm - which in most
places equates accessibility with accessibility for screen reader
users.  

For example, see the Scripts section -
http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/guide/1194.22.htm#(l) - which gives
advice contrary to the WCAG's HTML Techniques recommendations -
http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-HTML-TECHS/#directly-accessible-scripts -
regarding event handling.

Best,
    --tyler
