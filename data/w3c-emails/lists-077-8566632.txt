another group that is almost always ignored.

many people with attention def disorders (including some with
Epilepsy) must or should avoid the "Confusion" of a graphics site the
blinking and flashing and poping up and all the "Stuff" on the screen make
it difficult or impossible to use.  a simple B&W text screen is fully
usable but throw in colors and movement etc and the site becomes just a
"confused mess" or even worse could cause an epeleptic or other type of
reaction

sure this is always the case, that which is understood and has a vocal
support group gets the most attention (squeaky wheel syndrome)

no I found it quite interesting
most important is to find a standard or system that will work for most if
not all users.
