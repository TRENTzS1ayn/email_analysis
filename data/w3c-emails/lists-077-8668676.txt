I agree completely.  In fact, this is how I am presenting the subject of 
accessibility to the groups and businesses that I am talking to about the 
subject.  Don't think of accessibility as something only for the 
"disabled," but as a way to make sure that everyone can use the web.

I talk about baby boomers with failing vision, people listening to the 
web/email being read to them in their cars, people with carpal tunnel, 
people using wireless devices, people with broken arms, people in low-light 
environments, people who are color blind, people who for whatever reason 
have slow connections or old computers,etc. -- providing statistics with 
figures in the tens of millions.  That gets my audience thinking in terms 
of something different than "we don't have any blind people using our website."

Once they start realizing that they probably do have potential customers 
who can't use their websites, or that their customers have employees and 
customers who need accessible websites, it is easier to get them to 
seriously consider making their websites accessible.  Then we can get down 
to the WCAG, section 508 and 255, etc.  standards.   Or even better, get 
past the section 508 standards (or relevant statutes in other countries 
than the US) -- the "law" -- and just start talking about how to make their 
websites accessible.
