That's why I encourage people who care about this to run their own
tests. ;)

Not necessarily.  The most important thing is how it relates back to the
original spark of this discussion which was:  People who have read the
guidelines have come away thinking that they're all about access for
blind people, and all about access by screenreaders.  This is not just
a hypothetical case, or even anecdotal; you can find solid evidence which
says folks think "WCAG 1.0 is about blind people, or about blind people
primarily."

And just the same, it's hard not to read WCAG 1.0, which spends about
75% of the guideline space dealing with blindness issues, and not come
to the conclusion that accessibility is mainly about blind people.

See, it all actually does make sense -- the study of "how much column
space is spent on <x>" can let us know whether or not people who read
WCAG incorrectly are doing it because they're "just stupid or something"
and "didn't read carefully"; or, if perhaps when WCAG was written, the
authors didn't realize that the amount of space spent primarily on
screenreaders and blind people would lead to a lot of misinterpretation.

I think there's a value in examining not only WHAT we wrote, but how
we wrote it.  You gave an example of splitting a "write clearly"
checkpoint into a half dozen, to elevate the importance of one group's
needs -- I think we need to consider whether or not that kind of
thing was (unconsciously) done before, producing an artificial
_apparent focus_ on one group.

The good news is that, as you say, WCAG 2.0 checkpoints are being
written more broadly, which will give a better sense, when someone
reads it, that we aren't just talking about people who can't see
pictures, but about everyone who faces artificial barriers to web
access.

That kind of analysis would be great.  I would love to see it. ;)
[Especially about section 508.]
