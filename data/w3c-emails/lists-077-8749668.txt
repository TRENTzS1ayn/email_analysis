Danny,

Your correspondent might like to take a look at the Victorian Open Road
project (http://www.openroad.vic.gov.au/) - they provide instructions in
many languages for obtaining fonts. Their technique might be applicable
here.

I just received the mail below, and it must be a common problem - any
suggestions (I suggested GIFs, but that seems a bit feeble).
Cheers,
