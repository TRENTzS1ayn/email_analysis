Paul,

my suggestion is to use the default font, although I don't always do it.
Let the user choose.

Just my two cents.

Subject: Font sizes



Hi All,

I need some references to quote on fonts and good web design for a friend of
mine working with Oxford Health authority. We all know times roman is not
always a good idea and thus <FONT FACE="geneva, arial, helvetica, sans
serif"> is so simple so it's not worth talking about, but that is my
problem, being so basic no one I can find has mentioned it in print!!


Even checked Nielson and nothing I could see.  Any suggestions please?
