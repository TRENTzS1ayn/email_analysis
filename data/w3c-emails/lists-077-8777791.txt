I would back up the "let the user choose". I looked into this a while ago,
and don't have anything I can think of as a reference, except that the
results were that Times Roman is better for some people and worse for others.
Best to let people decide for themselves. (Which is maybe why it is hard to
find something saying otherwise).

I believe that I put some of this in a mail to the User Agent Accessibility
Guidelines Group many months ago, but don't have time to search yet myself.
If I have time and remember I'll try to find the information.

cheers

  Paul,

  my suggestion is to use the default font, although I don't always do it.

  Hi All,

  I need some references to quote on fonts and good web design for a friend of
  mine working with Oxford Health authority. We all know times roman is not
  always a good idea and thus <FONT FACE="geneva, arial, helvetica, sans
  serif"> is so simple so it's not worth talking about, but that is my
  problem, being so basic no one I can find has mentioned it in print!!
