I believe the "serif" is the problem, (smaller fonts) unless of course as
Mike points out the user has reset their own browser. But then we assume
they can or know how to.

Hi all,

I usually go with "sans serif" or "serif" without more precision. It seems
to me that we can preserve some design and at the same time allow the user
to keep their preferences. Of course, with only relative font sizes.

Can this cause accessibility problems?
