Well, in general the user will be able to have their default preference,
which is good, and relative sizes are a good thing. But there are users who
have a badly set up browser, and don't know how to change it. This can cause
a real problem for those users, but it may be that the browsers should be
solving this problem.

  Hi all,

  I usually go with "sans serif" or "serif" without more precision. It seems
  to me that we can preserve some design and at the same time allow the user
  to keep their preferences. Of course, with only relative font sizes.

  Can this cause accessibility problems?
