Hi, 

I'd be interested to know anything about people's experience of real world
implementation of font sizes?

The conclusions of the following article - 

http://www.alistapart.com/stories/fear4/index.html

are that real world implementation of the W3C recommended 'em' doesn't work
and that there are only two options - 

1) specify in pixels (which you can't resize on the browser and therefore
ain't accessible).

2) don't specify font sizes at all and rely on the browser defaults.

Any thoughts, experiences??

Cheers,

Fraser
