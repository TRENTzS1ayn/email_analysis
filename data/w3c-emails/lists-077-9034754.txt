HWG COURSE D201: Accessible Web Design
24 September 2001 to 11 November 2001 (7 weeks)

      The World Wide Web was created as one of the most inclusive
      media; anyone, regardless of computer type, operating system,
      or browser version, could access information on the Web.

      But then something went wrong.

      Today's web is full of thoughtlessly designed sites which can't
      be accessed by a diversity of web browsers. Users with special
      needs, such as those with physical disabilities, are often shut
      out from essential e-commerce facilities, distance learning
      programs, and web-based news systems. Why did this happen, and
      how can we fix the problems without tearing down attractive,
      dynamic web sites and replacing them with text-only pages?

      HWG online education instructor Kynn Bartlett will show you how
      to ensure your web site can be used by as broad an audience as
      possible, in the newly revised course D201, "Accessible Web
      Design." This seven-week web-based course will cover the full
      range of accessible design, from practices to policy.

SAMPLE WEEK'S LESSON:

      Want to know what the course is like?  A sample week is 
      posted on the Web, free of charge!  The URL is:

      http://access.idyllmtn.com/d201/#sample

      You'll see what the reading assignments and Web references
      look like, as well as the hands-on exercises and review
      questions; what you won't see is the coolest part of the class,
      the peer-to-peer interaction with fellow students and the
      instructors that is the trademark of HWG online classes.  But
      hopefully the sample will whet your appetite for more!
