The HTML Writers Guild is pleased to announce the creation of
a new mailing list for our members, about web accessibility:


AWARE-Techniques
      <http://www.hwg.org/lists/aware-techniques/index.html>

      This HWG mailing list, sponsored by the AWARE Center,
      is for discussion of issues related to accessible Web design
      -- tips, techniques, and advice from fellow Web designers who
      are working to make the Web more accessible to everyone,
      including people with disabilities.

WHY THIS LIST?

The HWG lists are designed for designer-to-designer sharing of
experience and expertise, so that we can all become better at what
we do.  The AWARE-Techniques list is a forum for HWG members to
discuss issues related to designing web pages which can be used
by all audiences, including people with disabilities.

The list is different from the W3C's (excellent and recommended)
Web Accessibility Initiative mailing lists because it is intended
primarily for technical discussion of web accessibility among
web designers, much as the HWG's Accessible Web Authoring 
Resources and Education Center (http://aware.hwg.org) complements
the technical resources of the W3C.

Anyone with an interest in discussing hands-on web design
practices related to accessibility is welcome to join the Guild
and participate in this new mailing list.  To join, please see the
instructions at:

      http://www.hwg.org/lists/aware-techniques/index.html

ABOUT THE GUILD
