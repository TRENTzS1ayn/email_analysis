Dear WAI Interest Group Members,

W3C's Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) invites comment on the second
public Working Draft of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (WCAG
2.0), published 24 August 2001 [1]. 

This Working Draft incorporates comments received on the first public
Working Draft of WCAG 2.0. It is not based on consensus of the Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (WCAG WG) [2]; has not completed the
W3C process; and is not stable or referenceable. This WCAG 2.0 Working
Draft in no way supersedes WCAG 1.0, which will remain stable and
referenceable for the foreseeable future.

Comments on WCAG 2.0 will be welcome throughout the course of document
development, but comments in the early stages of development are more
useful than later comments. If you are interested in comparing checkpoints
in WCAG 1.0 with evolving checkpoints in the WCAG 2.0 Working Draft, please
refer to the Checkpoint Mapping [3]. 

We invite comments on two mailing lists:

- For any comments that you want to be sure are registered with the WCAG WG
regarding the August 24th WCAG 2.0 Working Draft, please send them to
w3c-wai-gl@w3.org, if possible by Thursday, September 6, 2001. Comments
received after that date are also welcome.

- For general discussion about this Working Draft, please comment on
w3c-wai-ig@w3.org. That discussion will be monitored to some extent by the
WCAG WG, but we cannot guarantee that every issue raised there will be
registered with the WCAG WG for formal discussion.

The WCAG WG welcomes comment on any aspect of the draft, but is
particularly interested in feedback on the following issues:

1. There are several "Notes to reviewers" that highlight issues that the
WCAG WG would like reviewers to address. These issues have been discussed
in the WCAG WG, with no clear resolution, or have been identified as
needing more research. The notes should be self-explanatory and are found
throughout the document. 

2. The WCAG WG has been focusing on Checkpoint text and success criteria
for each Checkpoint. We have tried to provide examples and benefits for
each Checkpoint to aid understanding. Please help us identify where the
Checkpoints and success criteria are difficult to understand. We encourage
feedback about the success of this approach.

3. Note that there are many open issues [4] that the WCAG WG needs to
discuss further and address in future Working Drafts. The WCAG WG welcomes
comments on the listed issues.

Other suggestions or comments are welcome. This message may be circulated
to other lists, but please be careful to avoid cross-postings.

Thank you for your review,

- Judy Brewer and Wendy Chisholm, on behalf of the WCAG WG
