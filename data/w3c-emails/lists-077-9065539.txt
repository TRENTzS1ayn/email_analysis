This is a technical issue which I have no idea about
but I just thought it worth mentioning.

When I click on the link
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/ from my work I get
the 'latest' version of the guidelines '14 August
2001'
I 'check for newer versions of stored pages every
time'

When I click on the same link from home I get the
'latest' version of the guidelines '24 August 2001'

So, it is possible, at least for me <smile> to believe
that you are looking at the latest version of the
guidelines when in fact you are not.

My, totally uniformed view is that this may have
something to do with my respective ISP's caching
policies but thought it worth mentioning.

Cheers
Graham Oliver
