Greetings, all.

Did anyone listen to this call / e-Seminar? What were your thoughts? It was
interesting to me in the general sense to see what products are offering,
but I had a lot of problems with the products themselves (as in, the
products did not appear to be accessible in and of themselves). Anyone
else's thoughts / opinions?

Best regards,

Denise
