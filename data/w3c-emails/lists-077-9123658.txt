Points about defining accessible schema. Difficult for a schema author to known all the elements that should be put in for the various disabilty types. RDF could be used here to further describe a given element's accessibility features.

This applies also for style sheets. Given an element, how do we know what kind of style sheet class to apply to it when it's not the immediate docuemnt?


Improving on point 2.7, but for style. AH, Like 2.10, but with some examples. So with 3.1, how do we associate a particular style sheet with a accessibility context?

In 2.8, it would be handy to have some guidelines for working with namepaces when two elements in different namespaces have the same name.

In 4.4, it's great to give some indication of the reason for a given element - such as the title for the TOC - but what happens if it's use depends on context? Maybe not m,uch cn bne done about this, but it is a common scenarion. In one case it may be the TOC person title (e.g. Resume for Steven Livingstone) and in another it may have a different meaning (e.g. employee name is Steven Livingstone). Both come from the same elemenrt but are used in differeny ways.
