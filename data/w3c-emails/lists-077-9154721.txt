Yes, it seems we are in agreement.

THe thread began with a question about where the research was that proved the
well-known fact that sans-serif fonts were better for people. And I think
exhausted itself on the fact that there isn't such proof, becuase the
well-known fact isn't actually true.

Designers should know the accessibility constraints, and as you and Jamie say
beyond that they should design. Stylistic effects aid comprehension, when
used well.

Cheers

Charles

  Hi Charles
  This conversation however gets to the heart of a very
  important issue for me.
  We need (I believe) to let the 'designers design' as
  much as we possibly can.
  That way we can work with them towards accessibility
  for everyone rather than appear to be hindering them
  in some way.
  I am not going to go into a web developer shop and
  tell the developers that they shouldn't choose the
  fonts that they (or more importantly their clients)
  want.
  Sure, I will let them know all the issues about
  accessibility of fonts and font sizes but that is not
  the same as saying they can't make informed decisions.

  There are many important issues to get across and
  (IMHO) the more I can let the 'designers design'  the
  easier it is for me to get the accessibility message
  across.

  As an aside isn't this one of the reasons for 'User
  Style Sheets'?
  That is, if the user doesn't like what the designer
  has chosen from a group of fonts, the user can
  override them?

  Cheers
  Graham Oliver
