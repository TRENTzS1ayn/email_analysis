Excerpts:

Under the terms of the merger, IWA will assume responsibility 
for all HWG operations, while preserving the HWG identity and 
programs during an expected twelve months transition period 
under direction of HWG Board of Directors. HWG has instituted 
several industry recognized programs including HWG online 
lasses, email discussion lists, The AWARE Center, and Gutenberg 
at HWG which will continue beyond transition under IWA 
direction. IWA will continue to maintain and promote these core 
association programs.

[...]

The HWG has a longstanding commitment to supporting accessibility
standards for the Web. HWG is the only individual membership 
association of web authors that participate through membership
in the  World Wide Web Consortium (www.w3.org).  IWA has agreed to
adopt HWG's accessibility policies and continue with support and
participation of W3C standards.
