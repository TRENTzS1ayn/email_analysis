I would say that your screen reader is trying to be extra smart, and has a
bug in that.

A map like you have described should be renderable directly. This is the new
HTML 4 model (well, it  was new 5 years ago) which adds block content
(paragraphs, lists, text links, etc) to the things that can be in a map.

In the old model the things in there were always invisible anyway, and they
were all "area" elements.

Check with the manufacturer of your screen reader.

The relevant part of the HTML spec is

  I have been trying out the <map> element as a way of organising sets

  am using reads out "start of map section navigation with 0 items" . -
  when there is a group of several links within the map tags.

  Does anyone use this, and can you write the code so that it will tell
  you how many links atre in the group, rather than saying "0" ?

  Does anyone know of sites that use the <map> element to group links?

  The html I was using is like this:

  <map title="section navigation">
  <A HREF="page1.htm">Topic 1</A> |
  <A HREF="page2.htm">Topic 2</A> |
  <A HREF="page3.htm">Topic 3</A> |
  <A HREF="page4.htm">Topic 4</A> |
  <A HREF="page5.htm">Topic 5</A>
  </map>

  Cheers all,
