This is invalid HTML, reflecting the fact that you are abusing the MAP
element.  MAP is required to have a name attribute, because it only
makes sense in the context of a USEMAP.  You also are in violatin of
a *should* requirement on the A elements; the syntax of SGML doesn't
really allow the DTD to enforce the requirement that A elements specify
regions.

Map is not a general means of grouping links, but specifically for
image maps.  A graphical browser, with images on, will not render it.
