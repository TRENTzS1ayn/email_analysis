HTML 4 introduced the concept of the map element as a general method for
grouping links. This was reinforced in HTML 4.01 when it was changed to allow
what already worked - text links and area elements being mixed (for backwards
compatibility).

You are correct about hte name attribute being required, although this
probably would have changed if we had done an even better job.

If the map element contains block content, and not just area elements, then
it should be rendered by graphical browsers, and the only one I know of that
didn't is amaya, where it is a registered bug that may have been fixed now.

  This is invalid HTML, reflecting the fact that you are abusing the MAP
  element.  MAP is required to have a name attribute, because it only
  makes sense in the context of a USEMAP.  You also are in violatin of
  a *should* requirement on the A elements; the syntax of SGML doesn't
  really allow the DTD to enforce the requirement that A elements specify
  regions.

  Map is not a general means of grouping links, but specifically for
  image maps.  A graphical browser, with images on, will not render it.
