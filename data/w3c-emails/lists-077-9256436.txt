Check out the Disabilities Statistics Center's FAQ under "What are the 
income and poverty levels of people with disabilities?"
http://www.dsc.ucsf.edu/

It doesn't break out people who are blind but does provide a source:
Kaye, H. S., and Longmore, P. K., (1997). Disability Watch: The Status of 
People with Disabilities in the
United States. Oakland, CA: Disability Rights Advocates.

Also take a look at their reports and publications.

Another source is the International Center for Disability Resources on the 
Internet (ICDRI).  They link to a number of documents about employment.  I 
haven't looked at any of them, so I don't know how relevant they are.
