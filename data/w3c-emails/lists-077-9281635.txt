aloha

the first question to be asked is:

1. what screen reader are you using? (please provide not only name, but
version number, as well - choose "Help" and then "About" to discern)

the second question to be asked is:

2. did you change any of the screen reader's default settings?

the third essential question is:

3. what browser are you using? (please provide not only name, but version
number, as well - choose "Help" and then "About" to discern)

using JAWS for Windows versions 3.x and 4.0 in conjunction with MSIE 5.5-SP1
or Lynx32 (version 2.8.4dev2), textual maps are handled without problem -
could you please also try the following test pages, in which the MAP element
is used to provide a navigation bar:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/tests/navbar.html
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/tests/accesskey1.html
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/tests/accesskey3.html
(the markup of the last 2 passes the W3C validator) - and report what you
hear?

when the MAP element does not contain graphics, JFW does not identify the
links contained within the MAP as "image map links" (when the
user-configurable setting "Say Link Type" is selected, which is the default
setting) as it does when it encounters an image map comprised of IMG
elements - for more information on JFW's HTML Options, consult:

gregory.
