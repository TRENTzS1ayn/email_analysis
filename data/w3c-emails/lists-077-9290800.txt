One of the arguments put forward for using PDF files
on web sites is that the content is not 'editable' by
the web site visitor, whereas an HTML page is easily
edited by the web site visitor.
So 'We use PDF files because our information is
copyrighted and we want to protect it' is an argument
put forward.
Is this right? 
What are the alternative perspectives?

Cheers
Graham Oliver
