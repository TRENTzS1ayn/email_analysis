If I have a pdf creation tool, I can often edit the document.  If I take
the trouble of converting the document say print and scan it with ocr I
can edit the document.  About the only thing a pdf does for you is look
the same no matter what platform you view it on.  It is not of course
directly edittable though.  It also looks more closely like the original
than any other format I am told.

Subject: PDF Files and Copyright


One of the arguments put forward for using PDF files
on web sites is that the content is not 'editable' by
the web site visitor, whereas an HTML page is easily
edited by the web site visitor.
So 'We use PDF files because our information is
copyrighted and we want to protect it' is an argument
put forward.
Is this right?
What are the alternative perspectives?

Cheers
Graham Oliver
