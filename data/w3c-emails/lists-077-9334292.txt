Yes, one thing that happens with banner adds is that as you are trying
to read a page with a screen reader, when they change, you are yanked
back to the top of the page often long before you have finished
examining the contents of the page.

Subject: Accessibility and Pop-Up Ads


I honestly don't browse enough with lynx or a voice browser to really
run
into a lot of pop up ads, but I just saw one which pretty much took over
the
entire page at weather.com (for a war movie on HBO. Planes flew all over
the
screen, and all sorts of other annoying things took place).

I guess i am wondering in what cases do banner ads / interstitial ads /
etc
impact browsing, and second to that, if banner ads, etc cause enough of
a
problem that they can make a page inaccessible.

I hope my questions make sense... any thoughts?

Denise
