Consider an ad as part of a page (that's the effect for the user). Does the
page (ad included) meet WCAG checkpoints?

  screen, and all sorts of other annoying things took place).

  I guess i am wondering in what cases do banner ads / interstitial ads / etc
  impact browsing, and second to that, if banner ads, etc cause enough of a
  problem that they can make a page inaccessible.

  I hope my questions make sense... any thoughts?
