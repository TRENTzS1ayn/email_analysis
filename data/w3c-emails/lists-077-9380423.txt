 Charles,

That is how I was.. approaching thinking of it. I am working on website
evaluation guidelines, and have just gotten into some of the worlds of "what
if" - this one being "what if the client is generating pop up ads." It seems
the most common sense to me, but its nice to get your feelings seconded!

Thanks!

Denise

Consider an ad as part of a page (that's the effect for the user). Does
the
page (ad included) meet WCAG checkpoints?
