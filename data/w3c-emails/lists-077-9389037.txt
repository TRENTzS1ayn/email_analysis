Advertisers will use any technique they can think of, until it gets
discredited, to distract the user from the nominal content of the page.
In the case of commercial pages, the nominal content is generally
secondary and the advert is the actual primary content, but it does seem
that governmental organisations are selling advertising space, and their
sites are not supposed to be a means of attracting people to the adverts.

Less reputable advertisers use deliberately misleading content to try
and trick people into clicking through.

The need of advertisers to distract means that they are always going to
violate rules that are there for people who have difficulty concentrating
on one part of the page.  Left to their own devices, advertisers will
always try to dominate the page.
