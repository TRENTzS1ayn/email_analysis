All the presentational features of PDF have to be easy to recover,
otherwise you couldn't print it!  If you can convert to PostScript, 
you can regenerate an unprotected PDF.  You will probably lose the newer
semantic markup, added for accessiblity, in doing this.  (Third party
PDF interpreters don't necessarily obey the copy protection flags.)

It is, however, true that PDF was designed with commercial requirements
(controlled layout, technical enforcement of copyright, etc.) in mind,
whereas HTML was designed for free distribution of information, which is
more of an academic requirement.
