I believe there are tools out there but they would possibly breech
the DMCA.

As a general rule about ways to prevent copying while allowing
viewing:
If you want to stop the average computer user copying something it's
pretty easy.
If you want to stop a technically minded user copying it's hard.
If you want to stop a hacker it's very hard and probably not possible
with pure-software solutions.
If you want to stop a commercial (legal or illegal) interest it's
impossible.

Once one of the above groups can copy the techniques trickle down
from mafia etc. -> hackers -> techies -> "normal" users.

As an example, DVD players for Linux were developed by hackers and
are currently moving from the techies to the "normal" users.

If you really want to prevent something from being copied you should
either not distribute it electronically or else rely on the law to
protect your copyright (tapes and CDs have been easy to copy for
years, but the Music Industry still makes billions).
