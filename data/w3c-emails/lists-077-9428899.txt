Hello all,

    Recently, I was asked to come up with an accessible way to provide
my organization's 'org chart' on-line.  Traditionally, these charts have
been put in PDF format, but (obviously) that poses barriers to some
users.

    I've whipped up a simplified (and fictional) version of what came to
mind and would love some feedback (either off-list or on) on the
effectiveness of this solution.  Any advice on better ways to do this
would also be appreciated.  The page is:

http://www.ncsu.edu/it/dss/webaccess/sample_org_chart.html

    This question, I think, is bigger than just org charts.  Perhaps a
broader way to phrase it is:  How do you best linearize tree-like
information?

Thanks in advance!
