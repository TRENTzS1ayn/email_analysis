Hello,
I thought it might be interesting to point out that in the US our copyright
law says that it is not an infringement of copyright law to provide the
published work in an accessible format.  In particular, I am referencing
section 121 which was added to our copyright code in September 1996 under
Public Law 104-197, 110 Stat. 2394, 2416.

This means that even if an organization is publishing in PDF so that it is
not "editable" as mentioned by Mr. Oliver, US law still provides copyright
protection when accessible formats are provided for use by people with
disabilities.  Hence, the argument that a publication must be in PDF to
protect copyright does not have merit when the issue is accessibility.

Best regards,
Cynthia Waddell

Subject: PDF Files and Copyright


One of the arguments put forward for using PDF files
on web sites is that the content is not 'editable' by
the web site visitor, whereas an HTML page is easily
edited by the web site visitor.
So 'We use PDF files because our information is
copyrighted and we want to protect it' is an argument
put forward.
Is this right?
What are the alternative perspectives?

Cheers
Graham Oliver
