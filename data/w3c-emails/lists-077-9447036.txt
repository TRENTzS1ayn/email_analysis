   Hello,
I thought it might be interesting to point out that in the US our copyright
law says that it is not an infringement of copyright law to provide the
published work in an accessible format.  In particular, I am referencing
section 121 which was added to our copyright code in September 1996 under
Public Law 104-197, 110 Stat. 2394, 2416.

       Interesting...Then, why do RFBD and the like have to do their stuff 
with special equipment and such? (RFBD does their tapes on 2-track recorders, 
instead of more common 4-track.)
