Hello Tyler:

Good question.  The first thing is to ask what kind of information you are trying to convey through the chart.  What does a sighted person get by looking at the chart.  The next step is to figure out a linking mechanism that can most closely model eye-brain information retrieval operations (if I glance up I can find out who is at the top); if I glance to the right I find out...).  Be careful of two-dimensional trees.  This is my term for trees that have perhaps two kinds of hierarchical information (maybe "consists of" and "supervises".  Can you do this with just one list of links or do you really have, in effect, two trees?
(Of course, a tree diagram is 2d when drawn on paper or screen but I'm focusing on logical dimensionality rather than display dimensionality)
For a linking mechanism, I look for:
1. Consistent link text - if you link by office name, use this throughout and have the same information for each office in the same order.
2. A level by level traversal is best, (I like the model of a book: Chapter titles, Sections, subsections- if I click on Chapter 1, sections for chapter 1 only come up)
3. leaf node material should appear at the top of the page followed by nonleaf nodes( links to the next level.)
I'm not sure if this helps.  Some of this may be just my preference.
