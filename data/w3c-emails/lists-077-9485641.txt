If it is really tree-like information, then XML is an ideal way to encode it.
You might like to use SVG to provide pictures and words together, in a way
that can use CSS to present the thing in a text view.

An example of this (but for a diagram of a network) is provide in the Note
Accessibilty Features of SVG - http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG-access

Or you might provide an XSLT transformation to produce HTML output.

I haven't done one of those yet, although it is on my "to-do" list.

  Hello all,

      Recently, I was asked to come up with an accessible way to provide
  my organization's 'org chart' on-line.  Traditionally, these charts have
  been put in PDF format, but (obviously) that poses barriers to some
  users.

      I've whipped up a simplified (and fictional) version of what came to
  mind and would love some feedback (either off-list or on) on the
  effectiveness of this solution.  Any advice on better ways to do this
  would also be appreciated.  The page is:

  http://www.ncsu.edu/it/dss/webaccess/sample_org_chart.html

      This question, I think, is bigger than just org charts.  Perhaps a
  broader way to phrase it is:  How do you best linearize tree-like
  information?

  Thanks in advance!
