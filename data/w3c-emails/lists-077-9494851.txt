Hello

I have some questions relating to the use of 'alt'  tags which I hope
someone may be able to help with.  See http://www.immi.gov.au/

The problem we have is that when an alt tag appears on a navigation item, it
obscures part of the secondary navigation.  Tags also 'appear' to take a
while to disappear.
(EG: hover over : Visiting Australia nav item) 

With accessibility in mind:

1. Is there any way to choose where to place an alt tag in relation to the
image it is describing or does it always appear just below 'the hand'?

2. Can you control the length of time an 'alt' tag appears onscreen?

3. Does anyone have any alternative suggestions to the 'alt' tag for the nav
items (which at this point must remain as images).

4. There have been instances when surfing that 'alt' tags have appeared, yet
when images are turned off some do not get labelled with their alternative
text.  Does anyone know why this occurs?  See http://www.aahc.com.au/

Thanks in advance
