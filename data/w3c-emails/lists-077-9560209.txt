One should always set a foreground colour when one uses a background
image.  One should always set a background colour when one sets a 
foreground colour.  Therefore one should always have both a background
colour and background image.

This means that one gets good colour contrasts with and without images
and before the image loads.  Also, there is no sudden colour change when
the image loads.

One shouldn't, of course, have background images with strongly different
intensities in different parts (as people might try to do everything in
one image, as one can't then have a right background colour.
