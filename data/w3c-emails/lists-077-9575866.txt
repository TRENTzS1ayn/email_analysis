DENVER, COLORADO: The Mile High City
www.aace.org/conf/edmedia/aboutdenver.htm

Denver, the mile high city, is young, exciting and growing. In the past
five years, Denver has built three new sports stadiums, a new airport, a
new downtown amusement park, a new world class aquarium, several major
new
shopping centers, a new downtown entertainment complex and a variety of
other new attractions.

Located in the middle of the United States, Denver is a unique city,
rich
in diversity and culture. Denver has one of the largest downtowns in
America and it's the hottest entertainment district in the West. There's
something to do in Denver almost 24-hours a day.

At the center of the downtown activity is the Denver Pavilions, a
two-square block entertainment complex with a Hard Rock Caf?, NikeTown,
Virgin Records, 15 cinemas, restaurants, nightspots and 50 stores on
three
levels. Free shuttle buses cruise the 16th Street Mall as often as every
90
seconds, making everything in Downtown convenient and easy to reach.

For Tony-award-winning theatre, symphony, opera, Broadway road shows and
dance, there's the Denver Performing Arts Complex, the largest
performing
arts center in the world under one roof. Within easy walking distance
are
the Denver Art Museum, the Colorado History Museum and the U.S. Mint.

With 300 days of bright sunshine a year, Denver is the place for
enjoying
the great outdoors, and surprisingly, much of it is downtown. From the
ED-MEDIA 2002 location at the Hyatt Hotel, the beautiful formal gardens
at
The Civic Center Park is just a short walk away. And Six Flags Elitch
Gardens, America's only downtown theme park, features more than 48
thrill
rides, a complete water adventure park, elaborate gardens, shows and
more.
In metropolitan Denver, you can visit the Denver Zoo, the fourth most
popular zoo in America and the home of more than 3,500 animals.

 From the breathtaking beauty of the Rocky Mountains to the culture,
sports, color and entertainment of the city, Denver is an ideal location
for ED-MEDIA 2002. We look forward to seeing you there.
