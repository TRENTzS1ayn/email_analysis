Hi Gregory

I'm using Home Page Reader 3.0, which works with IE 5. I have changed 
some of the defaults, but none to do with "map" as you don't get the 
option. I tried your first example page 
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/tests/navbar.html and got the same result as 
with my test page, ie when it gets to the map element it reads "start 
of map with 0 items" then reads the links, then "end of map".

Cheers

Rebecca
