Hi

I don't suppose anyone has a copy of this article?

Below is a link to an LA Times story.  It, perhaps, may be the best
example
of how resolving disability issues will change lives that I have
seen yet.
(In that the web gives a quality of life that just.. otherwise might
not
exist for people).

I went to have a look, but it doesn't seem to be appearing anymore and has
probably been archived

Thanks in advance
Sharon Dennison
