AG:: but not totally.  Actually, in Viral's example it is arguable that it
would be better to have the left hand column be coded as THs because that is
what you need to have in mind as context to grasp what an individual rate
quote
in the body is telling you.  But this is a) too pedantic for the assitive
technologies to have bothered with it -- they follow author usage mostly,
don't
lead it and b) is what the assistive techniques assume anyway, that the first
row and first column spell out the coordinate axes for the rest.

AG:: au contraire, TFOOT was invented for bottom margin headers to stay on
screen as the body data is scrolled.  So if you have a TFOOT it probably
contains things that should be classed as THs.

Google for "THEAD TFOOT" there is a page talking about scrolling that comes
up.
