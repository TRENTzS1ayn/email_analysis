aloha - since yesterday, i've been compiling and updating a local resource
page for VICUG NYC (the Visually Impaired Computer Users' Group of New
York City) and the metro area in general - the resource is located at:
http://www.hicom.net/~oedipus/vicug/wtc_emergency_info.html

since one of VICUG NYC's "core" constituencies is the deaf-blind community
in NYC, i am issuing a request for captioned resources about the attack,
its aftermath, the continuing investigation, etc. - please send them
directly to me (oedipus@hicom.net) as well as to the list

also, if anyone has any information about similar resources for the
various "disabled communities" in the NYC area, please let me know, and
please redistribute this request and the above-listed URL as appropriate.

thank you, gregory j. rosmaita
webmaster & minister of propaganda, VICUG NYC
