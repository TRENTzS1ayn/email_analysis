Hi Jamie,

My experience has been to include a "0" [zero] in the blank cells of a
table such as your immigration table. These can be hidden from (most)
sighted users with a span class for the cell [eg .hide {  visibility:
hidden}], but will be read out by a screen reader thus giving a blind
person better orientation within the columns of your table.

WRT an empty table head element, why doesn't the top-left cell describe the
labels in column 1? If this is not needed visually, then again it could
have a span class applied to hide it.

Hope this helps, Andrew

I'm glad this came up. I have a couple of other questions:

How should I mark up an 'empty' table head element - a table were there
is no header - as is sometimes the case with the top left-hand cell?

Is it ok to include &nbsp; in empty cells?

If anyone has the time to check this page and let me know if it looks ok
(I fear I might have followed the W3C exapmle too literally) I would
really appreciate it. (BTW I know I am not allowed the border color in
the table, I'm still trying to make this work in CSS):

I hope you will forgive me for asking what seem like trivial questions
at a time of such crisis and sadness for many of you.

Thanks in anticipation
Jamie Mackay
