David,

I tried using the CLASS with the TD elements, but the visual effect
collapses - see http://members.optushome.com.au/amja/wai/span-test.html

> sighted users with a span class for the cell [eg .hide {  visibility:

Used as a first choice, it becomes FONT by another name, and is used that
way be many authoring tools.
