strategies, which is an open issue across multiple groups.]

   supports a new event, onmousewheel. The onmousewheel event is
   triggered when the user rotates the wheel button. The event object can
   be queried to find all the event's properties. Only the onmousewheel
   event exposes the wheelDelta property. The wheelDelta property
   indicates the direction and the length of the wheel rotation. The
   length is given in a multiple of 120. A negative wheelDelta indicates
   the wheel has been rotated towards the user. A positive value
   indicates it was rotated away from the user. Put your mouse on the
   image below and rotate the wheel button. The image should change its
   position on the page:

Anything named onInputHappening is broken on delivery in terms of disability
access to webApplication behavior.

The action, the object method, must be identified, and as a second step bound
to actualInterface degrees of freedom such as a down event on the left button
on a mouse, or in this case, a measurable rotation of the wheel on a
wheelMouse.  Only by assuring that the input acceptor is adequately described
can we [with a majority of successes rather than a majority of failures]
provide third parties with a usable capability to inject successful bindings
from alternate device or emulator arrangements.
