It would be interesting to find out whether it ends up in the DOM at a later

I don't really understand why this is considered MS centric, wheel
implementation seems to be a huge bonus,
the one I have is by Logitech...

I contacted ig, mozilla, gimp, konqueror, javascript-newsgroup, Waco and no
doubt a few others, to find out if there was a javascript function, without
success. I've yet to try it out, as I had given up until today.

thanks again
