Because the mousewheel concept was developed (commercially at least)
by MS and Logitech and because the only time I've heard of it
mentioned by *nix coders they say they use 120 as the delta value for
mousewheel code because they figure future-proofing in the same
manner of MS is likely to be a winner. There is no reason for using
120 rather than 60, 100, 180, 200, 240 or another easily divisible
number other than someone had to decide on one and MS decided on 120
(although it does have obvious advantages as a choice).
