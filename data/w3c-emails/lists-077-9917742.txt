A recent article discussing navigation, graphics bloating & consistency of 
design (mainly on e-commerce sites) from a usability perspective. However, 
seems to me, focusing on accessibility in these same areas goes a long way 
toward overall accessibility.

Sites for sore eyes demand a dose of simplicity
there are a lot of people doing some very good things with Web design. But 
there are a lot of people who aren't.
