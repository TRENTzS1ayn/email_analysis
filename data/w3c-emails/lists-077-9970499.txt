       Maybe not totally. One issue I found interesting was the fact that 
many of those who were wheelchair-bound or otherwise disabled were basically 
marked to die in the collapse of the WTC towers. Web designers and tech 
personnel in general, as well as the firms many work for, are some of the 
largest engines of the economy. I believe we could do the world a great 
service by pushing not just for an accessible web, but at least escapeable 
buildings as well. Does it relate to the www? No, not totally. But I've 
tended to take a larger view of technology accessibility than most, I admit. 
The web itself being accessible means little if people can't get to someplace 
to use it, can't use it safely, or have to put themselves at risk to use it 
in otherwise "normal" situations.
