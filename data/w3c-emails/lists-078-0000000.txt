Hi all

I've had a quick peek in the archives but either I'm missing it or it's not
there. Are there any issues raised by the use of inline styling rather than
using a linked style sheet?

thanks in advance

Julian Scarlett

btw I got my knuckles severely rapped for publicly criticising the fact that
Sheffield's online voting site was inaccessible. This suggest to me that
there are people who subscribe to this list who's main agenda is *not* the
provision of accessible web pages. Thanks folks (you know who you are) for
taking the interest in my postings but it won't stop me voicing my opinions;
I just won't be able to do it from work and this will hamper my efforts to
get a good service for the people of Sheffield. From now on everything that
I say on this list that may be regarded as my employers as controversial
will be done under a pseudonym. ;-)
