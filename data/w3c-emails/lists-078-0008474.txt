the answer to your question is not only no, it is not even possible to
access the application with the bridge unless everything is just so.

Subject: Java and accessibility


I have been looking at different authoring tools and was wondering if in
general whether it is possible to access software that has been designed
using Java with a screen reader, without having to install the Java
access
bridge and the utilities?
