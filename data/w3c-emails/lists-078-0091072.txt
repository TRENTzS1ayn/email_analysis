Like it or not, when processed with essentially linear technology, it *will*
be linearised (even if you put a table of contents at the top, for random
access, that will be linearised).  Given that, the choice is between *a*
logical linearisation, and the mess you get if you read a typical newspaper
layout from top to bottom within left to right (assumes western European
page layouts).  If you read a newspaper in the way that a typical web
page linearises, you would end up switching between two or three articles.

(Even PDF has had linearisation support for such layouts for a long time,
although I've never seen it used in anger.)
