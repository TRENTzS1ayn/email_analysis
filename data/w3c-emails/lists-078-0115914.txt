I think the reason that people like the narrow definition is that
it is more commercially acceptable.  Companies don't like catering
for what they consider unprofitable markets (leaving aside the
validity of that judgement) but, providing everyone else is in the
same position, they are more comfortable in supporting people that
they can imagine being themselves in later life of their children than
people in general.  The people here running a consultancy or addressing
accessibility on behalf of their employers have to take account of this
to remain in business/employed; you can possibly see some of this in the
person who recently reported that they had had to double subscribe to
allow them to express their own opinions.
