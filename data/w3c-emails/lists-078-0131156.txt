I have published a new article on the Making Connections Unit (MCU) Website
about access issues related to the use of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).  You
can find it here: http://www.mcu.org.uk/articles/cssaccessproblems.html

In this article: 

* How CSS is being used to mimic proper HTML tags.
* Why using standard HTML is still important.
* Why using cascading style sheets improperly can make Web pages less
accessible.

I am interested to hear your feedback. Of course I don't want to discourage
people from using CSS for presentation and layout, but I think it is worth
highlighting possible accessibility problems that may occur when using them.

If you have an article related to accessible Web design and would like to
publish it on the MCU Website, don't hesitate to get in touch.

All the best,
Jim
