peepo.com offers a google site search facility,

I like to leave old parts of the site up as an archive

I don't want the search facility to find them, unless this is a history 
search.

I need to link to them, for instance in news items.

howto ensure that the search facility only links to items in the 
'current' site.

I seem to have got in a bind as the free version only seems to search 
complete domains.

I would not want to exclude the google robot...

thanks

jonathan
