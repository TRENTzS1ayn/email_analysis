Hi Jim,

A good piece - your have a reasonable point and argue it well. On the
downside I would say that it only gives part of the story. You make the
point that using e.g. <SPAN> rather than <H1> for things that are headers is
lacking something, though you don't actually pin down what it is. IMHO, I'd
say that thing was metadata, that h1 should be considered more important
than h2 and so on. It can be reasonably argued that the use of 'legacy' HTML
3.2 markup is one way of providing such information, and I think that is
essentially what you do in this piece. Another way may be to use named
classes, like "tophead" in your example, though of course it would be better
if they came from well-known vocabularies - class="h1" perhaps? Hopefully in
years to come the W3C's activities in the region of metadata will develop
and provide a consistent, simple approach to situations like this, and we
won't need to rely on a vocabulary of maybe two dozen terms plus fairly
arbitrary nesting rules to explain our document's structure (at this point
somebody reminds me of a standard that does this already ;-). For now at
least, I reckon what you've written makes good pragmatic sense.

Cheers,
Danny.
