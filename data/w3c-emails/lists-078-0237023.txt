I think you have done it correctly. The LABEL element works for me with
Window-Eyes and HPR giving the cost of each shipping option (I didn't try
JFW). One can argue that this is not adequate information and you need both
the timing and the cost. In that case, given the tabular structure, you
could use the title attribute on the input elements to specify their
"prompt," rather than the LABEL.

Subject: another forms question


I have a form inside a data table. The code in question is part of our
shopping cart and is located at
http://www.iqnetcom.com/validate/canpost.htm. The user is given a list of
shipping costs based on different delivery dates and asked to choose one.
The table is organized into 3 columns in the following order: date, price,
select  with all the proper data table markup.

I've put a label tag around the price and the id for it in the input tag of
the appropriate radio button.

Some JAWS users report not being able to access the date in forms mode and
others report not being able to tell which radio button goes with which
price. They seem to think that the radio button is on a different line than
the price when they are in the same row.

How do I code this so that all the information that is needed to make a
decision is "seen" by a screen reader? The information has to stay in this
table data format.

thanks,
