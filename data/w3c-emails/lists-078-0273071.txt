id="" values must begin with a letter. Yours are all numbers, like
id="19.59". Given how many HTML elements and attributes Jaws fails
to support, I would be very surprised if this minor legalistic
transgression were the cause, but it is something. The page does not
quite validate.

These are not entirely conclusive suggestions, I admit.

From everything I've read, Jaws is majorly imperfect in interpreting
forms. It is possible that you are doing everything right and it is
still screwing things up.
