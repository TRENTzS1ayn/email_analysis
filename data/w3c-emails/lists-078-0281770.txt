Jim,

I'm not sure exactly what you mean. I can't seem to find form examples where
title is used. I've copied the code from one of the table rows and added the
title attribute the to input tag. Is this what you mean?

<tr>
<td headers="t1">Monday May 13, 2002 AM</td>
<td headers="t2"><label for="S27.57">$27.57</label></td>
<td headers="t3"><input type="radio" name="PRODUCT_ID" id="S27.57"
title="delivery Monday May 13, 2002 AM" ></td>
</tr>

Joe Clark pointed out that the label and id values have to start with a
letter so I've added that change as well to the example above.

Thanks to both of you for your feedback.
