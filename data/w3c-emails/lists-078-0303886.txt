Hi folks, this is just personal news. Some of you may know that I've
been busy since the start of the year working on a book on Cascading
Style Sheets -- SAMS' Teach Yourself CSS in 24 Hours. The writing and
reviewing and editing work is now done on that, which means that around
the start of July you'll be able to buy it. It's an introductary book
aimed at people with HTML experience who haven't learned CSS yet, and
takes you from a CSS beginner all the way up to a proficient expert.

The Web site is just a placeholder for now, but will be located at
http://www.cssin24hours.com/ -- I'm working on it this week, so if you
have suggestions as to what makes a good book site, email me privately
at kynn@cssin24hours.com.

I am now free again to look for paying work with this book completed,
and so if you need a Web accessibility guy for contract or permanent
jobs, please let me know. Hopefully things will turn out better than
the disappointment that was Edapta and the travesty that was Reef.
(For those of you looking for software for dynamically adaptable
web sites, don't even bother with Reef EveryWare. The Edapta stuff
we were working on in 2000 is dead, but the good news is that Reef
will soon be dead too at their current rate; there is a little
justice left in the world.  It's a shame, though, that such a keen
concept and great worked was killed by a petty man's shameless
incompetence and greed.)

Anyway, if I've ignored any email from any of you in the last few
months, please drop me a note reminding me what it was, and I'll beg
for forgiveness and answer you now. Thanks.
