Hi all,

just a quickie. I have a page (several actually) with a 'skip links' link at
the top of the main nav menu. On showing this to some sighted users who I
would assess as having limited experience of the internet but make up a
sizeable proportion of my target audience I became aware that this link was
confusing them. I therefore wanted to hide it and attached a css class with
visibility set to hidden. Does doing this present any problems for the
people that would benefit from a 'skip links' link. I'm pretty sure that
screen readers will pick up the hidden link but just wanted to make sure.
Any comments?
