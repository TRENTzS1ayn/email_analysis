Yes, this presents problems for sighted keyboard users if they don't know the
link is there. It isn't a massive problem - if they land on an invisible link
they can find out where it goes to normally, but they can be surprised by the
strange navigation pattern and can't count properly to get to a link they
were aiming at.

As much as anything the wording is a hassle...

cheers

Chaals.

  Hi all,

  just a quickie. I have a page (several actually) with a 'skip links' link at
  the top of the main nav menu. On showing this to some sighted users who I
  would assess as having limited experience of the internet but make up a
  sizeable proportion of my target audience I became aware that this link was
  confusing them. I therefore wanted to hide it and attached a css class with
  visibility set to hidden. Does doing this present any problems for the
  people that would benefit from a 'skip links' link. I'm pretty sure that
  screen readers will pick up the hidden link but just wanted to make sure.
  Any comments?
