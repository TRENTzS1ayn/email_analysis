There are sighted users out there (like me) who would like to be able to see
it and use it in a normal graphical-rendering browser like Opera. If we can't
see it we don't know we can use it.

You can partially hide it - making it change colour with something like

a:link.hidden { visibility:hidden }
a:hover.hidden a:focus.hidden { /* something that makes it stand out */ }

Peepo.com used this technique to avoid showing lots of alphabetical stuff at
once. I suspect it might be a good compromise...

  Would it also be possible to add the link the same colour as the background so that it is hidden from sighted users, but those with screenreaders can still access it?

  perhaps rewording the link will help.  Say something like "move to main
  content" and they get the idea?

  Hi all,

  just a quickie. I have a page (several actually) with a 'skip links'
  link at
  the top of the main nav menu. On showing this to some sighted users who
  I
  would assess as having limited experience of the internet but make up a
  sizeable proportion of my target audience I became aware that this link
  was
  confusing them. I therefore wanted to hide it and attached a css class
  with
  visibility set to hidden. Does doing this present any problems for the
  people that would benefit from a 'skip links' link. I'm pretty sure that
  screen readers will pick up the hidden link but just wanted to make
  sure.
  Any comments?

  tia
