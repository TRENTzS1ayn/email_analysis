Julian stated that he wanted to hide it, I gave information that could offer a way of doing that. Whether it is good or bad was not the intention of the original post nor my answer.

However, while on that subject, this was featured in a post back in 1999: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/1999JulSep/0413.html

The suggestion here is the use of an arrow to denote link skipping, or skip to main content, and was up for proposal within the WAI. So, what was the decision? Finding that out will probably answer the question that David is posing and that Charles hinted at.

I agree that it (the link skipper) is not just for visually-impaired users, so surely this has been dealt with in much detail previously and a protocol assigned accordingly, has it not?

but that defeats the purpose of it.  If I am a keyboard user as Chas
points ot and I am sighted I will miss count because there is a link I
don't see.  On the other hand, if I have low vision and my window on the
world is small, I wwould like to be able to see the link so I can jump
to what matters.

Would it also be possible to add the link the same colour as the
background so that it is hidden from sighted users, but those with
screenreaders can still access it?

perhaps rewording the link will help.  Say something like "move to main
content" and they get the idea?

Hi all,

just a quickie. I have a page (several actually) with a 'skip links'
link at
the top of the main nav menu. On showing this to some sighted users who
I
would assess as having limited experience of the internet but make up a
sizeable proportion of my target audience I became aware that this link
was
confusing them. I therefore wanted to hide it and attached a css class
with
visibility set to hidden. Does doing this present any problems for the
people that would benefit from a 'skip links' link. I'm pretty sure that
screen readers will pick up the hidden link but just wanted to make
sure.
Any comments?

tia
