display:none is meant to prevent all rendering including aural; note that
the description of speak:none; says "Suppresses aural rendering so that the
element requires no time to render. Note, however, that descendants may
override this value and will be spoken. (To be sure to suppress rendering of
an element and its descendants, use the 'display' property)."

All elements must have some sort of formatting structure; though the effect
of that formatting structure would vary according to the output medium.
"display" controls the formatting structure rather than visual appearance,
the use of the word "display" is a relic from the fact that CSS1 only really
considered visual media, and is a bit of a misnomer (cf the CSS term
"canvas").
