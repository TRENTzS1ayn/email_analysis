I agree with your problem and diagnosis, but I wonder if a different
solution might be in order.  Change the wording to (for example)
the value of the <Hn> element introducing the next section of the
page.  To make it really clear to many of your sighted users what has
happened when they clicked the link, you could add an onclick event
that will actively highlight the next section.
