The most inclusive compromise I've seen is:
(1) Use a text link (skip navigation, skip menu, skip to content, etc)
(2) Use script to style the text color to match the background
(3) Use the Onfocus event of the link to change the text to a contrasting 
color
(4) Optionally, reset the color with the Onblur event.

(See the main navigation at http://www.msfw.com/Accessibility/ for an 
example)

With this approach, the skip link will:
(1) be read by (present) screen readers
(2) be visible to sighted keyboard-users when it is tabbed to
(3) not distract other sighted users
(4) fail over to being a visible text link if scripts aren't supported

As has been mentioned, invisible image links can't be read by sighted 
keyboard users (note that tool tips, either from alt or title, don't appear 
when a link is tabbed to, at least in Internet Explorer).

A potential drawback would be if search engines would flag this as an 
attempt to skew results by hiding words on the page. (With the color being 
set as a style from within a script, it would have to be one sophisticated 
search engine -- anyone know for sure?)
