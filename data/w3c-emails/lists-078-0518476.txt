That's not always true. Many individuals with physical disabilities who use 
adapted keyboarding devices instead of mice find it excruciatingly slow to 
tab through long, repeated lists of navigation links.

While the concept may have been initially conceived to assist screen-reader 
users, is there any sound argument why this shouldn't apply to individuals 
with physical disabilities as well? The 508 requirement ("A method shall be 
provided that permits users to skip repetitive navigation links") doesn't 
appear to suggest anything to that effect.

(Personally, I happen to feel that this requirement makes more sense as a 
user agent feature rather than for individual web pages, but I guess that 
discussion will have to wait for the next revision of the standards...)
