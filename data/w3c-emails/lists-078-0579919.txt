 I was trying something like this today:

Respond.org.uk: <a 
href="http://www.respond.org.uk/help/index.html">Challenging sexual 
abuse in the lives of people with a <a title="learning 
disability">LD</a></a>

I expect someone else can think up a better example, and it is hardly a 
very serious issue, just thought I'd mention it.
