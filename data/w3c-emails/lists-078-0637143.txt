I wouldn't bother. <abbr> and <acronym>, which are what you're
really getting at here, are useful only for *unfamiliar*
acronyms, and WAI, which doesn't get out much, is singularly
incapable of recognizing this, going so far as to mark up the
acronym WWW in its examples.

If you really, really insisted on doing this, you should use
<acronym title="learning disability">LD</acronym> inside <a></a>.
Presumably that would validate.

I cannot imagine how this approach is in any way helpful. One
suspects that every reader of your page will know what "LD" means.
In any event, you need annotate only the first occurrence of the
term to comply with the spec.

I use <abbr> and <acronym> myself, with stylesheets to make them
overt. I just don't expect them to be very useful.
