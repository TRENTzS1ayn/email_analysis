Marking up abbreviations can be very helpful in ensuring adequate 
representation of keywords in site searches.  Consider a search for "World 
Wide Web" versus a search for "www" - both are contextually very different, 
and will yield unique results.  Increasing the relevance of search results 
is a keystone of accessibility in my opinion.

Further, users with cognitive disabilities such as memory loss, and 
attention disorders could receive benefit from abbreviation markup if their 
browser/agent supports tool-tips for them.
