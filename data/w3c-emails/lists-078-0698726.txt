Good summary, good review of the topic.

One small wrinkle:  

It is possible to do all that for a superclass that subsumes both of these.  There doesn't need to be a clear distinction between them to have adequately defined constraints on what will happen with either.

But it could help.

One operational distinction that would seem to matter is a difference in "TTS mode hint" that is 'speak' in one case and 'spell' in another case.
