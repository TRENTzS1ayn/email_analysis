Subject: Inaccessible Web sites


Hello all
I'm in need of some outstanding examples of web sites that are
inaccessible to a Jaws user. This is for a tv documentary about
disabilities. They want an example of a page that's poorly
designed..we'll explain what's wrong with it. I thought you guys
might have run across a really great example of what NOT to do.
Thanks in advance for your help.
Lulu
