Here we will have a problem of internationalization.
If the explanation that gives Mr. Ben Meadowcroft is correct, it contradicts
the explanation and the form in that we understand the difference between
abbreviations and acr?nimos, in Spanish, according to the Real Spanish
Academy of the Spanish Language in answer to a consultation that I made him:
http://209.204.223.237/abrvsacr.htm

For us the difference doesn't consist in if the abbreviation is pronounced
or not like a word. For us the difference rests in if we "translate" what
means, or not.

For example, in Spanish, "F.B.I." it is an acr?nimo (We pronounce the
initials, we don't translate their meaning, maybe in English when somebody
finds that abbreviated form he/she reads: "Federal Bureau of
Investigation"). That which means that in the future it can have
difficulties to locate terms if some automatic system can make searches in
the net for acronyms and of abbreviations.

Emmanuelle

Good summary, good review of the topic.

One small wrinkle:

It is possible to do all that for a superclass that subsumes both of these.
There doesn't need to be a clear distinction between them to have adequately
defined constraints on what will happen with either.

But it could help.

One operational distinction that would seem to matter is a difference in
"TTS mode hint" that is 'speak' in one case and 'spell' in another case.
