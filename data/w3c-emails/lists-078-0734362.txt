Examples I use in my Creating Accessible Web Sites course are any news
sites.  Some really good examples (although they are Canadian) are
www.canada.com/ottawa, www.cbc.ca, www.canada.com

Sports sites are also good examples of inaccesibility,

www.nascar.com

Hope some of these help,

Hello all
I'm in need of some outstanding examples of web sites that are
inaccessible to a Jaws user. This is for a tv documentary about
disabilities. They want an example of a page that's poorly
designed..we'll explain what's wrong with it. I thought you guys might
have run across a really great example of what NOT to do. Thanks in
advance for your help. Lulu
