Well, this looks pretty thorough (although I would expect nothing less
<grin/>). There is some initial work on captions using SVG from WGBH - and
there is a public mailing list at W3C for discussion of potential work on a
"Timed text" format - i.e. some kind of standard that would allow for a
single method of providing text such as captions and subtitles. Most of the
discussion  there is about requirements for such a format, and I suspect Joe
is a good person to work on this.

Cheers

  level of typography for captioning (and, begrudgingly, for

  Any more examples I should add that are notably different from what
  I've got there?
