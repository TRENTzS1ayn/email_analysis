I hope he has registered the problems with Bugzilla.   I wonder though
if he is confusing rendering behaviour with what is actually specified
in HTML 4.  I can't imagine there is much scope for Netcape to get
HTML 4 wrong.  I know it still gets bits of CSS wrong (I have uncleared
Bugzilla reports on its handling of z-order), but most sites break 
because of Document Object Model issues.
