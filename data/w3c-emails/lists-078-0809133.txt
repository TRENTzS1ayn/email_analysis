This can be easy, if you can use default text that is guaranteed to be
invalid - e.g. non-numeric data in a numeric field. It is a problem though.

I'm afraid javascript is the only way to do this in most browsers AFAIK. On
the bright side it is a relatively easy piece of script to write in a manner
that degrades well to non-javascript user-agents.
