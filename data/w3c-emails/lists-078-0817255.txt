Oops, yes I did mean that. Sorry.

I think I may have misunderstood something here. I was (am) under the
impression that whatever I, as an author, decide to put in a text area to
designate it's intended use  is the actual place-holding characters. Jukka's
statement about them conflicting with *genuine* values provided by the
authors seems to suggest that my understanding is wrong. What then, is a
place-holding character and how does it differ from , for example, my
decision as an author to put "enter your name here" in a text input that is
for a user to type in their name. I must admit to being a tad confused now. 

If there is a difference between the two and I do not use place-holding
characters how can I achieve AAA accessibility?

thanks
Julian.
