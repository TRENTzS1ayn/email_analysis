would that it were true that we could now abandon the practice but in
fact, there are still many people not using the latest and greatest or
even the updates or two before them or who are using application
combinations whose feature set is still dinosauric.  I would not make
the leap just yet unless you know that your targets do not fit the
above.

In fact the Checkpoint text is "Until user agents handle empty controls
correctly, include default, place-holding characters in edit boxes and
text
areas".

In order to decide whether this is still required to meet triple-A
conformance it is important to have some idea of whether or not User
Agents
handle empty controls correctly. Unfortunately here we have to decide
for
ourselves unless and until the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
group
provides some criteria.

So until there is any better information, my understanding is that User
Agents do handle empty controls correctly, so not including default
place-holding characters does not violate this checkpoint any more. In
some
cases it is obviously helpful to have a default, but I agree wuth Jukka
that
having proper labels is the real solution to explaining what the form
control
is for (and that is already required by a higher priority checkpoint).

  If you use initially empty input fields, you don't achieve AAA
  accessibility. One might say that you then need to decide between
  accessibility and compliance with some rules for accessibility. :-)
For
  example, when asking for a person's name, there's no point in putting
any
  initial value into the field _unless_ you have some information of
what the
  user's name might be.
