(You mean Guideline 10.4. (It is at priority level 3.))

Many people share your opinions and views. The "place-holding
characters"
might help people using some old software, but they probably cause more
problems than benefits. Besides, they are illogical, and using them
conflicts with genuine default values provided by authors.

You can't.

My advice is: Don't use place-holding characters. (They are sometimes
claimed to give information about the kind of data that is expected, but
any
need for such hints is caused by lack of adequate explanations and
labels
before the fields.)
