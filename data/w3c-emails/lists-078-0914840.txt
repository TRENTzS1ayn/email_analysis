Myself included, FWIW.  IMNSHO, guidelines should always steer well
clear of advocating anything likely to be harmful (e.g. confusing)
either

Agreed.

A technique I occasionally use is to populate a field with a help
string, and use an onfocus event to clear it the first time the
field gets focus.  But whether that is a good idea is more a matter
of usability than accessibility.

<input name="date" value="YYYY-MM-DD" onfocus="value=''">

shouldn't be too confusing, but can never be more than an ad-hoc usage.
