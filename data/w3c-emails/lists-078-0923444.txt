I forwarded it to the list because I wanted to take back something from
this list which I did take back.  We are not to cross post so I felt it
best to do this.  I have also encouraged people to look at the other
posts on this topic in the archives and to join wai ig if their
attitudes are right.

Who is this?  Are his views worth any more than his vague references to
"html 4.x complient[sic]" or "good web development work"?  Is there any
reason to suppose this was anyone other than a clueless deezyner who
thinks it should look exactly the same as it does in frontpage?

That would require the problems to be formulated.  If he can formulate
them for Bugzilla, then presumably he can also do so in whatever forum
this post appeared.

In short, why the **** was that post forwarded to this list?
