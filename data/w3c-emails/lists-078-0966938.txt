and of course, if It never is sensed that onfocus has been triggered,
you still have to clear it manually but at least you know what format
the date should take.

Myself included, FWIW.  IMNSHO, guidelines should always steer well
clear of advocating anything likely to be harmful (e.g. confusing)
either

Agreed.

A technique I occasionally use is to populate a field with a help
string, and use an onfocus event to clear it the first time the
field gets focus.  But whether that is a good idea is more a matter
of usability than accessibility.

<input name="date" value="YYYY-MM-DD" onfocus="value=''">

shouldn't be too confusing, but can never be more than an ad-hoc usage.
