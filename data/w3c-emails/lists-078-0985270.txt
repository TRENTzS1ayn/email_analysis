I may have jumped the gun a little here and not seen what your exact
requirements were.  Maybe we are both looking for different things.  

In the Creating Accessible Web Sites course we compare the site in both
a visual browser and Lynx to ensure you are receiving the same
information.  We test to see if the "alt" attributes in the images are
appropriate and convey the proper information.  If tables are used for
layout with spacer graphics, do the spacer graphics for the proper "alt"
attribute {alt=""}.  We do listen to hear how the page is spoken (for
example on the CBC site the link to "full story" has spaces between each
letter and is in uppercase, likely to be spoken F  U   L  L ...).  Is
the site in scalable text..  We check to ensure that if you had a
mobility problem could you activate the main and side navigation with
ease.  Can you make the clickable area larger?  Do the text links make
sense when taken out of context?  For example most news sites will have
a large number of links "Full Story" when hearing a list of the links
that are available on any page.

Does the site use forms?  Do they use radio buttons?  Can you activate
the search function?

I hope this helps clarify why I listed the sites in my previous email.
I personal feel that the news sites are missing a huge audience as their
web sites are not very accessible, and in most cases information is
missing (when viewing in Lynx).  I also realized the audience they are
excluding was never part of their target audience prior to the WWW.

I really enjoy this list and refer to many of you (generally, not my
name) in my courses concerning accessibility.
