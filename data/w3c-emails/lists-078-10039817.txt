msreader if you use windows and a sound card is quite good.  The book is
well structured so if you can take advantage of the latest acrobat
reader, you can also use it there.  I too however in the spirit of
better coverage and more universal access would like to see the book
made available in a form such as html.  I'll be happy to make a tape and
someone can put it on cd of the msreader voice reading the book.

How about offering the eBook in a more accessible format? eBooks aren't
good
and PDF only marginally better for us blind types.

Cheers

HiSoftware has recently published a book  "Understanding Accessibility"
(ISBN - 1-930616-03-1). This book, is a guide to creating and testing
Web
sites that are developed to the U.S. federal standards for accessible
Web
content, and the World Wide Web, or W3C, accessibility guidelines. This
book
provides a reference on accessibility remediation. It also provides
guidelines for accessible Web design, and information that will assist
organizations in integrating accessibility into their existing quality
assurance and content management practices.

HiSoftware Publishing is currently in the process of developing the
second
edition of the book, which will address WCAG 1.0 guidelines Priority 1,
2,
and 3 as well as Canadian, European and world wide accessibility
guidelines.
This second edition will be available as print media.
