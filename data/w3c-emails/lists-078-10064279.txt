Perhaps it would be an idea to approach HiSoft with a proposal to do the CD version. I'm sure that they would see the business benefit of offering something along those lines. I have to agree with chaals though, copyright infringement is not good...

That would be a deliberate breach of copyright, and of the agreement you
made
to download the book. You should wait until you have permission before
offering stuff like that...

  well structured so if you can take advantage of the latest acrobat

  better coverage and more universal access would like to see the book
  made available in a form such as html.  I'll be happy to make a tape
and
  someone can put it on cd of the msreader voice reading the book.

  How about offering the eBook in a more accessible format? eBooks
aren't
  good
  and PDF only marginally better for us blind types.
