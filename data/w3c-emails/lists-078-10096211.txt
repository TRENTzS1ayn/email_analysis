I found an interesting bug in IE on the Mac (it occurs in IE 5.0 and 5.1,
haven't checked other versions).

The first thing to note is that when using IE on the Mac, input areas AND
labels each are in the tab order.  As a result, a form with 3 input boxes
will have 6 tab stops for a Mac IE user.

The issue comes in when you are trying to be very diligent.  If you enclose
an input tag inside a label tag or if you use @for and @id to associate the
label with the input that is not contained within the label tag set, you are
OK.  If you enclose the input within the label tag set AND use @for and @id,
the bug presents.  When a user tabs to the label (or clicks on it), a focus
ring appears around both the label and the input field, and a cursor blinks
in the input field.  When you type, each character is doubled.  Type,
"hello" and it appears as "hheelllloo".  Less than desirable.

I've attached a test file with the different possibilities, and have tested
this without complaint using Netscape and Opera on the Mac and Netscape, IE,
and Opera on Windows.
