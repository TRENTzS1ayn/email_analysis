My persistence has been rewarded!  After emailing my problem with the
Compaq Presario to the State Attorney General, Better Business Bureau
and other entities, I have been speaking with the people I need to
hopefully obtain a return authorization.  Here is the summary:

1.  Compaq stated they are not installing the full XP version as
designed by Microsoft.
2.  I was having the same problems on XP Home and XP Pro and Compaq
discusses that Compaq does not support third party applications. Only
this is stated on the warranty that comes with the box - not on the web
site when you are placing an order.  
3.  I was told XP Home was for the home user who has no special needs
for extra software and XP Pro is for the business who has special needs.
I commented that XP PRO is designed to work with third party
applications that a developer uses, but since the full version of XP was
installed it is not properly functioning. Now I know that Compaq will
not support these third party applications nor will they guarantee that
they will function under the Product compatibility wizard.

SO BUYER BEWARE with assistive technology! Compaq is relooking into my
request for a refund. Stay tuned!
