Except that their definition of accessibility is "does it have a text-only
interface" - there is nothing mentioned about whether there is support for
authors to create content that is accessible, or whether anything more
sophisticated than a text-only interface (for example the use of text
equivalents for functions and images provided) is available.

But a good resource anyway to start from.

  For those of you who have expressed interest in information comparing
  different e-learning platforms I have come across another relevant site:

  The structure used for the reviews is very comprehensive and there is a
  comprehensive review of WebCT 3.7 but the review on Blackboard is lacking
  in detail. Also appears to be an older version of Blackboard that has
  been reviewed. Several other e-learning platforms are reviewed at this
  site and well worth checking out and bookmarking to check for regular
  updates of the reviews.
