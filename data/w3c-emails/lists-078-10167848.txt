Your comment about the definition of accessibility only referring to the option of a text-only interface does not apply to all of the reviews at this site. If you look at the review of WebCT 3.7 for example, you will see this description under the title accessibility:
WebCT has optimized accessibility for the following assistive technologies: Screen reader software: JAWS 4; Browser: Internet Explorer 5.5 SP2; Operating system: Windows 2000. Both Chat and Whiteboard are navigable by keyboard. New color scheme provides high contrast between background and foreground elements. The high contrast color scheme can be the default or overridden by users. Invisible navigation links can be used by screen readers.   

My point was that the review of Blackboard was weak - not containing the detail of some of the other reviews listed on the site. Your observation re the lack of detail about accessibility features certainly applies to the review of Blackboard.

Having said that there are still many accessibility features not mentioned even in the WebCT review. I intend emailing the author (Bruce Landon) and suggesting the Blackboard review be updated. I will also raise the concern that there is lack of consistency in the review of accessibility features and that there is a need to address at least the priority 1 level checkpoints in such a review.

You are right Charles - it is a good start and worth encouraging the author to develop further.
