The Prince of Asturias Foundation

   This legally established body was founded under the name of the
'Fundaci?n Pr?ncipe de Asturias'(The Prince of Asturias Foundation), and is
for cultural and general advancement and progress.
   The Fundaci?n Pr?ncipe de Asturias is totally non-profitmaking, and its
aim is to strengthen links between the Prince of Asturias, heir to the
Throne of Spain, and the Principality of Asturias, within a modern-day
context.
   To this end, it will support the quest for the social and cultural
welfare both of Asturians themselves and also - in view of the wider
universal nature of the historic role of the Principality - of members of
the Spanish and Portuguese-speaking communities in particular. This support
will be primarily provided by fostering the Sciences, Technology, Fine Art
and the Arts.
   As a symbol of the nature and aims of the Foundation, The Prince of
Asturias Awards will be held yearly. They will reward scientific, technical,
cultural, social and humanitarian work done by individuals, work teams and
institutions, with priority given to the Spanish-American Community of
nations.

Best regards,
Emmanuelle
