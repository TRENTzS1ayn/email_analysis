Accessibility issues aside, it's simply not worth the time and effort (and
therefore the money) spent to design graphical buttons.  Inevitably, those
buttons will need to change for some reason.  Whether it's a new color
scheme that is implemented, or the actual text on the buttons.  It is simply
more cost-effective to leave the buttons as <input> elements and use CSS to
style them.
