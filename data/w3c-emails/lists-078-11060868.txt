Well no <img/> is clearly a good thing, or at least would be if browser
support for <object> wasn't so terrible. For backwards compatibility we
could use <img src="blah.png" alt="whatever"
xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" />.

I wonder whether xhtml-legacy-redecl-1.mod will include such an element.

The lack of explicit support for xlink is disappointing, and I can't help
thinking that use of xlink should have happened before use of xforms given
how much simpler a move to xlink will be for most elements (if we keep src
and href around for a while, like the dual use of lang and xml:lang in
XHTML1.0).
