Hello everyone,

I've had a look on google and the w3c list archive, but I've not found any discussion about this yet.

I know that you need to seperate links with more than whitespace, e.g. [link] [link] or link | link, and I usually do this when I have standard text links.

I basically have a left menu created using styled divs, to make each link look like a button.  When you remove the styles, you end up with a list of links:

Home
Link 1
Link 2
Link 3
etc

Bobby testing picked up on this...but how do I get round it without it affecting the original design too much?  Maybe I should add [ ] around each one, and then hide the [ ] with styles...maybe using display: none, white font colour, etc?

All thoughts welcome!

Kind Regards,

Andrew Johns
