Some topics covered in the new feature list would seem of particular 
interest to this group. Haven't tried it yet, but I'm about to.

URL in the message below.

For those who don't follow these things I should probably say that Jaws is 
one of the main screen reading software packages for blind users. I'm 
including the non-Web new features as well because they give some idea of 
what elements of speech output are configurable, customizable, etc.
