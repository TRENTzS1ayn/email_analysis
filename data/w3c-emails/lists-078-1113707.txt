I am sometimes amazed at how differently people feel about level of
accessibility of web sites.  It really is amazingly subjective.  For
instance, the http://www.canada.com/Ottawa site has a big image map at
the
top (at least as JAWS reads it).  This image map has no labels on the
various links which one could immediately condemn as being utterly
inaccessible.  On the other hand, the names of the files comprising the
map,
the files the different parts of the map link to, are very clear and
simple.
Therefore, since JAWS reads the text of the main part of the filenames
as an
attempt to provide some access to the map, a JAWS user hears a list of
quite
clear, lucid links to various parts of the site.  This means that the
site
is inaccessible in strict terms, but the work-arounds in JAWS work
startlingly well in this particular case.  The CBC's site is similar.
There
is a lot of map action, and I suspect the map links aren't all repeated
elsewhere on the page.  The maps aren't labeled, but the screen reader
tricks of reading the names of the files linked to are, again, pretty
effective here.  Even the unlabeled graphics indicating that audio is
available are pretty clear in JAWS.

So, as a JAWS user, I don't think WindowEyes has it over JAWS here, but,
even though both screen readers deal as well as they do with these
sites,
it's only because of the tricks in the screen readers, and other
combinations of browser and technology would probably fall on their
faces at
these sites.

Regards,
Jerry
