Dear WAI IG,
     I do a lot of work on Linux accessibility and feel that there are many ways in which Linux
can better implement the standards coming out of WAI, specifically User Agent and Authoring Tools.
 Mozilla (the new version of Netscape), which is cross-platform, does have people working on its
accessibility, but I think there is a lot of room to support their work.  Also, there is more than
one Internet browser for Linux -- Konqueror (http://www.konqueror.org/) is another great browser,
fully featured browser that does not implemet any WAI standards at the moment.  Please e-mail me
if you're interested in getting involved / learning more.

Best,

--JP Schnapper-Casteras
