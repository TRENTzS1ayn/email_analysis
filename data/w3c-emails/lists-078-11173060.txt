Does anyone have or know of a good page that explains why "click here" is 
bad linking practice?  I have tried various forms of gentle persuasion to 
suggest that "click here" is not good.  I have mentioned that some browsers 
can print a lovely table of urls and link text, at which point "click here" 
is obviously useless.

It's a bad habit of some coworkers who don't want to think about link text 
so they always use "click here".  I need truly excellent reasons to show 
them the light.
