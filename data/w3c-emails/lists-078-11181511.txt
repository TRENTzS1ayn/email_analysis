I have done something similar to that; put a "." in a span after each link
and style it to display:none. I don't think this causes any problems for
anyone although if it does I would really like to know. This first came to
my attention when I was playing around with some  Eric Meyer styles and
remember thinking at the time that this would come up on the list sooner or
later ;-)

On a similar theme Mr Meyer also has a way of creating pure css roll-overs
that look great for the browsers that support it but I'm wondering how they
will 'sound' in a screen-reader and look in a text-browser. They work thus:

<a href="path/to/page.htm">link text<span>roll-over text</span></a>

the <span> is set to display:none and then using a:hover it is set to
display:block with fixed positioning. My first thought is that the roll-over
text will get read out in screen-readers as part of the link text because it
is contained within the <a> tags but I can't see another way of creating the
same effect that would be accessible. Any ideas?

regards 
Julian
