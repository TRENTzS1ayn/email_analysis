I've always assumed that the most accessible way of doing rollovers was to use css classes, which change onmouseover/onmouseout onblur/onfocus, which according to the guidelines is acceptable, as it'll work in browsers that support javascript and if it's turned off, it doesn't affect the navigation.

Is this the wrong method?

Kind Regards,
