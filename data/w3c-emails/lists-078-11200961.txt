sorry, my mistake in choice of terminology. These rollovers are designed to
show extra text/images away from the actual link. Eric Meyer calls them
pop-ups but that term doesn't seem right either. For an example take a look
at http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/css/edge/popups/demo.html and put your mouse
(if, indeed, you use a mouse) over the links. Can't see how to make it work
with a keyboard though :(

regards

Julian
