If the user is using a browser that lists the links on a page, e.g.
JAWS on one specific mode then all they are going to see/hear is "Click
Here", which tells them absolutely nothing about where the link will
take them.

Not everybody uses a mouse, they might be selecting links by a method
other then clicking.
