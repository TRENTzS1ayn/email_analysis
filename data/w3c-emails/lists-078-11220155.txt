See for example

  Popup Menu
  http://jibbering.com/accessibility/menu.html

and more generally find

"Client-side Scripting Techniques"

in

  Development of WCAG 2.0

For those of you with an eye to the future, please review

  Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 Events Specification

in the light of Checkpoint 1.2 ofthe DRAFT UAAG, see
