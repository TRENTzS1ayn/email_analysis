print the page out as text or turn off images or find a demo lf a screen
reader and do as al suggests or do as al suggests without a screen reader
and ask your coleague to think of what is highlighted as all that is known
about the current link.  make sure images are off.  If you can find a way to
get just a list of links on the page, show her that.  Also, have her ask her
self, what might happen if the links really told the story?
