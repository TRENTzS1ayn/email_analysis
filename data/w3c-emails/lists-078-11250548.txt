Al and David have made very good points, but to add further I think that sighted users will also benefit from links that say more than just 'click here'.

Users come to websites for principally two reasons: to find information or to use a service like e-commerce. Because of this, links should lead the user to where they want to go, without ambiguity. So, if a sighted user can see clearly where a link is going to take them, or use the link's wording for finding information through an internal search (or even an external one) then they will probably use the website again and tell their friends. This just makes good sense to me.

OK, I know that this is not really an accessibility issue per se, more a usability issue, but it illustrates why the use of click here benefits no one except the designer/developer of the website. In my opinion.

Regards to all
Simon

print the page out as text or turn off images or find a demo lf a screen
reader and do as al suggests or do as al suggests without a screen reader
and ask your coleague to think of what is highlighted as all that is known
about the current link.  make sure images are off.  If you can find a way to
get just a list of links on the page, show her that.  Also, have her ask her
self, what might happen if the links really told the story?
