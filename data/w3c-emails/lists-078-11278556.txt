No, but the point Kynn made is that you can do this in your user style sheet
and apply it to your browser. If people had CSS2 capable browsers as a matter
of course (after all, it is only about 5 years since the specification was
published as a W3C Recommendation) then we could provide this user style
sheet rule and not worry any more about whether the author put it in content.

Where people are relying on pictures, and getting confused by new windows
opening, a different approach is probably smarter - I would suggest the
feature that many browsers have of forcing pages to open in the existing
window, and keeping the history. (iCab does a slightly different thing - you
can normally go back in the new window to the page from which you opened it,
but not before. Opera gives you a more powerful history again as I recall).
