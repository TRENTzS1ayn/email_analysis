If the problem you are experiencing is a Lynx problem, the developers and superusers on the lynx-dev list will need to know both the version and OS you are using to help you diagnose and fix or work around the problem.  But for site problems, the OS should matter little, for a given version of the program.

You can get your version from the information page with the equals key and report the Lynx version you observed with, and that should be good enough for reporting problems with a site.  [But read on.]

If you report both your Lynx version and OS version it doesn't hurt.  But the priorities are pretty stable at:

1) what you did (with URL you were at) and what broke: what happened, why this is wrong
2) browser you were using, with version
3) other installation and configuration stuff

The first thing Wendy would do is simply turn to her copy of Lynx or other text browser and try to reproduce the problem; for which she needs a description of what you did leading up to the problem and what the actual problem was that ensued.  Trouble reports are more often inadequate in this regard than in configuration information, but some problems require the configuration information to determine the source of the problem.  Walk through the episode so someone else can try to reproduce the problem.  Jerry's report is excellent in this regard, but he is reporting on success, so that is easier.

Even better (in Lynx) is to turn tracing on with control-T, walk through the episode again, starting with going to the page where the problem occurs, through where the browsing breaks.  Explain in your own words why this was a problem, and attach or include the trace log file with your report.  This automatically captures the Lynx version and the URL you went to.  If the problem is any one of a number of _server_ problems, tracing the HTTP steps in this way will be the only way to know for sure.

Only if Wendy or the webmaster fails to reproduce the problem does the diagnosis delve into versions, hosts, and that level of detail.
