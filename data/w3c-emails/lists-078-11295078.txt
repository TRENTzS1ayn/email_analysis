It's just lazy writing, isn't it? It uses a stock phrase instead of 
describing why a person should follow the link, or what will happen if they 
do. Any good copy editor would veto it, at least on most worlds in this 
star cluster.

But I give "click here" points for brevity over phrases like "activate this 
hypertext anchor".
