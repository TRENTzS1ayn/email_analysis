Hello all,
I am working with a group that has made a menu with transparent image links.
These images have alternate text but when color styles are ignored in a
browser, sighted or low vision users cannot see the images.  An argument is
that alternate text is there and the transparent image can allow for user
defined background colors, etc.

My opinion is that text and style sheets can be used to acquire the same
visual effect and if styles are ignored, the text is still visual on the
screen.  Is there any other advice to help support text and CSS over
transparent image links?  Is this even an issue or should I save an argument
for let's say...Springfield versus Shelbyville?

(sorry couldn't resist)

Thanks for your help!
J
