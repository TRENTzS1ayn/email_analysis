'Click here' is bad style but it's not an accessibility problem.  At worst
it's just poor use of hypertext.

(Yes, I realize that some screenreaders will take links out of context
and present them as a list, but that is ALSO poor use of hypertext --
hypertext links aren't meant to be used in that way.)
