This is a problem with the screenreader. It shouldn't be doing that.
The context of a hypertext link _is_ important.

If a screenreader is going to generate a summary, it should -- at the
very least -- include a good degree of context around the link, not
just the text of the link.  The notion that you can take any link out
of context and expect it to work well is a bad assumption regarding
hypertext.

I agree that most pages are tedious and not easy to navigate.  However,
expecting all links to make sense when read in a list is not a reasonable
requirement to place on text authors and it does not solve the problem
correctly.

A different solution must be found to the tediousness of pages -- at
Edapta [*] our solution was to generate navigatable sections of each
page with a menu up front and appropriate backlinks, plus page
summaries.
