Click is slang for "follow this link."  There has never in the history
of Web access been a single person who knows how to operate a Web
browser by typing, speaking, using a switch, or tapping a screen, who
has been completely stymied by the concept "click here" and been unable
to use the link.

Blind people don't go "click here? but i don't use a mouse! AUGH I CAN'T
ACCESS THIS SITE!" and run screaming from their computers.  Everyone knows
what "click" means.  It means "follow this link."
