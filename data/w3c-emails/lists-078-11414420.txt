Sure.  But it's not an accessibility error.  It's just bad style.

Actually, "click here" is also very imperative.  It tells you what to
do.

      You can enroll online -- just <a>click here</a>!

      You can <a>enroll online</a>!

One of these is more imperative and urges action more effectively.
Hint, it's not the second. :)

      You can enroll online -- just <a>use your browser's function to
      follow this link however you do that with whatever assistive
      technology you might have and you will be taken to an enrollment
      form!</a>

Well, okay, this is better:

      You can enroll online -- <a>enroll now!</a>

But you see, there are purposes for "click here" beyond simply the
assumption that someone doesn't know how to use a hyperlink.  It's
marketing.  Saying "click here" is more likely to get a response than
not saying it.
