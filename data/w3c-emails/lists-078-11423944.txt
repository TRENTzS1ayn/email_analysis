Which raises the question of whether the web is a push medium or a pull 
medium; the original concept was as a pull medium, with the browser user
in control, rather than a push one with advertisers in control.

Those designing for advertisers may well have to take this into account,
but those designing for the consumer side of charities (fund raising is
just advertising) and for government agencies should understand that 
advertisers do it for control and think before mimicing them.
