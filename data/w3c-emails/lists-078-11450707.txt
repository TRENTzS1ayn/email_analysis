Whilst I might consider using media dependent styles++ to include the link
in printed versions, the mainstream browsers have the facility to print
tables of links and Lynx can even add reference numbers for these into
the main text.

I'm also likely to include them inline where I'm giving examples of 
web pages rather than simply linking to resources.

Including them unconditionally, seems to me to pollute the hypertext
concept, and do something that the browser could do anyway.

++ For a fully CSS browser, one could do this by using generated text,
but pragmatically one would probably have to selectively disable the
text in visual browsers, so that old browsers would display it.
