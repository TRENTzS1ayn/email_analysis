In a list other than DL you take the list item.  [DL: take DT, DD pair]

Inside a paragraph you take a sentence.  That's lightweight NLP.

Even with the most heavyweight NLP, without author collaboration and markup
conventions you are guessing.  More weight, better guess.  But guessing
*could be effective*.  If one reduces to 5% the fraction of links where the
user has to retreat to "read full text" mode in the screen reader, you have
broken the back of the problem.

That's what it takes to connect with the accessible UI technology
in the field today.

We can't take an idealistic posture and simply plead "broken browsers" where
there is a clear consensus pattern of practice across [screen readers and
close kin] on this point.

Taking a fresh look from first principles, marking the appropriate
context might be something that takes less skill, and bends the author's
intent less out of shape.  Hence achieves a higher fraction of web content
actually deployed that conforms -- eventually.

Since the latter could be readily semi-automated, something like
spell-correct on-the-fly, this option could reasonably be considered as a
candidate for the functional flow of the future.  And XHTML 2.0 does need to
have one eye on the future.  See also
