so are you going to teach the millions out there?  click here is no good
even if it is slang and even if its use can be inferred.  it is still no
good.  It does not teach our kids good writing habits.

Click is slang for "follow this link."  There has never in the history
of Web access been a single person who knows how to operate a Web
browser by typing, speaking, using a switch, or tapping a screen, who
has been completely stymied by the concept "click here" and been unable
to use the link.

Blind people don't go "click here? but i don't use a mouse! AUGH I CAN'T
ACCESS THIS SITE!" and run screaming from their computers.  Everyone
knows
what "click" means.  It means "follow this link."
