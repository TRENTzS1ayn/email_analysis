it is an accessibility problem albiet one that can easily be put to rest

Even "follow this link" is more difficult to understand than "click
here."
"Click here" is an accepted idiom on the Web and understood by many

It's not an accessibility problem though.  Even if it gets someone's
dander up -- causing offense via insensitivity is NOT an accessibility
problem, although it may be rude.
