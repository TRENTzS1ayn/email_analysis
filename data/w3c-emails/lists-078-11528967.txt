Hyper links can be used in any fasion one desitres whis is why they are
called hyper.  it is perfectly acceptable and an accessibility issue in
some instances to allow one to have a list of well written links such
that they compose a table of contents through which one can hyper
through.

'Click here' is bad style but it's not an accessibility problem.  At
worst
it's just poor use of hypertext.

(Yes, I realize that some screenreaders will take links out of context
and present them as a list, but that is ALSO poor use of hypertext --
hypertext links aren't meant to be used in that way.)
