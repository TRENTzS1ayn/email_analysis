Yep.  They're still there.  But curiously, it doesn't say if they work with
Internet Explorer 5.5 or 6.

"Note: These tools are only recommended for Internet Explorer 5. "

However, I just installed them with IE 6, and they seem to work just fine,
at least so far.  Thanks for the heads up, John!

I just installed it with IE 5.5 under Windows 2000 - works fine.

Thanks,

Kathleen
