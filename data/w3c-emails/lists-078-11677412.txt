MessageSteve,

buy the book Constructing Accessible Web Sites which Jim Thatcher and
several others wrote.  It is published by Glasshous, a company in the UK,
and is available at: www.icdri.org/constructing_accessible_web_site.htm

Jim gives you excellent instructions on how to accomplish accessiblity with
both standards.

An accessible version is coming out on CD.  If you buy the book, then you
will receive a copy of the CD as well when it comes out.

Sincerely,

Mike Burks

    We have a client whose site is visited by UK and US users and which
needs to be made accessible. The pressure for accessibility is coming from
the US. I'd like to know what their options are ... do they:

    1) Make the site 508 and WCAG Priority 1 compliant

    2) Make it only 508 compliant. Will this satisfy the Disability
Discrimination Act of the UK?

    3) Make it only WCAG Priority 1 compliant? Will this satisfy the US
pressure coming from the Federal funders of the site?

    All input would be greatly appreciated.

    Thanks
    Steve
