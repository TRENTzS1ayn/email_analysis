Apparently I have not been clear.

Use pictures! They help people! Use them in headings. Use them to identify
navigation. Use them in ways that solve more problems than they raise.

There is long-running discussion on this topic in the WCAG group, and I think
I have argued consistently for the last couple of years that it is important
that web pages are illustrated. Not "put a couple of pretty pictures there
for the disabled folks", nor "put a couple of cool images there because they
somehow make pages bettter". Illustrate content. This is hard to do, but Joe
gives good simplistic example technique below.

The point about using plain-text inside map is not to do it instead of
graphics, it is that map is better html than "skip navigation links". By all
means, if you have a graphical version of a navigation bar, use it. If you
have an abstract XML version and derive a user interface, please include one
that allows for graphics to be used.

I don't know where the idea comes from that images should not be used in
headings. It is possible Joe knows WAI better than I do, and it sppears
certain there is some piece, or page, or set of documents he knows that I
don't. So without some pointers there is little I can do to follow up, except
say that he seems not to be talking about what WAI says as a rule.
