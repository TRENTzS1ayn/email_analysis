If you look at WCAG 1.0 or Section 508, then is undoubtedly true.
Adherence to either places a much lower priority on the needs of some
groups than on others, and also sets up a competition between the needs
of some groups and the needs of others.

So I would say this is a legitimate statement.

This is why an adaptive/transformative approach is most valuable.  The
idea that all users can be equally served by a single user interface is
one which should have died years ago.  Unfortunately, it's 2002 now and
we have yet to see fully-deployed increased accessibility adaptive
transformations. :(

You have accurately identified a weakness in current accessibility
thinking.  The solution, as I see it, is to change our thinking and
realize that multiple interfaces need to be constructed.  If you are
already assembling a portal system which separates the business
logic (backend) from the front (dynamic content) then you are already
advantaged when it comes to building a functioning adaptive transformation
system.  You can get better results for a broader group of users by
creating multiple templates which meet a diversity of needs.
