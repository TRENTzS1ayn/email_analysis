Dear All,
The DDA states that websites should provide a service that is no less than that offered to non-disabled users, and it is assumed (as the UK government is yet to provide parameters for commercial sites) that single-A conformance is the minimum - judging by the RNIB (http://www.rnib.org.uk) campaign for accessible web design. However, if you look at the Guidelines for UK Government websites (http://www.e-envoy.gov.uk/publications/guidelines/webguidelines/handbook/handbookindex.htm) it will outline what the Government requires for its own sites and those of the public sector.

Also, consider that the German administration has recently taken a further step and asked for double-A compliance as a minimum!

Furthermore, I would have a look at Martin Sloan's take on the DDA in the UK, available at: http://elj.warwick.ac.uk/jilt/01-2/sloan.html

Having said all this, I would agree with Charles that double-A standard is a good target to aim for as a minimum, but if triple-A compliance is at all possible (even if not on all pages) then I would strive for that. I would also like to add the following: please, please, please validate your code and CSS.

Good luck.
Simon

Well, what people do normally in this situation is consider the desires of
their customers. WCAG Priority 1 and Section 508 are different - meeting WCAG
triple-A conformance would cover you for Section 508 and satisfy the US
requirements, but meeting single-A would not.

I don't know the details of the UK Disability Discrimination Act, but I
suspect it would not be satisfied by meeting section 508. I am fairly certain
that the Australian equivalent act would not be satisfied by Section 508.

My two cents worth of advice (and two cents in australia is now legally
worthless) is to go for about WCAG double-A in your development and
maintenance planning, and ensure that you meet Section 508 requirements
immediately. This is becuase the 508 requirement isn't complaint-driven but
rule driven, whereas I understand the UK act as being reactive.

Cheers

Chaals
