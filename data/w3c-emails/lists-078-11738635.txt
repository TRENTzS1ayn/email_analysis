The basic fact that you cannot make your web offering usable by 100% of
everyone is just true.

On the other hand, for the kind of system you are contemplating, there are
things to consider that will make a big difference in who can and cannot use
the result.

The fact that some of us think you can reach more of everyone with
pattern-generated alternative forms from the servers is partly why the
openness to "server-side diversity" is still in WCAG 2.0.  And in your
situation where you are joining information services from multiple backends,
there is cause to question why you cannot support multiple frontends as well.

You have the uncomfortable opportunity to lead the charge _for_ information
integration across the services coming from the multiple backends and
_against_ creating a system of plumbing stovepipes for inaccessible media
channels pasted together in the pixel domain.

If you design the voice interface to each backend service first, you may be
surprised at how easy and how adaptive the fleximode composite actually is.
