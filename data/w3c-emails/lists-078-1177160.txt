JAWS 4.x requires the user configure JAWS to read title attributes, but once
that configuration is made I've found it to be very reliable in all the
testing I've done with it - JAWS has read the title attribute in every
instance we've employed it.

What happens? It gets read! <grin>

I know that Window-Eyes supports the TITLE tag for form controls, and I 
believe JFW does as well. In terms of browsers, TITLE is supported at least 
by Netscape 2, 3, 4, 6, Internet Explorer 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,  Opera, and WebTV.
