My understanding is that what is actually required is that the organisation
provide an equivalent service.  One implication of this is that, if they
provide a service through the web site, any alternative needs to be
available 24 by 7 by 365.25!

This is likely to involve taking the web site down on Christmas day or
staffing call centres, enquiry points, etc. on that day, so the accessible
web site may well be the cheapest solution.
