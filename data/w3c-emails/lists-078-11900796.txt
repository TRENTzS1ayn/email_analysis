The big 2 when underlining of links is disabled.  This is a user option and
very common for designers.  Lynx on Slackware Linux (uses a text colour
change, as the underscoring isn't possible in the normal display console
display mode and other approaches, such as inverting video, would be too
ugly); I have numbered links on, which does effectively delimit the links.

I don't think any browser will confuse them internally, it is a question 
of whether they look like one or two links to the user.
