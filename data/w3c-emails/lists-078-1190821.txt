Images for submit buttons are part of HTML, and are accessible to screen
readers.  You will run into all of the same problems related to nonscalable
text as for any text that is presented in a graphic, but the form will work
fine.

don't forget the alt attribute in the input element!

<input type="image" src="foo.gif" alt="submit" width="50" height="20" />
