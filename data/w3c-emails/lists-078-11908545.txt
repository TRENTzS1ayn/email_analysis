I would rather think the real difference is:
Level A...neglect of these will definitely prevent some users from
accessing the site.
Level B...neglect of these may cause the site to be hard to access for
some or may take an unreasonable time.
Level C..Neglect of these probably will not stop a user  or delay
him/her greatly but will detract from the site.

The real difference is in acceptability to commercial web designers.

1 should cause no real hardship;
2 will limit their scope somewhat;
3 tends to rule out a lot of what they want to do in terms of
presentation.
