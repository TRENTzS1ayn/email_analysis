Some new things on the MCU Website:

Short notes on the accessibility of PDF documents
(http://www.mcu.org.uk/articles/pdfs.html), and
notes on the ins-and-outs of using Frames
(http://www.mcu.org.uk/articles/noframes.html).

I am working with a designer within Glasgow Caledonian University to
re-design the MCU Website, so look forward to a new-look site, 'real soon
now'. 

I believe that:

A good looking accessible Website does more to push the issue of
accessibility, than a badly designed Website about accessibility. The
majority of Web designers seem to think about the visuals first (of course I
am generalising), and accessibility later. So why not  acknowledge that, and
demonstrate by example, that accessibility and good design are not mutually
exclusive concepts.

It would be good if the MCU Website was a good example of the above
statement. So as soon as the site has been tarted up, the MCU will be
launching the 'Good looking and accessible Websites' campaign. Essentially
the idea will be to compile a list of Websites that are both accessible and
great looking. Get in touch if you have any opinions or suggestions related
to this idea.

All the best,
Jim
