the fact is that it is darned right confusing and distracting to have
click here in the middle of a page with no indication of where you are
going to go and yes folks, on many pages such as the adverts described
below, there is no text in context.

Regarding "generating context around a link" when summarizing links.
I'd
have to say, "I don't like it." All it does is to slow down navigation,
and,
doggonnit, if you're going to have a link, I just can't see why the
skilled
HTML author can't make the link give a good impression of where that
link is
going to go or, at any rate, what the link pertains to.  If the text
doesn't
link to information closely related to the text itself, then why on
earth
did the author pick that piece of text as the source of the link in the
first place? As for plain "Click Here" links, few things disgust me more
than the advert links on web sites that only say, "Click Here," and
nothing
more.  My reaction is, "You'd better give me a better reason to digress
from
what I'm doing to visit your link than the sheer joy of 'clicking
here'."

Well, that's one blind guy's opinion.

Jerry
