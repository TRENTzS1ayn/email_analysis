Hi Folks -

I am frequently asked (challenged?) to identify web sites which
demonstrate "best practice" in accessible design.

I should emphasise that what I have in mind here are sites that
are authentic (i.e., they provide some genuine, useful, service,
rather than being "toy" demonstrations), and that exemplify
"inclusive" design - i.e., that are "good" across multiple
criteria and for many distinct user groups - including, but in no
way limited to, those with a variety of disabilities.  Ideally I
would like sites which demonstrate that, in general, there is no
absolute or inherent conflict between accessibility and other
typical design objectives (specifically including visual
aesthetics, interactivity, etc.).

I am certainly not looking for a single "best" site, but rather a
collection or portfolio of exemplars that collectively cover a
variety of typical categories of web site or service.

I have had a quick search through the wai-ig list archives, the
W3C WAI resources, and google, with pretty limited
success. Perhaps the closest resource to what I am talking about
would be the site for the RNIB "See it Right" awards:

  http://www.rnib.org.uk//digital/siraccess/

This is useful, but also has a number of limitations for my purposes.

So if people have any relevant links - either to archived
discussion on this forum, or to other resources elsewhere (such
as a good "web accessibility hall of fame"), then they would be
much appreciated.

In any case, I would welcome any suggestions from this group as
to your own current favorite nominations - perhaps with brief
commentary on why you pick them out. (But please note that I am
definitely not looking for examples of bad or inaccessible design
- I'm afraid I have no shortage of those...)

Many thanks,

- Barry.
