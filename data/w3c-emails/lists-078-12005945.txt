Not sure I'd agree with any of that.  It doesn't so much limit what
they can do, as whether they can get away with using totally clueless
software to produce their pages.

I wrote something about my take on the subject in the Help pages for
the Accessibility Valet (<URL:http://valet.webthing.com/access/>).
One point that seems relevant here is that whereas levels A and AA
just require simple avoidance of gross stupidity, level AAA calls
on the developer to be proactive in providing accessibility.
