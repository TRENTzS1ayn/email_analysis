Tim,

As far colors go, I really don't think they should even be an issue.  If you
have experimented or developed to XHTML then the concept of color within
your actual HTML document does not (should not?) exist, it must all be done
via your CSS.  Thus, with CSS removed the end result *should* be essentially
black text on white (gray?) background, although this is generally up to the
user agent/software owner.  Some tools such as lynx will output black on
grey, in the major contender browsers I believe the default colors re black
and white, although they allow the owner to specify other combinations if
they so choose.  But if the style sheet support is removed, then color as
defined by the content author is nullified.

The Web Design Group (www.htmlhelp.com) offers a couple of little tools they
call WiDGets which extend right-click functionality to IE 5+.  One of the
tools they offer disables style sheets; it's a tool I use all the time.
(Note, it only disables linked or @import style sheets... in-line styles are
not affected)
