Martin,

This doesn't address your problem at all, but as a Unix user
with adequate eyesight and a user of graphical web browsers,
I too have found Verispam / Notwork not merely difficult but
impossible to use over a long period.  In part the website
is the worst I have ever had the misfortune to try and use,
and is totally illegible to me in my usual browser (Konqueror).
Equally problematic, when I have given myself a headache fighting
with it, I can finally get to the point where it claims
to have emailed me and wants confirmation, whereupon the email
never arrives.  In fact, the mere existence of this email
correspondence shows you've got further than me with them!

I voted with my feet, which in itself involved a prolonged
correspondence with an extremely helpful domain registrar
(gradwell.com) who now have my business.  I understand that
this kind of experience is quite usual with Verispam victims.

But in this case, it's not just you!
