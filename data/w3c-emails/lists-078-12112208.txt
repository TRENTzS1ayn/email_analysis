I have come across the following statement:

"We have discovered a "bug" in a major assistive system.  When applying the
alt-tag, we have found that it MUST directly follow the src-attribute, and
come before any other attributes, such as height and width, e.g.
<img src="file.gif" alt="Description" height="100" width="100">  
If the alt-tag is in any other position, some screen-readers will not find
or interpret it."

1) Has anybody heard of this?
2) Is it true?  If so, which system are they referring to?

Thanks in advance.
