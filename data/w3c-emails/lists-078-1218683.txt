Hi Julian,


I finished for some days  a very long form that can
be sent with an image as input button. I only used XHTML 1.1. (cgi-script is
already on the server) I could recieve the form I sent in Lynx. But for people
who don't have a browser that can send the form with an image as button
I already planned alternative pages for all the forms I have in the fansite..
Why should you use an alt text? You can easily write next to it. Press the..
(what the inputbutton presents to be)
to send the form and the alt attribute=""
See

I could also send this formular with a screenreader.

Greeting
Ineke van der Maat
