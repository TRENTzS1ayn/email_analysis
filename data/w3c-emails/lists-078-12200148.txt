Nov 2001 on my web site, see

 

http://www.uaccessit.com/   and Professional Articles, "What is Web

Subject: what is web accessibility?

 

I need to source information about accessibility. Does anyone know of a
good reference as a brief introduction to what is web accessibility? It
should be a short piece please.

 

Thanks
