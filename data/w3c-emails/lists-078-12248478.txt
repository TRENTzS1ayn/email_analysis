Well, on the one hand Nick is right - anything that works as described
doesn't manage to handle HTML sufficiently well to be considered a working
implementation.

On the other hand, that doesn't stop people using things that give them some
benefit sometimes. This is an issue that won't go away, unfortunately. Unless
it is not possible to produce an imperfect tool people will use them, and
allowing for development means allowing for mistakes.

But if these people were selling their product to me I might argue as a
consumer that it doesn't do what is advertised, and they should provide new
copies to people who have paid for the product, which do the job properly.
Which may or may not actually have a useful outcome.

I might also choose a different product. Or write my own repair for it. Or
even just live with the problem. The real world is like that.

just my very personal approach to life.

cheers
