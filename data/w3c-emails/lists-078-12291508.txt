Not yet. I'm hand-coding some stuff to get a better idea of how the whole
thing works.

My example document is a simple RDF Graph with N-Triples of the same RDF at
the bottom of the image. My thinking is if the SVG was to be rendered as
just text then the text in the graph would be both obsolete (since it
duplicates the information in the N-Triples) and confusing even if the code
was ordered in such a way as to avoid this. As such the solution would seem
to be to not render the text from the graph in such a case, only the
N-Triples. (N-Triples probably aren't the best format for voice rendering
either, but if I could create an SVG which would only give that portion to
the speaker then I'd have a start).
