I think the answer is in how you are generating your text version - if you
are using CSS or XSLT then you can do it in many different ways.
Alternatively, you could generate the nTriples from the text included already
in your format, using an animation or something (I haven't thought through
the details of this as an animation yet...) so that a text-stripping
operation would only have one lot to start with.
