This is perhaps an example of where the long experience that stands behind
the design of the digital talking book application is wisdom we should mine.

In the digital talking book, there is an 'escape' method that applies to
forms and tables, and some other selected structural-group elements.  This
allows you to get past something from within it.  The title or label of a
block should be interpreted as being within the structure for the purposes
of this escaping, and to make the interpretation easy that should be the
syntax.  This is consistent with the syntax in ISO HTML and the Digital
Talking Book.

  "Escapable" Structures
  http://www.niso.org/standards/resources/Z39-86-2002.html#Escape

There is a long-standing desire to move toward a normalized architecture
where the content provides the structure and the player provides the methods
for structural navigation.

My point here is that the skip-nav or its cousin here the skip-movie link,
is something to do with what we have today; but that the answer for the
future is not a 'skip' method but an 'escape' method that provides the
'skip' capability and more.  Navigation bars are just another sub-case
along with tables and movies.

The browse method of listening to the title of a section, beginning the
section, and then escaping from the section is just much more robust.  As
compared with trusting the title to completely convey the information needed
to decide to exhaustively browse the section or skip it, 'escape' wins hands
down on usability or user friendliness,  This is why the 'browser back' verb
is such a winner on the Web.  You can sample to the depth you care to and go
back and go elsewhere.  Just within a linearly organized topic tree you
don't need to go back to figure where to go next; the default is to go on to
what's next following the escapable structural unit.

The action plan involves

a) coming to terms with the consumer and player interests that this is a
distinguished class of grouping objects in the structured media, and not all
such containers [involves WCAG, UAAG most]  The PDF solution should prove
that we need this.

b) coming to terms with the format designers on how to indicate this
property with regard to elements in the API or syntax [involves PF, ATIA,
various format groups].  "This property may be thought of as membership in
an escapable class.  If that helps.]

c) deployment of conforming [developer and player] software.

d) deployment of conforming content.

This is a functional deficit of long standing.  It takes an organized
engineering effort to make an effective change.

The PF group is the most likely institutional home for action on this plan.
Those interested in making actual progress on structural navigation please
contact me [off the list suggested] to express this interest.  If we can get
critical mass, we will move out.
