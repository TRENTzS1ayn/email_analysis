Hi,

The Berkeley campus is considering different learning management systems
(LMS).  As part of the evaluation process, they will be conducting
usability tests of different systems.  The department doing the
evaluation is interested in running usability tests with disabled/blind
students and faculty as part of their process for selecting an LMS for
the campus.  Does anyone know of other universities which have run
usability tests with disabled/blind people using LMS systems?

Thanks very much,
Scott
