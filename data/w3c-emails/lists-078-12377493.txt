The response by Carlos was not complete and could be misinterpreted.
Section 508 has an indirect impact on websites other than Federal agencies
in the US.  For a complete discussion of this impact on entities doing
business in the US, including how Section 508 informs US entities covered
under the Americans with Disabilities Act and other disability rights laws
on how to ensure effective communication through the accessible design of
web sites, please see my law and policy chapters in the recently released
book "Constructing Accessible Web Sites."  One interesting response to the
Section 508 effort is that a number of States have adopted Section 508 in
policy or legislation because they want their websites to be accessible to
the widest possible constituency.

Hi Steve,

Sorry for the delay in the reply. Unfortunately it is only applicable to
  websites of the Federal Government, not to other websites. It is not
even applicable to state sites.

regards,
carlos
