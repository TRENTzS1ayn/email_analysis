Cynthia,

I believe that Carlos was describing the situation in Germany, not in the 
U.S., in response to Steve's question about Web accessibility policy in 
Germany; and that his response is accurate for that context.

With regard to states in the U.S., however, while many are adopting US Sec. 
508, others are adopting W3C's WCAG 1.0, which addresses a broader 
constituency. U.S. Sec. 508 includes fewer provisions, and explicitly 
excludes certain constituencies such as those with cognitive disabilities.

With regard to indirect impact across both public and private sectors, the 
biggest impact will come when organizations get serious about requiring 
ATAG-compliant software (authoring tools that comply with W3C's Authoring 
Tool Accessibility Guidelines 1.0), not just WCAG-conformant Web sites, 
since that will help drive demand for authoring tool developers to deliver 
software that supports the production of accessible Web sites. So far, one 
of the only formal statements on this issue has come from the European 
Parliament:
         (long URI coming, and skip past the introductory material to get 
to the provisions)
