Yes, several organizations have. WAI's reference links on US State policies 
will be being updated... most likely next week (very out of date at the 
moment, but we have the data to update it already); the international list 
is being updated (off-line) this week and will be posted to WAI IG shortly 
for comment. (Not useful to comment on that until the updates are done, 
since we are integrating many edits that people have already kindly sent in 
previously.)

WAI's state list will not be such a detailed grid, no.
