Judy,
Thanks for the clarification regarding comments on Germany.  As for the WAI
effort, you are exactly right in that the accessibility benefits found in
the WCAG 1.0 are much broader than that in the US Section 508.  I am hopeful
that when the Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Standards
are updated in the future, we will see the US adopting more of the technical
specifications found in W3C Recommendations.

Best regards,
Cynthia Waddell

Cynthia,

I believe that Carlos was describing the situation in Germany, not in the
U.S., in response to Steve's question about Web accessibility policy in
Germany; and that his response is accurate for that context.

With regard to states in the U.S., however, while many are adopting US Sec.
508, others are adopting W3C's WCAG 1.0, which addresses a broader
constituency. U.S. Sec. 508 includes fewer provisions, and explicitly
excludes certain constituencies such as those with cognitive disabilities.

With regard to indirect impact across both public and private sectors, the
biggest impact will come when organizations get serious about requiring
ATAG-compliant software (authoring tools that comply with W3C's Authoring
Tool Accessibility Guidelines 1.0), not just WCAG-conformant Web sites,
since that will help drive demand for authoring tool developers to deliver
software that supports the production of accessible Web sites. So far, one
of the only formal statements on this issue has come from the European
Parliament:
         (long URI coming, and skip past the introductory material to get
to the provisions)
