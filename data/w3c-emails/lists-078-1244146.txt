wait a minute....it was a question about something I had heard not
something I have even experienced (only because I don't use a GUI)  and
the question was 

   does Lynx behave differently from a text based OS vs a GUI based OS??

that's all, nothing more just curious, principally because people will
tell me they checked something out with Lynx and it is ok, I go there and
it is unreadable....

But for site problems, the OS should matter little, for a given version of the program.

Trouble reports are more often inadequate in this regard than in configuration information, but some problems require the configuration information to determine the source of the problem.  Walk through the episode so someone else can try to reproduce the problem.  Jerry's report is excellent in this regard, but he is reporting on success, so that is easier.

Explain in your own words why this was a problem, and attach or include the trace log file with your report.  This automatically captures the Lynx version and the URL you went to.  If the problem is any one of a number of _server_ problems, tracing the HTTP steps in this way will be the only way to know for sure.
