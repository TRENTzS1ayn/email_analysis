I'm sorry to be blunt but this isn't a question of accessibility, it's a
question of realism.

You can use javascript to store information about what has already occurred
and to reduce network traffic in a manner for which you will be able to find
a complying enabling tool for just about every disability the user might
have. In a closed-environment situation I'd probably recommend doing just
that.

What you can't do is use it and expect it to work in every tool in the real
world, or across every firewall and this has nothing to do with
accessibility in the narrower sense. Expecting it to work in the wild is
na?ve to the point of lotus-eating. Blaming accessibility standards because
they point out this fact is childish.

The whole web-companies-can't-afford-to-do-their-job thing is just FUD.
