Can you be a bit more specific?  The impression I get is that you are saying
it is OK to use Javascript in a closed environment.  Which is probably the
direction I would lean toward, but I just want to get clarification.

In my opinion, I don't think that it's a problem to have a requirement of
Javascript being enabled in a closed environment.  But, again, the problem
you'll run into are archaic situations where clients in the same system
might have different, non-DOM, base browsers.
