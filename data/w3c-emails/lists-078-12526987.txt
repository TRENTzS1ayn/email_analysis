My understanding and Cynthia can clarify from a legal standpoint is all
U.S. states are required to have a guideline as required by ADA,
however, they can either: 1. make their own, 2. use any or all or a
combination of WCAG, 3. 2. use any or all or a combination of 508

I understand they must have something in place, but not sure what every
state's timetable is?

Thanks Judy. I'm a little unclear on the enforcement of 508 compliancy.
If certain states choose to be compliant with the W3C's WCAG 1.0 does
this mean that all states can follow either 508 or WCAG, as long as
they're accessible at the end of the day? Or are these states which
adopt W3C's WCAG 1.0 also 508 compliant?

Thanks
Steve

Cynthia,

I believe that Carlos was describing the situation in Germany, not in
the 
U.S., in response to Steve's question about Web accessibility policy in 
Germany; and that his response is accurate for that context.

With regard to states in the U.S., however, while many are adopting US
Sec. 
508, others are adopting W3C's WCAG 1.0, which addresses a broader 
constituency. U.S. Sec. 508 includes fewer provisions, and explicitly 
excludes certain constituencies such as those with cognitive
disabilities.

With regard to indirect impact across both public and private sectors,
the 
biggest impact will come when organizations get serious about requiring 
ATAG-compliant software (authoring tools that comply with W3C's
Authoring 
Tool Accessibility Guidelines 1.0), not just WCAG-conformant Web sites, 
since that will help drive demand for authoring tool developers to
deliver 
software that supports the production of accessible Web sites. So far,
one 
of the only formal statements on this issue has come from the European 
Parliament:
         (long URI coming, and skip past the introductory material to
get 
to the provisions)
