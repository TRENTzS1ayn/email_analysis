I think Its partialy correct. Not using JavaScript is more an
is-it-supported
and a security question than an accessibiliy isue. However with
client-side
scripting thinks an be done to make a page inaccessible. Think of a
scrolling
page title, altering the colours continuesly, chaning a font from large
to small
in a loop. Without client-side-scripting it is't possible to do.

The cookies have nothing to do with accessible to disabled people. Its
onlyy
a support and even more a security thing.

100% agreement on this. Also author saying it a too large strain on
their
servers to do it server-side are missing the point. The client-side is
an
extremely hostile environment so the server-side has still to do alot.
Only the network interface could frm a bottle-neck, but it either
indicates
theyre handling the data incorrectly (to much overhead) or the nework
is not suited for the application.
