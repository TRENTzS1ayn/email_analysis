Yes. As one example whenever I see client-side validation I'd lay money on
whatever on the server is receiving that validated data being hopelessly
insecure.
This isn't to say that client-side validation doesn't have its place (I
would always recommend it is used - just not on its own); just that I'd win
that bet more often than I'd lose it.
