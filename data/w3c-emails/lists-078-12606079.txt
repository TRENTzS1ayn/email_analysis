I would suggest that the vast majority of e-commerce applications track
everything through the server.  All the cookie typically contains is a
session number, which is effectively a file name for the file containing
the session data on the server (although it is more likely to be in
memory or on a database).   Both ASP and the one that generates the dead
Javascript links to a null fragment on the same page only store session
IDs client side.

In fact, one strategy for doing without cookies is more likely to store
client side, as it uses hidden form fields.
