Until 1998, I was stuck on the "information dirt track", where
actual download speeds of 100 bytes / sec were a rare luxury.
In those circumstances I used web-by-email myself over several
years.  I even implemented such a service in (IIRC) '95.

Not a bad idea, but certainly not new, and well under an hours work
to implement.

Interesting.  It would seem that googlemail have accomplished something.
Not a technical accomplishment, but one of raising awareness and getting
into the mainstream press.

I'll defer to Al Gilman's reply on that subject.

BTW, calling it "googlemail" looks to me a lot like a case of passing
off, using someone elses (deserved) reputation.  That kind of (lack of)
ethics puts me right off.
