One category that this does apply to is the portable braille &/or speech
notetaker. As far as I know the Braille Lite products (Freedom Scientific)
don't have a web browser application. The Pulse Data is scheduled to release a
browser for their BrailleNote line next month, but the process of upgrading
existing users may be slow. The Elba Linux-based device from Papenmeier
reportedly has browser capability (I haven't seen this one).
