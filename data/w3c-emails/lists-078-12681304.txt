I agree with Al that the model of being able to get into a navigation
structure and get out of it at ny point is better than having to decide at
the beginnning whether or not to follow the "skip navigation links" link.

Which is why I think the lynx implementation of the map element is so smart.
It does exactly that, with ordinary HTML (3.2 or 4.0 or XHTML or even tag
soup that is close enough to HTML that it gets recognised).

There is a neat demo of using map "the modern way" (i.e. what was specified
in 96/97 but somehow hasn't been implemented much) at
http://www.icab.de/test.html - a set of tests produced by iCab to show how
cool their implementations are. It works really neatly in lynx as a
demonstration of what the old technology offered that we haven't yet used.
