Agreed. What WCAG requires is that groups of links are identified and
skippable. I think that is one bit, and that being able to escape a block is
important. (That is a requirement in UAAG - checkpoint 9.9
http://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG/guidelines.html#tech-nav-structure in the current
draft). In addition, being able to get to "the start of the content" is an
important feature in navigation - like being able to get to a search page for
any collection of pages (analagous to using the browser search for a single
page).

I am not sure that it is explicitly identified as a requirement in
WCAG 1.0 which has a short list of explicit structure requirements and then
requires "navigation bars"...
