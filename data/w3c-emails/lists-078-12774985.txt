Not only is it (skip to main content) not in WCAG 1.0, it's not in WCAG 2.0
either.  But I think "skip to main content" could fit in Checkpoint 3.3
Provide multiple methods to explore sites that are more than two layers
deep
http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#nav-mech

WCAG 1.0 and WCAG 2.0 are too biased to the notion that structured content
is the answer when in fact the structures in XHTML are too limited to
communicate more of the semantics of web pages and web applications today.
If there was a "main content" tag, in addition to the "body" tag", then
that could mark the beginning of the "main content".  Additions of the "top
navigation" tag, side navigation, advertisement, etc. tags would help in
further communicating not so much the "structure" but the intended purpose
of the content that could then be presented and navigated by the browser.
I'll take this thread and include it in my comments on WCAG 2.0
