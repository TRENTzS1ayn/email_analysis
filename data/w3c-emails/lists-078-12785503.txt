Steve,
Thanks for the suggestion of adding a "skip animation" link!  I'm working on
a site with small, embedded Flash 5 animations and have been concerned about
what I could do to increase its accessibility.  This should work great for
me - the content in the movies is also explained in the text of the articles
anyway, so by skipping the movie they don't lose any information, I don't
have to worry about people getting trapped in the movies, and they don't
have to resort to using the text only printer version either.

Trisha
