Hi All,

I've just been looking at the voice interface fleximode reference 

  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/wai-xtech/2002Jul/0015.html

I was sent in relation to an earlier question.

Could anyone give me a very brief overview of what this is please as I've
read the text and am a little confused. Probably because I'm reading it out
of context. Basically, is fleximode a product that helps design voice
interfaces or the methodology proposed n the reference above for designing
them? I've been asked to advice on the potential of providing a voice
interface for another system. I have some experience or at least
understanding of WebSphere Voice Server which uses ViaVoice technology under
the hood but that's all I'm familiar with. There do seem to be many other
"voice/speech recognition servers" and wondered whether anyone had any
thoughts or suggestions of where else I should look?

Thanks in advance.
Cheers
Ian
