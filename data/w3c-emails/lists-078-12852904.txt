Following the excellent comments regarding the accessibility importants
thread could I suggest that you maybe skip keyboard interfaces and focus on
neural interfaces instead please!!*grin* This would solve all our
accessibility issues!!

Cheers
Ian

Subject: 'wow!' keyboard interfaces?



Hi,
I'm back thinking about keyboard interfaces again, and was wondering if
anyone could point out software that they considered to have a particularly
good keyboard interface, or better still characterise what it was about the
interface that made it so good.

Cheers,
Danny.
