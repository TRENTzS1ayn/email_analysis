Hello All,

HiSoftware is looking for beta testers for our new web based
accessibility testing tool. Based on our award winning AccVerify. More
information can be found at:
http://www.hisoftware.com/press/accmonwt.html. This Web based beta
requires no special beta agreements. It allows for total customization
of all accessibility settings for Section 508, or WCAG.

Anyone interested please send me a mail off the list, beta should start
on Thursday Afternoon and go for 5 Days.

Best Regards
Rob Yonaitis
