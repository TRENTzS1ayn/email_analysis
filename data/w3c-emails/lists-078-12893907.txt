Hi All,

I am trying to validate a site and have two questions for you. Here is the 
site (I will be asking for an accessibility check in a few days):

http://www.entrepreneurdisability.org/

When I put the css through the w3c css validator it warns me to put in a 
colour for the links. I didn't put a colour in for the link and visited 
link as I wanted them to remain the normal default colour. Do I still have 
to list these colours to be sure?

When I put through a page that has a <ul> it tells me that I can't have 
<br> after </li>. Can anyone tell me how to do it if I can't use <br>? The 
phrase the validator gave me was:
Error: element "BR" not allowed here; assuming missing "LI" start-tag

The page can be seen here:

Thanks for the help,

Cheers

Lisa
