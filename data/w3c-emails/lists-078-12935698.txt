Strictly speaking, even having a BR element will not introduce blank
lines, as its origins owe more to .br in troff, than to line feed in
ASCII.  However the big 2 do interpret it that way.

The right way to do is is to set the top and/or bottom margin on LI,
using CSS, but the hack way to do it on the big 2 (but *NOT* on Lynx)
is to put the BR before the /LI.
