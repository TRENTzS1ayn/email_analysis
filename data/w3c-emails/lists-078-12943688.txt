Well, you may want to leave the default color for the links, but 
in this case you shouldn't redefine the background color too. 
The validator warns you when you change color or 
background-color leaving the second default. It's not an error, 
message, it's only a warning.

Why? Suppose a user set up her browser to use gray text on blue 
background, yellow links and white visited links. Then you 
define white background and black text in your style sheet 
leaving the link color default. What happens is that the user 
will not be able to see visited links at all, because they will 
be rendered white on white. Also yellow links in the white 
background wouldn't be much readable.

Hope this helps.
