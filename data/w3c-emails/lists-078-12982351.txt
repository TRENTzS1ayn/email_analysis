I think this is great, sort of.  But PDF forms seem like overkill.  How are
the PDF forms better than standard HTML forms for this kind of application?

I guess one upside is that they can be filled out offline.  But if they are
meant to be filled online, why not just have a standard web page?

I'm sure there's more to the story than that one article, though, including
the reason they needed to make the forms PDFs.  Anyone know why?
