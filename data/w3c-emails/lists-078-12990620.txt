easy answer to your last question, that is what the decided to do years
ago so rather than find a real solution they decided to cludge.  Html
would have been vastly superior and there are many other things they
could have done and can do, but dispite frequent pounding on them, they
like some other agencies have stayed a particular course for what ever
reasons but the bottom line is that the consumer looses in the end.  The
gains in this case apparently are the same forms can be served to all
and pdf is their favorite route so they can still use it.  They have a
lot of money tied up in it apparently.

I think this is great, sort of.  But PDF forms seem like overkill.  How
are
the PDF forms better than standard HTML forms for this kind of
application?

I guess one upside is that they can be filled out offline.  But if they
are
meant to be filled online, why not just have a standard web page?

I'm sure there's more to the story than that one article, though,
including
the reason they needed to make the forms PDFs.  Anyone know why?
