Could they provide both a PDF forms and HTML forms to cover all the bases?
And both would integrate into the same back-end system?

Maybe they do?

Maybe they're going that way?

Standard web forms would no only help assistive technology users, but also
text browser users, PDA users, WebTV users, and anyone else who can't run
Acrobat.

BTW, I found this on the IRS web site's accessibility page:

<snippet>
Persons using screen-reading devices, who generally cannot directly read
documents in PDF format, will find a HTML version of many of the forms and
the publications on the IRS site. Over the next several months, the IRS
plans to make all PDF files accessible. As new publications become available
in Acrobat 5.0, which is 508 compliant, they will be posted on the site.

For information on Forms and Publications Accessibility:
The IRS Alternative Media Center has prepared hundreds of its most popular
tax forms, instructions, and tax publications using full text descriptions
where needed and is making these files available for download through the
IRS web site. Adobe Acrobat PDF format has been used as a means of
distributing government forms as well as other documents.

BTW, I checked their forms section and selected a few forms to see what
formats they had available.  Of the dozen I selected, none had any other
formats than PDF.  Where are the HTML versions they speak of?

Even the "list of forms you can fill-in using your computer" are all PDFs.

I guess the eFile program offers some forms online.  But none are through
the IRS itself, and some cost money.  Maybe that's why the IRS is reluctant?
