Thank you Dan.

Tax Forms, Applications for Visas and Passports, as well as numerous other
documents still require that they be printed and usually signed or in some
other way authenticated via human intervention.  I think that the American
IRS folks should be commended for attempting to move the envelope ahead,
albeit in small steps.  I agree that they should be encouraged for
continuing to improve what they have (which does have some serious flaws),
BUT they should also be recognized for what they have attempted to
accomplish.  Sometimes working within a system is harder to do than
re-writing the rules to your own particular slant on things, or railing
aginst the "system" without offering partical alternatives (with the
emphasis on PRACTICAL).

In a perfect world, everything we do we would be able to do via the web (so
goes the mantra).  But until we can guarentee interoperable Personal Digital
Signatures with iron-clad authentication I for one can understand the IRS's
reluctance to go full hog.  Even Dan has indicated that he is reluctant to
eFile, preferring to print off and mail his final return.  Here in Canada, I
have authorized my accountant to eFile my returns, and true to Murphy's Law
they "lost" it.  It was finally "found" but not without some gnashing of
teeth, so Dan's reluctance is not 100% ill-founded.

I have a friend who works for the Canadian Passport Office, and their office
faces similar hurdles to overcome.  They are experimenting with a multi-step
process whereby an HTML form is submitted to the server and "processed",
outputting the results as completed fields within a PDF document, ready for
printing.  It also "writes" the fields to a db, but the fields must first be
"authorized" before being accepted - a process which requires that the user
print out the completed PDF, sign it and manually submit it to a passport
office (along with photos, references, etc.).  (Note, they have gotten this
to work in a lab, but have not rolled it out yet... she tells me that it is
extremely server processing intensive and there are overhead concerns there.
But the experimentation continues).

Is this perfect?  No.  But is it a creative attempt to further extend
accessibility?  You bet (or at least I think so), and IMHO even a little is
better than none at all.

Just my $0.02 worth.
