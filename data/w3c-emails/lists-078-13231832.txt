Great example.  What (or which) principles were followed to produced this
Website?

For example, did the principles include any of the following?
      No more than x items should be displayed per page
      Expand the page to fill the browser window
      Provide a border around the page
      Highlight each cell when mouse rolls over
      Include text with each symbol
      etc.

If I were to use this "set of principles", would I roughly come up with a
similar website?
