Hi,

We're using tables for layout, and would like to have a picture show on
the right side of an article, but have the screen reader read the ALT
text of the picture before reading the text.  Any ideas?  I know you can
do this with CSS2, but due to the use of browsers like Netscape 4.7, as
far as I know, we can't rely on CSS2.  We first tried to develop our
website by just using CSS1 and CSS2, and not use tables for layout,
which worked fine in the newest versions of I.E. and Netscape, but what
a mess in the older browsers!  Therefore, our solution was to use tables
for layout. We do use CSS1 for font type, size, color, etc.

The look would be something like:

X = text
O = picture

Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxooooooooooooo
Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxoooooooooooo
Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxoooooooooooo
Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxoooooooooooo
Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxoooooooooooo
Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxoooooooooooo
Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Thanks,

Hy
