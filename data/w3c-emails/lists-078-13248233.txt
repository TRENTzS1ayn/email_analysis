Talking tax forms sound like a real step forward.  It has been
difficult,
especially in recent years, to find tax programs that would talk well
enough
for a blind person to use, so broadening the options will be a great
thing.

The still-very-present problem is access to the *inputs* to the forms,
namely the W-2's, 1099's, and the like.  I wonder how access to those is
going.
