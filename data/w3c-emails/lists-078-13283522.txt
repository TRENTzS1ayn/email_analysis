Hello,

Does anyone know of a table, list or discussion identifying which
accessibility elements and/or attributes are supported by which versions of
which browsers (or assitive technologies) on which platforms. Eg when did
access keys get supported (browser & platform).

I had in mind something like Eric Miller's CSS comatibility table -
http://www.webreview.com/style/css1/charts/mastergrid.shtml

Any pointers gratefully appreciated.

Andrew
