Agreed.  These sites do have serious accessibility problems.  Unfortunately,
the fact that certain screen readers cope with them as well as they do means
that these sites may not be the best options for demonstrating the
consequences of poor coding if the television documentary happens to use
these certain screen readers.

http://www.xo.com/ has some pretty nasty imagemaps that leave me clueless
with JAWS.  The American Airlines site at http://www.aa.com/ is another.
The Observer and Eccentric newspapers at http://observerandeccentric.com/
also aren't so swift.

Cheers,
Jerry
