Please remember, to tell those using screen readers it is a pop-up.  It
can be very confusing to figure out what in the world is going on.

1) Use a browser with a strong CSS2 implementation, and which supports
   frames, and doesn't have popups disabled by the user;
2) Code in a transitional version of HTML;
3) Code links that you want to pop up similar to:

<a href="...." target="pop_up">.......</a>

One with a strong CSS2 implementation but frames unsupported or
popups disabled will still show the message but not pop up!

Specifically, as part of a CSS2 style sheet, the rule selects A elements
that have a target attribute with the value pop_up, and causes an
additional inline box to be inserted into the CSS rendering model, after
the contents of the A element, containing the text:

  (This will open in a new window.)

and with other rendering attributes inherited from the A element box
(I'm not sure if this includes :active dependent ones).

On windowing, frames capable browsers with popups enabled, and no
existing frame called pop_up, such a link, when activated, will create a
new window for the content.  (Subsequent uses will re-use the same
window, unless it is closed in the mean time.)

Frames related attributes and elements are not supported in strict
versions or in XHTML 1.1.
