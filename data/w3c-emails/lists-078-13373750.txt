Hi again,

Well, if I'm suppose to be getting a pop-up, I'm not.  I'm using
Window-Eyes 4.2 Pro by GW Micro.  (I personaly prefer Window-Eyes over
JAWS, but hey, we all have our likes and dislikes <grin>) If you would
like, when I go to my friend's place (probably later today) I can use
their computer, which has JAWS on it.  Just let me know.

Here is what I hear:
NOTE:  quote marks represent what is coming out of my speakers. Anything
not in quote represents an action I took or an explanation.

"Link the peoplo home page" press down arrow
"Link music" press down arrow
"C" press down arrow
"Link Colplay" press down arrow
"Link Creg David" press down arrow
Then every time I hit the down arrow I here "Link" and a letter of the
alphabet.

I'm using I.E. 6.0 for Windows.

Hope that helps.  Good luck!

Warmly,
Hy

Well screen reader users were my particular concern.

We've had a report on peepo.com, and this is one of the issues being
addressed.
Not having jaws, or knowing at this time how to configure it suitably, I

am looking for some qualified responses on whether our test page is
appropriate in this respect.
Has anyone visited http://www.peepo.com/alfy/music/c.html, and used a
screenreader, preferably jaws, and does it work?

equally, is there another method that will check if it is working, ie by

throwing up a dialogue, or sending to the status bar etc.
for instance in mozilla 1.1 the info: "this will open in a new window",
is written all over the screen, as a default(just installed today) and I

dont think this is appropriate.

thanks

jonathan
