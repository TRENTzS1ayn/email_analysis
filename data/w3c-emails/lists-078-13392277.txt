Hi

I'm new to designing websites that match the WAI guide lines.  My
biggest problem with the guidelines is that you can't use absolute
sizing?

Does this really make a big different to the accessibility of the site.

I'm also looking for several different screen reads to try the site out
on any address of where and can download a trail copy or purchase them
from would be great?

Thanks

Daniel
