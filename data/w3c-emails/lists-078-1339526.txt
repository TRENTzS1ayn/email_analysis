describes what the Credit Unions are.  I would doubt that these
organizations, owned by their members, are covered by 508.

Could anyone give me a lead as far as a website to visit or a federal
department to talk to about the accessbility of Federal Credit Union
websites? Does 508 apply to the Federal Credit Unions? Is this written down
anywhere?

Thanks,

Suzanne
