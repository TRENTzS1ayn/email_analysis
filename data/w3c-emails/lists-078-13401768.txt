Basically yes.  If you don't design with relative sizing, people
are either forced to use pixel level magnifier tools, with a considerable
reduction in usability, or to disable font sizes, which for sites not
designed for relative sizing often results in a total breakdown of the
visual structure.

Once you have turned off author sizing, you have to make a conscious 
effort to turn it back on for sites that do use relative sizes effectively.
