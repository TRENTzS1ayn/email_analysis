Probably one of the biggest differences out there.  I'd say this is my 
first item to be considered if you want to make an accessible website. 
The biggest "disability" in the world has to be less than perfect 
eye-sight, right?  How many people do you know who wear glasses?

That's not to mention people who have large monitors -- you know, those 
folks with large amounts of income who are very web savvy and probably 
more likely than anyone else to buy stuff online?  (i.e. these aren't 
folks you want to lock out).

If you use pixels, anyone who uses IE (which includes some 20 million 
AOL/Windows users) will not be able to resize your text.

What problems are you having?
