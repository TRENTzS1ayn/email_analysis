Hi Daniel,

Here are some links to 2 of the major screen readers in use in the U.S.


JAWS for Windows
http://www.freedomscientific.com/

Window-Eyes for Windows
http://www.gwmicro.com

Both of these companies provide trial copies. That being said, there is
nothing which can replace having a bunch of screen reader users evaluate
your site.  I'm currently developing a website, (slowly but surely) and
have had a couple of screen reader users take a look.  They found a
navigation system I was using confusing.  So now I am fixing it.  The
funny thing is, I am a screen reader user myself, but because I knew
what it was suppose to be, it made sense to me.  <grin>  Also, I'm a
fairly experienced Internet user.  I got on the Internet in 1995, when I
could see the screen with my nose pressed against the screen, and have
been a screen reader user since 97.  I'm use to figuring out frustrating
websites, which say they are accessible.

Good luck with your site!

Warmly,
Hy

Hi

I'm new to designing websites that match the WAI guide lines.  My
biggest problem with the guidelines is that you can't use absolute
sizing?

Does this really make a big different to the accessibility of the site.

I'm also looking for several different screen reads to try the site out
on any address of where and can download a trail copy or purchase them
from would be great?

Thanks

Daniel
