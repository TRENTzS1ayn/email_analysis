Hi All,

I put up this site for my client in late 2000/early 2001, at that time I 
found that finding accessibility info was tough-not like today :) I looked 
at many major sites for the disabled to see what they did and read whatever 
I could-so there may be things I don't have on this site-and any 
comments/help with accessibility and usability would be much appreciated.

The client works with disabled entrepreneurs-so this site is used by people 
with every type of disability. When I designed the site, the organization 
was able to get a few testers with different disabilities-which was great. 
Now I need more feedback to see what changes I can do to the site to make 
it even better.

Here is the site:
http://www.entrepreneurdisability.org/

The page that gives me most concern is the membership application page.
http://www.entrepreneurdisability.org/membershipapp.htm
I had this tested by one person and their screen reader (I also tested it 
with IBM and Jaws), but I would love to know if anyone else has any 
comments about it-how to improve it?

Most of the pages validate to html 4.01 trans, although I know that the 
'did you know' page has a problem with <br> in a <ul> list. I am also aware 
of the PDF issues on the newsletter page-we are changing them very soon.

Any feedback (positive or negative) is appreciated-feel free to tear the 
site apart!

Cheers

Lisa
