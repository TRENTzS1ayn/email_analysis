Thanks very much Hy, and Bill

Do we have something screen readers will pick up, but that sighted users wont be distracted by, unless they want to be?



it seems that either my coding is astray, or else Kynn's proposed 
solution* may be less than ideal...

Kynn could you take a look? (is xhtml 1.0 transitional an issue?)

Hy: Window-Eyes 4.2 Pro by GW Micro is not reading the pop-up advice, Hy please could you confirm if jaws reads out the notice. did you try typing a letter, each letter takes you to other music stars, perhaps we can set one or two up for you?

Bill: suggests that the advice should be written to the screen, whereas as I understood this, it was primarily for screen readers.

Jonathan: IE6 does not display the advice on the screen and a new install of jaws 4.5(demo) on IE6 does not read the advice. though i'm a novice.



please excuse my errors, I'm considering setting the font size to 1pt, but perhaps we can find a better solution?
