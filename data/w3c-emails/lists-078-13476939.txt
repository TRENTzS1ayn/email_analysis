Hi,
?
I have a question - and I apologise if the answer is obvious, but I was
never a programmer so I don't know.
?
From what I understand (please correct me if I'm wrong) the DTD and HTML
Lang attribute?are used by browsers/ATs to determine the code and
language used in order to best represent a site.? My question is this:
Can these browsers/ATs still read (and interpret) the DTD and HTML Lang
attribute if it is not at the very beginning of the document? for
example:
?
<HTML>
<HEAD>
<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html;
charset=US-ASCII">?????????? 
<!--alang="en"</HEAD>
<BODY TEXT="000000" BGCOLOR="FFFFFF">
<!-- -->
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN"
http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<title>Amputations</title><meta http-equiv="content-Type"
content="text/html; CHARSET="iso-8859-1">
...
?
This is a Lotus Notes problem - this Content Management System
automatically generates HTML code from a word processing type
environment.? The first five lines are automatically generated by Notes
and cannot be tinkered with in any way (and if they can I would be more
than happy to admit my error and learn how!)
?
Cheers,
Gian
