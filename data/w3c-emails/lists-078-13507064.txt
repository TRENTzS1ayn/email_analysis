An alert box is a system convention that users will understand (or need to
learn) if they use the system at all. So from that perspective it should make
sense.

It still depends on what the alert says, and so on. And you should have
server-side validation in any case, because no everyone will have scripting
turned on and it is generally helpful to validate the data before trying to
process it further (for security if nothing else).
