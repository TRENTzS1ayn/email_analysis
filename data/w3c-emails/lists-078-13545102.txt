Hello All,

We have Started work on the Second Edition of the Understanding
Accessibility book, The new book Will have:

- Detailed coverage of the Canadian (CLF) Standards 
- Full WCAG 1.0 (Current Book is Only P1)
- EARL (Evaluation and Report Language) and Uses
- Digital Media
- XAG (XML Accessibility Guidelines)

The Previous Book covered Section 508 and WCAAG 1.0 Priority one and
Testing Strategies

The goal of this book as with the current book will be:

- Introduction to the concepts & guidelines
- Provide Practical Workshops

This book will Remain free of charge and our hopes are to introduce all
developers to the development and test management of Accessible content
by achieving and passing the 450,000+ Distribution rate we have on the
First Edition. 

I Believe to do this we need to release the book in every language
possible, we are looking for Volunteers to work on the Translations, We
currently have French and are looking for any other languages. 

As a not for Profit book there is no money in it but we will:
- Add Your Name as a Language Editor and Give the Individual the
appropriot Credit in the Text. 

Additionally we are looking for feedback as to what people believe are
issues that should be covered in the second edition that were not
covered in the first. Our Goal is to Release the New book in English and
French in Mid October.

Help us keep this Book available for a cost of 0. Any one interested in
this please contact me off list.

Best Regards,
Rob Yonaitis
