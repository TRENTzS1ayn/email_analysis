I really wouldn't recommend doing this though.

If, for instance, a screen reader already notified a user of links
opening in a new window, then they might hear something like:

  "Link: Microsoft, opens in a new window. Link opens a new browser
  window."

I feel that informing users that a link opens in a different window or
frame is an issue for browsers, and not authors.
