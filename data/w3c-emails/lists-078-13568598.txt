To put it another way can you explain which user agents do advise one?
and do they need any prompting?

ie6 does not seem to, but there again perhaps its not configured right.

I'm getting complaints, but cant get a straight answer as to how to get 
a response.
presumably someone has seen this working, how about sharing the method.

thanks

jonathan
