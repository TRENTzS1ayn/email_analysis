> ie6 does not seem to, but there again perhaps its not configured right.

IE (at least to 5.5) doesn't support attribute qualifiers in CSS 
selectors, with or without values.  Mozilla supports them without
values and may support them with values.

Other minority browsers may support them.

The style sheet simply appends the text to each link in the
displayed page that contains a target attribute with the 
specified value - no animation, etc.  It really only seems of
use to me as an important rule in a user style sheet, as it will
seriously clutter the page in an author style sheet, or require
the user to select a non-default sheet.
