Hi everyone,

I'm hoping you will be able to assist me. We are trying to allow the
uploading of images to our site through a form.  The problem is, the
"brows" button will not read through my screen reader.  Here is the
code:

<input type="hidden" name="MAX_FILE_SIZE"  value="50000">
<label for="logo">Logo of Organization or Activity (50kb  max.):</label>
<input type="file" name="logo" id="logo">

Any ideas?

Thanks!

Warmly,
Hy
