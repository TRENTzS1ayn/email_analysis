All.
For accessibility, what do most prefer to use when specifying font sizes in
order to comply with the WCAG on the issue of using relative as opposed to
absolute sizing and the general guideline of allowing users to control
sizing wherever possible?  I refer here to the distinction between px and pt
etc.  What do people feel is best, px, pt, or some other CSS varient?
Mat.
