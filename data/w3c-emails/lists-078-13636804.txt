Hi,

We use "em" for font sizing in our CSS.

Warmly,

All.
For accessibility, what do most prefer to use when specifying font sizes
in order to comply with the WCAG on the issue of using relative as
opposed to absolute sizing and the general guideline of allowing users
to control sizing wherever possible?  I refer here to the distinction
between px and pt etc.  What do people feel is best, px, pt, or some
other CSS varient? Mat.
