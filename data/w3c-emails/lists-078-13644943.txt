About the only thing that people agree on is that points (pt) should be 
avoided at all costs on the web.

Points are rendered incredibly small on some machines, especially Macs. 
  Points are useful for printing, not for screen viewing.
Please don't use points.

Use EMs or percentages or font keywords....
