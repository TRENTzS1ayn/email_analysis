Perhaps it is in the terminology we use in describing our feelings or our
individual assessments.

I could easily say that the described map is accessible to a JAWs user but
does not meet the WCAG or 508 accessibility standard. I prefer to use the
term "meets a standard" or "meets a checkpoint" or "follows a guideline"
than to say "is accessible" because I have the implied definition from the
standard. I prefer to use the term "is accessible" when it is qualified by
a "to whom" phrase, as in "to an x y z user".  The more precise we are in
our communication the better we communicate.

The WCAG and 508 standards (standard with a small s) attempted to define a
set that would allow many or most, but not all users of all platforms of
all browsers of all assistive technologies to access the site.

Phill
