I don't think doing it within the link is appropriate, since then the
link text doesn't make sense out of context, if I use one of my tools to
get a list of links within the page, the links that gives don't open in
new windows, so your link text doesn't make sense.  I really think the
options are don't use new windows, or leave it to the UA to tell the
user.
