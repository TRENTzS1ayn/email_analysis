Points and pixels are both dreadful. Points are at least theoretically
accessible, since theoretically one can adjust the mapping between points
and pixels in such a way as to ensure the readability of most commonly used
sizes (8pt+), but currently such support is rare or absent. Pixels give you
the same issues as text-as-images do for people with poor vision. I wouldn't
rule out pixels if the size was so large as to guarantee that *everyone*
could see it, which could conceivably be something you would want in a
design, but isn't likely to arise very often.

The best sizes to use are the named sizes.
