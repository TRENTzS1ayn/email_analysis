There are two potential problems with the named sizes too. Where users want
to increase the size a lot, the differences in size become too great.

And in browsers which followed the original CSS recommendation on how big the
named sizes should be the differences are already too much for many people.

In each case it means the user really eneds to set up their own fairly
complete style sheet for sizes :( Not impossible, but a frustration. The
AWARE project at the HTML Writers' Guild was collecting style sheets that
would be helpful for users:

http://aware.hwg.org/styles/

(Oh, and please don't make normal text bigger or smaller than the user's
default. Although some people can't change their default size, it is
frustrating for people who have set a size that they need.)
