Yep.

Below, I meant "normal text" - the general stuff that makes up a page, which
would be read through. I agree that highlighting particular things is
valuable, and small print is so-called because people are used to the (in
theory) administrative detail they don't need to read being smaller.

But a lot of sites use something like small, or 70%, as a default size for
ordinary paragraph text. So I have to increase it again so I can read it.

Cheers
