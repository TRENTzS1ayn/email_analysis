EM or % is the way to go.

A warning though -- I had a weird situation where I used both of these
and when I applied it to text in a nested table the value doubled.
Example, some text that was set to 80% of normal size (through CSS)
suddenly became half as small when inside the nested table.

But perhaps it was just me!
