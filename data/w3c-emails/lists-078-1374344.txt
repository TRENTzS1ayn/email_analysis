Well, for one, it doesn't even validate! Makes me wanna run out and join
with them for sure!
http://www.htmlhelp.com/cgi-bin/validate.cgi?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.iwanet.org
%2Fjoin%2Findex.html&warnings=yes&input=yes

No DTD! (ARGHHHH!!!!!!!)

or how about:
Line 49, character 9:
</CENTER> <TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=2>
        ^Error: end tag for element CENTER which is not open; try removing
the end tag or check for improper nesting of elements

Line 109, character 109:
... GCOLOR="#FFFFFF" WIDTH="100%">
                                 ^Error: element TABLE not allowed here;
possible cause is an inline element containing a block-level element

Line 110, character 61:
...  FACE="Arial" COLOR="#FFFFFF"><B>Step
                                 ^Error: element FONT not allowed here;
possible cause is an inline element containing a block-level element

****************

Then there's the matter of autorefresshing the stupid banner call:
"<IFRAME
src="http://128.121.216.101/cgi-bin/ads/banners.pl?region=1&refresh=10&keywo
rd=NULL" height="60" width="468" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" vspace="0"
hspace="0" frameborder="0" align="middle" scrolling="no"><A
href="http://128.121.216.101/cgi-bin/ads/blink.pl?region=1&slot=1"
target="_top"><IMG
src="http://128.121.216.101/cgi-bin/ads/bimg.pl?region=1&slot=1&keyword=NULL
" border="0" width="468" height="60" alt="Click Here!"></A></IFRAME>"

I love to here that clicking sound that IE is creating every 10 seconds or
so...

**********

OK, in less than 60 seconds then, I've found contraventions on one page to
the following WAI Guidelines: 3.2 (Formal Grammers), 3.3 (Use Style Sheets),
3.4 (relative sizing), 3.5 (Header Elements - <CENTER><FONT face=Arial
color=#ffffff><B>Learn About IWA (Step #2)</B></FONT></CENTER>), 3.7 (use
blockquote properly), 7.4 (auto-refresh), 11.2 (although, since I don't know
which version of HTML they are authoring to, it's hard to tell what's
deprecated...)


Yup, a shining example of what not to do.
