They are preferable alternatives to PX or PT, yes

Nope, that's the danger when EM or % get nested.

That's why I have gone to using "font size keywords" which are 
alternately called "absolute" by the W3.org and "relative" by others.

They are "absolute" in that when you nest a "x-small" inside an "small" 
you get the same "x-small" as you would have gotten no matter what it 
was nested inside.

They are "relative" in that their sizes relate to one another and are 
resizable.
