'leave it to the UA' this would be great except for the fact that many users wont know how to configure this.

also in a college environment the ua will need constant supervision, which is definitely unrealistic.

So, one needs a default that pop-ups can be announced to a screen reader without being written to the screen.




I'm still waiting for a working example, does anyone have an online link that gives this advice using jaws as a screen reader?

thanks
