I was thinking about writing a CSS generator for creating user style 
sheets for various user needs, but noticed the ATRC at the University 
of Toronto has done it already:

http://nide.snow.utoronto.ca/CSS/CSSindex.html

It comes with four default style sheets: low vision, colorblindness, 
limited manual dexterity, and cognitive disabilities. There is also a 
form where users can enter their needs and get a style sheet to address 
them.

There seems to be a great need for this among users who don't want to 
(and shouldn't need to) learn the tricks available in CSS2. I think 
this is an excellent resource.
