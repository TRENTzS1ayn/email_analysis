A Windows user can go into the Start, Settings, Control Panel, Sounds
applet and assign sounds  or earcons to the "open program" and "close
program" events.  Good sound effects are in the Utopia and Robots sound
schemes.  While there, assign the "program error" sound from the Robots
scheme to program errors, and you have a crash which really sounds like a
crash.

These earcons don't warn you that a new window is about to open, but tell
you when your actions or the actions of an advertisement have opened
another window.  The annoying thing is that, in your effort to close
various windows, you will end up closing too many and end your browsing
session prematurely.

I would not put a warning inside a hyperlink.  Perhaps just after it.
