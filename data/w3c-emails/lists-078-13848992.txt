I was asked just recently if there is any kind of internet survey software
that is 508 compliant??

most of what I have seen will not let the user "submit" the final results
in a text based screen reader like LYNX...however I have used this feature
in some internet sites but am unaware of what software package (if it is
commercial) any help to respond to the survey maker would be usefull.  the
person running this is NOT very computer savy

thanks
Bob
