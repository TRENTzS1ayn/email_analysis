As pointed out on a recent thread in www-style, what browse button?

The browse button is not specified by HTML or CSS and is the result of
using a standard GUI control.  It need not exist at all, but if it does
exist, the lack of integration with the accessibility software is an
implementation problem in the particular OS or accessibilty software.
