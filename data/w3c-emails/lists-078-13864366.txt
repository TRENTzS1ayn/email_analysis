[embed] refers to the proprietory embed element used for background 
sounds and other non-HTML, non-bitmapped, components of the page.  It
would be OBJECT elements if OBJECT elements were implemented sensibly,
but many SVG examples use it because of the poor implementation of
OBJECT.

It's not connected with pop-ups.
