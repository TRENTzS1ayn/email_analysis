Not really sure what you mean by "survey software".  If you mean a method
whereby people can respond to a question amd have their answer tabulated
(like a "vote" type affair) then generally any server side script could
probably handle it... as long as they use the input of "submit" and not the
input of "button" (which crops up fairly regularily).  Then, as long as the
supporting HTML code is compliant, the survey should pass muster.

Is that what you mean?  Or am I way off?
