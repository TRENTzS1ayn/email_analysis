Ditto on large lists being not extremely usable: they frequently have no
way of quickly navigating the list using a screen reader, and it is a
matter of too much information. On the other hand, I have occasionally
used some of google's directories to browse through topics, but not often,
as the list format is irritating and time-consuming and I get much faster
and more accurate results when I just use the search feature. This does
bring me to a question I have had though:
What is the HTML code for including a site search field on one's web page?
I am still using only HTML to write my web page code, and could not figure
out how to code a search for the site.
