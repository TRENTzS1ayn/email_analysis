This is a complex question, because it involves commercial issues.  The
search engine operators generally provide approved code fragments, but they
also specify restrictions on use, to ensure that the search engine operators
benefit from the inclusion of the search field.  Generally, you will have
to pay if you don't want the use of the particular search engine to be
too overt, and you don't run your own search engine software on your
web server.  To be legally safe, you really need to look at the instructions
provided by the search engine operators, not some third party summary of
them.

The simplest ones will generally just be a form that submits a query
the same way as the search engine's normal page does.
