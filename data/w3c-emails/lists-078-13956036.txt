As has already been pointed out IE is clearly not the only browser that
supports CSS as stated on the web site. However, I think what is meant is
that the CSS stylesheets generated use IE terminology. For example, I
created a stylesheet using the generator and specified the colour dark blue
for links. The colour value "dark blue" (but without the quotes) is used in
the stylesheet which works fine in IE but when I tried it under Mozilla
"dark blue" was not recognised as a valid colour value and it defaulted to
white. I'm not particularly well up on the CSS spec but would guess from
this behaviour that "dark blue" is not standard. Saying that, the rest of
the output, although simple, does seem to work well and I agree that it is a
much need tool for those unfamiliar with CSS. 

Cheers
Ian

I was thinking about writing a CSS generator for creating user style 
sheets for various user needs, but noticed the ATRC at the University 
of Toronto has done it already:

http://nide.snow.utoronto.ca/CSS/CSSindex.html

It comes with four default style sheets: low vision, colorblindness, 
limited manual dexterity, and cognitive disabilities. There is also a 
form where users can enter their needs and get a style sheet to address 
them.

There seems to be a great need for this among users who don't want to 
(and shouldn't need to) learn the tricks available in CSS2. I think 
this is an excellent resource.
