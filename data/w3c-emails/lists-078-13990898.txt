Right. There are requirements in the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines
[1] for these things to be "clear and obvious" (that's potentially
subjective, even with the exact wording which is slightly tighter, but at
least in claiming conformance a developer has to have some argument that
explains how it is clear...)

[1] http://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG10 is the Recommendation, with a draft for a new
version available at http://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG-wombat and the group
developing them works publicly so you can go there to look at their latest
internal working draft.
