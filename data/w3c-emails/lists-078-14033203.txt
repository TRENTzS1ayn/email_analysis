Hello, all,

Can anyone recommend resources for finding statistics on Internet usage of
people with disabilities (PWD) in the United States?  I'm looking for things
like how often, types of devices and platforms typically used to access
information, etc., as well as demographics, types of information PWD are
most interested in and the like.

Thanks in advance!

Terrie
