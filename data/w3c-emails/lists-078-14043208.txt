Do you mean the internet, or do you mean "web pages".

In any case, any such statistic will miss out the significant category
of those who have not tried because they don't believe that they are able
to use the internet (I believe this applies to a significant number of
blind people, who believe it is a purely visual medium - which may be
true of commercial web sites, but goes against the philosophy under which
it was created).

Any statistics are likely to underestimate the low end of the market because
there will be no commercial interests to collect the statistics and many
people will mis-represent their browser to web sites because of real and
imagined fears that the site will discriminate against them if they 
give its true identity, rather than that of one of the big2 (this actually
happened to early IEs, so IE actually identifies as Netscape (Mozilla),
with a comment that it is IE!).
