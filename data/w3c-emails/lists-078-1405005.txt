But yet the page content is still accessible. I agree with a previous post 
regarding the terminology needing to be switched from "inaccessible" to 
"does not validate." After all, a page's ability to validate or lack 
thereof does not necessarily dictate its accessibility 
(fortunately/unfortunately as that may be).
