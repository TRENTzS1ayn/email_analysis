Forwarded from the blinux list (blinx-list@redhat.com), where it was
forwarded from the blindprogramming list (blindprogramming@yahoogroups.com).

The web site talks about Gnopernicus in more detail, but it is basically a
project to provide output to screen-readers, magnifiers, and braille devices
from graphical applications built in GNOME 2 - a free windows-based interface
for Linux.

The thing is reportedly usable, and as a free project programmers can play
with and improve it (so long as they make their improvements available for
free in source form - see the license for precise details)

Just thought some people might be interested.

Subject: Gnopernicus web site.

Hi, since there is so much interest in the Gnopernicus project here is the
web site for Gnopernicus. Dennis you should put a link to this under the
Linux section, and this might answer most of the questions people have.
