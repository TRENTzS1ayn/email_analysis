Hy,
He browse button is available but not on the first pass.  In my
experience,
the screen reader reads the first focusable item in the <input
type="file">
element.  When you are in forms mode and you tab forward, you get the
edit
field that is part of the input.  Tab beyond it and then tab backward
and
the screen reader reads the browse button.  After locating a file, tab
backward more and then tab forward into the input element and you can
verify
the path of the selected file.  Fun, right?
