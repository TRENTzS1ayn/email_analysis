More or less. The rules that apply are those for SGML or XML depending on
whether you use HTML or XHTML (note that XML is a lot simpler than SGML).

See the HTML specification: http://www.w3.org/TR/html for the latest
(currently XHTML 1 published January 200 and revised August 2002) or

http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/ for the latest HTML specification (published
december 1999, a revision of HTML 4, originally published december 1997 and
revised april 1998).

Yes. Then it is only your title any metadata that is in an unknown language.
