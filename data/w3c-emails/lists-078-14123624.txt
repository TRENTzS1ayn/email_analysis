Browser makers implemented headers first, so that is what people started
recomending. When browser makers didn't implement scope people got laughed at
for suggesting using it (understandable really) with the result that people
who write sites got given the hard way first, and had to wait for the simple
solution to be useful.

Unfortunately (but again understanably really) users don't change their
systems very often. So you don't get to take advantage of the newer features
(well in terms of implementation - these were all proposed in '96 or '97) to
make your life easier until users go through the process of upgrading, unless
you are happy leaving a whole lot of users in the cold.
