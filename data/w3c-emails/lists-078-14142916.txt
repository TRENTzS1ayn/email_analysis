Use ID and HEADERS.  SCOPE is still not implemented widely enough to merit
your relying on it at this time.

This was the report of Ken Nakata and Doug Wakefield to the
FedStats workshop of accessible tables as recently as the end of June.

The 508 materials you refer to are older, hopeful, and not yet valid as
reflecting implemented technology.  You should regard what Ken and Doug
reported to the FedStats workshop as a clarification with regard to the
earlier technical information from the Access Board.
