Today however some user agents (IE5+, Netscape6+) will interpret the HTML 
and CSS in different ways if the DTD is present versus absent.  Typically 
without a DTD the UA will try to emulate past old, buggy behavior in 
previous versions of itself, where with a current, correct DTD it will 
follow the standards more correctly.  So to get consistent results that you 
can count on, including a DTD can be very important.
