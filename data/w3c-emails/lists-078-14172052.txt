The answers may not be so different as they may sound.

Let me hasten to say that what we were dealing with primarily
in the FedStats meeting would come under Jim's 'complex' category,
where HEADERS is the only way [at present] to ensure service
to the customer.

What I don't understand is what the cases are where SCOPE adds
value, between tables handled fine by the first-row, first-column
heuristic and the cases where HEADERS markup is required to make
the connections right.

At the FedStats Workshop there were multiple vendors showing tools
that reduce the time and errors for this considerably.
