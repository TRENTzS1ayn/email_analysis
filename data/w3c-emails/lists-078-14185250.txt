Hi,

My understanding is JAWS will read forms with title tags in them as long
as there isn't a label associated with it.  I know for sure JAWS will
read title tags in <a> tags, provided the user has their settings set
properly.

Window-Eyes will read titles for forms that don't have a label in them.
However, Window=-Eyes will not read title tags in the <a> tag.  When I
asked GW Micro, the creators of Window-Eyes if they could add this
feature, they said they didn't see the need.

Hope that helps!

Warmly,
Hy

I assumed that title and status content was read by screen readers, this

appears not to be the case.

can anyone advise me if this is a configuration issue?

thanks
