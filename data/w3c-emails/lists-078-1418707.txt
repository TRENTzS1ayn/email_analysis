David, et.al.

Federal Credit Unions are not federal agencies, they are owned by the
members that form them. They are regulated, however. See
http://www.cuna.org/data/consumer/whatis/whatisacu.html
and (when it's up)
http://www.ncua.gov/

As far as I can see, a credit union doesn't fall under 508.

Could anyone give me a lead as far as a website to visit or a federal
department to talk to about the accessbility of Federal Credit Union
websites? Does 508 apply to the Federal Credit Unions? Is this written
down anywhere?

Thanks,

Suzanne
