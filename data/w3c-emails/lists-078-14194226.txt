You read the table of "tests" correctly. The best thing today is to put
headings in row one and column one as measured by assistive technology
support. I tried to be careful and say, "for programmatic identification"
use scope and TH. There are places where the scope "adds value" and one is
in the corner, like row 1 column 1. With TH there and without scope, you
can't tell whether that heading cell is a column heading or a row heading.

I hadn't seen Nakata's Power Point Slides before, Thanks. They (Doug
Wakefield and Ken Nakata) recommend the same as I said in my post - use TH
and scope for simple tables and when the table is complex (where TH and
scope are inadequate) then use headers/id.

The answers may not be so different as they may sound.

Let me hasten to say that what we were dealing with primarily
in the FedStats meeting would come under Jim's 'complex' category,
where HEADERS is the only way [at present] to ensure service
to the customer.

What I don't understand is what the cases are where SCOPE adds
value, between tables handled fine by the first-row, first-column
heuristic and the cases where HEADERS markup is required to make
the connections right.

At the FedStats Workshop there were multiple vendors showing tools
that reduce the time and errors for this considerably.
