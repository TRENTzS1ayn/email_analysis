Let me emphasize what Jim said:

"If the table is complex ("more than one Logical
level of row and column headers") then your must use headers and id's
because headings will not be properly identified with TH and scope."

That is a key point.

The other point is that the screen readers do a pretty good picking up the
top row of column headings and first column of row headings all by
themselves, without even TH's - so the real requirement is if you can't
design (or re-design)  a simple table, use the headers= attribute on
complex tables.
