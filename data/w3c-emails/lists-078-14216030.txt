Neither is Jim Thatcher nor jimthatcher.com.  He is a consultant, and quite
a good consultant since he was the vice-chair of the committee that wrote
section 508 and pioneered the 1st screen reader called Screen Reader for
DOS, that where the term "screen reader" comes from, the "Kleenex" of
facial tissue.

Jim is just as independent as the authors of these reports that you
recommend, and, more importantly, he is more knowledgeable.  I don't know
Mr. Steve Graves, a former GCN reviewer, and chief engineer at
Communications Resource Inc. of Potomac, Md., but he's no accessibility
researcher or pioneer.

These articles only compare a few products, while Jim's evaluation compares
them all.  If you have some specific information about Jim's comment on
AccVerify, I'm sure he would accept the input.

I have and use HiSoftware, Lift, Crunchy, Bobby, SSB, and others. I have
and read the Forrester report.  I'm not complaining about the reports or
reference to them, they are all good, just not complete without also
comparison evaluations like at jimthatcher.com
