Pedantic point: you mean the FPI.

That's logically correct.  Though it's also worth pointing out that at
the time the WCAG was written, all the online validators would permit
omission of the FPI, and would validate to a default doctype in the
absence of an explicit one.

The underlying point is of course that the markup should be correct.
That too is problematic.  Valet is stricter about validation than other
accessibility tools, and delivers a straight fail on invalid markup
when evaluating at AA or AAA.  This leads to many users finding it too
strict, and preferring something to reassure them:-(

I would apply a simpler test: they must validate, and they can't validate
without it (actually in SGML terms they can, but HTML imposes additional
restrictions).

OTOH I wouldn't quarrel with your answers.
