penny made from our book to a charity you do the same Jim!, However, we
give the book away, some people because of guidelines cannot accept free

Show Supporting Data Please and do not stand on I am Jim Thatcher so I
am above reproach. It is simple Jim your review is Invalid. How can you
even call it a review when you mix two products. 

Make a claim that our forms are not labeled, did you check all one
hundred+. 

I am not speaking for other vendors, but the arrogance that you show
here is sad. As I sad Jim, You have done good work, this Review is not
in that category. 


Correct it!
