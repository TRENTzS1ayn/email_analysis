I should have included Site Valet, A-Prompt, WAVE, RAMP, and others. But I
didn't. And I am sorry.

Erm, if you're not a vendor, why are you promoting information on
exclusively one product?  Is it by any chance the product you happen
to be familiar with?

IIRC, the OP asked for more general info than individual products.
That's one reason I considered a reply pointing to my own pages
would not have been particularly appropriate.  But anyone reviewing
accessibility products should of course include the leading online
service (now also available in a desktop edition) at
