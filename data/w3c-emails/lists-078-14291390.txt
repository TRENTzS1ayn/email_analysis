Yes.  The other point to note is that the guidelines aren't really
so concerned about the DOCTYPE, they are concerned that the document
comply with the DOCTYPE.  Having out of place tags fails on that
point.

> 2. Can the lang=en be specified in the BODY tag instead of the HTML tag?

Yes, although you should include it on HEAD as well.  Neither place
will probably be spotted by a search engine.  However, my impression was
that you couldn't control the HEAD and BODY tags (at most one of each
is allowed - the HEAD and BODY elements are always present, but the tags
need not be).

Please don't do this; I can do without 4.5K of proprietory format data
in my WAI mail folder (25K for the first article).
