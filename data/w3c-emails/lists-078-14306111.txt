I only have experience with JAWS, and I'm guessing you mean the title
attribute.
We happen to have tested this just today.  It can - if you make it so it
reads
tooltips.

That's under...uh... I only have that at work.  You have to get into the
configuration management, which I forget the right options for.  Then, it's
Set Options -> Verbosity Options -> <your current level's> Preferences ->
Tooltip.

That's with JAWS 4.02, I believe it is.
