Yes, that is what I meant.  The title attribute, like:

<a href=":http://www.nowhere.com" title="The Nowhere Home Page">Home</a>

Sorry for the confusion.

Warmly,
Hy

I only have experience with JAWS, and I'm guessing you mean the title
attribute. We happen to have tested this just today.  It can - if you
make it so it reads tooltips.

That's under...uh... I only have that at work.  You have to get into the
configuration management, which I forget the right options for.  Then,
it's Set Options -> Verbosity Options -> <your current level's>
Preferences -> Tooltip.

That's with JAWS 4.02, I believe it is.
