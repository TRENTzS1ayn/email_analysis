I understand that jaws version 4 and above allows you to set what type of
alternative text attribute is read.  Either alt, title, on-screen text, or
the longest of those if more than one exists.
I also understand that the new version of Jaws (4.5)  allows you to set a
kind of cascade for the alternative texts. so that for example, the longest
of them is read first, otherwise alt is read first if it exists, or then
title, then the on-screen text, then... src (for images etc. i assume)  ...
and so on.
I am not sure if different cascades can be set like this for different html
elements other than links or graphics.
With forms, I think that Jaws will still try to read the label if it exists.
Hope this info is useful.
Mat.

I assumed that title and status content was read by screen readers, this 
appears not to be the case.

can anyone advise me if this is a configuration issue?

thanks
