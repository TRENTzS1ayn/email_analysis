Hi,
I am doing some research work on searching and browsing. I want to 
design some thing which depicts the advantages of both 
comparitively.
So, to which one people go when they feel to retrieve information 
about some thing or in some other occasion: Browsing or 
Searching?

Please help me regarding this...

regards,
Pavithran
