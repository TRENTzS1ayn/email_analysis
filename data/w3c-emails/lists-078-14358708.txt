No, I don't think you can be in double-A conformance without satisfying each
Priority 2 checkpoint. The conformance section is pretty straightforward. If
you say that things are WCAG double-A when they are demonstrably not, it may
not be a good idea in the medium term...

What the checkpoint says is that you must inform the user "until user agents"
do it themselves. Remember than back in 1998 and 1999 when the guidelines
were being finished this was looking forward to the day when user agents did
this, and the requirement on authors would vanish.

The problem for users is that unless they know they are having a new window w
opened they get confused and disoriented. I know, because it happens to me.
And I can see the screen and find out what is happening. So I use a user
agent (iCab) that does tell me when a New Window will be opened (unless
people do stupid things like link to a piece of javascript), and one (Amaya)
that just won't follow instructions to make new windows except from the user.

I think that a case could be made that user agents can inform the user, and
therefore the checkpoint is not applicable. At the moment the market
penetration of such user agents (Amaya, snufkin-enhanced Explorer, iCab, etc)
is pretty poor, so it is a very weak case that I would expect to fail under
real-world testing...

But not for too much longer I hope. Browsers are improving. The work being
done on the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines includes making sure that
there are implementations of the requirements, and if you want a particular
feature you should be able to find a browser that does it. (If you want all
of them then it is like any other standard - complain to your browser maker).
