Steve,

If you want the "conformance" tag to have any real "authority", then fudging
sections of it seems inappropriate to me.

"All Animals are created equal, some are just more equal than others..."
(to paraphrase George Orwell).

W3C Priority 1, 6.3: "Ensure that pages are usable when scripts, applets, or
other programmatic objects are turned off or not supported. If this is not
possible, provide equivalent information on an alternative accessible page."
(Most often, the launching of a pop-up window invokes a JavaScript call
[which often opens a window with a fixed width and height].  If JavaScript
is not enabled, then what?  Yes, you can spawn a new window using the
target="_blank" attribute, but this introduces it's own issues as well,
including resource issues, spatial disorientation for those with cognitive
disabilities, etc.  How many new users, not aware that they have spawned a
new browser, become frustrated that their "Back" button isn't working?)

W3C Priority 2, 10.1: "Until user agents allow users to turn off spawned
windows, do not cause pop-ups or other windows to appear and do not change
the current window without informing the user." (Now it can be argued that
users *can* turn off pop-up windows [using applications like "pop-up-cop",
etc. or via their preferences settings - such as in Opera], but then the
content is not accessible...)

My feelings on this have been aired before - if you say it, means it!  Since
some user agents cannot handle pop-up windows, including them for ANY reason
introduces possible accessibility/usability problems.  Not knowing your
site, or your situation, I cannot say that your action cannot be acheived in
another way, but I can suggest you try.

Cheers!

JF
