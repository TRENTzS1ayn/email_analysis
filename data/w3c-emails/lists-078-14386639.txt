Pardon the cross posting to members of multiple lists.

A situation has arisen where a large group of institutional developers have
been recommended to implement a series of "Standardized" Access Keys
assigned to "Skip Nav" functionality across multiple web sites .  However,
the recommendation came without sufficient research, and unfortunately 2 of
the 3 recommended Access Key commands are "reserved" in a major Adaptive
Technology application.  Specifically, they have recommended the use of
"Alt+1" and "Alt+2".  Users of IBM's Home Page Reader may recognise these as
being  "Alt+1 = Headings Reading Mode" and "Alt+2 = Text View".

It's a mess.

An alternate solution must be developed and implemented immeadiately, and I
volunteered to query this group of informed and involved experts for
possible solutions.  Current thinking is to move to "Alt+X", Alt+Y" and
Alt+Z" (Windows terminology - other platforms generally use variants of the
same), but proper research is required before recommending these revisions.
Time is of the essence, so perhaps this group could assist?

Is anyone out there aware of the 3 newly proposed Access Keys being reserved
in any current user application?  While the focus is primarily on web
browsing in the broad sense, if there is a conflict with another mainstream
application this information is important as well.

Thanks in advance to all respondees.
