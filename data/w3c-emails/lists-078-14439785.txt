Just a thought...even if JAWS etc tell the user can we be sure that
people who are using braile readers and other forms of display also get
warned.  After all the SOCOG Case was taken by a gentleman who used one
of these and there are many others.

Thanks John and Charles. I'm auditing a client's site so I have to make
suggestions. If it was my site I'd simply remove all popups. But my role
is to advise on the options available.

Both your viewpoints of sticking to the guidelines make sense. If you
say it, mean it. For me the frustration is a lack of working examples
accompanying the guidelines. No one on this list or on the WebAIM list
-- and we have world experts in the field of accessibility on these
lists -- has given a happy solution to this.

I'll rephrase a previous question to the list: do JAWS, WindowsEyez or
IBM Home Page Reader warn the user about a new
window/popup? If these do then the case for UA's doing the job is solid.
The checkpoint says that a warning must be issued -- if the UA does it
then surely the site doesn't have to.

Steve
