the alt-letter keys are used as operating commands in LYNX and possibly

I'm afraid that there are probably few if any keys that are not used in
one software operating system or another for something. and I can't think
of anything that is unused in any operating system or communications
software

seems a "Blank" or unused key is fair game fore programmers.  also don't
forget those using other languages in which keys are used differently, and
then those using non traditional alphabets such as Korean, Japanese, etc
on Double byte operating systems which use totally different keyboarding
systems.

for the internet to be cross platform and cross language it must be pretty
basic, I doubt you will find any combination of keys that are totally
unused.
  and then throw in folks using "adaptive" keyboards such as eyegaze or
voice control ...........

sorry to throw water on the fire but I'm afraid too many American's forget
this is a "WORLD WIDE WEB" and microsoft is not the only operating system
in existence
