Thanks Jukka, I'll pass this link on to the client.

No, they override the coded ACCESSKEY attribute, but since the Skip Nav
function aids the visually impaired the most (not exclusively, just the
most), having it paired with non-functioning accesskeys (and even going so
far as to telling users what they are) is just hopeless... <sigh>

It's appearing that X,Y and Z may in fact not be viable.  Perhaps Alt+7,
Alt+8, Alt+9 (and after reading your page) Alt+0="Accessibility Features on
this site"

The intent here is to actually assign Accesskeys to 3 "hidden" skip nave
functions...
