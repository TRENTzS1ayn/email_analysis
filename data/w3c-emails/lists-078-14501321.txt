You're totally right -- it's not a perfect solution. But so far no one
has stepped up to the microphone and shown the way. 

Perhaps if there is no perfect solution we should choose the least messy
one. To recap here are the options:

1) Provide a warning in the link itself, e.g. "MS.com (link opens a new
window)"

The downside: if your browser does provide a warning you'll hear "link
opens a new window" twice. Not the end of the world. 

Also, some browsers which extract links from a page don't actually open
that link in a new window. These users are probably used to the nuances
of their browsers and probably wouldn't be totally thrown out by this
"mistake". Hell, they might even think "These guys are trying to make a
WAI level-AA compliant site. That's cool!"

2) Provide a warning near the link, e.g. in the TITLE attribute.

Downside: TITLE is not universally supported so the users who need to
know this snippet of information most might not get it.

3) Don't ever provide popups or open new browser windows.

The downside ... Depends on the site.

What do you guys think? In the inclusive and universal spirit of
accessibility option 1 might be a step in the right direction?
