Actually my preference is for option 3. It is possible in most windowing
browsers to open a link in a new window anyway. I suspect even emacspeak can
do this.

For option (2), although not all browsers make the title attribute available,
many more do than tell the user that a link opens a new window. So the
argument that you satisfied this because you did half and the browser did
half of it's share seems stronger.

(checking what happens in individual browsers and being able to back up the
argument would help - anyone have some data already?)

Otherwise I would go with (1).

That's my 2 cents worth. If you have the data for 2 you could propose the
argument to the WCAG working group as a technique for WCAG which has support
in browsers...

cheers
