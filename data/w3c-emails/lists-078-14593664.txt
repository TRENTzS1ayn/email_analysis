In my opinion, Accesskey should never have been put in the specs until
there was an understanding of a very small number of keys reserved for
specific navigation purposes.

Window-Eyes uses the alt numbers 0 through 9 for reading the contents of a
frame or window of information from the screen.  In WE 4.2 and probably
earlier, the SET file which configures Window-Eyes for use with IE has
alt-0, alt-1 and alt-2 undefined.  Alt-3 will read the whole IE application
window.  Since these "hotkeys" are handled by the screen reader, they are
not passed on to the browser.  I would think that HPR would intercept its
hotkeys before an accesskey directive could see it.  

See if you can design the pages with only one accesskey or none.
