I was trying to get access keys to work with IE but they don't seem to.
I had GW Micro try it, and they said they couldn't get access keys to
work in IE with or without Window-Eyes.  Funny.  Does anyone else have
any info on IE and access keys?

Thanks,
Hy

In my opinion, Accesskey should never have been put in the specs until
there was an understanding of a very small number of keys reserved for
specific navigation purposes.

Window-Eyes uses the alt numbers 0 through 9 for reading the contents of
a frame or window of information from the screen.  In WE 4.2 and
probably earlier, the SET file which configures Window-Eyes for use with
IE has alt-0, alt-1 and alt-2 undefined.  Alt-3 will read the whole IE
application window.  Since these "hotkeys" are handled by the screen
reader, they are not passed on to the browser.  I would think that HPR
would intercept its hotkeys before an accesskey directive could see it.


See if you can design the pages with only one accesskey or none.
