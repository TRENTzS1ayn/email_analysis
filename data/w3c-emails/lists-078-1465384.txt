There is no such thing as an image button in HTML.  There are images within
button elements, but there is no clean fallback mechanism for these, and
the first browsers (other than Lynx) to implement them, did so in a way only
suitable for client side scripting.  There are also image maps on forms.  As
image maps, they break the cachability of GET mode forms because they don't
send exactly the same coordinates every time.

Because what you call image buttons are image maps and are virtually useless
for text mode browsers, when used for their intended purpose.  The fact
that Lynx may display them when it doesn't display ordinary images is
purely the result of a pragmatic error recovery policy.

This reads like "click here" to me!
