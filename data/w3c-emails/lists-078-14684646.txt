I though Dublin Core was about author provided metadata.  It seems
to me that such data for accessibility would simply further ghettoize
accessible web sites.  Ordinary authors will ignore it, or, if forced
to include it, provide token "safe" values, thus degrading the value
of the data.  If may even be seen as an extra cost in making a site
accessible, making accessibility weaker in a cost benefit analysis.
