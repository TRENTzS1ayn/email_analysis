slightly off topic:

regarding the use of pop-ups, there seems to be a faction that only know 
of the annoying variety, there are plenty of positive uses for them.

music, radio and film sites frequently use them. this content is the 
type which does not benefit from filling the screen.
they open in a new small window, and one can continue browsing and 
seaching as needed, in the original window.

what arguments are there against this type?

(Our users with severe learning difficulties, would never find these 
pages if they had to navigate through their homepages, so we link 
directly to them, assuming ie6 with plugins. in the future it might be 
possible to include some sort of -browser-sniffing- however this content 
negotiation is tricky. )
