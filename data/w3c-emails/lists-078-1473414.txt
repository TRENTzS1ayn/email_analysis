The first Microsoft browser to support them failed to provide the
name and value when used to actually submit the form - they obviously
implemented them only for client side scripting.  At the time, I was
actually involved with developing HTML applications and I was doing
some of the work in the, unsupported by marketing, Lynx browser.  It
worked with BUTTON, but the application failed on the IE browser that
was the official target!  (I think this was IE4.)

The real problem, though, is that button does nothing at all on pre-HTML
4 browsers; whoever designed it forgot to provide a graceful degradation
path.  Combined with the fact that designers had already started using
DHTML for animation effects and had long since found a workable solution
for graphical buttons meant that it was dead in the water from the start,
and the latter point means it is still dead in the water - although not
a scripting issue in this case, this is the greatest problem for any
attempt to provide declarative alternatives for scripting - the scripts
do what the designers want and the elegance of the declarative approach
is not enough to make them change.
