Certainly in the field of accessibility, it is clear that the author 
may not be the best person to assert that the resource is accessible 
- usually on government and other sites a third party is requested to 
do this. And the metadata that will convey the information about the 
accessibility will probably not be stored as part of the actual 
resource. Further, with new technologies emerging that will test , 
and re-test, sites for accessibility, it will be computer agents to a 
large extent that will create the metadata - and it may be developed 
as a service to people who have special access needs.

What do others think?
