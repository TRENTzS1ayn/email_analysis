well, it sounds a bit like PICS but there are a lot of new 
developments that make it much more likely that we will succeed now 
than it was back when we made PICS.

PICS lacked structure, repeatability and strings, so it was further 
developed and became RDF. It is probably with RDF that we will be 
able to come up with metadata schema that do what we need - and EARL 
is just one example of what will probably be useful.
