Unfortunately john your argument fails by a rather simple test.

you say 'ask don't tell*', but people with severe learning difficulties 
are in no position to respond.

they don't know if they have a T1 line, so asking them, in effect denies 
them access to the resource.
whereas, they more than likely recognise charlie chaplin, _If_  they 
have an interest in him.
(similarly text versions of books are great, but many of our users need 
abridged versions, and these may not be. The option could confuse.
Most cannot read, but none have a screen reader, and there is no 
'free'(as in lunch)screen reader designed for their needs.....
So don't imagine that your proposed solutions have not been considered, 
they just aren't very helpful for our users. )

This gap between the ends and the means, is in large part the issue that 
w3c/wai is failing to grapple with.

thanks
