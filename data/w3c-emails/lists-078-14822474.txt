I don't disagree with your conclusions, (popup windows best avoided) I do
however disagree with most of the arguments.

Opening new windows in no way relies on javascript, and when javascript
is used, this can be for added benefit (such as validity to a HTML
version without the target attribute, or more control to the user etc.)

<a href="/moo"> ... </a>

is equivalent to

<a href="/moo" onclick="//cause moo to open in new window"> ... </a>

as far as scripts being disabled, the result of activation on the link is
the /moo resource being available to the user, the script will just
suggest some additional behaviour, the accessibility of moo isn't
effected because of the script (it will of course because of the new
window, I hope the distinction is clear.)

I believe there are many UA's which do allow, in fact I don't know of a
combination which doesn't under some configuration, neither should it
prevent access to the content (if the script is appropriately authored)

I don't see the relevance here at all, firstly it doesn't mention script
values, and it's a side issue to the main point of opening a new window.

This is certainly an issue I agree with.

The default behaviour in UA's that I know of is for the history to be
copied to new windows, therefore the back button will work, it has to be
specifically disabled, so whilst yes that is something to include in
techniques documents, I can't see that it's a reason not to use.

Of course they will, "don't rely on script" is well covered in WCAG, but
it's a seperate issue to new windows.

I have to say I don't believe they can even "sort of" let alone anything
else.
