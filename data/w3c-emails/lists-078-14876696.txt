Mike I'm not sure if you've brought this up before, anyway certainly it 
has been entertained.

As an SLD teacher with seven years experience in the UK, I am in a 
position to reply.

If we define SLD as representing those people with little or no reading 
or writing ability, and this is a fairly arbitrary definition, then it 
is very hard to see how they could contribute directly. Bearing in mind 
that there is currently very limited screen reading software available 
for their needs.

peepo.com is a project I manage, that is run jointly by Lambeth College, 
and Wandsworth Social Services. It's purpose is to enable SLD clients to 
more easily access the web.
It's development is directly influenced, by my understanding of their 
needs, WAI standards, and my coding skills.
To some extent then it is a model or reflection of current understanding 
of SLD accessibility needs.

Please also consider that I've been contributing to WAI for quite a 
number of years, and yet understanding of the issues is slow to develop.
In the fullness of time, there will no doubt be this possibility. Anyone 
anxious to meet and/or work with SLD clients/users to better understand 
the issues is very welcome to contact me. Wendy has been a visitor, 
though unfortunately I may have spent too long distracting her with my 
ambitious plans.

thanks

jonathan
