Need not, but in the real world does.  Most windows are opened
with href="#" onclick= or href="javascript:...", not with 
href="fallback URL" onclick=... or href="wanted URL" target="...
(The # is literally a hash not a place holder in my example.)

The default behaviour of the ones I use, including IE5.5, is to clear
the history when the window is opened using the object model, or
target=.  IE5.5 does retain it when opened using the menus, but that
is not we are talking about.  The Mozilla's I've used clear the current
URL and history when manually opening a fresh window.  I haven't
checked the behaviour for right click open in new window.
