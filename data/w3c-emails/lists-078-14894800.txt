I suspect some of this is to defend against third party advertising
popups (and ISP advertising popups, such as those generated by 
Geocities), and generally unsolicited popups, rather than popups
triggered by explicit actions, or at least correlated to mouseovers.

The market for such software is unlikely to be amongst those who are
confused by popups, but rather for relatively sophisticated users.
