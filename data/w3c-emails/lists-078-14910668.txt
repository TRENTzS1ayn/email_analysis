Dear WAI Interest Group Participants:

The User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 (UAAG 1.0) has returned to a 
fourth Last Call, so that reviewers can comment on changes since Candidate 
Recommendation. UAAG 1.0 addresses accessibility of Web browsers, 
multimedia players, and their interoperability with assistive technologies.

During the past year, while UAAG 1.0 has been in Candidate Recommendation 
at W3C, the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines Working Group, chaired by 
Jon Gunderson, has made excellent progress in getting developers involved 
and in documenting implementation experience. As a result:

- The Working Group improved, clarified, and simplified UAAG 1.0. A few 
checkpoint
    provisions with low implementation experience were deleted so that UAAG 
1.0 could move
    forward towards Recommendation. The conformance section has been 
simplified.

- The Working Group has made good progress on test suites for UAAG 1.0, 
which will enable
   more precise evaluation of the accessibility of specific browers and 
multimedia players, and
   on evaluation tools and an evaluation report format.

The document is available at:
    http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-UAAG10-20020821/
A list of changes is available:
    http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/wai-ua-wd-changes
The Working Group is taking comments through 18 September 2002, on the 
public mailing list
    w3c-wai-ua@w3.org

The UAWG does not expect to make substantial changes to the document as a 
result of this review, and expects to
request to advance directly to Proposed Recommendation after the review. 
More information on the W3C Process is available at:
    http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/

We would like to bring your attention to the report documenting 
implementations of accessibility features of UAAG 1.0 in browsers and 
multimedia players, and welcome information on additional implementations 
of which we may be unaware.
