Input of type="image" is not a problem, just put alt text on the image.
Example at www.IBM.com, both "search" and "go."

All

I am working on the assumption that using an image to submit a form will
cause accessibility problems either because of the need for javascript or
because it would mean using invalid html to create a text alternative for
the image. I am in a situation where I am being asked to use images for form
submission and would like to hear the views of list remembers.

thanks

Julian
