It is "our" responsiblity to ensure that it is as easy as can possibly be to
set up a profile. Agreed this is not straight forward as can be seen from
the use and set up of CSS but is possible.

For what it's worth, I don't believe we should always be working to the
lowest common denominator. Yes we absolutely MUST take everything into
consideration and do everything feasibly possible to cater for all but we
have to draw the line somewhere at some point. We can't halt progress. We
absolutely must keep an eye on the future to ensure that new and emerging
technologies support accessiblity from the outset. The fact that we have
even been asked to comment on this proposal is indeed testament to how far
things have come which I welcome. It ain't going to happen over night but
rather this than the far to common "it's not accessible so how do we fix it"
model. 

If individuals don't want to use this feature for whatever reason then
that's fine, but let us at least give them the option. Yes there will always
be situations which mean a particular approach will not be suitable but in
this case I haven't heard 
any yet which couldn't be over come.

I personally feel the benefits outweigh any disadvantages.

Cheers
Ian
