I agree with that, I was playing devils' advocate for a bit there

it is where to draw that line that we seem to have a problem with,  I just
try to make sure we remember that the level of technology that "we" have
in the industrialized part of the world is not necessarily the same level
as the rest of the world, and if you are a disabled person in Nicaragua
for example your computer is probably second hand, you pay for access to
the internet by the minute and your modem may be 2400 baud. but this
persons need for what the internet has to offer may be more important than
what we need, especially since that may be the ONLY access to the
knowledge they need.

no argument there, the future technologies of today are the antiques of
next year the more access built in the less adaptation that has to be done
by the IT folks on the front line.   of course one of the pet peeves of
most people using adaptive gear is that every advance seems to push one
more group of disabled users off the net.

heck just getting a "how do we fix it" is more than most do.

I agree, but I think there should be some basic level that should always
be a fall back position, and since there are few if any pieces of
equipment that can not use ASCII text I think that should be the fall back
position for every improvement (IMO) and that if anything has to be
dropped maybe it should be some of the intervening steps, always leaving
the basic ASCII text mode as the "bottom line" even an old TR-80 can read
that!  And yes I know folks that are still using them.

but I'm sure there will be some who will find them.

> I personally feel the benefits outweigh any disadvantages.

benefits and disadvantages are always in the eye of the beholder.  I am
writing to you in PINE, not because I don't have Mozilla or Netscape but
because for my needs it is the best.  do I see any benefit in fine
graphics and fancy eyecandy, nope. so what is to one a plus is to another
a negative.  and I for one would not use anything that requires me to
allow the server access to my computer, I have the highest firewall I
could establish (which I am sure has holes in it, just haven't found em
all yet) and I won't even visit a site that requires cookies'.  I use the
net to "find" what I want, then I call or mail em my order, I am far from
unique here. not to mention the millions who refuse to even go on line for
fear of loss of privacy. (real or imagined) M$ is doing nothing to
aleviate these fears among the hold outs.
