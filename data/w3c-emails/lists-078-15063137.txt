I may have misled you. The URL is not accessible and does not have the alt
text. I have locally coded it with alt text and found what I described
before. I need some help coding the example as an OBJECT. Then I will put
them both (with permission) on my site and let y'all know.

When I get these available I would be interested in how LYNX handles the two
cases (APPLET and OBJECT).

Thanks Bob.

so I just visited the site using Lynx and it loaded and ran rather well,
although I did not get the "shimmering water" caption all I got was the
infamous [inline]
