It may develop this thread further to outline a specific case...

peepo.com is reasonably accessible say ~A. it more or less passes the w3c
validator, and has been hand checked to some extent.

it now links to a number of radio stations.
these mostly work in ie6, however very few work with ie5.2 on the mac.
the people who set up the radio stations have relatively sophisticated and
lengthy scripts for sending users to the correct stream.
I've had to shortcut this, because they ask too many questions, for our
users.
I don't wish to copy, let alone understand these huge tracts, neither do I
wish to reverse engineer them, there might even be legal implications.
Given the diversity of sites that we link to, a monolithic script for the
site would be truly gargantuan.

However many of the links will be down for reasons outlined above, for many
users, and this makes it in my mind a very poor example, and yet there is no
immediate solution that presents itself.

Hopefully this explains the area which may need further development.
