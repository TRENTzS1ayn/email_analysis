A mere 28 days late, here is my reportage of Bill Gates' receipt of
the Louis Braille Award for contributions to blind people.
Really, the Microsoft Accessibility group should have accepted
the award (Gary Moulton, come on down!), but that's not how these
things work.

*Who* would have thought that a 10-year-old could upstage the
richest man in the world?
