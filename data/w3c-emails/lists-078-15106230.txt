Hi
 
I just test one of my site using Watchfire's bobby tool and under
priority 3 Accessibility I was told that my site does not meet the
requirements for Bobby AAA Approved status as I have not provide a
Summary for my table.
 
The table in question is just there for layout purposes and not data as
I understood the guild lines you only need to use summary for data
tables.
 
Is this correct?
 
Thanks for your help.
 
Daniel Hillier
