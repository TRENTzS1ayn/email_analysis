I normally put in something along the lines of 

summary="layout table"   :-)

Hi
 
I just test one of my site using Watchfire?s bobby tool and under priority 3
Accessibility I was told that my site does not meet the requirements for
Bobby AAA Approved status as I have not provide a Summary for my table.
 
The table in question is just there for layout purposes and not data as I
understood the guild lines you only need to use summary for data tables.
 
Is this correct?
 
Thanks for your help.
