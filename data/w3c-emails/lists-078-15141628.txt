Using tables for layout is not accessible and therefore you cannot get a triple-A standard where tables are used, that is my understanding of it. If you must use tables for layout, Julian's suggestion is best.

However, there are alternatives that work well, although Netscape 4.x may cause problems.

Good luck

Yes you don't have to specify a summery for these kind of tables because
tables _MAY_ not be used for layout purposes. Thus you don't have to
specify
a table summary if you don't have a table ;-)
