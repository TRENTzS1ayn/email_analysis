Hi Daniel,
If you are going to use tables for layout only, include the summary but
leave the value blank. Eg. summary=""

I dont see any point in making a user listen (if using a screen reader) to
all instances of all tables that merely say "layout table", this just
prolongs the time a user will have to listen to the page with no extra
benefit. If this value is blank Screen Readers, in particular JAWS, should
ignore the tag completely.

Of course if your table holds data or would benefit from an explanation,
then go ahead and use the 'summary' tag with a useful description.

I am only talking about Screen Readers here, not any other form of assistive
technology. Using blank summary tags will get is past the Bobby test.

Hope this helps?

Regards
Matt
