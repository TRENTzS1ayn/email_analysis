I am currently working on two sites, and want to make sure that I'm
accessible. I've run the tests and it appears to be so, but would like some
opinions as well.
 
The sites are:
 
http://www.carty-intl.com <http://www.carty-intl.com>  (log in as visitor
with username visitor and password info)
http://www.appearancestrategy.com <http://www.appearancestrategy.com> 
 
Thanks for any input.
