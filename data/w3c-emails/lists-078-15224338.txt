Hi Nina,
 
Had a quick look at the first site which looked OK to me although I
personally found some of the text a little confusing. I have no idea who or
what IBO is for example. I also did find the sentence "For use with
prospects, clients and IBOs in the United States/Canada only." very clear.
Maybe it's because I'm for the UK but I have never heard prospects in this
way and it wasn't immediately clear that it was the site that was "For use"
with but I'm being very picky.
 
The second site however, http://www.appearancestrategy.com
<http://www.appearancestrategy.com/>  I didn't have so much joy with. I use
my own stylesheet which sets font size to 14pt (I know, shouldn't use pt in
general but this is purely for my own use and I wouldn't use it otherwise!!)
and with both IE5.5 and Mozilla the top right links are partially obvscured
and are only readable using my powers of deduction. It like the right hand
side of the words disappear under another "layer". Had a quick look at the
source and not being a CSS guru couldn't see anything particularly obvious
but this looked unusal to me:
<div class=PageContent id="Cat1"
style="visibility:visible;height:auto;z-index:1;position:absolute;clip:rect(
0,600,auto,0)">
 
Appart from not knowing what clip does I can't see why you would give the
div a class and then add more inline styling. Why not just stick with one or
the other? There could be reasons why you might do this though I suppose?
Also, I did notice that the font-size is set to 12pt which is accepted (as
mentioned above) not to be the best units to use. The predefined words
small, large,... I think are the best choice.
 
I didn't look at anything else and I only looked briefly at the above but
hopefully it will be of some use.
 
Cheers
Ian

I am currently working on two sites, and want to make sure that I'm
accessible. I've run the tests and it appears to be so, but would like some
opinions as well.
 
The sites are:
 
http://www.carty-intl.com <http://www.carty-intl.com>  (log in as visitor
with username visitor and password info)
http://www.appearancestrategy.com <http://www.appearancestrategy.com> 
 
Thanks for any input.
