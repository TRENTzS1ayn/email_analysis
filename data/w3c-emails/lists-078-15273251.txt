Hi Everyone,
Sorry for the cross posting.  I know that audio descriptions are required for
multimedia and videos under standard (1194.24) (d) "All training and
informational video and multimedia productions that support the agency's
mission, regardless of format, that contain visual information necessary for
the comprehension of the content, shall be audio described."

Does this provision also hold true for video's that run in a web page or cd rom
in software such as media player, quick time, etc.?
Thanks in advance.
Scott
