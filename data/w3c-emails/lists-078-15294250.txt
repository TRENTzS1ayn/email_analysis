If a developer is not developing according to formal grammars - i.e. their
code is not valid HTML (for example, although it applies equally if it is not
valid RTF, PDF, etc) then they are causing fundamental problems. If they are
doing it right then this is a necessary step.

Where I say in my original message a textual version I do not mean a
plain-text document - in my opinion those are of very limited use in
accessibility except as a final rendered version for a small group of people.
I mean a hypertext structured document, but one that uses text rather than
graphic content or a particular layout convention to convey its message.

(A "correctly marked up document" may indeed be sufficiently flexible to
provide a one-size-fits-all solution. Making such a document is difficult in
practise, and for some real world examples it may be less likely that
accessibility will be provided in this way than by having a flexible
delivery. Each approach has potential problems and benefits...)

Cheers
