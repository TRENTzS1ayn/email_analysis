I think this is basically untrue.

There is a browser that has a partial implementation - emacspeak. It is free,
but runs on Unix systems - I don't know if it is available for Windows (the
speech drivers for Windows-based free speech synthesisers are probably the
real problem). And there are a few bugs in it.

But unlike what Dave says, it is useful to have a browser that does this
because emacspeak allows the user to apply their own style sheets (in CSS or
XSLT). I have only asked one regular user of emacspeak, and he is happy to
continue with the built in default user style sheet in most cases (he
specialises it for a few things that he does a lot).

Cheers
