Many of the guidelines, checklists, and validation tools mention
that you should not only validate by using an automated tool,
but also using manual validation by people with disabilities.
I thoroughly searched the WAI website but could not find anything
on how and / or where to do that. I sometimes see request of
webpage authors on this list if someone can have at look at their
site, but I wonder if this list is the place for such requests. Just 
imagine that accessibility becomes a well known issue amongst web authors, 
then a couple of hundred maybe thousands of such requests would be posted here.
