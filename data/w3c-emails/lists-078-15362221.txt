Someone asked me just now if I think that tools have made a difference to
accessibility. I thought that what I said below was clearly saying they did,
but since apparently it isn't I will (try to) explain why I think so.

For most people, learning accessibility testing is very difficult. Just using
the list of checkpoints is almost impossible without already knowing what is
in the techniques documents, and knowing some stuff that could be added to
them.

The tools that have been produced for testing and repairing accessibility
problems in Web pages have been enormously helpful by making it easier for
people to do what they need (make acccessible pages). At times people have
claimed that a tool can automatically test everything and there is no need
for a person. I don't think that is true - I know that some tools recognise
their limitations and explicitly ask the user to check some features, and
others just test a certain group of features.

People have from time to time misunderstood or misused the information they
get from tools - this is something we need to keep thinking about. But the
tools themselves are helpful, and seem to be getting better all the time.
Allowing people who aren't experts in either the web or accessibility to
produce accessible web pages (by the right mix of guidance, help, tesing,
etc) and providing ways to make existing web content more  accessible are two
important things that tool developers have done to make the Web a better
place, and I look forward to them getting even better at this.

I suspectit will be a while before they can take away all the need for
thinking. But already they can free up a lot of time to concentrate on the
really difficult issues by making the simple things very much easier.

cheers
