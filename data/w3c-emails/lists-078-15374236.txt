I'd say also very tedious to do with any degree of thoroughness:
a recipe for oversights!

Any tool has to compromise somewhat between doing a thorough job and
overloading the user with mostly-irrelevant information.  Of course,
the only tool that can guarantee complete support for WCAG is one whose
report on any page is the WCAG itself.  But a useful tool is one that
adds to that, by drawing a users attention to specific things that are
(or might be) in violation of the WCAG.

In the case of an organisation managing a web team, another role for
tools is in automatic monitoring of updates in support of an
overall QA strategy.  When someone makes a "trivial" update and
commits some blunder through inattention, better an email reminder
from Valet the next morning than that it goes undetected!

Yes.  The spellcheck is a useful analogy: the limitations on what it
can do are broadly comparable, and are familiar to anyone likely to
be using web-accessibility tools.
