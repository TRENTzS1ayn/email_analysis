Scott,

As a usability (early) and accessibility (later) person, I like this 
idea of a joint seminar. I keep running across instances where a new 
facet of a disability surprises me, whether that disability is sight, 
hearing, or mobility.

You are correct that it works both ways. I've found people with (and 
for that matter without) disabilities often are not aware of 
usability research and developments that could benefit them. People 
doing usability research and development may not fully consider the 
impact on and potential benefits (perhaps with only a bit of 
tweaking) for people with disabilities.

I perhaps should mention that I've seen a few usability efforts that 
despite the best of intentions were less than fully beneficial due to 
misapprehension on the part of the usability developers and the 
absence of input from people, particularly people with disabilities. 
No, I don't want to point fingers. Yes, most developers are aware of 
the (general) problem and do include users in their projects -- at 
least when it comes to testing.

I regret I would not be able to attend the proposed seminar. I hope 
the event happens as it could be very beneficial. I would like to see 
the lessons learned be made widely available.
