The term "standard usability testing methodologies" was used frequently in
the questionnaire.  Is it defined somewhere?  What comes to my mind
includes, but is not limited to the following:

- paper walk through design test with user subjects
- observations & timing of user attempting to complete a task
- satisfaction of user attempting to complete a task
- focus group discussion of needs & requirements
