I think this is entirely beside the point.  What is an international
Webmaster organization, one that has taken over the HTML Writers' Guild and
allegedly embraces its philosophy on accessibility, doing creating a
membership form that includes numerous infractions of accessibility
requirements? One can only hope that this is strictly temporary and will be
wrung out in the near future, although it looks like it's been many months
since the HTML Writers' Guild merged with the International Webmasters
Association.

Jerry
