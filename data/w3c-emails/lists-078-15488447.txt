Hi Nina,

A brief look at the first site (http://www.carty-intl.com) noted the
following:

   Contrast issues between navigation links and background image;
   Increasing text size can result in overlap of navigational text-links
   with text in background image;
   Avoid beginning all text links on a page with the same word - this means
   users navigating with a links list are unable to alphabetically jump to
   an area of interest - begin the link with the most distinguishing
   information as much as possible.  (e.g. Feature Product list, all begin
   with 'new');
   Some text size is fixed (e.g. text in search result table);
   Identical text links to different targets should be avoided (e.g. search
   result for "baby food" is three text links of 'baby food' that go to
   different targets);
   Data tables are not marked up with headers (e.g. search result table);
   Layout fails in NN 4.7
   Lists not marked up as such (e.g. list of 'air treatment product' links
   have no separator between)
