Nina,

I've taken a quick look at both sites.

> http://www.carty-intl.com (log in as visitor with username visitor and password info)

The page looks fine except for the non contrasting link colors at the
top. When enlarging
the font size so I can read it revealed a few things. The links flow out
of the image t
the top and flow into the content earea. It also seems that the name of
the site and what it
delivers is in the image. Thereby the links and this text fall together
are aren't very
readable anymore.

This could be prevented if the background image of the page is seperated
into three areas
and made the background for a <div> tag. That is one for the links, one
for the name of the
site + what is sands for, and one for on the left of the content area.

The links at the right are a bit difficult to read due the colors
choosen. When enlargin
the font size the links at the right are hidden behind somekind of area,
and are not
so understandable when you see only the first 3 or 4 characters.

Also the text of the contents area flows out of the contwents area and
starts to overlap the
logos and ads at the bottom. This could be solved when the content area
would streatch itself
to be taller. This could maybe done using a couple of div tags with a
couple of background
images. But it may require a layout table to be able to keep the same
layout.
