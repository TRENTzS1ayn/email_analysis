Can this legislation be invoked for the production of DVDs also then? I
haven't been able to use any DVDs easily (but this isn't many) because you I
have been presented with an on screen menu that I can read. An audible
description would enable me to work out what's going on. Then all I need to
do is work out how to select the appropriate option!!!!

I have had discussion with others regarding DVD accessiblity and there does
seem to be a lack of any standard approach. Some are good, some are bad and
generally the players themselves are inadaquate.

(I know this isn't strickly web related so apologies in advance for any
stress this may cause anyone.)

Cheers
Ian

From our understanding (and authoring - we sat on the Access Board's
EITAAC), we always expected that those uses are exactly what that provision
was written for - so the answer to your question is yes.

And it's not so hard - see may examples at ncam.wgbh.org/richmedia
