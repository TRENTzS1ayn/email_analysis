There is a new article on the Making Connections Unit website:

What is an accessible website? Attempting a definition.
http://www.mcu.org.uk/articles/whatisaw.html

It is an attempt to find a way of thinking about accessible web design that
addresses the needs of website producers, not just consumers.

If you have never read any of the articles on the Making Connections Unit
website before, this is the one to start with; I think it attempts to
address some important issues. I expect there will be people who don't agree
with the conclusions, or the approach taken to get to those conclusions - if
so, but don't keep your thoughts to yourself, add your comments to the page
or to the discussion forum. Or get in touch with me directly.

All the best,
Jim
