If produced by and/or for the federal government, its employees and/or the
general public, DVDs would be covered as well.

There are a few examples of DVDs with video description (as well as closed
captions) on the marketplace and a few with talking menus: from PBS Video -
"Abraham and Mary Lincoln: A House Divided," "Marcus Garvey: Look for Me in
the Whirlwind," and from Universal, "How the Grinch Stole Christmas (Jim
Carrey version). More are coming.

The access features were produced by WGBH's National Center for Accessible
Media. For more info, write me or access@wgbh.org
