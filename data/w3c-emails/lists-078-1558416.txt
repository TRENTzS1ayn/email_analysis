does anyone know a list of speak plugins?

I just tried www.speaksforitself.com, and apart from its strange 
license* it is very easy to load and install.

It doesn't however read alt or title text**.....
I'd particularly like one that did, do you know of one that is free?


thanks

*does anyone think this is enforceable?
** a javascript workaround is possible, but what a way to go...
