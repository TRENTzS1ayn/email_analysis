This is most of what I think is a sound approach. However it relies on
empirical testing (if I can't find a person who has a problem that person
doesn't exist) and tools. Each of these approaches is a bit it and miss -
there are things that they won't cover

 - the person who can't write to explain why they can't use the site, as
   happened to me when trying to pay a bill from Telstra)
 - the tools miss the fact that some groups will not be able to find a
   piece of content, so will never know they missed it. For example, the
   critical link for people with cognitive disabilities is hidden from normal
   visual display. I think there are still simple ways of doing this that
   aren't picked up by tools

I think that having a specific list of checkpoints (and I use the WCAG
ones...) which have some rigourous approach to covering the practical
problems is important as well as the empirical testing.

One of the critical pieces below is the insistence on testing the design when
it is conceived, implemented, and altered. And another is the idea of
creating a template. I think that for simple sites a template can just be an
HTMl page structure, but in any serious project a content management system
(CMS) is important. This raises a number of issues - what things need to be
available in the CMS structure, and in particular what needs to happen as a
user adds data, or wants to create a new presentation.

I did some work recently on this that i think would be useful if I can only
write it up properly. (Problem was that it was largely unrecorded, and
entirely in Spanish, and it will take me some time to make it available).

But there are content management systems designedd to support accessibility,
and there are tools available to monitor accessibility on an ongoing basis
and provide reports. More of both is always a good thing of course, as is
adapting or extending existing systems that people are using and comfortable
with.
