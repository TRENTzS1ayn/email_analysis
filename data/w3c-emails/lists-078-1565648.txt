Hi,

I'm just finishing up a project where we checked web page accessibility
for blind users by phone.  Basically, each blind subject was on a
conference call with the testers.  There were a couple of benefits to
this approach.  It reduced the amount of set up time because the blind
subject was able to work with his/her standard accessibility
configuration.  Another benefit was that it significantly reduced
testing costs like travel while increasing the number of testers.

I've been asked to take our notes and produce a document describing the
approach taken so it can be used in some other projects.  I was thinking
it might be good to include any testing approaches that other people may
have taken.  So far the only significant description of testing web
pages by blind subjects seems to be the one written by the
Norman-Nielsen group.  If you know of any other or have your own
approach, I would very much appreciate hearing about them.

Thanks,
Scott
