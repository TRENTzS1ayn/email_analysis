Yes it would as per the way (x)HTML is designed.

This could pose problems to the extend an user who doesn't see the
position relative to the rest of the contents. One solotion for such
devices would be either to _always_ ignore the pre-loading attribute,
or to wait while he complete page including all objects is flly loaded
to start reading.

For a page that does not have the pre-load attribute on a section, the
screen reader could start to read as soon as (x)HTML file is downloaded
(images and othetr objects are still loading, or won't be loaded at
all.)
This doesn't pose an problems because only the objects are skipped in.

But when an author uses a <section pre-load> or more preferable
<section style=":partial { content:"loading"; visible:none }">
around the complete page or around pieces of content that contain
more that only an image or other object, the linearity of the page
would be broken up completely, and the user would not know the
relation between the parts of an document. For users that can see
what is happening on the screen (the positiopn of what is read within
the document) it would be clear, for those who can't see it, it won't
be clear.

To prevent this either a screen reader must _always_  be able to tell
the user agent to not honor the pre-loading of sections, this would be
accompliced if it's implemented using CSS. (see the messaqge posted by
Tantek on this subject)
