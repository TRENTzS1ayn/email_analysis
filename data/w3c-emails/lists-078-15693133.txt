Peepo has advocated for some years the use of the keyboard as means to select links.

In the latest mozilla browser, when you type a letter, except in a text entry box, it cycles through links that have that letter in their text.

it seems slightly buggy, but what do you think?

(course it screws my coding right and proper)

thanks
