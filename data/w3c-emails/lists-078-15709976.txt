i found out about this only a few days ago and have
been using the so-called 'typeaheadfind' since then
quite a lot.  i haven't found it buggy at all and
absolutely love it.

it's more a Find function then a 'cycling through
links' function.  with the focus on the page you just
type a word (or beginning of it) and mozilla jumps to
that word.  F3 finds the next instance.  it first only
looks at links but if you type a '/' (slash) before
the word it searches the whole text.  it really just
saves you bringing up that cumbersome Find dialogue
box.

i don't think it really works for cycling through
links.  the tab key works better for that.
