well those are some of the positives, how about disabling for those who are
hyperactive, and just cannot stop fiddling with the keyboard?

its buggy in the sense that for instance 'k' words aren't just those that
start with the letter k but also those that include the letter k. I'd expect
it to have a few others besides.
