It would probably be better defined as: for all
replaced elements, and all block level elements,
which contain one or more replaced elements.

When imnplemented as an CSS property it could be forced
to be ignored. This would enable it for special users need,
devices, or other software, which use an user agent (that
does or does not implement the property) to get their data.

When implemented as an (X)HTML attribute, there would be
no way to disable it's effect for an user agent that implements the 
attribute, and by this can cause accessibility issues.

The proposed CSS property of Tantek would seem to
be the thing, now only the *complete* definition
for it and agreement of *all* parties.
