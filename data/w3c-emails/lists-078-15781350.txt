OK, apologies in advance for this one but an interesting problem has come up
on another list and I was hoping that someone hear might know a bit more.

The problem is with regard to the use of terminal emulation type software
such as Citrix where a client uses applications running on remote servers
via a purely graphical interface. Screen readers can't make any sense of
these images so does anyone know of any research or bodies involved with
looking into this accessibility problem? Obviously, in some cases it is
straight forward to use a telnet session to perform or use such utilities
but what about when this is not possible? 

Once again apologies for the abuse of this list but I hope people will
forgive me this disgression on the grounds that it is a ligitimate concern.

Cheers
Ian
