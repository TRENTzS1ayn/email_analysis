For the same reasons that the sighted person wouldn't use it:

- any add on software constitutes a technicality barrier for most users;
- it may require additional clearances from network administrators;
- many network administrators may refuse it because sites heavy in banner
  ads often have terms of use that forbid the use of banner blocking software;
- the machine may be a shared resource and the network administrator may
  not want to impose such a policy for all users.

On the other hand, a sighted user can much more easily ignore or dismiss
the adverts (although people with some perception disorders may get
confused as well).

Popups are much more of a problem for blind users, but they are no more
technically oriented than sighted users.
