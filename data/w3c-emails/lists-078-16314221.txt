Hello,

The DAISY Web site, http://www.daisy.org does not have SMIL online, but
tens of thousands of Digital Talking Books (DTB) use SMIL and are being
distributed on CD-ROM. In most cases the content is around 500 meg of
compressed data. Tough to put on the net right now.

Best
George

I've still seen all too little implementation of SMIL technology.

Does anyone know of a site with links to a broad range of examples? Does
this one:  http://www.choicefm/choicefm.smi meet the intention of 
the smil group?

Come to that do we yet have a list of accessible (best practice) 
examples of other (w3c) technologies?

I'd offer peepo for ecmascript, but I'm sure we can suggest more 
suitable references.

thanks

Jonathan
