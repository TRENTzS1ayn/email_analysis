Hi, all!

I just had this exchange with my webmaster, who is trying to make my under-development site accessible:
I said:
"- all links that are live need to be the standard blue and underlined,
> > going to the usual color (can't remember what that is at the moment)
when clicked"
He asked:
> >"Is this an accessibility thing? I'm using the hover tags from CSS to
> get the menus to change colors during selection process. The drawback is
> that the underscoring disappears on regular text until the mouse appears
> over it. Any suggestions?"

The site is at www.accessall.net/work/ Can any of you suggest what to do or who else to ask? This is 'way beyond my expertise.

Thanks for whatever help you can give.

Audrey
