It's not an accessibility thing... it's one of Jacob Nielson's more 
irritating usability recommendations.

Your links don't need to be any particular color, though they need to 
have sufficient contrast against the blue bar. And since it's pretty 
obvious that the links are part of a navigation bar, They don't need to 
be underlined either.

The text size does need to be bigger, though. Your webmaster shouldn't 
go below 1em in his font sizes or should use another method of 
determining font size.
