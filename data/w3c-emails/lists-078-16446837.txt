Hi Petra,

The URL is http://www.drempelsweg.nl which should sound something like
www.thresholdaway.com in english.
The pages are in Dutch and there is no english translation of the pages.

The project is a government project and started in april 2001. 4 so
called ambassadors (one with a physical handicap, one with a visual
handicap, one with a mental handicap and one with a hearing handicap)
tried to get 100 intention explanations from commercial companies and
non profit organizations to make their web site accessible. Accessible
here means including priority 1 checkpoints of the WCAG 1.0.
In april 2002 there were more than 100 of these intention explanations
signed including banks, our parlement www.tweede-kamer.nl, some online
shops, our national train company www.ns.nl etc.

We are more than a year after the first companies signed the explanation
and I can say the intentions are good, but realy making a web site
accessible is another thing.
Most of those who signed the explanation publish more inaccessible pages
every day, than they make accessible. Another problem is, htat they
signed a explanation on making their web sites accessible based on
priority 1 checkpoints (give frames a clear title, add alternate
description to images etc.).
Our parlement web site www.tweede-kamer.nlclaimed that their web site
was accessible following the Drempels Web standard, but in practice I
could not read parts of the web site with Hal / Supernova screen reader.
Another problem is that priority 1 does not say anything about the use
of relative table sizes, instead of absolute measurements. This are
priority 2 check points. People with vision loss often use their own
large font and set their display resolution to a low value. The effect
of using absolute measurements is, that you get horizontal scroll bars,
because the page does not fit on the screen anymore. To read a line of
text you have to move the scroll bar from left to right for any line of
text you are reading. On some pages scroll bars are disabled and
information becomes inaccessible at all.

Also in the European Uninion they are taling about prority 1, as they
talk about making web site accessible.
Maybe this helps blind screen reader users, but not those other millions
having problems accessing the Internet.
I bring this topic up in the WAI several times, but there seems to be
less people there with the interests of low vision and elderly people in
mind.
All what is said is, that it should be solved in the client, but who can
point me to a browser, that let me reformat my pages without losing
information?
There is a Internet Explorer 5.5 and higher plugin called WebEyes (see
http://www.ionsystems.com/ion/aboutwebeyes.html), that does some
reformatting. But I do not like the concept of this company let owners
of web pages pay for making there web site WebEyes enabled.
The plugin does not work well with screen magnifiers.

Since a year I use a braille display and screen magnifier to access my
computer and the Internet. For accessing the Internet I always use the
free and exelent webformator (http://www.webformator.com) plugin. Acting
like a blind with WebFormator give me better access to the Internet than
all those WCAG priorities, because most web designer seems to stop after
adding alternate descriptions.
