It depends. If the future necessity and current desirability of higher level
compliance is borne in mind when doing the first "pass" it can be a useful
part of the process of deciding strategy, many AA or AAA improvements can
then be done in the first stage of improvement.

If it's done in a more mechanical way of first ONLY doing A work and then AA
work then it is indeed a flawed strategy.

In other words I think the WAI prioritisation is a useful tool in deciding
on the local and mutable prioritisation scheme you describe.
