This weekend my political site was visited by a regional embassador for
Friesland of drempelsweg.nl who is nearly blind. I got a mail that this
site is accessible and  he liked the added text why the site is built as
it is and how browsersettings can be changed  when it is necessary. The
site meets AAA conformance.

In your mail it seemed that there are only  Dutch sites that are not
still accessible but will be made accessible soon or later.. .

Hallo Ineke v/d Maat
