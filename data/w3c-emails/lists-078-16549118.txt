Just received this news item from the E-Access Bulletin. Don't know how many people receive this from this list, and it seemed an interesting item. Shame that it is on at such an inconvenient time of the day/night.

* TO ALL READERS OF E-ACCESS BULLETIN:
- NEWS UPDATE: AUDIBLE TELEVISION ON BBC1.

For the first time this week, people in the UK will be able to access
audio-described programmes on ordinary analogue television. BBC One
is rerunning four documentaries from the recent 'What's your problem?'
season of programmes on disability, in accessible formats, in the early
hours of the morning over the next two days (6-7 November).

Audio description is an extra narrative audio track that verbally
describes important visual details. The first documentary is 'The man
who learned to see,' on at 12.10 am late tonight/early tomorrow
morning. Full details are towards the bottom of the page at:

According to the RNIB, the screenings are an opportunity for visually
impaired people to experience audio-described TV and request more of
the services. "People should write to the BBC
[http://www.bbc.co.uk/feedback]. If enough people show support for
audio-described analogue services it will be difficult for the BBC to
resist doing more and increase pressure on the government to set
higher targets for digital services," said a spokesperson.
