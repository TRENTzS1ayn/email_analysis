I'm working on some forms that use Javascript as the first line of
validation and PHP as the second.  But I'm having trouble accessing the
checkboxes when I just use the keyboard.

When I tab through the items, I skip over the checkbox so I can't select it.
I'm not able to select the label either to check the box either, as I am
able to do with the mouse.

If someone could point me in the right direction, I'd appreciate it.
Thanks.
