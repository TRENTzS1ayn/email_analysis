To say again:

it is my contention over something like 4 years that it is essential 
that we demonstrate by example, what is currently implemented and the 
advantages or not of using the tools that we promote.

No one else has an 'authorised' or even extremely popular reference 
judging by google, and this means that it is more than necessarily 
difficult to find out what is the current best practical means to 
implement plain html never mind scripts.

ps opinions on implementation are a necessary first step, thanks :-)
I like the 'a' tag method because presumably most browsers use it, and 
I can remember it.
