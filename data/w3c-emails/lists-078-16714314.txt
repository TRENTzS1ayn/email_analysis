Please remind me whenever I open my own business, I'll do it in a brick
or wooden building insead of a concrete one. :-)

Clearly enough (as already said many times) a very strange judgement,
probably
based on poor knowlegde of e-business, or the meaning of the meaning
behind the
ADA. The ADA s antidiscrimination, and not just a law to ban out strairs
only
buildings.
