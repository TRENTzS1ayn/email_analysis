The aim is not to produce a toolTip over text.
The aim is to provide information about the abbreviation in a manner that
best approaches the balance of making this information available to those
who benefit from it without breaking the flow of the text to those who
don't.
Producing a toolTip is a good way of doing this for some, but by no means
all, users. Even then the title attribute is not sufficient in itself to
mark that the encoded text is an abbreviation (as opposed to a piece of
jargon that might also be given such extra information:

<span title="a hacker with malicious intent">cracker</span>
