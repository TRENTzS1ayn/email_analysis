abbreviation and acronym already have definitions that were created 
before the web, and are not of it, they certainly do not relate to 
tooltip or your un-named and un-described alternatives.

the route I suggest is less open to confusion, a tooltip is readily 
identifiable, if there are other uses, let us describe them, and then 
we will be better able to understand what would be suitable for their 
usage.

It is evident that abbr and acronym give no help in this context.
