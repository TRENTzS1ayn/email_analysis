One use is in screen-readers reading the title as well as or instead of the
abbreviation (either the first time it is encountered, or every time)
another use that is becoming common is:

@media print{
abbr:after " (" abbr(title) ")"
}

Which works on Mozilla. An equivalent that works in IE can be faked where
one puts the text that would be generated by the CSS above explicitly into
the HTML, but mark it as display:none for media other than print.
