Please review the developments from the workshop held recently at the 
(Dublin Core) DC 2002 Conference in Florence. See 
http://dublincore.org/groups/access/

The DC accessibility group are interested in making contact with 
others working on aspects of accessibility metadata and would 
appreciate your involvement if you are in that category.

Please feel free to join the DC list and share your interests in this 
area of work. We are working closely with W3C standards and hoping we 
can help disseminate the good results of the W3C accessibility work 
as widely as possible by 'implementing' accessibility in the very 
extensive DC-based metadata context.
