Hi,

The issue of "getting it right" is an interesting one, but it is not
clear exactly what it means since various people and organizations have
different interpretations.

With regards to web page accessibility, I contacted hisoftware and found
out their software doesn't address a number of the issues of "understanding".
When we were doing some web page testing, some of the questions that blind
people were asked were like:

    1.  What is the purpose of the web page being presented?

    2.  How do you know you are correctly interpreting the purpose of
        the web page?

    3.  How long did it take you to correctly understand the purpose
        of the web page?

    4.  What on the web page is confusing to you?

    5.  What on the web page did you use incorrectly?
