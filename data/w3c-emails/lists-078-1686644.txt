there is no validation here.  Now, if you use comparison strategies and
ask what was good or bad or whatever about this site as opposed to this
site and you knew at what starting point the person was at skill wise,
you might get somewhere.  I cannot even begin to answer most of the
qquestions you asked here.  Let's see.  I'll try in my in your message
below.  Hisoftware products address these issues in that if their
suggestions are followed, pages will be as accessible and usable as
possible.
    1.  What is the purpose of the web page being presented?
dp: if the page is well written and accessible, I could take a fair
guess as could anyone looking at it.

    2.  How do you know you are correctly interpreting the purpose of
        the web page?
dp: my experience with life tells me and if I don't know, I will tell
you I don't know.

    3.  How long did it take you to correctly understand the purpose
        of the web page?
dp: if I cannot understand the purpose of a web page within two minutes,
I either ask someone if it is im;portant enough or I move on.

    4.  What on the web page is confusing to you?
dp: now, this is highly subjective and of course, I'd have to have a
page if something is confusing.  and then again, perhaps nothing is
confusing to me or the entire page is confusing to me but this question
tells me nothing.  I will give you this though.  I have seen pages where
the same links repeat several times on the page in the liniar top to
bottom fashion of my reader and this is quite strange to me but I have
learned that it is the way some pages are marked up and that the page is
not actually liniarized to most people.

    5.  What on the web page did you use incorrectly?
dp: again, can I answer nothing?
