  I think I see the problem, building a ramp over 2 of 3 steps is adding
  insult to injury...it is worse than no access at all.

Well, it isn't a good way to impress people. But it might be enough to help
some people - I have often been to a place with someone whose chair could be
got over one step, but not over three.

There is a philosophical tension here. On the one hand it is important not to
let perfection become our enemy by making us avoid improving things only
somewhat. On the other hand if we stop seriously trying to achieve perfection
then we are wasting our time and can go home now.

  sure, exclusion is exclusion,  having to have someone lift someone in a
  wheelchair is the same as a visually impaired person requiring someone
  else to read their monitor to them.

Right. To some extent there is software available that can do that. It
doesn't do a great job, so providing more useful content to start with is
better.
