I wonder how much of this depends on the user agent, by which I mean the
combination of the web browser and screen reader.  As a specific example,
ever since JAWS for Windows discovered how to grab headings (*real* headings
with numbers, not just over-sized type that web designers like to pretend
are headings) and present them in a list with the ability to move
immediately to a heading, I have suddenly become very enthusiastic about
proper use of headings to mark off important section divisions in a web
page.  Prior to the heading support, I have to confess that headings didn't
do much for me because they were essentially indistinguishable from other
stuff on the page.  It makes a big difference, to me anyway, if you can gain
some sort of hierarchical view of a web page rather than just the classic
never-ending linear version.

In summary, how a web page "stacks up" may be surprisingly dependent on the
browser/screen reader used to view it.  Just my two cents, and hopefully not
too far off the mark.

Regards,
Jerry
