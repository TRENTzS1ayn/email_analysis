I think you're right.  What it comes down to is that nobody will be able to
use all of the "curb cuts" you include in your web page (perhaps we could
use a more all-inclusive term like "user conveniences?"), but the more
accommodation nicities are included, the more likely that Joe or Jill user
will find those particular nicities that he/she likes/wants/needs.

Cheers,
Jerry
