From http://www.hisoftware.com/access/whatwedow.html

[Checkpoint]  3.2 Create documents that validate to published formal
grammars.
[Method]      Programmatic
[Explanation] Identify if a page does not use the !DOCTYPE tag and fail or
warn as configured.  This is a visual/programmatic  checkpoint that can be
verified and reported on with the HiSoftware Interview Wizard.

But what happens if the document has a doctype declaration, but the page
does not validate to it?  Is that page deamed accessible or not accessible?
While the US Section 508 does not make this a manditory requirement, in
Canada their accessibilty requirements for Federal Web Sites (part of the
Common Look and Feel standards) requires compliancy to the WCAG Priority 1
and 2 levels to pass muster (AA).

I ask this as a serious question - how important is it to developers out
there to ensure that your pages validate?  Or has Section 508 become the
defacto benchmark and who cares, it has skip nav links and alt tags and it
looks good in IE?
