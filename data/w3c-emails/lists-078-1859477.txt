Validation is all fine and good but it would be quite simple to have a site
that validates and passes all the standards tests but when a user sits in
front of it they can't use it at all.  Perhaps what Scott is testing in his
phone sessions is not accessibility per se but usability by people who are
blind.  This is an extremely valuable activity that will provide way more
insight into how people will access your site than a simple validation
activity.  Both automated validation testing and real live user testing are
important steps in good site design.

interesting point Jerry!

This harkens back to my point of "vallidation" with which I was putting
forward the crazy notion that doing it right to begin with makes a huge
difference.

I wonder how much of this depends on the user agent, by which I mean the
combination of the web browser and screen reader.  As a specific
example,
ever since JAWS for Windows discovered how to grab headings (*real*
headings
with numbers, not just over-sized type that web designers like to
pretend
are headings) and present them in a list with the ability to move
immediately to a heading, I have suddenly become very enthusiastic about
proper use of headings to mark off important section divisions in a web
page.  Prior to the heading support, I have to confess that headings
didn't
do much for me because they were essentially indistinguishable from
other
stuff on the page.  It makes a big difference, to me anyway, if you can
gain
some sort of hierarchical view of a web page rather than just the
classic
never-ending linear version.

In summary, how a web page "stacks up" may be surprisingly dependent on
the
browser/screen reader used to view it.  Just my two cents, and hopefully
not
too far off the mark.

Regards,
Jerry
