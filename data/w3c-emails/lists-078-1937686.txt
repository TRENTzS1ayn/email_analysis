To make Net Meeting work fast enough for a lecture/demonstration situation, modem speeds were not enough.  And the speech synthesis had to be done in an external hardware synthesizer.

This would serve usefully to give constraints on experimental protocols that researchers planned to use in this remote mode.  Check with the folks at ATRC in Toronto at least to see what they do with their scattered-site testers.
