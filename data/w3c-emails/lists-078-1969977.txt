accessibility means that it is available and can be used.  time is not a
deciding factor in this.  Other factors as has been indicated on this
thread address the time issue.

Hi,

Actually, the original quote was:

    "Web pages are like cars.  you need to know how to drive before
getting
    into one."

The analogy I offered was an extension of that statement.

It would seem that different blind people have different points of views
about time being a factor of accessibility.  Some blind people feel they
are at a competitive disadvantage when it comes to being slower than
sighted people when using information technology and web pages.  The
mail I've been getting recently seems to indicate that there are blind
people who are concerned about that.  For example, blind students
needing to do research to write papers do not get three weeks to prepare
when sighted people get one week.  If it takes blind web users 4 times
as long to shop online, how many blind web users will give up?
Reasearch and testing will offer better understanding of the issues.

I have heard complaints from web developers about the W3C and the 508
documents not having the same information with regards to accessibility.
The definition of accessibility is often not readily understood by
laymen many of whom have other responsibilities besides accessibility.

Again, different blind people have differing views of accessibility.
I've been moving more towards testing rather than philosophical
arguments.
