Hi, Rob

Yesterday, when I talked with the HiSoftware people about the interview
wizard, I was given a different view.  Perhaps, there might be a gap in
understanding the wizard since it is new.  When I was talking with them,
they scheduled me for a demo tomorrow.  At that point I'll be able to
compare questions we've been using in testing by phone to what the
wizzard provides.
