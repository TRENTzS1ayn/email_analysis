thinking and knowing are two different things.  I've been working in the
accessibility field for more years than I can count and time does not
fit into the accessibility equasion unless time is an inhibitting factor
to access.  Look at all the access standards out there and you will not
see a mention of time as we are discussing it here.  Time is independant
of accessibility and in much it is subjective.  As a blind person I may
be able to access something doubly faster than another blind person.
What does that make me?  It makes me better at using the tools or
perhaps I have better tools that some other blind person but it does not
make the information or content or software more or less "accessible".
End of factual statement.

Hi,

Well, other blind people think that time can be an issue for
accessibility.
(I also suspect they probably think they are right just like other blind
people believe they are right.)
