By taking an ad absurdum example it's easy to show that time is an
accessibility issue - would you consider a wheelchair user travelling 20
miles under his or her own steam to be an equally accessible form of
transportation to a wheelchair-enabled bus?

One of the problems with time (and also effort, concentration, and other
requirements that can increase when one is making use of an accessibility
feature), is that it is hard to measure in a way that will be valid for all
users, and hard to decide on clear limits for (how slow does something have
to be before it really affects accessibility?). This is unsatisfying for
those of us who attempt to come up with solutions, mainly technical, to
these problems.
