This is an aspect of a wider problem in usability studies (including
accessibility testing): are you observing the right thing?

We all know that automated check such as Page Valet is useful, but is
just one tool for getting it right.

Exactly the same applies to a survey in which disabled (eg blind) people
are asked to assess a page.  Although this superficially represents a
"live" test case, it does not observe the subjects working in a "natural"
manner, looking for information or making transactions they genuinely
want.  Instead, they have been put in an artificial situation, and are
working to someone elses expectations rather than their own.

A more realistic study would observe the everyday net usage of subjects.
If I were allowed to propose an experiment, I would track the browsing
of my subjects (with their permission, of course) over an extended period,
by collecting data at a proxy.  The only "extra" permitted would be a
standardised one-click function offering the opportunity to comment
on whether they were subjectively experiencing difficulties.

If I may end with the customary plug, I have the technology infrastructure
for that study ready and waiting.
