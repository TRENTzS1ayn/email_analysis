This is a difficult problem. I believe it has been discussed before, because
I was thinking about it at the beginning of last year or end of 2000 and
talked to people about it, but can't find it in archives.

The approximate ideas I had were that with some good user testing, we could
work out a rough guide to the time factor increase. (This is more or less
what the Nielsen Norman group worked on as a basis for their guidelines).

We could then use these to provide some more solid guidance for how we asign
priority...

  By taking an ad absurdum example it's easy to show that time is an

  One of the problems with time (and also effort, concentration, and other
  requirements that can increase when one is making use of an accessibility
  feature), is that it is hard to measure in a way that will be valid for all
  users, and hard to decide on clear limits for (how slow does something have
  to be before it really affects accessibility?). This is unsatisfying for
  those of us who attempt to come up with solutions, mainly technical, to
  these problems.
