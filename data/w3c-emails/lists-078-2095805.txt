Hi,

I'm not sure what else to say.  Different blind people have different
views as to whether time is an issue for accessibility.  For example,
if a blind student can use a chat room where tutoring is conducted, but
can't keep up with the discussion and accessing reference materials
being displayed simultaneously, is the chat room accessible?
