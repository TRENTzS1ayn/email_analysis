Hi,

I didn't want to imply that a phone methodology would be useful for all
aspects of accessibility testing.  I also did not wish to imply that the
blind accessibility is the only accessibility to be concerned about.

The question of time with regards to other disabilities is also
interesting.  If a web page was set up so that a person with a cognitive
disability could read and understand it in 10 minutes, is it accessible?
Suppose that the page could be restructured and a person with a
cognitive disability could read it in 2 minutes.  Is the first form
really accessible?  Suppose a paraplegic could climb up stairs dragging
his/her wheelchair behind him.  Even though it took much longer than
using an elevator, are the stairs accessible?

Usually when I lecture, I focus on usability and say that accessibility
is just a specialization of usability.

PS  Just a thought on "Accessible is accessible to all".  In a book called,
"Johnny Got His Gun", the main character lost all four limbs, sight
and hearing.  If web pages aren't accessible to him, then they aren't
accessible?
