Hi,

Web developers, like programmers, can do the darndest things.  Programmers
can write code which will be syntactically correct and take ten times
longer to run than needed.  Or they can write syntactically correct code
which is near unintelligble to other human beings, but syntax checkers
can have a hard time determining that it isn't readily understandable.

You should see some of the HTML that students can write which will validate
but creates awful web pages.

PS  A number of blind people that we've tested have pretty easily
tested web pages while on the phone.  It often is not that dissimilar
from being on the phone with a customer and needing to look up
information to give them using a screen reader.  But like any methodology,
there are probably some people the methodology may not be approrpriate for.
