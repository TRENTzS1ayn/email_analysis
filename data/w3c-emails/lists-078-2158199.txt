Hi, Al

We've basically used conference calls where everyone is on their
computer looking at the same web page.  We wanted to keep the technology
somewhat simple.  The main draw-back was not being able to test people
who didn't have a direct link to the net and had only one phone.

I may not have been clear in my original posting.  The document I'm
working on is basically to apply the methodology used in one project to
a specific set of other projects.  It's not a standard test protocol for
all projects that other people may be working on.  It could probably be
used as a basis for developing protocols for other projects outside of
the ones initially being considered.

I think that the methodology probably cannot be automated, but is probably
best used in combination with automated processes.

One of the challenges is knowing what questions to ask.  Some people
are great interviewers and instinctively know when to explore certain
areas in depth.  Others lack that intuition.  In some ways, it is like
counseling.

To make Net Meeting work fast enough for a lecture/demonstration situation, modem speeds were not enough.  And the speech synthesis had to be done in an external hardware synthesizer.

This would serve usefully to give constraints on experimental protocols that researchers planned to use in this remote mode.  Check with the folks at ATRC in Toronto at least to see what they do with their scattered-site testers.
