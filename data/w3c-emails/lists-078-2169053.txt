Hi, Nick

I'm not quite sure that the methodology you are describing is actually
addressing the desired task.  The web pages are being developed for a
particular purpose and the goal is to test them for problems.

For example, if a web site is selling a new type of device, subjects may not
be that interested in actually purchasing the device.  If the web site
waits till there are "natural" customers to find problems, the problems
might be so great as to drive the "natural" customers away.  I might be
misunderstanding, but I'm not sure how your proposed methodology handles
this testing task.
