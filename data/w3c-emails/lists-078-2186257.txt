Hi,

The issue of limitis is tricky.  I also believe that achievability plays
a role too.  For example, can Mount Everest be considered accessible?
If a significant amount of the US fiscal resources were made available,
Mount Everest could probably be made accessible.

As near as I can tell, there really hasn't been much research into what
aspects of a web page can increase the amount of time needed for blind
subjects to use web pages.  Some improvements might actually be quite easy.
