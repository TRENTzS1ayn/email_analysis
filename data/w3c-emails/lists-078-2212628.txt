Hi,

I believe this is getting into design concepts.  Basically, the
web page designer is trying to fulfill some purpose with a web page.
A user is using the web page to fulfill a purpose too.  Basically,
the developer does testing to be sure that the web page is achieving
the purpose the developer has in mind.

Learnability is often considered a usability issue.  Is it also an
accessibility issue?  When does a usability issue become an accessibility issue?
