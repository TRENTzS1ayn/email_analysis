To him.  Trick questions not allowed <grin>.

Seriously, if a user was faced with these barriers would they be able to use
the internet at all?

Let's assume that if the user had neither sight, hearing, or mobility then
presumably communcication would be via some form of tactile transmission;
I've seen braille output pads connected to computers, as well as braille
printers so the technology exists.  In your scenario the user could probably
not use an "off-the-shelf" application, but given enough desire and money
the possibility of a custom adaptation is not far fetched... thus if the
content of your web site could be interpreted by one of the braille type
(tactile) transmitters, then, maybe, yes pages *could* be made accessible to
the user.

The point is, as developers we need to stop second guessing about *how*
users access our pages... leave that to them.  Our goal is to ensure that
there are as few barriers as possible to the thought/content being conveyed
in our pages.  It's about knowledge, not transmission.
