so what are gw micro and freedomscientific and dolfin and others doing
spinning their wheels then?  Why is it that our capability grows with

accessibility by phone



Hi,

The issue of limitis is tricky.  I also believe that achievability plays
a role too.  For example, can Mount Everest be considered accessible?
If a significant amount of the US fiscal resources were made available,
Mount Everest could probably be made accessible.

As near as I can tell, there really hasn't been much research into what
aspects of a web page can increase the amount of time needed for blind
subjects to use web pages.  Some improvements might actually be quite
easy.
