Dan Nissen's e-mail about "Usability Specialists" evaluating the same large
web site differently has reminded me that it also occurred with
accessibility specialists  - or judges - evaluating whether a site met the
WCAG standards or judging guidelines.  In many cases they agreed, in some
cases they did not reach consensus.  The more subjective the standard, the
more room for opinions.

The other point to consider when testing web pages - or evaluating the test
subjects ability to use and understand web pages  - is what Jerry stated,
the capabilities of the assistive technology.  I would like to see how the
results take into account the capabilities of the AT and the user's
proficiency with it.  For example, would a learning impaired users using
WYNN get more out of a page than just using Opera?  Would a blind user
using Home Page Reader get more out of a page than a blind user using a
screen reader and Lynx?  Of course the answer is obvious yes since the AT
provides many features, but these features and the users' ability to use
them needs to be taken into account when doing any kind of study like this.
