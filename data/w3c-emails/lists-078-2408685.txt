Hi all you Lynx users

sorry if this is OT but have had a look in the lynx-dev archives and no joy;
I'm running out of ideas for where to get help. 

I have just installed Lynx 2.8.4 on Win2K and can't see anywhere in the cfg
file to enter authentication details for our firewall. When I start Lynx it
hits the firewall straight away with no option for me to enter username and
password so I get an "access denied" error message. I can't believe that
they haven't built this into the configuration options.
