in addition to using the features I mentioned earlier, there is also a
search feature that can be employeed by jaws on web pages.  As a blind
person who has been using assistive technology since the early 80s, I
can say with certainty that yes, it takes us more time.  It even takes
us more time to walk down the street.  I can also say with certainty
that untill you make computers and computing as simple as turning on a
lamp, you will always have a devide of some sort between those who feel
comfortable with and are efficient with the technology and those who are
not.  Most of what you describe here can be over come unfortunately for
those who don't want to do it by effort.

Hi,

Her observations on the time issue are quite interesting and are similar
to some other comments that have been sent to me by blind people.
I asked her permission to post her note as more information for
people to consider on the issues.

A question to consider is how much do blind people want to put into
learning their access technology.  A goal should be to make things as
simple as possible.

I've been talking with her and some other blind people about doing
some research into a couple of these areas.  It is looking like there's
a
possibility to get it sponsored through the Berkeley campus.
