Hi,

I think it reflects that different blind people have different points of
views.  Software takes longer because of design choices which don't
address the needs of the blind users.

Programmers often have problems understanding usability.  A view
frequently expressed is that if people want to use the technology, then
they need to put the work into learning the technology.  Usability's
goal is to make the technology as easy to use as possible.  Why not also
make it easy for blind people to use?

The analogy I keep coming back to is paraplegics and stairs.  If only
those paraplegics would put the effort out, they could get up those
stairs and not need those expensive elevators.
