I think the lack of testing with real subjects is a big problem for many
people.  I was at the convention of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society
listening to some researchers from New Mexico.  They were working
accessibility for the blind with sighted subjects because they had no source
of local blind subjects (except the approximately 3 students in the school
who were blind).  I suggested they start with the state agency for the blind
(I work with Texas Commission for the Blind in my job as a computer
supplier).  But, I think there is a need for some help to researchers and
developers in getting good subjects.  And there is no substitute for people
with real problems, because of the state of the usability science.

Regards, 
Dan

Hi,

Again, different points of views.  There are blind people who believe
that thier needs are not well understood nor researched by HCI/usability
people.  If something is being created from a universal design
perspective, then it is important to understand the needs of each
type of user, including blind people.
