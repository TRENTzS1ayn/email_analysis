If the firewall uses an open protocol, you will be prompted for the
information.  The normal reason for simply getting rejected is that you
are using a Microsoft proxy configured to use their proprietory NTLM
authentication scheme.  If they are, and the proxy managers are not
prepared to bypass it for you, or let you use Basic authentication, you
will have to use Internet Explorer.  Note even Netscape don't implement
NTLM, which makes me suspect that there is some intellectual property law
(patents or confidentiality) that is preventing their doing so in the USA.
I haven't seen a description of the protocol that would allow an open
source product to implement it.

Given that you appear to be using Outlook/Exchange and given the nature
of the organisation you work for, it is almost certain that they are
a dedicated Microsoft house and are using NTLM authentication.
