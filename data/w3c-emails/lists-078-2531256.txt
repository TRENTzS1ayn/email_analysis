Something that I feel is missing from WCAG is a guideline about trying to avoid
using visual language. For instance, "see the links on the left" - meaningless
in an audio or text browser.

The WCAG technique documents are somewhat guilty of this,
http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-HTML-TECHS/#data-tables gives an example of:

   "The table is divided into two columns. The left-hand column is 'Total
   investment required in billions of dollars'. The right--hand column is
   'Spending' and is divided into three sub-columns."

...for a sample table caption.

Might be nice to include something on this in future guidelines?
