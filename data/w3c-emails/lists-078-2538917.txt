One of the intriguing things about the word "accessibility" is, it is not
being used "just for the blind" anymore. Jakob Nielsen also points out the
needs of the aging and of young children, and the W3 Consortium even goes
so far as to point out that emerging technologies need to be included in
access considerations also, since handhelds typically have small screen
and not much processing power, or a user might even be using a cell
phone's browser, also limited in its power. Many sighted geeks I know are
using Linucx as an OS, or LYNX as a browser, because they want something
fast and are less than impressed by the bells and whistles. Universal
design is just good code, and good code, by degault, is typically
accessible to not only screen readers but alternate input and output
devices.
