All,

In a recent post by the hand of this poster and from the address from
wich this message is being posted, some language that is apparently
objectionable to some was written.  the fact that the language is
objectionable to some was made known as such to this poster after
posting and hence this message.

It is not the intention of this poster to profane anyone or cause harm
or degradation of feellings.  Language such as was written in the post
refered to here will never be written in posts from this address at the
hand of this poster again.

The discretionary manner in which this was made known is much
appreciated.  It is prudent, wise and necessary that when writing in
public that we all take as great care as possible to avoide such as this
by giving all the benefit of  doubt when making reference to each other.

Please don't start a thread on this topic as it has been discussed
before on the list but if you wish to discuss this further, private
messages are welcomed.

Thanks Sincerely,

Hands-On Technolog(eye)s
