If your expectation in this example is that any title information on the 
page is going to be read by existing assistive technology, I 
think     something would need to be changed.  I tried your example using 
the url http://www.w3.org/wai.  JAWS, Window-Eyes and HAL didn't read any 
of the title information I found in the source that seemed like what you 
wanted the AT to show that indicated "valid".

I couldn't get this example to work with Home Page Reader.

Why not have an option that allows the user to choose how they want the 
results conveyed, i.e. with color or with text.  If with text then include 
the text as part of the page, not a title.
