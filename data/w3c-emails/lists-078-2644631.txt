A term that literally includes the colour blind but which most people
would not think to include them.  A very significant proportion of
men of European origin are colour blind and it has always been a 
strong principle that you do not use colour as the only channel for
information for that reason, and because of the possibility of using
devices with no colour support.  (I'm surprised how often this rule is
broken, though.)
