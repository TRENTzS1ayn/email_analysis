Yes, that's implicit in any model using CSS (you didn't think I'd even
contemplate using <font color=...>, did you?)

Indeed.  So <em class="deprecated">color=&quot;octiron&quot;</em>
should be fine.  And that's exactly what I'm using if we ignore the
title attribute.  The mapping of the "deprecated" attribute to a
colour is of course in CSS.

I'm happy with that, as far as it goes.

Exactly.  We're expecting the user to be proactive.  That relies on
both the user and his/her software being capable of defining a
meaningful presentation of things like class="deprecated".

Again, CSS does that in principle.  The Right Solution is improved
clientside tools for dealing with it.  Whatever I do serverside is
extra.

I've found that tends to become harder to manage as the number of
codes increases.  If we take "W" to mean warning, that could be a
validation message of severity "Warning", or a warning generated by
a WCAG checkpoint.  Slightly longer texts such as "WCAG" seem
clearer, as do the visual cues used in Valet.

Again, that's close to how most of the Valet tools behave, so I think
we seem to be in agreement.

Site Valet offers many tools - Page Valet is just one of them.
What else should be given such prominence, and why?

Well, er, yes.  That's a compromise between informativeness (WCAG is
much more informative than, say, "W") and brevity.

Bah, Humbug!  You have the XML (or indeed the EARL) - you are free to
do what you like with it.  A stylesheet to present it as you prefer
should be trivial to construct.

I'm less concerned about offering the presentation you describe in HTML,
because it's already widely available, in earlier Page Valet versions
(still available), and in the W3C and WDG validators.  I have no interest
in duplicating existing services, except where I know I can offer a
significant improvement on them.

Yes, I can see that's an issue (but you still have the XML).
Maybe I'll find ten minutes tonight to put up a new stylesheet
on the server, to present a much briefer report.

Hmmm, the feedback I've had on that has been overwhelmingly positive:
the visual highlighting of errors and warnings causes them to stand out
prominently in a quick overview.

I hope the new service (under construction) will help.  It will
eventually offer much the same accessibility tests as Page Valet, but
in a kinder, gentler manner, and with options to fix up broken markup.

Indeed, but Lynx is a very low priority, in that users such as you and
me have the option to use a CSS-capable graphical browser, and web page
analysis is not a task that's likely of high priority when away from
the desktop.  Btw, lynx is the browser I use for most of my development
work on services such as this.

This is a service under construction.  Posting here is exploring ideas
for how to proceed with the construction.  Regarding my particular
question, Kelly Ford's reply was a complete answer.  Yours, as ever,
explores other related issues and provokes thought - for which I
thank you.
