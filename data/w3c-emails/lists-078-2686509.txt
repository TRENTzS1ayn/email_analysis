the entire story is that The products from HiSoftware allow you t
customize your tests and even visually or other wise validate your
results in any way you wish.  I recommend and have recommended for years
that the human factor be part of any development process.

Hi,

I meant software which checks syntax for conformance for certain desired
expressions or characteristics rather than validating for grammatical
correctness.  I think the issue is determining accessibility by
syntactic analysis as compared to determining accessibility by
testing users.
