Hi,

I spent about an hour and a half on the phone with the HiSoftware
people being give a demoe of their product.  They showed me how the
testing could be configured in certain ways, but couldn't show me how
the test could be configured for the types of testing I was looking
into.  After the demo I sent Rob a note asking how the type of
testing I was interested in could be done using HiSoftware.
