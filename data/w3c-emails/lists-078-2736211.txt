Hi,

Ahh, I'm wondering if there is a break down in communication occuring.
When I was told that HiSoftware would do what I was looking for by
interviewing, my assumption was that it was the subject being interviewed
since that is what we were doing by phone.  I'm beginning to get the
sense that it is the web page developer, rather than the test subject,
which is being interviewed.
