Hi All,

At
http://www.dotnet247.com/247reference/a.aspx?u=http://aspfree.com/authors/st
ephen_rylander/Persist.aspx
under my large font settings I have to scroll to the right to see text which
makes reading the thing very slow and awkward. The main body of text is
contained in a TD tag so I specified 50% in my stylesheet but it had no
effect. I changed it to just 500 (for a laugh really) and to my surprise it
worked and the text displays in a more narrow column which I don't need to
scroll. So my question is why didn't the 50% work? What is it 50% of? Is
that the point? I just don't like using fixed values.

Cheers
Ian
