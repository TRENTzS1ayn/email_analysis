Hello Charles, 

I was particularly interested in your comment about "no accessibility
without usability"... It is exactly our philosophy ! We try to prove to
the whole earth (lol) that accessibility and particularly technical
accessibility is clearly not enough to make a good experience for the
impaired users.
If one conceive a web site keeping in mind (and use experts for)
accessibility and usability, the web experience will improve for
everyone !
What do you think about it ?

Where can i find informations about the author of this part of the
conference ? (in english or in french).

Thank you

J?r?me ERNU.

Objet : Trip report - WebXTutti, Italy



Dear all,

I spoke at the WebxTutti (Web for All) conference in Italy last week,
and
thought I would send my trip report here.

This is a personal impression, not a formal report.

The event was well-organised - instead of the anticipated 100 people
there
were over 200 in the audience. The event was hosted by the Ministry for
Communication in Rome, was free, and was advertised as providing a full
day
of presentations on accessibility. The conference was in Italian, as is
the
Web site launched there - http://www.webxtutti.it - which is good news
for
the Italian speakers of the world...

The presentations were of a high quality, covering a good range of
important
topics. Particular personal highlights included:

 "No Accessibilty without Usability" Because that seems to me such an
important idea. I don't believe that accessibility guidelines can be
replaced
by user testing for most people, because most developers cannot afford
the
time or money to find a test audience covering the huge range of users
they
are trying to cater for, and then do their own interpretation of their
results.

 A presentation on (among other things) the XML Accessibility Guidelines
-
http://www.w3.org/TR/XAG - which is a document I intend to produce an
updated
draft of shortly.

 Several presentations on assessing accessibility of different sites
using a
combination of methods including automatic testing and user testing.

 The announcement of "Torquemada" - http://www.webxtutti.it/testa.htm
-an
online accessibility testing tool (downloadable version promised soon)
in
Italian.

Presentations are available from the site -
http://www.webxtutti.it/convegno.htm
- although mostly in Powerpoint or Word format.

Thanks to the organisers of the conference.

Cheers

Charles McCN
