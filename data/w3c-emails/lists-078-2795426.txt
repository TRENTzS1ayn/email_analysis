Hello, 

Is someone can help me ?

I am searching examples of lawsuit between web sites and people impaired
unable to access the sites... Is there some links, newsgroup, papers of
very known "affair" ?

By the way, some links towards lawsuit between handicapped and firms or
others (always in an accessibility way) are welcome too...

Thank you,

J.
