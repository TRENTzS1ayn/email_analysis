It still jars when people write "tag" and mean "element".

This is invalid CSS, although I believe that "px" is commonly interpolated
by browsers.

IE 5.5 tables (Win 32) seem to have some non-intuitve behaviour for
percentages.  I had to style a table element with "font-size: 100%" to
get the expected behaviour of using the size given on the body element.
This might be an absolute size for table elements in the browser's
virtual style sheet, but might be an actual non-compliance.

The percentage of TD is, I believe, of the TR.
