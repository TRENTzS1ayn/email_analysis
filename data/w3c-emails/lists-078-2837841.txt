Most likely seems a browser bug - there are problems with CSS and tables in
many old browsers.

  Hi All,

  under my large font settings I have to scroll to the right to see text which
  makes reading the thing very slow and awkward. The main body of text is
  contained in a TD tag so I specified 50% in my stylesheet but it had no
  effect. I changed it to just 500 (for a laugh really) and to my surprise it
  worked and the text displays in a more narrow column which I don't need to
  scroll. So my question is why didn't the 50% work? What is it 50% of? Is
  that the point? I just don't like using fixed values.

  Cheers
  Ian
