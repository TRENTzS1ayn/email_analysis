Here is a query that has not reached the WAI site and is from a list for MAGpie. I am sure that Diana will appreciate our help. Her email address is below her name...

Kind regards

Simon

Hello everyone,

I have an ADA compliant church website, that I am re-engineering in
Dreamweaver with Flash.  I have a created a number of Flash buttons for the
navigation system, but I haven't found a way to modify the Flash button to
display a control tip text.  Is anyone aware of a utility I can use to
modify the Flash button?  

I am also looking for a method to enlarge the font size of the control tip
and alt text in regular links.  Any suggests.

Thanks in advance.
