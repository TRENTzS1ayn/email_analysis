Connecticut to Enforce Accessibility Guidelines

Darby Patterson - May 31, 2002 -- HARTFORD, Conn. -- As accessibility in
Web-site design becomes increasingly important to state and local
governments, Connecticut is ensuring its Web-site designers are trained
and
qualified in creating an accessible site.

In a recent notice to consultants, the state's Department of Information
Technology announced that all consultants will be required to take
Web-site
accessibility training "in accordance with the state guidelines for
achieving universal accessibility." The guidelines will be used in the
creation of any state Web site. The state's IT department has the
guidelines
posted online.

The directive includes all consultants currently under contract with the
state who work in a number of areas, including Internet management and
development; design; application server administration; Internet
graphics;
and as webmasters.
