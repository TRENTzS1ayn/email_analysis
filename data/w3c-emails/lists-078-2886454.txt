Hi Jerome,

closest I can get is a link to the Word version of his presentation in
Italian (I don't have Word so haven't read that):

  Hello Charles,

  I was particularly interested in your comment about "no accessibility
  without usability"... It is exactly our philosophy ! We try to prove to
  the whole earth (lol) that accessibility and particularly technical
  accessibility is clearly not enough to make a good experience for the
  impaired users.
  If one conceive a web site keeping in mind (and use experts for)
  accessibility and usability, the web experience will improve for
  everyone !
  What do you think about it ?

  Where can i find informations about the author of this part of the
  conference ? (in english or in french).

  Thank you

  J?r?me ERNU.

  Objet : Trip report - WebXTutti, Italy



  Dear all,

  I spoke at the WebxTutti (Web for All) conference in Italy last week,
  and
  thought I would send my trip report here.

  This is a personal impression, not a formal report.

  The event was well-organised - instead of the anticipated 100 people
  there
  were over 200 in the audience. The event was hosted by the Ministry for
  Communication in Rome, was free, and was advertised as providing a full
  day
  of presentations on accessibility. The conference was in Italian, as is
  the
  Web site launched there - http://www.webxtutti.it - which is good news
  for
  the Italian speakers of the world...

  The presentations were of a high quality, covering a good range of
  important
  topics. Particular personal highlights included:

   "No Accessibilty without Usability" Because that seems to me such an
  important idea. I don't believe that accessibility guidelines can be
  replaced
  by user testing for most people, because most developers cannot afford
  the
  time or money to find a test audience covering the huge range of users
  they
  are trying to cater for, and then do their own interpretation of their
  results.

   A presentation on (among other things) the XML Accessibility Guidelines
  -
  http://www.w3.org/TR/XAG - which is a document I intend to produce an
  updated
  draft of shortly.

   Several presentations on assessing accessibility of different sites
  using a
  combination of methods including automatic testing and user testing.

   The announcement of "Torquemada" - http://www.webxtutti.it/testa.htm
  -an
  online accessibility testing tool (downloadable version promised soon)
  in
  Italian.

  Presentations are available from the site -
  http://www.webxtutti.it/convegno.htm
  - although mostly in Powerpoint or Word format.

  Thanks to the organisers of the conference.

  Cheers

  Charles McCN
