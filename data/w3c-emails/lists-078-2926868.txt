I will write to the guy and ask for permission to translate (and ask that
WebXTutti host the translation) to an HTML version in english.

  I think people generally prefer URLs to attachments. This is an
  accessibility issue too. Think about the time and cost needed to load an
  attachment when your E-mail works over a GSM connection, for example, and
  the E-mail program has been set to download all new messages.

  Well, the first question is whether we have the original author's permission
  to distribute and translate the document. The document appears to contain
  interesting points, but it would probably be much more useful if expanded
  from lists of items to somewhat longer running text with explanations.

  Anyway, when I fed the HTML document (which has apparently been created by
  saving a Word document in "HTML" or "Web" format) to the Systranet
  translator
  http://www.systranet.com/systran/net
  I noticed, in addition to some other problems, that the translator was
  unable to translate simple words like "Sulla" in some contexts - because
  they were immediately preceded by bullet characters in Windows encoding,
  assumably confusing the translator.

  I think this illustrates how seemingly innocent tricks in markup or in the
  use of characters may have impact on accessibility. (Automatic
  translatability is an accessibility issue too, since it helps to get over
  language barriers to some extent.)
