Hello All,

Last week there appeared to be a miscommunication on this list regarding
the Usability Interview process and HiSoftware Solutions. I assume this
cam from answering what we do for usability testing and the question of
what products these solutions are included in:

I have asked the team to put some information on the web to clear up
these conversations regarding the HiSoftware Custom Interview
Wizard(tm). 

http://www.hisoftware.com/access/cinterview.html

The Custom Interview Wizard, is powered by Custom XML Question
Definition Files (XQDF) and Can be configured to ask one or many
questions that can be used to fully complete the usability interview
system, regardless of Which Usability guidelines you have selected to
use. This system Augments our Existing Visual Interview system providing
the highest level of customization you could desire that is combined
with a comprehensive test management system.

e.g. Software Accessibility/Usability Guidelines
e.g. .Net Accessibility/Usability Guidelines
e.g. Web Site Usability Guidelines

The Initial Product that this is included in is AccSoft(tm) The Software
Accessibility/Usability Test Management Suite that is currently in Beta.
It will then be Released across the Entire HiSoftware "Acc" Family of
Products.

If anyone has any further questions please feel free to contact me off
the list, I hope this clears everything up!

Best Regards,
Rob Yonaitis
