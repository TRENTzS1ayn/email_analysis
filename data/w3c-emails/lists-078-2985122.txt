I know he's on this list, and he probably has been pussywhipped
before on other sites about autobloggatio and is keeping all
quiet-like, so *I* will pimp him out to the peeps:

MARK PILGRIM, MAN OF THE MOMENT

"30 days to a more accessible Weblog"
<http://diveintomark.org/archives/rooms/30_days_to_a_more_accessible_weblog/>

One is liking Mark more and more. Where has he been all my life?

(BTW, if we can't say "para" on this list, despite the fact that
every para who speaks English uses the term, then presumably we also
cannot say "pussywhipped" or "autobloggatio" or use "pimp" as a
verb. Obviously that cannot be done. So just go read Mark's site.)
