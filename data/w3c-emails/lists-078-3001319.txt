I am always disappointed when i read mails full of slang : i can just
ask myself if it is ironical, tragical or whatever...
Barriers of language are for me a kind of accessibility problem, and i
regret usage of slang on a mail list as WAI IG (as in web sites of
course...).
I do not think all readers are able to understand/write english
perfeclty (and for sure i am !) so please use the clearer language as
possible, it's a way of improving accessibility for all.

Thank you.

J.

I know he's on this list, and he probably has been pussywhipped
before on other sites about autobloggatio and is keeping all
quiet-like, so *I* will pimp him out to the peeps:

MARK PILGRIM, MAN OF THE MOMENT

"30 days to a more accessible Weblog"
<http://diveintomark.org/archives/rooms/30_days_to_a_more_accessible_web
log/>

One is liking Mark more and more. Where has he been all my life?

(BTW, if we can't say "para" on this list, despite the fact that
every para who speaks English uses the term, then presumably we also
cannot say "pussywhipped" or "autobloggatio" or use "pimp" as a
verb. Obviously that cannot be done. So just go read Mark's site.)
