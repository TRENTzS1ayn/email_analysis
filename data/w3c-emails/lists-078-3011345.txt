I read this article and do not understand.  I want to keep this public
with all that this implies because it is important that people
understand what "is" going on here.

What good does it do to put up this snap shot of the life of one person
who has experienced both severe tragedy and extraordenary success.  I
don't have three hundred dollars a month to spend on the web so she is
lucky beyond my wildest imaginings.  I'm not complaining though, just
asking questions, probing the bubble, searching for answers.  This
article turned my stomach because First, I don't see the relevance but
perhaps I am missing something obvious and second, that It would evoke
feelings of pity for her from most people even though she is obviously
successfull.

Please someone explain in terms that are benefitial to us all what this
has to do with this list?

Thanks!
