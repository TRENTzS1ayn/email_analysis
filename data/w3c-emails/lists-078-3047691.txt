Hi, Rob

The posting helped to clarify the software.  A few more questions came
up for with regards to the software.  One is how in the XQDF can
conditions be specified for when to ask certain questions depending on
the answers to previous questions.

A second question is how does the person doing the interview indicate
that a question was skipped and why the question had to be skipped?

Another feature I use when creating interviewing software is to provide
for the ability to enter text related to the answers and to also choose
from checkboxes various characterizations of the text answers.  The
advantage to this is that it facillitates retrieval from database when
analyzing answers.  This helps avoid the problem of computers poorly
understanding the concepts represented in text, especially small blocks
of text.  How would XQDF allow for specifications of characterizations
of text related to the answer?

Thanks,
Scott
