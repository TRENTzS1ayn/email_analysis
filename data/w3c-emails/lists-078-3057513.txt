There is a big thread running on accessibility (particularly the ability
to recover plain text) of SVG on the www-svg list at the moment.

The issue that I raised over two years ago that authoring tools will
produce random reading orders has been re-raised, although, as of 
yesterday evening, UK time, the point that a successful SVG will be 
adopted for home pages (as some sites already use Flash) has not 
come up yet.
