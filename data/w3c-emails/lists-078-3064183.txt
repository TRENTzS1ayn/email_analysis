Hi All,

Just stumbled across this site and thought some people may find it of
interest. It's got an online Lynx viewer which is suppose to give you an
idea of how lynx will render a web page given the url, and an HTML Purifier
which looks like it will check to see whether a page conforms to a given
HTML version, and a plain text checker.
