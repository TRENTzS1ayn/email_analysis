I hope this clarifies the subject even more:

The XQF Is based on Question ID, The Final beta is complete and the
first release should be tomorrow at noon. The XQDF Allows for
Conditional Defines allowing for flow control based on, hmmmm, let's see
if I can make this easy

If QuestionID=Not Answered then NextID=Question ID Else next in flow

Not Answered or Let's say there is a customQueston:

How would you rate your Internet Experience?
[ ] Novice
[ ] Beginner
[ ] Intermediate
[ ] Expert
[ ] Geek
[ ] None of the above
[ ] I am skipping this one

That is up to the developer of the Question. There is a capability of
allowing for related comments/text to any question. If used it can
easily be queried from the open database or the XML Question/Answer
File. The XQAF file or DB for a Project or Project group has the concept
of a team or group of test takers for a particular subject/Object. The
Answers are keyed to provide rapid comparison of answers and sorting by
answer or category.

Probably more important is that this whole system is developed to allow
the tester to extend our solution in any way they can dream up the XQDF
"File/Language" allows the user to script out how the Usability
Interview will proceed for quick and effective test creation.

As a side note, Value Added Add-Ons the AccVerify Usability Test Manager
were created with the AccVerify Software Developers Kit.

I Hope this helps, if you have any further questions please feel free to
