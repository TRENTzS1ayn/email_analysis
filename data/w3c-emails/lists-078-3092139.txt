Hi,

I'm wondering if the DTD that is linked to the web page at
http://www.hisoftware.com/access/cinterview.html is out of date.  I
didn't see any conditional definitions or maybe I'm misreading it.

I think I may not have been clear about my question on "skipping"
questions.  I wasn't referring to the subject not answering a
question, but more what if the interviewer has decided to skip a question
for some reason, e.g. the question wasn't somehow relevant to the subject's
use.

I may also not been clear about my question on characterization of responses.
Rather than using a text field for characterization, I was wondering if
characterization could be done by checkboxes using some set of
characterizations.  Maybe something like:

     Answer comment:    ____________________________________


     Answer comment characterizations:

     ___  possible new feature               ___  potential user problem

     ___  possible software bug              ___  bring to attention of
                                                  document writer

     ___  problem in the user testing process

     ___  possible marketing/sales use


Another question is that the usability testing seems to be a sub-process
to accessibility.  Is it possible to configure the system where the
primary process is usability and the accessibility/standards is a
sub-process?
