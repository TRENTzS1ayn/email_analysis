Yes, Again our Solutions are Designed to allow you to specify how to
work your process as per your needs or systems currently in place. So
order/arrange the process how you want, Write a Wrapper how you want,
our Services Division could work with you to customize our out of the
box solutions to meet your organizations needs, etc... 

Examples:

We could integrate them into your content management system like we have
done with Microsoft SharePoint Portal Server or Microsoft FrontPage

We could integrate them into custom systems that you may have.

We could install and Distribute them through your global test labs.

We could also train you on how to use the software and create integrated
tests.
