Hello All-

I thought that you might be interested in a new case study that we have just
published with California State University-San Marcos. This study focuses on
CSU's utilization of HiSoftware Accessibility Solutions to comply with
California State University requirements for Web based courses and Distance
Learning Course accessibility.
