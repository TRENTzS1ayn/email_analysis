Scott, 

That is a good question! It works like this:


There is an Optional Global Setting to our Interface that is Time
Session. The Time session Variable Interacts With our Interview Object.
So that you will have the following times stored for use in Reports if
you want:

- Time in Milliseconds for Question
- Time in Milliseconds for XQDF Group
- Time in Milliseconds for entire XQDF Project Group.

Timer is automatic:

It Starts once Question Interface is loaded
It stops when the Next Button is hit, It handles, let's call them
Exceptions, 

1. If you answer question one in 6000 Milliseconds 
2. are on two for 5000 Milliseconds 
3. Hit the Previous button 
4. Are there for 3000 Milliseconds 
5. Return to 2 for 4000 Milliseconds 

you will have results of:

9000 Milliseconds for 1 
9000 Milliseconds for 2

And if there were only two questions in your XQDF you would have a total
time of 18,000 Milliseconds for the Test

Important to Remember, Timer per Question Starts after question data is
fully loaded. So After Hitting Next or Return you are not penalized for
any time needed for the system to do its thing. Our Switches control the
time start.

This is our way of Doing it so Remember you can control the timer
yourself with how you use XQDF Files or the API. 

The Reporting Templates provide the Facility of Displaying Time in
whatever format you want or use the XML Files to do it yourself or to
integrate into your test management system. A Good Example of how our
API can be used to integrate with a test management system is our
Integration with Mercury TestDirector.
http://www.hisoftware.com/tdprod/acctdinfo.htm We used our API to Add
Accessibility and Usability testing to this popular testing solution.

More information on our API's can be found at:
http://www.hisoftware.com/developer/accproducts.html

This type of Question is great because metrics like this for
Accessibility and Usability testing are essential to determine resources
needed to complete a task, In usability it is a tremendous test as
related to the overall design to purpose of the system or application.

Please feel free to send any more questions I will be more then happy to
help you understand how these products and API's work.

Regards

Rob
