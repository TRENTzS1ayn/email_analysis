Hi,

That's interesting about the time data collection.  However, what I was
asking was more about being able to start and stop timing for a
question.  The reason I was aking this was to be able to differentiate
between the time needed to explain to the subject what is needed to be
performed for the question and the actual time that the subject took
to perform the task.  That's why I was wondering if start time and stop
time buttons can be presented at the same time.  This can be especially
helpful if the subject asks questions to clarify the task being requested.

What kinds of timing of blind subjects has been done using the timing
feature?
