Sorry, are you saying that one shouldn't bother posting information that is
felt others might find of use without checking all know WAI resources first?
Or are you politely informing me that in this case I wasted my time but
please feel free to continue to post information I might stumble across and
feel others might find useful? Or are you telling me to read the WAI
resources first? (Unfortunately I don't always have time to do this.)

Cheers
Ian

Delorie has been a well-reputed toolkit for many years, and has been
rightly listed in the WAI existing tools page for as long as I can
remember.
