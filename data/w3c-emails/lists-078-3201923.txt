Is it just me, or is this beginning to feel like nothing more than a
customer support conversation (or a real sell job)?  While the minutia of
how this software works may be interesting to those who may have downloaded
and are trying it, what concrete benefit is it to this list in particular?
Gentlemen, perhaps you should be continuing your conversation off list?  Mr.
Yonaitis, perhaps your company should look to host it's own list serve, as
numerous other software companies do.

Thank you

JF
