The hard work is unlocking the power for masses of people, people
who couldn't care less about ontologies, or semantic webs, or even
accessibility. If you want all that stuff, you have to learn how to
make products that work for people, and accomplish your goals, if
you can figure out how. I'm sure they're well-intentioned people, as
my advisor was, but like him, they are wrong.
Dave Winer

PS: The bit about accessibility is deliberately provocative. Think
about it. People with disabilities don't want accessibility, they
want to use the Web. Different perspective.
