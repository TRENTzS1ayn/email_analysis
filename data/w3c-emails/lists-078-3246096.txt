Bone idle, I guess,

Issue: wish to provide a way that 'google' can archive peepo.com so that a search provides links that whilst not directly related to a topic, do link directly to that topic.

for instance: I link to a site that has a great 'tell the time' activity, however this site also has other great activities, such as paint, percussion, ......
Too many to individually provide links to at this time.

However it would be great to be able to leave a record, so that on a future search this was picked up...

Is this already a standard?
if not anyone have a good hack? ie where I can dump the info so that google would pick it up?

thanks
