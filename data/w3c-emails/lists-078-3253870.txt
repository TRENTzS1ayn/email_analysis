I believe Google indexes real content only.  They don't even process
meta header elements, for indexing purposes.

More generally, what you appear to be asking for is a mechanism that
would be abused to mislead people into accessing the site.  A 
commercial web site operator could create multiple web sites, most
of which exist just link to their main web site, but provide irrelevant,
but frequently requested, keywords to trick people into accessing the
main site.

I could imagine a service that indexes referrals and not the actual
pages, but Google only uses referrals to establish popularity.

In fact, there are proposals (RDF?) for letting sites create electronic
reviews of other sites, however I don't get the impression that 
commercial sites have taken any real interest in these.  As we all know,
most barely understand HTML.

I'm not even actually sure whether you really are suggesting hidden
keywords referencing third parties or hidden keywords for your own site,
but either way, Google's philosophy is that they don't process hidden
material, and engines that do would object to sites that have hidden
keywords that don't relate to visible content of the same site.
