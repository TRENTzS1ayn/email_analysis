Hello all,
I have a rather interesting question to pose, and it is one that I cannot seem to find a definitive answer for. Can anyone on the list provide me with some help with the following question?

Which is best for accessibility: HTML 4.x or XHTML standards?

IF anyone knows if there is an answer to this then is it also possible to scour everyone's brains for reasons why one is preferred above another.

Thank you in anticipation

Simon
