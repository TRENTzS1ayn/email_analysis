Code with errors, surely you jest!

In all seriousness, I am creating a bespoke set of checkpoints for a company and I have at the top this: validate your code to standards. Validate again.

Is there any reason why the need for valid code is not contained within the WCAG, especially as Jonathan has rightly pointed out that incorrect markup will not be rendered correctly, if at all...

thanks anyway Jonathan for the answer, I had a thought that XHTML would be better, but I thought that someone else could clarify the position for me as I don't like getting things wrong.

Kind regards to all
Simon

my answers are never very authoritative, however i imagine that in an ideal
world xhtml will be more accessible, as xml is the future, and xhtml is a
step in the direction of xml.

My most serious concern regarding xhtml, and xml (and this future), is that
code that has errors will not be rendered, try amaya.
This is bl*** awful for anyone with dyslexia, learning difficulties, DTs,
typos or other problems, as most would I think prefer some page rather than
no page.

thanks

jonathan
