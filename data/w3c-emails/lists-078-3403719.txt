Yes. It is a problem for people making assistive technology that HTML (as
opposed to XHTML) is not really reliable. So browsers end up being massive
programing efforts. Most of the code in them is for dealing with bad HTML,
not for providing any particular new functionality. This is feasible for
mass-market browsers, but not for those with a smaller user base.

By following the compatibility guidelines for XHTML -
http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#guidelines - you can write XHTML that will work
in almost every known HTML browser and will work in XML browsers. As Alan
points out there are other advantages to using XML - and one he doesn't
mention is that XML Namespaces allow for mixing different types of XML
together. Examples are what Amaya and Mozilla do with XHTML and MathML, and
Amaya and Croczilla do with those two plus SVG.

Using XHTML and making it valid is partly valuable because it allows browser
makers to stop working on fixing code errors that should be stopped by
authoring tools and to start working on making better, more accessible, more
useful browsers.

  One of the advantages of XHTML must be that imposes some discipline in the

  applications to read it, amongst which may be assistive technologies.

  Another advantage is that as it is valid XML it can be readily transformed
  into other markup languages and formats using XSL transformations.

  Code with errors, surely you jest!

  In all seriousness, I am creating a bespoke set of checkpoints for a company
  and I have at the top this: validate your code to standards. Validate again.

  Is there any reason why the need for valid code is not contained within the
  WCAG, especially as Jonathan has rightly pointed out that incorrect markup
  will not be rendered correctly, if at all...

  thanks anyway Jonathan for the answer, I had a thought that XHTML would be
  better, but I thought that someone else could clarify the position for me as
  I don't like getting things wrong.

  Kind regards to all
  Simon

  my answers are never very authoritative, however i imagine that in an ideal
  world xhtml will be more accessible, as xml is the future, and xhtml is a
  step in the direction of xml.

  My most serious concern regarding xhtml, and xml (and this future), is that
  code that has errors will not be rendered, try amaya.
  This is bl*** awful for anyone with dyslexia, learning difficulties, DTs,
  typos or other problems, as most would I think prefer some page rather than
  no page.

  thanks
