For web standards? Yes.
For end users? No.

If a page has a small error (and they do creep in from time-to-time,
especially
if you let other people edit a page), then giving the user an error would be
very annoying.

This won't happen in the short term as most XHTML is sent as text/html, so
will
still be sent through HTML4 parsers.

I feel browsers should detect XHTML, and parse it through an XML parser. If
that
errors, tell the user there's an error but then still attempt to parse it
through a HTML4 parser.
