Why?  The author may be using some AT which corrects for errors, either
as a deliberate useful activity (after all users are not interested in if
a page has errors they're interested in viewing the content.) or as an
aside to solving a different access need.

I don't believe there's any option but to use html 4.01, xhtml of any
flavour should be served as application/xhtml+xml and only 1 flavour may
be served as text/html and even then it remains broken to many user
agents.

Jim.
