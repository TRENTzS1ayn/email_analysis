I can see his point.  In some cases where the page is dynamically built based on content pulled from external sources, the original source may not always structurally correct.  This in turn means that your once perfectly validated page will now fail validation when the additional dynamic code is added.

However, if you are providing the content - e.g. using ASP and a Database to build a table - with some extra care and attention to what the code is actually building, it should be possible to ensure that the resulting dynamically built code is still valid.

For external sources, the best you can probably do in this situation is give feedback to the content provider and hope that they some day fix the issue.

Regards,

Andrew Johns
