So if I've understood you correctly, what you're actually saying is that XHTML it is not better than HTML for accessibility from an end-user point of view.

But, what makes it the better choice is that, from a development side, XHTML enforces rules for structural integrity in the code, thus removing the possibility of badly formed code as a potential hazard when making your page meet accessibility standards?

Regards,

Andrew

(to start by addressing the original question, HTML4 and XHTML1 are
equivalent, and it is trivial for a parser to convert either format
to the other, so there is no inherent difference regarding accessibility.
Of course that observation doesn't address broken markup or software).

 based on content pulled from external sources, the original source may
 not always structurally correct.  This in turn means that your once
 perfectly validated page will now fail validation when the additional
 dynamic code is added.

Then you should fix whatever is coming from the external source.  If it is
not originally markup then you just have to mark it up.  If it is markup
that might be invalid, parse it and generate your markup from the tree.
If it is known to be valid you can optionally skip the parsing step.

Of course, that is straightforward, unless your software comprises
seriously grotty hacks written by someone who doesn't understand markup.

 give feedback to the content provider and hope that they some day fix the
 issue.

Failing that, parse it yourself.  If anyone has trouble with that,
I can offer you software or a webservice to parse markup and transform
it to something valid (HTML, XHTML or other) that meets your requirements.
