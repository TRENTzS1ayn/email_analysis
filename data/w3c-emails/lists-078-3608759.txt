Hello all,

I'm currently attempting to build a standards (in terms of accessibility AND valid code) compliant page, using div tags instead of tables for layouts, etc, using float and clear CSS tags to position elements.

This works great in standards compliant (e.g. newer) browsers, but it looks a mess on Netscape 4.7 (and probably any other variations of NN 4.x)

An author on "A List Apart" suggests that I shouldn't bother attempting to make it compatible with NN 4.  They suggest hiding the site content from them, and give an explanation that the site is standards compliant, therefore works only in standards compliant browsers and other accessibility devices, and that for them to see the site they must get a standards compliant browser.

While I see his point, in that we should be striving towards future compatibility and not backwards compatibility, I can't help but think this is the same as "Best viewed in xxxxxx" mentality, and that it goes against the "accessibility" idea?

Please share your views on this, I'm sure they'll enlighten me. 

Regards,

Andrew Johns
