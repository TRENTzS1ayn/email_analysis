But Lynx doesn't support CSS.  Maybe the better solution would be to say
something along the lines of ....

"You are using a browser that either does not support some form of W3C
standards such as CSS, DOM or XHTML.  Therefore all you're getting is
unformatted text.  If you would like to view this site in all its glory, use
a browser such as IE 6, Mozilla 1.0, Netscape 7.0 or Opera 6.1."

Or you could just put the text "Browser Upgrade Message." and link it to
another page.  That's pretty harmless, and probably on the annoyance level
of "Skip Navigation."

Just some thoughts.
