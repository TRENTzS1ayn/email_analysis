  Ah, but there is the clincher: if I am using Lynx in order to linearize
  a document in order to output it through Speech or Braille, then I am
  left with a suggestion - on each page?? - that in order to get the glory
  out of the site I should 'upgrade' to a browser using CSS.

  If I use something like emacspeak I'll get the same - and that *HAS* support
  for CSS - Aural CSS.

  As you say, just some thoughts, but I'd find it *very* annoying. YMMW, of
  course.
