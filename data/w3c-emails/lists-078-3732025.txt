But what would be the point?

That's three abbreviations, each of which is completely unknown to most
people. It's esoteric language and tells people something most people don't
need to know, and don't want to know, at least not when trying to access
some content other than W3C standards themselves.

Besides, even if you manage to hide it from some user agents and even if you
have a "skip link" before it, it will be consumed by indexing robots, many
of which treat the text at the start of the document as very important. And
it often gets displayed in the "page summary" in hit lists by search
engines.

There are situations where such references to techniques are needed on Web
pages. But as a prime directive, they should be avoided _almost_ at any
cost.
