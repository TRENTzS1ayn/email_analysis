I can assure you that I have coded ASP pages in VBScript that do exactly
that in less than 5 minutes (I am not including the time it takes to develop
the CSSs for the different browsers in that). It takes 3 lines of VBScript,
though you may want to add some code to send an Expires and/or Last-modified
header so you will have better caching.

... css here for all browsers...
<%If BadBrowser Then 'Replace Badbrowser with test on
Request.ServerVariables("HTTP_USER-AGENT") for specific browser with bug,
e.g. NN4%>
... css here for bad browser
<%Else%>
... css here for standards-compliant browser
<%End If%>
