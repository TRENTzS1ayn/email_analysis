a friend is trying to convince me that a pdf text file is the same as
putting the site up in html text,   no matter how hard I try he can't
(won't) get it that pdf in and of itself is graphics even if the graphic
is of text
   am I missing something here or is this guy totally off the mark??  he's
claiming it will be compliant that way (but won't give me the URL so I can
test it before it is done, says he)

thanks
Bob
