Dear All,
I found this interesting Website accessibility poll on:
http://www.iwks.com/default.asp

Apologies now in case this page is not accessible - it's just that the results are very interesting and I would be happy to send an update to the list later on with the final results so we can all benefit from it.

Kind regards

Simon
