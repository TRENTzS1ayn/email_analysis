In my opinion, the .pdf files are not as accessible because tables cannot be
precisely marked up as HTML tables.  (ie. corresponding data cells to table
headers, etc.).

And as far as overall accessibility, one would need Adobe to obtain the .pdf
information rather than obtaining it through many mediums with ASCII text
online.

Subject: RE: pdf as text??




a friend is trying to convince me that a pdf text file is the same as
putting the site up in html text,   no matter how hard I try he can't
(won't) get it that pdf in and of itself is graphics even if the graphic
is of text
   am I missing something here or is this guy totally off the mark??  he's
claiming it will be compliant that way (but won't give me the URL so I can
test it before it is done, says he)

thanks
