The poll is halfway down on the right hand side of the page. Sorry, the page was designed by a person with idea on usability. A perennial portal problem...

The poll is just visible without scrolling down, underneath the Internet Works magazine image.

Are you viewing in graphics browser? Does anyone need better directions?
