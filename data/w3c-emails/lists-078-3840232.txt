I guess that I should have done this earlier.

Is your Web site accessible to the disabled? 
  
 1.)  Yes 16% 
 2.)  No - but it will be within the next 12 months 13% 
 3.)  No - and I can't see the point of doing so 20% 
 4.)  No - it would be too difficult to do 7% 
 5.)  Not sure - How do I do it? 45% 

I think that this is a UK-based magazine, but guess that the poll is international. I am emailing the site to see if I can find out how many respondents there were and if they can tell me if those respondents were all unique.

Update will come later.

Kind regards
 
Simon
