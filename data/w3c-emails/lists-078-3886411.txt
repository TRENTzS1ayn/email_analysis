That's a great point.

Adobe has made Acrobat 5.0 compatible with the Microsoft Accessibility API,
which is a big step forward for Windows users.  That means you can
technically make PDFs readable by assistive technology, IF the PDFs are
created or converted properly.

But for Mac, Unix, Linux, PDA, etc. users, the PDF is still as inaccessible
as ever.  And for Windows users, if you don't have the plug-in, then it's
not just inaccessible, it's unavailable!

That's why I suggest that if you have a PDF version, that you at least have
an ASCII or HTML version available as an alternative.
