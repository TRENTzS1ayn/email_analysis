To be fair to A List Apart, they do not say that if their pages look plain 
to you then you're using a non-standards compliant browser.  Their text reads:

"This site's design is only visible in a graphical browser that supports 
web standards (link to WaSP there), but its content is accessible to any 
browser or Internet device."

I'd also like to throw out there this resource for CSS layout templates for 
NN4:
http://www.saila.com/usage/layouts/nn4-layouts.shtml

I haven't tried any of them yet, so I can't vouch for them.
