you're confusing accessibility with availability. Just because your systems
admin people don't install a piece of software doesn't automatically mean
that the content delivered by that software is inaccessible. 

If I worked somewhere where the powers that be refused to install a browser
on my computer would that make html inaccessible? I don't think so.
