I have no idea who else Macromedia may or may not have contacted (except
that they didn't contact me).  Where would I find the specs if I want
to implement a client for (accessible) Flash?  And if those specs are
controlled by a single company, what guarantee do I have as a developer
that they won't do an M$ and change the specs to invalidate my work?

BTW, there's a thread about this on uk.net.web.authoring, that presents
the subject in a rather different light.
