Because some PDF files are simply scanned images of printed pages, people
using screen readers are not able to read these documents. Even though Adobe
offers free PDF-to-HTML or PDF-to-ASCII text conversion services (see Online
Conversion Tools for Adobe PDF Documents
(http://access.adobe.com/onlinetools.html), not all converted documents are
accessible. Tables, graphs, pictures and columnar layout can also cause
problems.

The Treasury Board of Canada Standard 1.2 requires using PDF files (minimum
version 2.1) only as an alternate format. That is, users must have a choice
which format they use-HTML version, Word document, text (ASCII), or PDF.
