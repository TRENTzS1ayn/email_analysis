Hi Asif,

I have no idea about whether .NET can run as a dll or not - you should
probably look in a windows developer forum for that.

But ASP is not going to cause or solve any problems on its own - it depends
how you use it. The end result for the user is what matters, and ASP is just
another way of putting together that end result.

  Thanks.
