Not in and of itself. The "controls" that InterDev provides you with
generate dreadful HTML and would probably cause problems, but the only
people I've ever met who used them where project managers (making failed
attempts to get an idea of what the coders working with them did).

Perhaps the controls have improved with .NET, I haven't checked.

IIRC .NET asp applications can be compiled to run as a .dll that interacts
with the ASP framework. Not that different to the way heavy-duty ASP pages
all used COMs form the hard work though. Could be wrong on this one.
