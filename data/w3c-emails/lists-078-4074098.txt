All,

I have search the archives and can't seem to find anything on this although
I'm sure that it's been covered somewhere.

scenario:
A page needs posting that is aimed at a minority section of the community.
Let's say for the sake of argument that we need to post material aimed at
the local Cantonese-speaking population. There is a problem in putting up
the text of the page because Cantonese is not based on the Latin character
set and reads in a different order to Indo-European languages. we could scan
an image of the text and put that up (far from ideal) with alt text and
longdesc but the textual equivalents would have to be in English too so that
doesn't solve anything. Has anyone considered embedding a sound file in the
page that will play on loading the page and 'speak' the text in the
appropriate language? What potential problems might this cause?
