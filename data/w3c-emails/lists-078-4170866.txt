It is not necessarily true that the particular version gets shown in the
browser. That depends on the details of the site setup.

To test this, go to the WAI home page at http://www.w3.org and try to
bookmark the W3C logo image.

Or go to http://www.w3.org/Icons/w3c_home and bookmark it. If you don't get a
URI from there that ends in .gif or .png then the content negotiation is
working and you have bookmarked a generic resource.

Cheers

  Which is what the browser will display in the address bar and what will
  get bookmarked.  If they have forced a language, they may not be going
  through the generic page at all, but navigating purely on their selected
  language pages.
