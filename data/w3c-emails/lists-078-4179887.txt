>>RNIB 'Look Louder' game: RNIB statement 21 June 2002, 15:30 hours
>>
>>In response to recent enquiries, Julie Howell, the officer who leads RNIB's
>>Campaign for Good Web design, has issued the following statement:
>>
>>RNIB congratulates Macromedia and GW Micro for working together to make the
>>content of Flash files accessible to users of the Window-Eyes v4.2
>>screenreader.  At the same time, RNIB encourages developers of web content
>>creation software and developers of screenreader software to follow this
>>example and work together to ensure that all web content can be accessed by
>>blind people who rely on screenreader technology.
>>
>>RNIB understands that much work is already in progress in this area, and
>>encourages all parties involved to continue this ground-breaking work.
>>
>>RNIB fully acknowledges the efforts that have been undertaken by software
>>company Macromedia to develop their product Flash MX so that it is easier
>>for web designers to create Flash files that are accessible to blind people
>>who rely on screenreading technology to access the web.
>>
>>RNIB acknowledges that Macromedia has undertaken a significant amount of
>>development work to ensure that web content created for the Flash rich media
>>player is available to screenreading technology via Microsoft Active
>>Accessibility (MSAA).
>>
>>RNIB acknowledges that Macromedia has worked closely with GW Micro,
>>developers of the screenreader 'Window-Eyes', to enable version 4.2 of
>>Window-Eyes to access the content of Flash files created with Flash MX.
>>
>>In an effort to support this work, RNIB worked with the online solutions
>>company Bluewave, who donated their time for free to create an accessible
>>Flash application using Flash MX.  The result can be found at
>>http://lookloud.bluewave.com
>>
>>The application 'Look Louder' is the first of its kind and has been
>>carefully designed to integrate accessibility features to allow it to be
>>read by the Winow-Eyes 4.2 screenreader.  It is hoped that lessons learned
>>from this exercise will be useful to web designers working with the Flash MX
>>tool.
>>
>>As well as highlighting good practice, RNIB also undertakes campaigning,
>>with the aim of encouraging software developers to develop their products so
>>that people who are blind and partially sighted can enjoy full and equal
>>access to web content.
>>
>>RNIB is very proud to uphold the 'Look Louder' game as a working
>>demonstration of the results of the Macromedia/GW Micro collaboration and
>>would encourage other developers to continue their efforts to create web
>>content that is accessible to everyone.
