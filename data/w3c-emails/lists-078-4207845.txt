Hello all,

Can anybody tell me why I can not validate my pages?

http://validator.w3.org/ does not seem to work .

I know that many connections fall out / work very slowly  since KPNQuest is
bankroot friday. This company ownes (or owned?) a quarter of all
cableconnections in the world.


Greetings
Ineke van der Maat
