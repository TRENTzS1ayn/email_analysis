Hello All,

Just a quick note: 

HiSoftware has integrated its Accessibility Validation and Repair
solutions with Microsoft(R) Office. This will enable Microsoft Office
Users to test and repair all documents created with Microsoft Office for
distribution on the Web or Corporate Intranets for conformance with
Accessibility standards outlined in Section 508 of the Rehabilitation
Act Amendments, and under W3C WCAG 1.0 Priority 1-3 accessibility
guidelines.

Office Solutions that are supported by the integration for validation
and Repair are:

- Microsoft Excel
- Microsoft Word
- Microsoft PowerPoint 
- Microsoft Access Data Access Pages

The New AccVerify(R) Publisher for Microsoft Office is a Com Add-In for
these offices solutions that will enable developers to validate
accessibility of the documents before distribution. The new Microsoft
Office Add-Ins will be available on June 26th 2002 at
http://www.hisoftware.com/access/valueadd.html

Regards,
Rob Yonaitis
