I've been implementing a label on a form, and during testing I found it to be rather buggy in various Netscape browsers.

* on NN6.2 it seemed to be fine;
* on NN6.1 the labels didn't render, although there was space where they should have appeared;
* on NN6.0 the labels DO render, but it seems to add a large margin the left side and pushes it all out.

I'm using the <label> tag, and using a CSS style to change the appearance of it, and I have set the margin to 0px so in theory there shouldn't be all that space on the left in NN6.1.

Are there any good resources which have workarounds on this (using CSS) and maybe any other form accessibility issues? 

The other thing is that in the original design, one label appears on the right, while the next form element has it's label on the left.  This is bad accessibility, is it not? Should I push to have it more consistent, e.g. all labels on the left?

Regards,

Andy
