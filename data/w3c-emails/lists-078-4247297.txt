Dear Jan,
On 25 February 2002 you answered a thread on Accessibility Legislation in Germany. In that you mentioned that a new law would be passed in May. Any update on this?

I am also interested in the relevant legislation in France, Scandanavian Countries and, if anyone knows, the Far East (Taiwan, etc); so if anyone else can help on this (English versions only please.)

Thanks in advance to all, and especially Jan.

Simon
