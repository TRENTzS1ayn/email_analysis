I've found pages that relate to America, UK, and Australia but nothing that outlines Europe, Middle East, Far East, etc and that is where I am stuck. Increasingly I am being asked to comment on accessibility on an international scale and it is an area in which I am lacking knowledge. Following a search of the archives I came across Jan's email address and the replies to a question on German accessibility legislation but from there I have drawn a blank. The biggest problem that I am encountering is that the documents are in their native languages and I cannot translate them.
 
Hence, the original question. If nothing exists on the Web about issues around the world, perhaps this is an area that the WAI and particularly this list should look into?
 
Cheers
Simon

I am also interested in the relevant legislation in France, Scandanavian Countries and, if anyone knows, the Far East (Taiwan, etc); so if anyone else can help on this (English versions only please.)



       Sounds odd, but has anybody put up webpages doing any sort of a summary of the various laws internationally re accessibility/disability rights?
