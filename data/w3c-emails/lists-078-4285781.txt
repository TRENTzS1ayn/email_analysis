Thanks Gregor,
Also just found this resource thanks to the ICDRI website. I knew that it must exist out there, so bookmark the following URL everyone!

http://www.icdri.org/global_legal_resources.htm

Thanks. If anyone has further information then I would be interested in reading it.

Kind regards to all
Simon
