Thanks for the info.  I've since found that cause of my problem.  The "text-align: center" declaration on the body element makes the labels disappear.  I used this declaration due to the the box model workaround, so I think I need to keep it in, which means I now need to find another workaround to fix a workaround :D

Regards,

Andy

Early Netscape 6s (even, I think 6.2) are considered only beta test quality
by the Mozilla developers.  It is really not reasonable to design for them.
I believe Netscape are going to use Netscape 7 as the label for the version
based on the version of Mozilla that is considered to be of release quality.

It can be argued that people using NN6 at all are likely to be updating
rapidly.
