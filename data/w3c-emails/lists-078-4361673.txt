I have created an on-line survey and trying to test with JAWS.  I used
radio
buttons for all the multiple choice questions.  When I am in forms mode,
JAWS repeats the question when I move from one option to the other. Is
there
a way to stop JAWS repeting the question when I move from one option to
the
other? Is there anything I can do in html to force JAWS to read the
question
only once?

Thank You.
