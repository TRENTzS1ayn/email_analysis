Dear All,
As many of you may have read I asked a question regarding Germany and Accessible legislation and many people replied to me with some fantastic resources. To repay the favour I can provide some feedback on some research I was doing in this area. I spoke to the European Union Communications Office this morning and asked if they could update me on what was happening in the European Union with regards to accessibility.

For those who don't know, 2003 is the European Year of the Disabled, so this legislation is paramount to that cause being celebrated properly by all Member States and their citizens, as well as those who are from outside the EU.

Happily I can report that they have sent me a full update! All in a couple of hours, which I think is a record as far as governing bodies go! Thumbs up for that. The URL for the information is: http://wwwdb.europarl.eu.int/oeil/oeil_ViewDNL.ProcedureView?lang=2&procid=5959

It is a bit messy for you guys in Lynx and older browsers, but if you can get to the large body of text this is where you can find out what is happening. For those who first language is not English, there is a translation button at the top for most European languages, but in Lynx it will only translate to French (because of character rendering problems I guess).

If anyone has any comment on this, please let me know as I will pass them back to the EU Communication group on behalf of the list once I return from my holiday next week. If anyone has real problems with this I can ask for a URL that provides a different version (if such a thing exists).

Kind regards
Simon
