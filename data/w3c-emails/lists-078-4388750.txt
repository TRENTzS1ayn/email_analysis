If this survey uses the fieldset, JAWS 4.02 ties the reading of that to what they call the groupbox in their verbosity settings.  You can either turn the speaking of this on or off but as far as I know at present there's not a read once per group setting as you arrow between different radio buttons.

Hello,

If you use JAWS 4.02, it is probably the way that JAWS reads legend of 
fieldset.

It's a good way I think. Before, JAWS did'nt read legend and the question 
was not read to the user in form mode. He has always to alternate between 
form mode on and off.
