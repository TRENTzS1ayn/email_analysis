I have found that many resources are, unfortunately, woefully out of date...

I have found that this list is one of the best ways of aggregating information of this type and I would implore the WAI to update its information if accessibility is to be taken seriously on a global scale via the knowledge obviously available on this list - thanks those who have contributed to my thread.

As Patrick suggests, any new resources should be forwarded onto the Policy area of the WAI site. I noticed that the Italian site has been updated at source but that the WAI page has not. As the Italian government is a partner of the W3C shouldn't a representative from the Italian government be forwarding changes to the relevant WAI co-ordinator so that updates happen with more regularity?

Anyway, I'm not wanting to shoot any messengers here. Without the WAI I would not be able to find this information at all, let alone know if it was up-to-date. It must be a nightmare for companines wishing to comply and not knowing if they are or, in some cases, need to and to what level of accessibility.

btw, I have found that contacting the relevant governments and countries is the ideal way to get information and many countries have embassies in the geographical regions that this list covers, so go ask them as they may well be able to point you in the right direction. All I ask as a user of this list is that any information is shared so that we all benefit.

Martin, an update on the UK perspective would be very much appreciated, WAI-approved or not.

Kind regards to all
Simon

I wouldn't rely too much on the resources/pages listed under the UK 
section - they are horrendously out of date (and my offer to update 
them has been ignored).
