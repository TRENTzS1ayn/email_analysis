I also was forwarding resources to the W3C WAI for the Policy page, but gave
up since the updates were not made.  Another idea - some people might
appreciate the global survey of accessibility laws and policies that are
published in our new book "Constructing Accessible Web Sites" at
www.icdri.org/constructing_accessible_web_site.htm.

I wouldn't rely too much on the resources/pages listed under the UK
section - they are horrendously out of date (and my offer to update
them has been ignored).
