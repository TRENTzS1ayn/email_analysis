I did not include this list in the cross post so I am posting

Hi Lists!

Please understand this crosspost as being hopefully helpful to many of
us.  I am looking for a contact management solution that is on the web
and is accessible.  Please respond privately or to your individual list
as I would like to keep cross posting to a minimum and I promise to
share what I find.

Thanks!
