Sadly they seem to be a rare beast. I have seen a few demonstrations and
*none* have been even level A compliant. You don't mention platform but if
it's Unix then there is a firm here in Sheffield who produce one that I
think may fit the accessibility criteria.   http://mkdoc.com/  One of the
writers of this CMS frequents this list so maybe he'll pick up on the
request. Certainly I haven't come across any ASP systems that I would
consider using without a lot of work being done on the templates first.
