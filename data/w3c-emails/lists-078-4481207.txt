I'm very sorry; I misread the original post as *content* management system.
Now, if only someone would develop some software that could read the text on
my screen so I didn't have to trust my own eyes...hhmm ;-)

Flippancy aside, I apologise for wasting list space. A quick go on Google
comes up with a few. I haven't checked them all but althought this one isn't
accessible, it is available under GPL so rewriting the markup wouldn't be a
problem.
