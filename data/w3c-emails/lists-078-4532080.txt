I suspect they are, and while it might not be too much work making
the CMS produce accessible HTML for the public doing the same for
the editor interface and in addition having to comply with ATAG
means that it's not a trivial task.

I guess one acid test is -- can you edit the site using Lynx or do
you need IE5.x or newer?
