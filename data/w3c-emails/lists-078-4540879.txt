Hi,

historically they have been very hard to come by. In the last couple of years
I have noticed that many of these systems have been working on it quite hard,
resulting in real improvement.

On one hand systems such as mkdoc and ziteedit, being web-based, have become
more accessible and will continue to improve as browsers do, as well as with
improvements to their own interfaces. Similarly, many products have now been
given a web-based interface, although the accessibility of those has
sometimes left a lot to be desired.

But there is more to the accessibility of a system than its interface - not
just the ability to add a longdesc or sevral, but also making it easy and
natural for content authors to ensure that documents being produced will have
useful structure. Where necessary, of course, this requires appropriate help
documentation.

All these requirements are detailed in the Authoring Tool Accessibility
Guidlelines - http://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG10 - a W3C recommendation since
february 2000.

cheers

  I suspect they are, and while it might not be too much work making
  the CMS produce accessible HTML for the public doing the same for
  the editor interface and in addition having to comply with ATAG
  means that it's not a trivial task.

  I guess one acid test is -- can you edit the site using Lynx or do
  you need IE5.x or newer?
