I've searched but can't find any information as to the accessibility of
server side includes. Is it acceptable for accessibility purposes to use SSI
to create a "text only" version of a website, so that the graphics and
javascript are removed but the content of the site is exactly the same
between the "text-only" and full versions of the site?  Thank you in advance
for any assistance in this matter.
