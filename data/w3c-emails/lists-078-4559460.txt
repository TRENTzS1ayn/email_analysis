Giving our CMS an accessible interface is pretty straightforward. At the 
moment it is possible to update content using Lynx, and the structure of 
the resulting document is controlled - one of our aims was to enable day to 
day content editing by people who have knowledge of HTML, which has the 
useful side effect of giving output documents a useful structure, assuming 
the templates are well structured. Every level two heading, for example, is 
in a h2 element, never a horrendous mix of font and strong elements.

One thing that does concern me is the editing of the templates. At the 
moment, that is only done through a text editor, and as such it can't 
really be done by non-techies. Is that an accessibility issue?

I'll see if I get a chance to set up an example site so I can show you what 
I am talking about.
