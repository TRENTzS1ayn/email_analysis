You won't find anything definitive.

It's not not allowed.  Pardon the double negative, but look at the latest
"requirements for WCAG 2.0, specifically the consensus item S1.  

QUOTE

  S1 - Serving content in different forms to meet different user needs
  and preferences is an acceptable way to comply with the guidelines, as
  long as the different forms:
    * are complete (i.e., they provide equivalents for all the content),
    * can be obtained from visiting the same URI
    * are up to date, and
    * can be easily selected according to user preferences.

  Note: We will not make any assumptions in this Requirements document
  about the method that is used, whether it is content negotiation or a
  link. The issue of where and how the user sets their preferences is an
  item that has not been discussed.

You can do this but you have to still take responsibility for the completeness
of the result.

It is recognized that it is a lot easier to keep text-only sites for example
up to date and complete when using server-side page generation techniques.

Tesco is an example where it seems to have been done reasonably successufully, 
from what I hear.
