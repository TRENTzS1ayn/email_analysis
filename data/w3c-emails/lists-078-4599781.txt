None in particular.

Yes. There are some problems with this solution, in particular it means the
downloaded document doesn't have the same accessibility features outside of
the context of the site, which may or may not be important, and there is the
problem of determining which version to serve.
It can be a useful technique when user-agents are very unlikely to have much
bandwidth or screen size (e.g. mobile devices), but most of the time there
isn't really any need for it.
