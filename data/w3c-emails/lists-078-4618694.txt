I?m a PhD student in the University of Mondragon in the Basque Country. I
want to base my PhD in Web accesibility. I?ve read the WAI?s Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines and I?m having problems with some techniques of
this Guidelines. On of the most important is that the <OBJECT> tag doesn?t
work properly  with the Internet Explorer. For example if I use <OBJECT> to
show an image:
<OBJECT data="magnifyingglass.gif" type="image/gif">
Alt Text
</OBJECT>
I can?t see anything in the Internet Explorer. If I fill the HEIGHT and
WIDTH attributes I see the image but inside a frame. And if I deactivate the
images in my Internet Explorer the image doesn?t disappear and I never have
access to the alt text...
Most of the people who navigates in the Internet uses Microsoft?s Internet
Explorer, How can apply WAI?s guidelines if this people can?t see the
alternate text of the <OBJECT>???
Has anybody hear anything about this problem? Thanks.
