Sadly IE/win's handling of <object> is severely broken. It treats all <object>
elements as ActiveX objects - if you insert a simple image using <object> and set
ActiveX to prompt, this will demonstrate that.

It will eventually display the image, but will behave more like you inserted an
iframe - complete with padding and scrollbars. You also can't scale the image.

It is a major, major bug - and is preventing sites from being more accessible.

Maybe for IE7, Microsoft?
