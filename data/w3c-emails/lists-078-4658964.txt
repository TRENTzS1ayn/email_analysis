Subject: Course on repairing web pages


EASI is in the process of making a revision to its online course on
accessible web design.  Besides continuing to walk participants through
learning beginning accessible HTML features, the course will now include
8
assignments designed to teach participants how to repair existing but
inaccessible web pages.  Each student will have experienced how to
repair a
real page they select before they earn the course certificate.

See the revised syllabus outlining briefly these assignments at
http://easi.cc/workshops/easiweb.htm.

Repairing existing web pages is increasingly becoming a needed skill.

The next online course begins July 8.
