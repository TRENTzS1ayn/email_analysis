I think this is an odd argument, when Windows Internet Explorer can have
(almost?) any element recieve focus.  You can even add it to the tab order
to obtain keyboard focus by adding a tabindex.  So if the reason was based
on Windows behaviour, it's rather odd conclusion.

Still onmouseover does exist for A, and so does onfocus, you can just use
the A one in all browsers I know of which allow you to use the img one
(and more in fact.)
