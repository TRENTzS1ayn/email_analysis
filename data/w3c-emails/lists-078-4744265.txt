I guess it is a trick question. Notepad might be more accessible to Dave
Poehlman, and it is in fact more accessible to me as an editing tool. But
then, that's because I happen to already know HTML, XML, CSS, WCAG, ATAG,
SVG, 4TF, and many other acronyms important or otherwise.

In fact, even then it depeds on the use case. If I am building a plain web
page that includes a lot of text based content they are about even. If I am
doing something that uses a lot of basic HTML features then frontpage (it
saves me typing too many tags, and then fixing the, which is important
because I have problems typing too much.

etc.

(Well, in my case the brand names are not important - I don't have a copy of
either piece of software, but the arguments apply to the various tools I do
use -  chiefly Amaya, and occasionally any of a whole range of others.

  Thought for today:

  Which is more accessible; Notepad or FrontPage?
