Web sites are mentioned as a one line example of a service that an
organisation might offer to the public, in the current guidelines.
The guidelines are not part of the legislation, as I understand it,
like a non-normative section in a standards document.

It has been said on this list that the next version of guidelines will
be much more explicit about web sites.

From the guidelines, but not from a reading of the Act itself, the Act 
applies to any service supplied to the public except where it is of the
essence of that service that it is not accessible to certain people.
That would imply that someone reading the legislation, with good will,
would infer that web sites were covered, even if not mentioned by name.
