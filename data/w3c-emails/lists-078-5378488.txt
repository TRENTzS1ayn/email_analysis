Hi all
apologies for cross posting if any of you are on more than one of these
lists.

This problem is beginning to bug me and I can't work out how to fix it. 

URI - http://www.sheffield.gov.uk/services/education/ict/default.htm

Problems:
IE5pc  - the navigation menu jumps downwards when the cursor is placed over
the 3rd button down. 
IE5Mac - the buttons cannot be seen at all but the link is there because the
cursor changes to a pointer (hand)

Other browsers tested - IE5.5pc, Opera6, NS6.2, IE5.5MacOSX all seem ok.
IE4pc doesn't pick up the button class but at least shows the links.

The style for the buttons is this:

a.myButton {
color: #003;
font-family: arial, verdana, "sans serif";
font-size: x-small;
font-weight: normal;
text-decoration: underline;
border: 1px #003 solid;
width: 90%;
text-align: center;
padding: 5px;
position: relative;
background: #eee;
float: left;
}

a:hover.myButton {
color: yellow;
text-decoration: none;
background: #369
}

and the buttons are contained in a div that is styled thus: 

.navmenu {
 background-color: transparent;
 border: none; 
width: 15%; 
padding: 0.5em; 
text-align: center; 
margin-top: 1%; 
float: left; 
overflow: inherit
}

Research so far shows that if I make the width of myButton a fixed px width
then the jumping thing stops but I can't work out why and I don't want to
use fixed sizes anyway.. Unfortunatley I do not have the 'aberrant' browsers
installed on my localmachine so testing is somewhat hampered as I don't like
making changes to live sites if I can help it ;-)

Does anyone have any idea why this is happening? It's driving me insane(r).

tia
