The message from Joe Clark does not appear in the archives, can we find
out what is going wrong and how many other messages are being dropped?

You do?  Would you care to expand on them, people with that knowledge
seem extremely thin on the ground and
http://www.learningdifficulty.org/develop/w3c-scripts.html is always
looking for examples.

I disagree entirely, for a start
http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-DOM-Level-2-HTML-20011210/html.html
says "The interfaces found within this section are not mandatory."  so we
can't rely on any DOM being in existence (beyond hasFeature ) in browsers
which fully support w3c recommendations (not that any currently do of
course.) and without a DOM - ECMAscript is wholly useless (even the w3's
DOM's require proprietary portions to be used.)

ECMAScript can certainly be used to increase accessibilty - although I'm
despairing to find a concrete significant example of this that actually
works across even the browsers I test on.

There are a great many arguments as to why not requiing ECMAScript isn't
an outdated requirement, but I see little point in advancing them when
the only suggested reason why it's ok - is that "everyone uses IE." which
is clearly preposterous.

Jim.
