Apologies to Mr Clark, the message was not sent to the list, Randal Rust
just forwarded the reply.

Can I just note that I find it extremely worrying that people give
misleading advice that is against the WCAG guidelines (both 1 and 2
draft ) via email to preople asking for implementation advice - they are
doing a massive disservice to the purpose of the list existingm, aswell
as encouraging the person to create inaccessible pages.

Jim.
