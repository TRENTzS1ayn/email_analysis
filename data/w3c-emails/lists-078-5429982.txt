HPR has many reading modes; items, headings, form controls, tables, etc.
When using the "Item reading mode", HPR will speak a chunk of information
and then stop, for example, a paragraph, a list item, or some other chunk
of information and will speak again when the user presses the "next" [right
arrow] key.

But I think what you are asking for is that the default reading mode -
which just starts reading the page when it loads - is for HPR to better
honor the tagging and not just the punctuation.  In my opinion most blind
users don't use this mode very often. Blind users more often will try to
get a quicker overview of the page by using the various reading modes.
Most sighted web master I worked with do, however, expect HPR to just start
reading their page in a pleasing way based on the visual presentation that
they see while it is reading.  We've debated in the past how HPR could
better pause between heading and paragraph, between unordered list items,
between text in DIVs. In other words, where there is no punctuation at the
end of the text, what should the behavior of the speech synthesizer be?

Thanks for bringing it to our attention again.  May I also suggest that
specific question regarding HPR can be sent to the HPR list, which I copied
above.

Hi Jukka,

Thanks for your in depth answer. I'm sorry, though, because  I might have
saved you some work and time by saying in the original post that my
tidbits
are marked up with <p> and in HPR the paragraphs are, in my estimation,
still
read run together.

Using an ordered list doesn't change the way HPR reads, it just sounds out
that 1, 2, 3, that may make it easier to tell the different items apart.

Thanks again,

Seth
