An accessible use of Javascript:

example:  <a href="new.htm" onclick="window.open('new.htm');" return
false">text</a>

An article about this recently appeared on Evolt.org.  Technically, you're
not using Javascript to get the desired effect, but the point is that the
user have access to comparable information if they have Javascript turned
off.  A script such as this will do the trick.

Take a look at this for more information:
