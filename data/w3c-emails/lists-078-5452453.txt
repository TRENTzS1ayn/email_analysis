Of course it's not, I still find it worrying that people are willing to
give advice privately to a post on the wai-ig list that is give advice
which is in the exact opposite of what the WAI's WCAG guidelines say, if
people disagree with the WAI guidelines I would hope they'd have the
decency to put that information on the lists where it can be debated and
the guidelines changed if a consensus agrees.  To spread misinformation
where it cannot be peer reviewed worrys me - I'm surprised it doesn't
worry you?
