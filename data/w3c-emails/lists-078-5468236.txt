Unfortunately not... (see below) - However your example is different to
what was said in the quoted text in yout post - your example degrades
without javascript, so javascript is _not_ required for access to the
content.

This has recently been discussed in www-validator (perhaps not the best
place) and there are a number of scenarios where it fails (returning
false cancels the navigation even if the window doesn't open -
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-validator/2002Feb/0121.html has
more discussion and a solution (which has only potential script errors in
various browsers including Mozilla as a concern)

Yes, all very trivial - like all examples of "accessible scripting", but
still somewhat useful (although demonstrating techniques which are
better, but still don't work across current browsers.) - window.open is
also of course in no standard.  Some non-trivial examples - some which
actually reflect the ways script is used by inaccessible sites would be
nice to see.
