This depends where the pages are, what they are for, and who they are for.

For example, in Australia, the Disability Discrimination Act would generally
apply to a case where an employee could not use an intranet, or to where an
employee was not hired becuase they had a disability that meant they could
not use some corporate system such as the intranet.

A government agency such as a government department, University or a public
school would, as far as
I understand the act, not be able to make the defense that it would cost too
much to change this.

I understand that the law is different in the USA, but that many of the same
results would aply in particular circumstances.

I am not a Lawyer, and this is a legal question. In addition, it is one that
needs to be answered on a case by case basis. So I would suggest that unless
you are certain of the laws applicable to you, you should be aware that there
really is a potential that you will have to ensure your intranet is
accessible.

just my 2c worth.
