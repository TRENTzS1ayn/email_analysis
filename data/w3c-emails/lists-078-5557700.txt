The legal requirement is often higher in such cases. If your company uses an
Intranet that is not accessible to a particular individual then that
individual couldn't work for you. If you don't hire someone because of a
disability that doesn't directly affect their ability to work (i.e. they
could do the job if it wasn't for your Intranet's poor design) then you are
guilty of discrimination in employment.
