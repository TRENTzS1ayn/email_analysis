The requirement there would be to make proper provision for disabled
employees, without discrimination.  An inaccessible intranet might
violate that requirement.

There may be a little more flexibility, inasmuch as the employer can
make provision for employees affected on a case-by-case basis.  However,
if you find yourself with a prospective employee for whom no solution
compatible with your network can be found, then you would probably need
to argue that the situation had arisen in spite of your best endeavours,
and really can't be helped.  That's going to be a very difficult argument
to make if you haven't followed the WCAG.

Don't forget: it's not just current staff, but prospective future
staff, who will have to (be able to) use the intranet!

Disclaimer: IANAL - my interest in this is as a supplier of software to
help companies meet their obligations (among other things).
