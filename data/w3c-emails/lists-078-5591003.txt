Another point about Javascript, is many of the common scripting 
techniques (e.g. window.open()) relate to browser automation, an
area that is not covered by W3C standards and therefore just reflects
reverse engineering of competing products.

My guess is that W3C doesn't cover this because its remit is documents,
much more than the tools used to access them, whereas a lot of designers
are really designing application programs to run on IE on Windows.
