JAWS is configurable to read either "no graphics", "tagged graphics", or
"all graphics". In "all graphics" mode, JAWS 4.01 will read the image
filename if alt is missing, alt="", or alt="[space]". In "tagged
graphics" mode, it will ignore the image if alt is missing, alt="", or
alt="[space]". (Surprisingly, JAWS 4.01 also seems treat alt text
consisting of punctuation characters, e.g. alt="*" or alt=">>", as if
were null -- i.e. it skips it in "tagged" mode and reads the filename in
"all" mode.)

With image links, "all graphical links" is the default, so JAWS will
read either the image filename or the link href when alt is missing or
alt="" (null). Strangely, JAWS seems to read the link href when in is
normal reading mode and the filename when "tabbing" from link to link.
Also, JAWS 4.01 DOES ignore image links when alt="[space]", not that I
would recommend taking advantage of this "feature"...

When title attributes are used, JAWS will read ONE of (1) the link
title, (2) the image title, or (3) the image alt, in that order of
precedence. There doesn't seem to be any setting to change how JAWS
handles titles on image links.

Next week we'll have to try Home Page Reader 3.02 and Window Eyes 4...

Subject: Another question about JAWS 4.01 rendering

Hello all,

In JAWS 4.01, for an image with a null alt text (alt=""), JAWS read the
name of the image. If  alt is alt=" ", JAWS don't read the name.

I think it is a result wich can surprise many Web designers.
