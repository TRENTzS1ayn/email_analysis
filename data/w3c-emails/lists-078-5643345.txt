There are sites that do this (Joanthan Chetwynd's peepo is one which is
appreciated, because although people find it confusing to use as a search
engine at first, it can be learned and has the right kind of cues).

The best examples of these (things like peepo, mencap -
http://www.mencap.co.uk - and others) also manage accessibility in terms of
text equivalents, etc, which seems like a sensible approach to me.

It is not that far from what the "graphic-rich commercial sites" we try to
make accessible need to do...

  Interesting conundrum here, I have been approached by Wandsworth social

  involves the use of images and sounds instead of words, I suppose the
  position could be taken that the website would only be of interest to the
  targeted group in question and as such, is it then a required need to be
  accessible in the normally accepted terms?
