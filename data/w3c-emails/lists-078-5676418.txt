Hi
   I am seeking advice on the reasons behind WCAG checkpoint 8.1.

"Ensure that pages are usable when scripts, applets, or other programmatic
objects are turned off or not supported. If this is not possible, provide
equivalent information on an alternative accessible page. Make programmatic
elements such as scripts and applets directly accessible or compatible with
assistive technologies [Priority 1 if functionality is important and not
presented elsewhere...]Specifically they want to use Javascript.

Having responsibility for development of an accessibility standard for my
organisation a problem has arisen that it appears to make it very difficult
for the organisation to comply with this checkpoint. 
The question that I have is according to the WCAG documentation the
rationale for this guideline
is to ensure support for older browsers and people who have scripts turned
off in their browser.
I am aware that JAWS is able to handle Javascript. 
Are there assistive technologies that cannot interact with Javascript?
Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.
