How is Javascript a problem?  There are, and always have been, perfectly
good ways to use Javascript with graceful and accessible fallback.
At worst, just make use of <noscript> where necessary, and if you are
ever tempted to use the evil javascript: pseudo-protocol for forms or
links, change that to a valid destination and use event handlers for
the scripting.

Erm - not everyone can afford modern equipment.  Have a thought for those
with an old 386 and 4Mb RAM, using Lynx, perhaps with a speech reader[1].
Perfectly good with well-considered javascript, of course.
