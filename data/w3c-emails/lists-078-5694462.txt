I think that would be an excellent idea.  Let me know how it goes.

Hi all,

Encase you have not heard the person who wrote Arachnophilia 4.0 is
working on version 5.0.

The new version will be written in java.

For more information check
http://www.arachnoid.com/arachnophilia/index.html

I don't know how accessible java based programs are with JAWS.  So maybe
some of us that use the program for our html editing can write the
author and explain he's a big hit with the disabled community.
