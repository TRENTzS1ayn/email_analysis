Well, there is a Java Accessibility thing like MSAA in Windows, or the
equivalent for GNOME. I guess it would be a good idea to point  the author to
this information...

cheers

  Hi all,

  Encase you have not heard the person who wrote Arachnophilia 4.0 is
  working on version 5.0.

  The new version will be written in java.

  For more information check
  http://www.arachnoid.com/arachnophilia/index.html

  I don't know how accessible java based programs are with JAWS.  So maybe
  some of us that use the program for our html editing can write the
  author and explain he's a big hit with the disabled community.
