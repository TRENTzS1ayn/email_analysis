Hi Rob,

technologies that cannot handle javascript include emacspeak, lynx (widely
used in some countries as a primary browser for people who are blind),
braillesurf.

There is a seperate question of whether users can handle javascript. People
who are unable to keep an overview of pages often find it is better to turn
javascript off, because if the page changes and they don't know how or don't
know why, it becomes extremely difficult to use the Web.

cheers

Charles

  I am aware that JAWS is able to handle Javascript.
  Are there assistive technologies that cannot interact with Javascript?
  Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.
