Since it's been mentioned before on this list I thought I'd ask here, though
I suspect it isn't a WAI issue per se.

Many on this list react to the javascript: protocol with garlic, the Latin
Mass and the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram.

My question is, what exactly is the problem with it.

Before answering, I do clearly see that it is a bad idea to use it somewhere
were javascript may not be available; there one should use an onclick and in
the onclick cancel the href which should point to a non-javascript
alternative method of delivery of the same effect.

I also acknowledge that it is rarely necessary (the only thing I can think
of that can't be done another way is using it in the src of an img element,
something I've only seen done once, and then as an example).

However in a case where javascript is clearly available (something written
from JavaScript for example). It is a slightly more eloquent and
self-documenting syntax. So do people still see a problem with it in that
case, and if so what exactly?
