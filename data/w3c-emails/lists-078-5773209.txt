From a purist point of view, the thing before the : is not a protocol
but a scheme; it identifies the format of the following data, which
in turn represents a web resource.  javascript: URLs don't identify 
a resource, they provide an action.  As someone waid, either here,
or on www-html, recently, links are nouns, but javascript: URLs
are verbs.
