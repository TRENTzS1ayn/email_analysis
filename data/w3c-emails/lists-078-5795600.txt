more to consider are the security issues of some places where some types
of coding that is not html or approved by them are stripped out or the
pages do not function due to lack of completness when delivered.  There
are assistive technologies in addition to jaws and some older versions
of jaws and browser combinations where if propper fall back is not used
as is suggested here, there will be a lack of functionality.

How is Javascript a problem?  There are, and always have been, perfectly
good ways to use Javascript with graceful and accessible fallback.
At worst, just make use of <noscript> where necessary, and if you are
ever tempted to use the evil javascript: pseudo-protocol for forms or
links, change that to a valid destination and use event handlers for
the scripting.

Erm - not everyone can afford modern equipment.  Have a thought for
those
with an old 386 and 4Mb RAM, using Lynx, perhaps with a speech
reader[1].
Perfectly good with well-considered javascript, of course.
