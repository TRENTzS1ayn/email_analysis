This was out of context and doesn't seem to follow from my posting, even
though it was copied to me.

To a first approximation, W3C has no products except documentation (Amaya,
the CERN web server, Jigsaw, being exceptions, but not used in the mass
market).

The W3C does specify document object models, and those specifications
include ECMA Script language bindings, which partially covers what
is popularly called JavaScript.  The popular definition also covers
browser automation features like window.open, and has an extended 
definition of document.write, both of which are rather prevalent on
real pages.

They don't define the core language and core objects for ECMA Script,
but the existence of the DOM implies some acceptance of it.

However, the HTML specifications only provide scripting hooks.  They
don't require that browsers support scripting or do so with any 
specific scripting language, or any object model except one compatible
with the events defined by HTML.
