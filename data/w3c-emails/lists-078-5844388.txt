if by external you mean that info is sent to them from the page so that
the page can be fed back to externally or that some other record is
updated, there are no problems that I am aware of.

Subject: Are there any know problems when Web pages using .js files?


I would like to know if there are any known problems with Web browsers
and
other assistive technologies (e.g., JAWS) with external JavaScript files
(assuming the browser has JavaScript enabled). I know JavaScript
shouldn't
be important for people who can't have JavaScript in their Web browsers,
screen readers, etc. I try to avoid fancy features with JavaScript
(basically, the Web pages are usable without these features).

Thank you in advance. :)
