Linking


Book on CD or tape on making websites accessible -
scroll down this message...
This is a very helpful newsletter for those interested in
web design and very supportive of accessibility.

Jakob Nielsen's Alertbox for March 3 is now online at:
> http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20020303.html
>
> Summary:
> Links that go directly to a site's interior pages enhance usability
> because, unlike generic links, they specifically relate to users'
goals.
> Websites should encourage deep linking and follow three guidelines to
> support its users.
>
>
> AUDIO-BOOK WITH ACCESSIBILITY GUIDELINES
>
> The 75 design guidelines for supporting users with disabilities are
now
> available in spoken form on CD and tape.
> Great while commuting or exercising, or if you are looking for a
> human voice alternative to listening to a screen reader.

> CASE STUDIES WANTED: Measurable Impact of Design Changes
>
> I am writing a report about metrics that quantify the impact of design
> changes. If you have data you are willing to share, please email Shuli
> Gilutz at gilutz@nngroup.com
>
> We need:
> * screenshot of the "before" design
> * screenshot of "after"
> * why the change was made
> * the before vs. after numbers
>
> Any type of user interface is of interest: websites, intranets, mobile
> devices, traditional software, consumer electronics, etc. Also, the
design
> changes may refer to a complete redesign of the total UI or it could
just
> be a single feature, screen, or design element that was changed.
>
> Measures of interest include anything that measures how the use
changed.
> Could be an improvement, but negative results would be just as
important.
>
> Sample metrics:
> * success rate (users' ability to perform tasks)
> * conversion rate
> * size of average "sales basket" for e-commerce
> * training time needed to learn a feature or system
> * sign-up rate for newsletters or other desired action
> * time on task and other productivity measures
> * number of times a feature was used
> * number of calls to help desks or tech support
> * learning or comprehension scores
> * other usage or impact metrics, including ones you invented yourself
>
> I can keep your contribution totally anonymous and purely report your
> numbers as statistics that don't include any indication of what
company or
> design they refer to. Of course, we would prefer to give you full
credit
> if you are willing to be named. Also, if you send us screenshots,
please
> indicate whether we should treat the screens as confidential info or
> whether you will allow us to publish the images. All contributors will
> obviously get a free copy of the report.
>
> Please send contributions to Shuli Gilutz (gilutz@nngroup.com) who is
the
> member of my team responsible for collecting the data. She can also
answer
> any questions you may have about this project.
