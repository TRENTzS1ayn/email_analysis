Someone posted the question about an accessible Flash site a few days ago.
This morning Macromedia announced Flash MX, and one of the new features is:

----------

Develop and Playback Accessible Content

Macromedia Flash Player 6 now supports assistive technologies such as screen
readers through support of Microsoft Active Accessibility. In addition,
Macromedia Flash MX now integrates tools for creating accessible content. To
add descriptive text to animations and user interface elements, select an
item and enter the appropriate description. Users with disabilities will be
able to experience your content.

We'll see how well this works.
