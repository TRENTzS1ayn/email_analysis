Aaron,

Have you had a chance to see how Flash MX works?  I'm giving a presentation
on accessibility to our local Macromedia User Group on March 20th, and am
hoping do demo a little Flash MX for them.

I know I'll be able to get it on the 15th, but any first-hand knowledge you
could share would be fantastic.

Randal
