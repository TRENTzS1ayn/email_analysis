Aaron, will you be demonstrating Window-Eyes with Flash at CSUN?

Yes, we have been working with Macromedia very closely, and it's been very
exciting to be able to test the new Flash components. I can only tell you
how Window-Eyes works with Flash (since it's the only screen reader that
supports it to my knowledge). When a page loads with Flash content,
Window-Eyes will announce that by saying "has Flash." Then the contents are
read just like text. Macromedia is using MSAA to serve the textual contents
of the movie/animation, so it is easily accessible to screen readers that
support MSAA (like Window-Eyes). Interactive movies are easily traversable
by pressing tab. Forms and the like are equally accessible.

The only drawback is that Flash animations are dynamic (hence the word
animation), so the MSAA buffer may refresh numerous times in order to sync
up with any changes that may be taking place. That might cause some
confusion to new users who aren't experienced with Flash. Window-Eyes has a
built-in hot key (ALT-SHIFT-M) to disable the auto-loading of Flash
refreshes to keep this confusion to a minimum.

It is really incredible to see sites like foxsports.com that were once
completely inaccessible to now be very accessible.

Just to toot our horn a little more, this is a huge stride in terms of
accessible multi-media, and we're very excited to be on the forefront of
this technology and to be working closely with Macromedia.
