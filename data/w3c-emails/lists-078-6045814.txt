Jim,
Macromedia has a presentation at CSUN, where you will see some accessible
Flash, and I will touch on it as well (among other things) in my
presentation on Rich Media accessibility.

You may also get a look at some demonstrations at the South by Southwest
accessibility panel this Saturday in Austin, TX.

Andrew
