You need to bear in mind that neither of these are really search engines,
they are both really vehicles for generating targetted advertising.  Google
has always had clean layouts and only uses text advertising, but, at least
in the past, my impression is that Altavista have deliberately obfuscated
their layouts to increase the chance that you will hit the advert
before finding what you really want.
