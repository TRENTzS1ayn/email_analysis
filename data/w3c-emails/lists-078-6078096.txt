Ahem, excuse me!  $795, plus the cost of Windows, plus the cost of
hardware capable of running windows!  Not to mention the serious
hassle of mopping up each new "virus"!!

How the **** is that supposed to be "accessible" to any but a tiny
minority of the richest blind people?

It's good that you're providing such products, but only so long as
noone starts using it as an excuse for neglecting users of lower-
cost systems!
