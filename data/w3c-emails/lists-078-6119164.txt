Dear All,
I happen to share some of the sentiments that are expressed on this list
following the announcement of the new Flash software. I use a Macintosh
and it is bad enough not being able to see many websites because they
are coded for the Microsoft users of this world. So, should I buy a new
PC with all the latest kit just so I can 'see' this latest and greatest
Flash website? I think not, and I don't think that I should be forced
into doing so.

While I think that Macromedia is doing the right thing in addressing
accessibility of its multimedia software and how it is viewed, I guess
that many would agree that this type of product would be better if it
incorporated all users, regardless of hardware or software.

One last thing: has anyone on the list tested this software? I just
remember the AOL debacle...

Kind regards

Simon

Ahem, excuse me!  $795, plus the cost of Windows, plus the cost of
hardware capable of running windows!  Not to mention the serious
hassle of mopping up each new "virus"!!

How the **** is that supposed to be "accessible" to any but a tiny
minority of the richest blind people?

It's good that you're providing such products, but only so long as
noone starts using it as an excuse for neglecting users of lower-
cost systems!
