You can't fault web designers for building sites that work in the browser
that is used by about 91% of internet users
(http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp).  Now I know those
stats are probably a little skewed, but it can't be by that much.  And
please don't get started on the whole "Microsoft is a monopoly thing."  

If you want to be able to view all of these supposed web sites that don't
work, then you should be helping to promote web standards.  Designers build
sites to reach the largest audience possible.  This is a simple fact of
life.  I'm not saying this is necessarily the right way, but it is certainly
the reality of things.

I suppose you expect they'd give it away for free, or sell it for $30?
Sometimes the expectations that people have are just silly.
