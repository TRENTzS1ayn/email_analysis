Yep, I agree wholeheartedly with your sentiments, however, you would have thought that if those involved with accessibility had been asked then this kind of thing could have been avoided and the new Flash software would have been accessible to all - the purpose of this list is to make websites and all that they entail "accessible to all". I will also address the other issue that you have just replied to in that I am not attacking microsoft or its supposed monopoly, I am just saying that if we look to include everyone (disabled, able, Mac, PC, computer literate, non-computer user, etc, etc) then these issues are important. I was using the Mac thing as an illustration of a point, not dissing MS nor anyone else either.

I am interested in any software or hardware that can make websites accessible to all, but it still begs the question: why was the software not available across more platforms - perhaps Apple didn't want to help, perhaps no one was asked and MS just got in there first. There is no right or wrong in this discussion, I am only attempting to relate this thread to the overall accessibility issues that affect everyone on this list and a great many more.

Kind regards to all
Simon

Good grief, can't we at least recognize that Macromedia is moving in the
right direction?  I'm not flaming Bob, but all too often on this list people
are complaining about how a web site or a product falls short of being
accessible in some way or another, even though people are trying very hard
to make things as accessible as possible.

I'm not about to suggest that we all run out and start using Flash, but I
think this is certainly a sign of good things to come.  I'm very interested
to see what Flash MX has to offer.
