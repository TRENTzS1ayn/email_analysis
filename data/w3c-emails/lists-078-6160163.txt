I agree with you, I really do.  And I'm not saying that your comments
weren't warranted either, I just wanted to remind people that more goes into
a software maker's decisions that just accessibility.  And I didn't
necessarily think that your were attacking Microsoft.  I threw those
comments in there so as to avoid the usual debate that arises.

I just get tired of hearing people on the WAI list finding faults with
everything, rather than trying to help find solutions.  If the people on
this list worked harder to educate, rather than criticize, then I think
accessibility would be taken more seriously.
