well it is the old, "are you on the inside looking out, or the outside
looking in....???"    if they put ramps at ten buildings but the guy in
the wheelchair wants into the eleventh he doesn't care about what they did
to the other ten, it is the one he needs that isn't accessible.

I wonder how hard their trying, why invent new ways to modify people with
disabilities when the method to make the site accessible already exists,
there is nothing wrong with people with disabilities so why is everyone
trying to make them use half asssed jury rigged stuff to use something
made to be inacccessible.

   the problem isn't with the operating systems it is with the attitude of
the web site makers.!

yeah I'm interested in seeing what they have to offer, but I don't even
want it....just put the text alt in the website and be done with it.

  it's getting to be like if everytime the auto makers came out with a new
model they changed the gas tank filler and you had to buy a new car to be
able to fill it with gas, or at least some new adapter!!  STANDARDIZE dang
it...what is wrong with ASCII text???  there isn't an operating system
anywhere in the world that cannot use it. (that I am aware of anyway)

sorry hit my pet peeve on button
