THERE IS A WEB STANDARD, HTML, ASCII TEXT  why the bloody *ell do they
have to keep reinventing the wheel.   the latest and greatest can read a
HTML ascii text site and the oldest DOS 1.1 can read it, so it is
"plain" is that a sin???

no designers build the sites to show off their latest "whiz bang" whistle

why should a person with a disability even need to buy another piece of
software just so the web designer can be a little lazy and not put in the
"alt" text.

  I'm sorry but it is NOT the people with disabilities (or who just don't
want this stuff) who are broke.  it is the people who seem to think PWD
need to be "fixed" so they can hobble through the minefield of complex
websites??

No I don't expect people to work for free, I expect that it shouldn't even
be needed...it is a product in search of a problem, and website designers
are given another excuse for not designing correctly.
