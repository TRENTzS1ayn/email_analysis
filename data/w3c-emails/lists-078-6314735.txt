depends, should a Sun system be accessible to Sun systems, yes but what
about people coming in from outside to investigate Sun products.

no it makes much more sense to build systems that can be used by everyone
then move on to proprietary systems that have a system that has to be Paid
to be entered (buying proprietary software or hardware)  MS can use
generic systems but MS systems cannot be used by generic systems, it is
one way access, in to MS but nothing gets out
