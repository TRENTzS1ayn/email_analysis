Should W3C rename the WAI guidelines as standards?

For example:

Web Content Accessibility Standard (WCAS)
Authoring Tools Accessibility Standard (ATAS)
User Agent Accessibility Standard (UAAS)

They will still be "officially" known as W3C Recommendations, but by
putting the word standard into the title, it will tell the reader what they
are intended to be - a standard, not a guideline.  This may also help with
fragmentation of the "guidelines".
As we've probably all heard before: "They're only guidelines".
