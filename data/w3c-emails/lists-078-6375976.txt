Hi Bob-

I can tell you about our products as an example. We architect in java
but we serve most end-users on our customers' sites who use MS systems.
We want to be compatible with everyone - but, to take a specific
example, when we produce chat applets, how can we provide accessibility
to every OS? As a young startup, we have a hard time just addressing the
largest segment of the market... And, btw, we are opensource
(Java/Linux)- but our users (who browse on our applets) are the ones who
have a proprietary OS...

Take care,

Michel

depends, should a Sun system be accessible to Sun systems, yes but what

heck MS isn't even accessible to users of older MS systems

no it makes much more sense to build systems that can be used by
everyone
then move on to proprietary systems that have a system that has to be
Paid
to be entered (buying proprietary software or hardware)  MS can use
generic systems but MS systems cannot be used by generic systems, it is
one way access, in to MS but nothing gets out

profit is fine, greedy monopolistic activities are not
