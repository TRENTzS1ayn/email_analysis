define "non-standard"

I have uploaded and am running the latest version of PINE in e-mail, and I
think I have the latest version of LYNX for web browsing.

now is this considered "upgrade" in your book or does it have to have all
the fancy bells and whistles to be considered "updated"

now how many people in the real world up date anything that
frequently...how about someone running the latest (not avaliable in the
USA) MSDOS 8.1 ??
   What about someone who is running BSD, or Linux, or some other less
popular browser???
   I am playing devils advocate a bit but many people just "like" text,
why is it so hard to understand this is a valid way to use the web and
people who chose speed and robust and clearity over bells and whistles
have a right to all of the data and information on the internet.

being considered "Non standard" and being "discouraged" is very different

a basic level of usability MUST be preserved.. there are too many people
in the third world and who are low income and who cannot or chose not to
upgrade on a regular basis.
