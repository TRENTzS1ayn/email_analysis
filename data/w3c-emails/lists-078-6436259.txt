You may want to indicate your interest in Javascript support to Harland.

I had intended to start working on it with an older version of
Lynx late last year between contract gigs. A new gig came up and

start on it again. Help is welcome. There doesn't seem to be
much interest in JS support as far as I can tell, however.
