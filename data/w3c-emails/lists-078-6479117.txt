Anyone can call anything a standard. It isn't some magic reserved name, it is
actually a word that describes the thing which people all use (so in fact
many so-called standards are not) or agree to use as the measure or
interface they provide for outside evaluation or use.

Beyond which, I don't personally think that it matters a great deal what they
are called - if someone advances a sufficiently compelling case for one name
or another I am ready to be convinced.

  Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that since W3C isn't an
  official standards-making body, nothing can be legitimately called a
  "standard"; it's a reserved word. However, "specification" should be
  available for use.

  I agree that the term "guideline" is problematic, because it
  carries an implication of "suggestion" which is not really what we
  are trying to accomplish nor is it in line with the way the
  "guidelines" are written.  (If we are truly writing "guidelines"
  then WCAG 2.0 would look more like advice and less like
  requirements!)

  Anyway, I suspect this won't change, even if it really should.
