>San Francisco, California -- March 4, 2002 -- Macromedia*, Inc.
(Nasdaq:
>MACR) today announced accessibility support in both the Macromedia
Flash*
>MX development software and Macromedia Flash Player 6. The player will
>include support for Microsoft Active Accessibility, which will enable
>people with disabilities to interact with Macromedia Flash content and
>applications using accessibility aids such as screen readers.
Macromedia
>Flash MX (announced today, see separate release) simplifies the
creation
>of accessible content by enabling the addition of descriptive text to
rich
>Internet content and applications. According to Section 508 guidelines,
>all federal agencies are required by law to make all content and
programs
>offered on their Internet and intranet sites accessible.
>
>"Macromedia is committed to ensuring our products can be used to
deliver
>great experiences to all people, including those with disabilities. We
>built core Microsoft accessibility technology directly into the player
to
>ensure this crucial issue was addressed," said Kevin Lynch, chief
software
>architect, Macromedia. "Macromedia has a corporate initiative to
support
>accessible solutions across our tools so that our developers can
deliver
>content and applications that both meet federal guidelines and are
>available to people with disabilities."
>
>"Microsoft Active Accessibility was specifically designed to simplify
the
>development of products such as Macromedia Flash Player to ensure that
>they easily interoperate with accessibility aids to deliver accessible
>content and applications," said Madelyn Bryant McIntire, group manager,
>Accessible Technology Group, Microsoft Corp. "Microsoft builds
>accessibility into our platform to let software developers quickly
bring
>accessible solutions to the marketplace."
>
>Macromedia Flash MX provides a simple, one-step procedure for selecting
>items within content and applications and adding descriptive text. When
>that content passes through to Macromedia Flash Player, it sends that
>descriptive text to an Active Accessibility client such as Window Eyes
>from GW Micro.
>
>Microsoft Active Accessibility provides a standard means for client
>software to communicate with assistive technologies. It also delivers
an
>identifiable standard to developers of assistive technologies, so they
can
>include Macromedia Flash support into tools for people with
disabilities.
