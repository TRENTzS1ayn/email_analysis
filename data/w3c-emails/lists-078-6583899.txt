I also use Pine as well since it is fast and easy to use. I do not have
any visual disabilities. However, I prefer to use Links
(http://links.sourceforge.net/) for the text Web browser when I don't use
a GUI Web browser. Have you guys used this browser before? I think it is 
a much better browser IMHO.
