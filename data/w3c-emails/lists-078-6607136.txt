Browsers I use:

Links, Lynx, iCab, Mozilla, Opera,  Internet Explorer, Netscape, WannaBe,
Amaya, MiniWeb, ICEbrowser, and Phone.com

(and occasionally others).

There is a page (slightly out of date, but noetheless useful for ideas) that
the WAI Education and Outreach group has where they provide links to a number
of different browsers, but not nearly all of them.

  I also use Pine as well since it is fast and easy to use. I do not have
  any visual disabilities. However, I prefer to use Links
  (http://links.sourceforge.net/) for the text Web browser when I don't use
  a GUI Web browser. Have you guys used this browser before? I think it is
  a much better browser IMHO.
