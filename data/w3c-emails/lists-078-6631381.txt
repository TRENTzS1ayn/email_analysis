I need some clarification of this ckeckpoint from WCAG:

(7.5)
"until user agents provide the ability to stop auto-redirect, do not 
use markup to redirect pages automatically. Instead, configure the 
server to perform redirects."

What I need to know is, what exactly does "configure the server to 
perform redirects" mean? There is very little detail in the WAI 
documents about this checkpoint.

I'm working on something where the redirects happen server side, 
using standard server side coding, rather than configuring the server 
to perform redirects - I'm not totally sure whether this method is 
within the checkpoint or not.

Cheers
