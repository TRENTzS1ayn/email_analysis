  I believe that this:

     http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/wai-pageauth.html#linearized-table

  can explain it much better than I could.

  Links, basically, is far TOO good at laying out tables in a visual 
  fashion. Lynx is not soo good, and this trait makes it invaluable in
  observing how a page functions with regard to checkpoint 5.3.
