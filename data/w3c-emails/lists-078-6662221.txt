Hi,

While we are talking browsers, I was wondering if any one else had noticed 
problems with tabbing in Netscape.  I have been puzzling over this for days 
now  ...

I am redesigning the e-bility web site using XHTML, PHP4 and CSS.  The 
formatting is picked up well by Netscape in both 6.0 and 4.7, as well as 
other browsers tested so far.  However with the content floated to the 
right and navigation on left I am unable to tab through the links.  As this 
is important for accessibility and also for forms I am trying to find a 
solution.

If anyone is interested in having a look the test pages can be found at:

http://www.qnet.com.au/e-bility_test/index.php

http://www.qnet.com.au/e-bility_test/brochure.php

The tabindex order is: content links, global nav links, utility links, 
footer links.

NB:  Most of the other links on the page don't yet have content behind them 
and some will take you back to the old site.
