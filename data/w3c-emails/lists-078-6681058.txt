Rebecca,

if you want to redirect your visitors permanently (ie you have changed your
file structure, deleted files ...) and are using an Apache server (majority
of cases), just include the following line for each file in your .htaccess
file on the server (root directory):

RedirectPermanent /somePath/spmeFileName.htm
http://www.yourDomain.de/newPath/newFileName.htm

This will cause a server-side redirect without client interaction, thus
avoiding meta or JavaScript redirects, which are dependent on the client
software?s capability of understanding the code.

The .htaccess file should be default be calleds by the server before
anything is delivered to the client. .htaccess allows you to configure a
number of server-side functions, including password protected access and
server-side redirects.

I?m sure that other server systems have similar functions.

If you are doing redirects dependent on the client software or user?s
behaviour, you will have to use server-side coding, ie PHP, ASP ...

Prost
Jan

  Betreff: clarify "redirects" in checkpoint 7.5


  I need some clarification of this ckeckpoint from WCAG:

  (7.5)
  "until user agents provide the ability to stop auto-redirect, do not
  use markup to redirect pages automatically. Instead, configure the
  server to perform redirects."

  What I need to know is, what exactly does "configure the server to
  perform redirects" mean? There is very little detail in the WAI
  documents about this checkpoint.

  I'm working on something where the redirects happen server side,
  using standard server side coding, rather than configuring the server
  to perform redirects - I'm not totally sure whether this method is
  within the checkpoint or not.

  Cheers

  Rebecca Cox
