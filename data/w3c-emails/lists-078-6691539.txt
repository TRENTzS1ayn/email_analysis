Hello all,

I have a couple of outstanding CSS/CSS2 issues:

1. Any way to over-ride the positioning of elements to prevent increased
size text being hidden behind other elements.

2. Is there any way to over-ride the height of certain form elements? Using
IE5.5, 1024x768 screen display with 200% font size windows display settings,
and large text size the search box on www.microsoft.com is very narrow and
although you can type into the field the text is undreadable. The Go button
is fine though. However, I get the same problem with the button sizing using
my hotmail account so suspect it is a CSS issue as opposed to a Windows
issue.

www.microsoft.com also demonstrates the problem of text being hidden behind
or too large and therefore hidden in an element. eg. Links at top of page
aren't readable and Search disappears behind the home link.

Any thopughts/solution as ever very much appreciated.

Cheers
Ian
