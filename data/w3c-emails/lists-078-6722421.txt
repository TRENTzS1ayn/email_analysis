Hello Scott,

Just a note on "HiSoftware Products and Client/Server Applications."
That is a pretty broad question, but I will try to answer it for you

For HTML/XHTML "Web" Documents:
HiSoftware AccVerify, AccRepair, AccMonitor, and AccessibilityWATCH will
work with all HTML/XHTML "Web" documents, whether or not they are static
pages or dynamic pages for Intranets, Internets, Extranets, etc... Using
our new AccVerify Test Center you can take automation to the next step,
allowing for full automation of Forms, Security, user groups and product
or catalog testing for your "Web" Based applications. Testing is for:

    Section 508 Standards
    IBM Accessibility Guidelines
    W3C WAI P1-P3 Guidelines or any custom guideline derived from p1-p3

Additionally The AccVerify product has a full API Allowing you to
integrate your testing with Products like:

 Microsoft Visual Studio .Net 
 Mercury Test Director 
 Microsoft Application Test Center
 Content Management Systems:

SharePoint CMS
Content Management Server
etc...

For "Software" Applications
Later this Spring HiSoftware will be releasing a new product that will
test Software Applications and Plug-Ins to see if they have been
developed to meet the following guidelines or standards:

US Section 508 
EITACC Desktop Software standards 
Microsoft Accessibility Guidelines 

This Product should be available in MAY 2002. It will integrate with the
AccVerify Test Center allowing for automated testing of Plug-Ins and
software applications.

Overall,
If you have further questions you can always contact our technical
people, they would be more then happy to review the capabilities of our
solutions with you or send you demonstration software.

We run a beta group and if you are interested in the software testing
versus the Web Document Testing please feel free to request membership
to the beta program. The product "Code Name" is "TotalACC"
http://www.hisoftware.com/betanews/ you will need to note that you are
interested in this product in your request.
