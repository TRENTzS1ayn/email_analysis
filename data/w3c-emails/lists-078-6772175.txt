Scott-

JAWS works with client / server applications on the client side.  [This
e-mail assumes that you are referring to classic client / server
computing with the client being an installed application on the desktop
of the user.]   If the client application is written in native Windows
code JAWS would read information about the application through the
appropriate API (MSAAA).  If the application is written in Java JAWS
would read information about the application through the Java
Accessibility API, with some caveats for native code access to the JVM.

As David pointed out early the usability of Java applications in JAWS is
still evolving.  Our application is written in Java and we have had
success in using it in JAWS.   Candidly, however, the results have been
inconsistent and both Sun and Freedom Scientific continue to work to
improve the situation.

Automated compliance tools such as InFocus (my personal favorite ;-),
AccVerify, Lift, etc. do not currently support the diagnosis of
applications as described above.  This includes applications embedded in
pages, stand alone applications, and pretty much anything else that
produces custom GUI components.   

I know of some tools on the market that are available to diagnose
applications; however, my "faith" in such tools is limited.  For the
time being the best route to ensure accessibility for native code
applications or embedded applications in web pages is to test [the
application] with assistive technology.  If you are in need of testers I
am sure this list, the commercial organizations posting to the list, or
my organization would be more than happy to help you find appropriate
resources.
