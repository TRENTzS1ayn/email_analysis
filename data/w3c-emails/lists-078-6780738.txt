as far as I know, if it is not useable, it is not accessible.  we are
after alll talking about leveling the playing field and comparable
access?  I'm not dinging mm,  I just want this to be understood.  I
await the day when we have parity with all formats and such.

>The Flash Player 6 will expose as much information as it can find in
any

text

will

>Starting with version 6 of the Flash MX authoring tool, creators of
Flash

>objects in their movies.  Authors can also control which objects are
>eligible for voicing, which can help silence distracting visual
elements.
>Some advanced techniques are also available, meaning that authors who
are
>dedicated to creating accessible content should be able to produce some
>excellent results for screen reader users.

>Beginning with version 6, Macromedia is also promoting accessibility

design

>In many ways, older Flash content will behave similarly to HTML pages
that

come

>It is important to distinguish among the many roles in which Flash
content

>displaying text, hyperlinks, and interactive elements.  When Flash is
used
>in this role, it is usually because designers want to create a Web page
>that is more visually flexible than HTML.  This is a situation that
should
>work reasonably well for screen reader users. On the other hand, Flash
can

>sometimes contain no text.  Often they have audio tracks as well, but
often

its

into

>movie.  But "eye candy" movies created prior to Flash 6 will not
provide

>In the end, Steve makes a good point: there is a difference between
content

Flash

more

attention

a

content.
