I am looking for opinions and experiences on accessible chat rooms.

  

I am in the market to purchase a chat program that could be used as an added feature on mostly health care related websites.

Is there an accessible chat program that is currently on the market?  Has anyone used accessible chat programs with a great ease of use?

 

What would be your stance on a website that had a chat room that wasn't accessible to all users?  Do you just not have chat?  Or would you tolerate it?

 

Thank you for your thoughts,

Christian

  wasn't suggesting that it be used for graphics, your right almost no way a
  person using a braille or text to speech reader could understand it.

  that is where the alt tag is handy

OK, so it seems we are in agreement on that bit.

OK, I think we are getting closer. ASCII is a way of encoding a particular
set of characters - those used in American English. (Actually not all
computers can use it - IBM computers used a different system for a long
time...) There are equivalent systems for other kinds of characters - and
Unicode (also called ISO-10646, or some other names) is the one most commonly
recommended because it includes almost all characters used today, some no
longer used, and some for only strange usages like the "klingon language"
invented by fans of star trek. (In 64000 characters I guess the first few
people to add their own silly ideas get to have a bit of space. I would
have preferred Mayan, but there are probably more  speakers of Klingon!).
