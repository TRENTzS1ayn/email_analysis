YM parrot?

Macromedia may have undergone a "road to Damascus" conversion, and we
can welcome the improvements to accessibility now coming from them.
But having seen this announced in other fora, the subtext is clear,

The bottom line is very clear: the requirement to provide an accessible
alternative when using flash stands.  Attempts to suggest otherwise
cannot be allowed to stand.
