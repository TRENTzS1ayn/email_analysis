My very personal 2 cents worth:

I would be extremely unhappy about a health-care related system that was
inaccessible. If it were not possible to find an alternative I would, of
course undertstand.

Anyway, I think the most widely accessible chat system (except for people
with significant intellectual disabilities, or difficulty typing and no voice
input systems - both groups who are not well-served by most existing chat
systems) is based on IRC - there are any number of clients, including some
that work well with screen readers, some rudimentary attempts at producing
them to work well for various other users, and it is available on virtually
every software platform.

  I am in the market to purchase a chat program that could be used as an added feature on mostly health care related websites.

  Is there an accessible chat program that is currently on the market?  Has anyone used accessible chat programs with a great ease of use?



  What would be your stance on a website that had a chat room that wasn't accessible to all users?  Do you just not have chat?  Or would you tolerate it?



  Thank you for your thoughts,

    wasn't suggesting that it be used for graphics, your right almost no way a
    person using a braille or text to speech reader could understand it.

    that is where the alt tag is handy

  OK, so it seems we are in agreement on that bit.

  OK, I think we are getting closer. ASCII is a way of encoding a particular
  set of characters - those used in American English. (Actually not all
  computers can use it - IBM computers used a different system for a long
  time...) There are equivalent systems for other kinds of characters - and
  Unicode (also called ISO-10646, or some other names) is the one most commonly
  recommended because it includes almost all characters used today, some no
  longer used, and some for only strange usages like the "klingon language"
  invented by fans of star trek. (In 64000 characters I guess the first few
  people to add their own silly ideas get to have a bit of space. I would
  have preferred Mayan, but there are probably more  speakers of Klingon!).
