Hi
As you say, it's the screenreader rather than magnifier that has the 
problems. I found this happening when testing out the website for a 
college I worked at once. It seemed that the culprit was dreamweaver - 
pages created in other editors didn't seem to get that effect - but 
couldn't really figure out why it was happening.
