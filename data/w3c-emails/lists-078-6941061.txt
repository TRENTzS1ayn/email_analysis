David,

I've done a quick search through google and couldn't find what em stands
for. I believe "e" stands for element but that's as close as I came. Here's
the best description I could find from blooberry.com:

Ems. A scaling factor relative to the value of the current element's
'font-size' property. If 'em's are used in the 'font-size' property for an
element, the scaling factor is relative to the value of the 'font-size'
property of the parent element. If this type of unit is specified for the
root element of a document, the scaling factor should be relative to the
browser default value for the property.
