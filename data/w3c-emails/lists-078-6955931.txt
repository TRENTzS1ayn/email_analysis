It's the size of the letter "m" which is the widest letter in the latin
alphabet (generally).

There is a definition in the CSS specification (lucky, since that is where
the thing is used a lot):
http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/syndata.html#length-units
That says "it is the font size".

  David,

  I've done a quick search through google and couldn't find what em stands
  for. I believe "e" stands for element but that's as close as I came. Here's
  the best description I could find from blooberry.com:

  Ems. A scaling factor relative to the value of the current element's
  'font-size' property. If 'em's are used in the 'font-size' property for an
  element, the scaling factor is relative to the value of the 'font-size'
  property of the parent element. If this type of unit is specified for the
  root element of a document, the scaling factor should be relative to the
  browser default value for the property.
