Actually, no.

Em is the square of the type size. Thus an em is 12 points square in 
12 point type (and a capital M is rarely as wide, measured in points, 
as the size of the type).

En is half an em.

To avoid misunderstanding, especially in noisy press rooms, printers 
often referred to ems and ens as muttons and nuts.
