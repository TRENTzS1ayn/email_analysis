FYI: Here at WebAIM a web based chat was developed for a few distance
education classes at Utah State University (USU), and I believe it will be
used next month for our On-line Web Accessibility Training Event.

http://acropolis.usu.edu/chat

It seems to work very well. The feedback we have received has been very
positive so far. In our situation we could not find a solution so we created
our own and hope to develope it further. This has been our approach to many
situations where accessibility is a must but accessible software does not
exist.

Jared Smith, the developer of the USU chat, also wrote an article on our
website about the accessibility of chat programs.

I am looking for opinions and experiences on accessible chat rooms.

I am in the market to purchase a chat program that could be used as an added
feature on mostly health care related websites.
Is there an accessible chat program that is currently on the market?  Has
anyone used accessible chat programs with a great ease of use?

What would be your stance on a website that had a chat room that wasn?t
accessible to all users?  Do you just not have chat?  Or would you tolerate
it?

Thank you for your thoughts,
Christian

  wasn't suggesting that it be used for graphics, your right almost no way a
  person using a braille or text to speech reader could understand it.

  that is where the alt tag is handy

OK, so it seems we are in agreement on that bit.

OK, I think we are getting closer. ASCII is a way of encoding a particular
set of characters - those used in American English. (Actually not all
computers can use it - IBM computers used a different system for a long
time...) There are equivalent systems for other kinds of characters - and
Unicode (also called ISO-10646, or some other names) is the one most
commonly
recommended because it includes almost all characters used today, some no
longer used, and some for only strange usages like the "klingon language"
invented by fans of star trek. (In 64000 characters I guess the first few
people to add their own silly ideas get to have a bit of space. I would
have preferred Mayan, but there are probably more  speakers of Klingon!).
