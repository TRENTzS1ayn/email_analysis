recently visited the state of Maryland site,  it is full of frames and
javascript etc....it also says for "people with adaptive equipment see
link at end of page"   go to end of page and click through.

and there is a nice little note saying basically "tough" we want to do it
this way and if you can't use it call this phone number and we will look
up what you want, of course phone is only answered during business hours.

does anybody think something like this is adequate how should this be
corrected?
