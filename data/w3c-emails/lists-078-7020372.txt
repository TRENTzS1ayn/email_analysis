I'm having real problems lobbying the BBC.
Is there a guide to instigating change, from the outside?

things to consider regarding the website design of
http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/

at least eight buttons are labelled 'listen', listen to what, you and I
know, however my guess is at least 20% of the population would have no idea.
(valuing people, uk govt white paper). this type of link is no better than
'click here'

there are about 160 links on this page, all visible at one time. This means
nearly everything is a link, and there is far too much of it. google/yahoo
generally offer ~20 + a few site links.

there are a large number of broken links, not surprising perhaps, but makes
for a dud experience. with plenty of pop up windows, try
http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/artist_area/williamsrobbie/  and try to listen
to 'eternity', this is topical stuff.

This may very well be the best example yet (peepo excluded) of what not to
do.

its a pity, because the BBC also has plenty of excellent resources,
presented in a reasonable way.
They also tend to use a picture to illustrate a link in many instances, for
example http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/today/ and this is relatively
innovative.
