Hi,
Does anyone have a clear idea of how far SVG implementations have got
towards allowing the different techniques described in this (excellent)
note?
In particular, I haven't found anything that can do the CSS styling to
present just <title>s and <desc>s - the note gives the impression that this
can be done already...can it?

Cheers,
Danny.
