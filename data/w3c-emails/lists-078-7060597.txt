Yes, we did the CSS presentation using IE, no SVG support installed. It is a
basic feature for XML browsers in general.

I am now talking to a developer who has a sonic/haptic/voice feedback system
for interpreting images, and the hope is that this will result in an SVG
plugin that does the same...

Cheers

  Hi,
  Does anyone have a clear idea of how far SVG implementations have got
  towards allowing the different techniques described in this (excellent)
  note?
  In particular, I haven't found anything that can do the CSS styling to
  present just <title>s and <desc>s - the note gives the impression that this
  can be done already...can it?

  Cheers,
  Danny.
