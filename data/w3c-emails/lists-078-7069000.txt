Well, obviously someone does, because they had it implemented like that.

If you are in fact a real live user of the State of Maryland site you might
like to enquire of their people who ensure accessibility what they think of
the matter.

But my very personal 2 cents worth is that this seems a lot like the back of
the bus to me.

I heard of one case that was worse - an Australian University had an online
enrolment system that was pretty inaccessible for a lot of people, so they
provided a backup telephone service. It was pointed out that this wasn't the
same thing - for a start only being available during business hours. So they
turned the Webserver off outside business hours too... <sigh class="BIG"/>

  recently visited the state of Maryland site,  it is full of frames and
  javascript etc....it also says for "people with adaptive equipment see
  link at end of page"   go to end of page and click through.

  and there is a nice little note saying basically "tough" we want to do it
  this way and if you can't use it call this phone number and we will look
  up what you want, of course phone is only answered during business hours.

  does anybody think something like this is adequate how should this be
  corrected?
