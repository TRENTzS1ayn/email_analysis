----------

I need to make a correction to my earlier response.  I have not dealt
directly with anyone from Connecticut on accessibility issues.  I had
problem with some people in Florida not understanding the requirments.  Just
a little early Monday morning mix-up.  Sorry for any confusion this might
have caused:)
