the fact that the tables cannot readily be exported to anything
approaching cross platform use is an inhibition.  I can access excell
spread sheets in excell but they fall apart for me on the web.

Subject: Accessibility of Excel documents


Dear All,
The assumption could be made that Excel documentation is accessible as
it can be used to show data in a table format. However, there are no
structural elements that I can find within Excel that could help with
accessibility. Does Excel cause any accessibility problems for users? If
so, how can these be overcome?

I have looked on the Microsoft site and searched on the Web, but I
cannot seem to find any specific mentions of whether an Excel
spreadsheet is accessible or not and I would very much appreciate your
input on this. Thanks in advance for any advice and help.

Kind regards

Simon
