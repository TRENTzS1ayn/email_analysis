So, does that mean that if an Excel document is offered on a Web page, it is better to cause it to open the Excel application and display the document there rather than display it in a Web page? I am again making the assumption that the user should be told that this will happen?

Thanks for the previous note on the use of Excel spreadsheets

Kind regards

Simon
