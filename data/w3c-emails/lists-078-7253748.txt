assuming I have an application to open, that may be the wisest hing to
do.  However, assumptions that I have excell are reaching at best.  You
also have to assume that my at supports excell which many do not and
many fairly new versions of them do not.

So, does that mean that if an Excel document is offered on a Web page,
it is better to cause it to open the Excel application and display the
document there rather than display it in a Web page? I am again making
the assumption that the user should be told that this will happen?

Thanks for the previous note on the use of Excel spreadsheets

Kind regards

Simon
