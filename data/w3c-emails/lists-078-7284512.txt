I don't generally like segregating users either. However it's worth noting
that there are advantages and disadvantages to tables vs. Excel apart from
accessibility issues. The fact that a given individual might want to see
tables sometimes (which are less of a UI shift when you are mainly dealing
with web stuff) and Excel other times (to do Excel specific stuff). On this
basis alone it could well be worth allowing both (or even more) formats.

 The reason that I ask is that I have a site with lots of

Open the spreadsheet on the server and generate the table from that on the
fly.
