That makes alot of sense. I'm using a dark grey for my main body text. She
wasn't experiencing problems on areas where there was a colored background
and she was experiencing problems on another website featuring black text on
a while background. In that case, only the link text was garbled because
it's a different colour.

Thanks, Mike.

Michelle
