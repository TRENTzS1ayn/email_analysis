Problem is that  users need a way of finding out what things can be triggered
by an onClick - this is a specific requirement of user agent accessibility
guidelines: http://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG10/guidelines.html#tech-nav-just-active
- so the solution doesn't really solve the problem, and instead leaves the
user, in a good implementation, in the situation of finding out there is
something that uses a non-standard link method that is not written to be
accessiblt and for which there is no helpful information available.

  We've talked a few times about the problems of the common "image

  allow sighted users to click on either the image or text, but we'd
  rather avoid making screen reader users hear the same link text repeated
  twice (the image's alt text followed by the text link).

  What if we did something like this (HTML code follows):

  <img src="image.gif" alt="" onclick="document.location='newpage.html';">
  <a href="newpage.html">Link Text</a>

  (i.e., use a javascript "onclick" on the image to load the new page if
  the image is clicked.)

  The image alt wouldn't show up in a screen reader's links list, and with
  alt = null, it wouldn't be read; at the same time, if a sighted user
  (whose browser supported javascript) clicked on the image, it would act
  as if it were a link. Without javascript, clicking the image would
  simply do nothing, but the text link would still work.

  Of course, this scenario would only apply if the image and the text link
  were exactly redundant, and when the layout of the page was preventing
  us from simply putting a single link element around both.

  Thoughts???
