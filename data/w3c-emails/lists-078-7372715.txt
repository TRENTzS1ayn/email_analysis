Somewhat better is:

.pseudoLink{cursor: pointer;}

<img src="image.gif" alt="" title="Link Text(or similar)" class="pseudoLink"
onclick="location='newpage.html';"><a href="newpage.html">Link Text</a>

You may wish to do something to deal with IE4 and IE5 using the non-standard
"hand" value for that cursor rather than the standard pointer (which
thankfully IE6 supports).

My suggestion isn't ideal, but would be an improvement on the above in
providing toolTip and hand-shaped cursor.
