Well, IRC is outdated in the sense that Unix is outdated.

Its benefits are that it works pretty well, there are lots of compatible
systems and servers and clients, etc.

(It is one of the tools that W3C uses a lot internally, and we also use it to
support access to meetings for people who have difficulty with the telephone
- hearing or speaking difficulties, bad phone lines, need to be able to read
what was said two minutes ago again, ...)

I know of blind users who have experience with an IRC client in emacs, using
emacspeak, an mIRC, a windows client. There are lots of others for different
situtations, and there is a client built into Mozilla that uses images for
some things...

cheers

  David,

  Thank you.  Have you used any of these systems.  IRC specifically? I have recently read that IRC is outdated, but the article that I read may be outdated itself.

  and some attempts have been aimed at making irc more pictorially
  available for these groups as well and the windows clients for irc have
  become fairly visually oriented but still remain at least to a great
  degree accessible to those not utillizing images.

  My very personal 2 cents worth:

  I would be extremely unhappy about a health-care related system that was
  inaccessible. If it were not possible to find an alternative I would, of
  course undertstand.

  Anyway, I think the most widely accessible chat system (except for
  people
  with significant intellectual disabilities, or difficulty typing and no
  voice
  input systems - both groups who are not well-served by most existing
  chat
  systems) is based on IRC - there are any number of clients, including
  some
  that work well with screen readers, some rudimentary attempts at
  producing
  them to work well for various other users, and it is available on
  virtually
  every software platform.

    I am looking for opinions and experiences on accessible chat rooms.



    I am in the market to purchase a chat program that could be used as an
  added feature on mostly health care related websites.

    Is there an accessible chat program that is currently on the market?
  Has anyone used accessible chat programs with a great ease of use?



    What would be your stance on a website that had a chat room that
  wasn't accessible to all users?  Do you just not have chat?  Or would
  you tolerate it?



    Thank you for your thoughts,

      wasn't suggesting that it be used for graphics, your right almost no
  way a
      person using a braille or text to speech reader could understand it.

      that is where the alt tag is handy

    OK, so it seems we are in agreement on that bit.

    OK, I think we are getting closer. ASCII is a way of encoding a
  particular
    set of characters - those used in American English. (Actually not all
    computers can use it - IBM computers used a different system for a
  long
    time...) There are equivalent systems for other kinds of characters -
  and
    Unicode (also called ISO-10646, or some other names) is the one most
  commonly
    recommended because it includes almost all characters used today, some
  no
    longer used, and some for only strange usages like the "klingon
  language"
    invented by fans of star trek. (In 64000 characters I guess the first
  few
    people to add their own silly ideas get to have a bit of space. I
  would
    have preferred Mayan, but there are probably more  speakers of
  Klingon!).
