I've just spent a good while trying to find something corresponding to
'Listen' using the Lynx browser, without success. The page source is a mass
of Javascript...

Is there a purpose for alt="" that I'm unaware of? It seems to occur a lot
on this page.

Good timing - the BBC today launched their first new music service in 32
years (and it's digital). Shame about the site.

Cheers,
Danny.

BTW, what on earth could be 'New!' about The Archers? Ed Grundy's got a
digital radio? Anthrax?
