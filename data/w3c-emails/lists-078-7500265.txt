Jim,

Is there an appropriate way to script the changing of location (e.g.
would window.location be correct?), or is it outside the scope of
appropriate scripting?

Mike

This would not cause the cursor to change to a hand in any current
browser/AT I know of, certainly future AT's would hopefully make
available the fact an onclick existed on the image.

document.location is also not an appropriate way of changing location.
location is normally a property of a window object, not a document.

Jim.
