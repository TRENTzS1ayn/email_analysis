    We've talked a few times about the problems of the common "image
    followed by text" link situation -- in particular, that we may want
to
    allow sighted users to click on either the image or text, but we'd
    rather avoid making screen reader users hear the same link text
  repeated
    twice (the image's alt text followed by the text link).

    What if we did something like this (HTML code follows):

    <img src="image.gif" alt=""
  onclick="document.location='newpage.html';">
    <a href="newpage.html">Link Text</a>

    (i.e., use a javascript "onclick" on the image to load the new page
if
    the image is clicked.)

    The image alt wouldn't show up in a screen reader's links list, and
  with
    alt = null, it wouldn't be read; at the same time, if a sighted user
    (whose browser supported javascript) clicked on the image, it would
  act
    as if it were a link. Without javascript, clicking the image would
    simply do nothing, but the text link would still work.

    Of course, this scenario would only apply if the image and the text
  link
    were exactly redundant, and when the layout of the page was
preventing
    us from simply putting a single link element around both.

    Thoughts???
