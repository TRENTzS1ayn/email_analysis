Hi. Thanks for your reply,

I'll stick to the specification, but I'll probably sleep
over this problem since the best solution seems to be
far from reach, still.

Nestcape6 and Lynx2.8 render the q element using delimiting
quotation marks for 3 languages (en, fr, pt) I had tested.

Netscape4.x and IE5.5 don't render any punctuation marks
for the q element.

I have also tested one brazilian freeware speech synthetizer
but it doesn't render any difference for the quotations.
Neither for the q element, nor the blockquote element.

I am working with a public library and we are converting
a few public domain books, already in digital format, from
MS.doc and .rtf to HTML.

Since I am working with old literature books, I did not wanted
to change the original style. For example, change the mdash
for quotations in favor of the quotation marks (american english
style).

I even thought about using something like:
<p>&mdash,<q>I had a great time in Venice</q></p>
So I could retain the original mdash and use the proper quotation
markup. But I've found some agents doesn't render de &mdash;
entity properly, since it is not ISOlatin1.

I guess I'll have to run a few more tests.

best regards,
