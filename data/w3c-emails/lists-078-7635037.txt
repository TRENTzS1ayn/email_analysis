As much as I dislike Excel, both from an accessibility viewpoint and from the 
fact that the computer arithmetic in Excel is (was anyway) severly flawed and 
should not be used for anything beyond hobby, it was an idea of the web to 
use content negotation, so that if both users have the same application, you 
exchange the original files, if not, you convert, either on the fly, or by 
converting the document you want to exchange when you create it. 

Using Apache, you could in principle do this by using different file endings, 
configure the server to serv content based on the Accept header, but then, I 
guess nobody is really using this feature, it isn't that customizable in 
browsers. Finally, Excel isn't one format, is it?

So, I would steer clear of Excel entirely... :-)
