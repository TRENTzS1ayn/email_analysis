Hmm. An alternative would be to mark these as blockquoutes (since they seem
to be a paragraph each, and have a style rule like the following:

blockquote.mdash:before { content: "--" ; margin: 0 }

(or something like that)

so for things marked

<blockquote class="mdash">blah blah blah</blockquote>
<blockquote class="mdash">foo bar thing</blockquote>

you get the right presentation, or just blocks (the common english language
approach, but obviously wrong for portuguese).

I am not sure  of the internationalisation aspect of that - I don't recall if
it is possible to apply per-language styles although I believe it is (maybe
just wishful thinking).

  Hi. Thanks for your reply,

  I'll stick to the specification, but I'll probably sleep
  over this problem since the best solution seems to be
  far from reach, still.

  Nestcape6 and Lynx2.8 render the q element using delimiting
  quotation marks for 3 languages (en, fr, pt) I had tested.

  Netscape4.x and IE5.5 don't render any punctuation marks
  for the q element.

  I have also tested one brazilian freeware speech synthetizer
  but it doesn't render any difference for the quotations.
  Neither for the q element, nor the blockquote element.

  I am working with a public library and we are converting
  a few public domain books, already in digital format, from
  MS.doc and .rtf to HTML.

  Since I am working with old literature books, I did not wanted
  to change the original style. For example, change the mdash
  for quotations in favor of the quotation marks (american english
  style).

  I even thought about using something like:
  <p>&mdash,<q>I had a great time in Venice</q></p>
  So I could retain the original mdash and use the proper quotation
  markup. But I've found some agents doesn't render de &mdash;
  entity properly, since it is not ISOlatin1.

  I guess I'll have to run a few more tests.

  best regards,
