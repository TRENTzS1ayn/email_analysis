Yep, agree to a point, but mixing percentages and pixles should be fine. I say this because when I was training to be a baker (a long time ago when I wasn't sure what I wanted to do) we used to create recipes in percentages as this gave the opportunity to work in grammes or pounds and ounces. Does it not work like that for pixels as well?

I would agree that mixing elements such as pixles and ems could cause problems, but percentages should actually help.

Just a thought...

Kind regards

Simon

This is kind of hypothetical, but it crossed my mind this morning.  

When you measure something, you stick to one type of unit.  Be it inches or
centimeters.  You don't mix the two, because it's not logical.

So why is it that we mix them on the web?  We set our screen resolution to
pixels.  Yet we have all of these other measurements such as points, ems and
percentages that screw things up.

We're mixing measurements, which you don't do in any other line of work.
Personally, it would be great if we could say our monitor was to appear in
ems, rather than pixels, but that's not how it works.  What I'm getting at
is wouldn't it be better if browsers just used pixel measurements?

Instead of IE giving keyword choices, what if it gave you the choice of
pixel sizes such as 800x600, which could then resize everything inside of
the browser window?  This is how Opera works, right?  Seems to me this would
eliminate a lot of confusion for developers, and make users happy too.

I should note that I have not read the User Agent Accessiblity Guidelines.
