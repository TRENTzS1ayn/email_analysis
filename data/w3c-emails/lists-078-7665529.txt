I'm working on a research project looking at web accessibility issues for
people with cognitive communication disabilities (specifically, aphasia).

The project is still in its early stages, but you might want to look at
this: http://dexter.shrs.uq.edu.au/cdaru/aphasiagroups/Aphasia_Friendly.html
This is from an Australian research project and gives some simple pointers.

Also, http://www.useit.com/papers/webwriting/writing.html gives some more
detailed and general pointers, but from research with non-disabled people.
This was written by one Jakob Nielsen, whoever he is :). Notice how well he
sticks to his own findings. Most of the conclusions that Morkes and Nielsen
have come up with seem to resonate well in our research.

To answer your original question, I haven't <grin>. A good example of
guidelines being as practically useful as a chocolate teapot. Hopefully 2.0
will have eventually have some more detailed information on writing and
language use.
