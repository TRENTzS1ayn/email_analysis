What you've done is redoubtable, but screen readers do not do java.

Hello there, if anyone is interested our IRC network's website at
http://www.blitzed.org/ is very accessible, I try for WAI double-A
compliance on all pages.

Although I'm aware that there are still one or two problems on some
pages (mostly down to other people not respecting the accessibility
rules), I am working to fix this currently.

Thank you
