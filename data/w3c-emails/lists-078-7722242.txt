Tom,

Again, the HTML version is not accessible. Another problem with chat rooms
is they go too damn fast, some refresh so fast that most screen-readers
can't keep up. Allowing the user to control the rate at which the screen
refreshes or manually refreshing the page may get around this. Also, the
order in which the messages are displayed may be very important to some
users.

HTH

Dave

Yes, but I can't really do much about that :/

The only thing I could recommend is CGI:IRC, which is a HTML-based IRC
client someone I know wrote available at
http://cgiirc.sourceforge.net/. We may integrate it into the site at
some point, I'm not sure how accessible we could make it though.
