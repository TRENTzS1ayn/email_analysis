Yep, sounds like your method is exactly what the checkpoint is asking for.

Have you considered writing it up as a technique for the WCAG group so the
WAI documents can be more helpful in future?

  I need some clarification of this ckeckpoint from WCAG:

  (7.5)
  "until user agents provide the ability to stop auto-redirect, do not
  use markup to redirect pages automatically. Instead, configure the
  server to perform redirects."

  What I need to know is, what exactly does "configure the server to
  perform redirects" mean? There is very little detail in the WAI
  documents about this checkpoint.

  I'm working on something where the redirects happen server side,
  using standard server side coding, rather than configuring the server
  to perform redirects - I'm not totally sure whether this method is
  within the checkpoint or not.
