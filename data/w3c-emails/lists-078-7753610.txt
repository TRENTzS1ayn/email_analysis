JAWS' behavior is user configurable. With it's default settings, JAWS 4+ 
does not read images will null alt text, but does read image links with 
null alt text. (David, have you manually set JAWS to "read all" for images, 
or did you find that your default settings were different than described 
above?)

I wonder if it is a technical issue of the way the alt information is 
revealed to/discovered by JAWS. Maybe it can't technically tell the 
difference between alt that is null because it is set using alt="" (quote-
quote) or null because it hasn't been set at all.
