location="newlocation.html"

Is safe in that it will not error in any browser I know of, and it will
work in almost all of them.  It won't work in certain NN4's which require
location.href="..." but that won't work in certain scenarios in IE6's
when you'll crash it, location.href would also mean you'd need to check
the location object existed for a couple of obscure browsers.

It's not reliable of course, but then no javascript is and we can't be
relying on javascript at all.

Such things aren't standardised anywhere, but obviously browser agreement
is pretty universal on calling the global object window and having a
location object.

Jim.
