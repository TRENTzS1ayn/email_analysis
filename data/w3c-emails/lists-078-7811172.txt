I received information about Neo Messenger through email.  The product
description from the website I have copied to this reply below.  I have
no problem accessing the website at http://www.neomessenger.com .  More
information is available there.  I was just wondering if anyone on the
list has used this product.

Neo Messenger --
Instant Messaging is an integral part for any e-business to attract
repeat hits on a website. NeoMessenger offers a complete suite of
pricing fit for every budget.

Instant Messenger facilitates visitors of a website to be better
connected with each other. Unlike emails it sends out messages instantly
to other members of a community. Online members know about presence of
their fellow members and can initiate a chat at anytime with each other.

With neomessenger, a webmaster can start his own instant messaging
service on his site in minutes. neomessenger is based on ASP model, so
you do not have to worry about any hardware or software, you do not have
to have a heavy MIS budget or technical team or maintenance. The
application runs on our server so you never have to worry about the
upgrades as all the upgrades are done on our server which become
available to you instantly.

*Done some research on this and the only mention of 
*Neomessenger that I can find on the Net is to do with a 
*keychain where you can record a voice for up to 15 seconds. I 
*don't think this is what you are talking about here Ken, could 
*you possibly let us know where you got this information from?

*Kind regards
