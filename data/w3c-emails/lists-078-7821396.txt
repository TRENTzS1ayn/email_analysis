this issue is being worked.  If I ask for all images, it should tell me
that there is nothing in the alt tag not give me the file name.

JAWS' behavior is user configurable. With it's default settings, JAWS 4+
does not read images will null alt text, but does read image links with
null alt text. (David, have you manually set JAWS to "read all" for
images,
or did you find that your default settings were different than described
above?)

I wonder if it is a technical issue of the way the alt information is
revealed to/discovered by JAWS. Maybe it can't technically tell the
difference between alt that is null because it is set using alt=""
(quote-
quote) or null because it hasn't been set at all.
