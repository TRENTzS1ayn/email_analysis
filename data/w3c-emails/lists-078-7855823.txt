Although pages that redirect on entry fail some of the WCAG guidelines,
location.replace(....) is better in that context as, to the extent it
works - and this sort of redirect is often the result of browser 
sniffing - it doesn't break the back button.  Obviously, if you are
simulating a real link, you do want to push the history stack, so
this is not appropriate in that context.
