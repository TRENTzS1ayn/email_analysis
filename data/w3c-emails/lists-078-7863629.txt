Hello Chaals,

The blockquote alternative seems to fit better for may case.
Although I am having some trouble with the content atribute.
This is CSS2, am I wrong?

I guess I will start using the follwing approach, (that seems
to be more stable)

blockquote.mdash { margin-left:0 }

<blockquote class="mdash">&#8212; I had a great time in Venice</blockquote>
<blockquote class="mdash">&#8212; I thought you had traveled to France</blockquote>

I will be running more tests with another screen reader
that is used by a large percentage of my target audience
and I will see if I can validate or not the mdash entity.

Thanks for your help,
