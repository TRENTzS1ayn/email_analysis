From time to time, I've seen discussions and participated in them
concerning things like empty or null alt tags, legend for field sets in
forms and other related topics.  We face two challenges.  One challenge
we face is that the targets we are shooting at are moving both on the
assistive and main stream side and the other challenge we face is that
even though for instance, the legend problem may go away if you use a
piece of at, when will it go away for a wide enough audience that it can
be considered a non issue?

I would hope for two things to happen.  One thing I would hope for are
newer and more intelegent user agents that can parse code that may be a
bit fuzzy in its meaning in ways that at can handle it clearly and I
would hope development tools that provide more clarity in development.
I would also hope that a day will come when it is possible to use an
agent by choice rather than by default according to our at needs.  I
think that pwweb speak was actually headed in the right direction and it
would be quite good if other apps could integrate the at from the ground
up.
