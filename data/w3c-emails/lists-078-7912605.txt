Hi,

I've been delayed in getting this notice out but this is to inform you
all that I have not dropped off the face of the earth as you may have
gathered by now but to advise you that if you sent me a private message
from feb 25 through march 1 and have not gotten an answer, it is most
likely due to the fact that my new providor dumped some 400 messages off
their server from my account.

Please feel free to write me again if you have not recieved an answer
and if you have not written me, it's ok now to do so if you like because
we've solved the email difficulties for now at least.

 Thanks for your understanding in this matter.
