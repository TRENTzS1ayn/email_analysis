The above page is by no means one of the worst offenders, at least if
we allow that their promotional video is not essential content, but
I'm going to sound off anyway...

Why can't people who purport to educate on web accessibility at
least practice what they preach?  This one, like so many others,
fails at the very first hurdle: it delivers invalid HTML, leaving
it to the vagaries of a browser to patch up the mess.

And - oh the irony - at the bottom of the page in smallprint that becomes
legible only by viewing the source,
"If you notice any accessibility errors on this site, please tell us!"
