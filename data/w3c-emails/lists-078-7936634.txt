Our designers are often asked to develop interfaces that feature rollovers using JAVASCRIPT. One of the popular requests is for the rollover effect to display a list of items which expands on the information that sits behind the link. The idea being that authors can have just a few main links from the home page, but users can easily find the deeper links by rolling over each button and viewing the list of links associated with each button.
The designers can ensure the major links are accessible by providing alternative text for each button and ensuring that there are redundant links that can be accessed via keyboard control. However, is there any way of making the more detailed information that is only displayed with the rollover also available in browsers with JAVASCRIPT disabled and for keyboard users and the visually impaired. 
The alt attribute could work but would be an unacceptable length for alt text. Longdesc is not supported by all browsers. Any ideas?

Thanks
