It formally complies with HTML specifications up to and including HTML 4.01,
but XHTML 1.0 makes closing tags obligatory for all elements.

On the practical side, some widely used browsers still choke on some
constructs when the "optional" closing tags for table cells are omitted. The
effects vary from completely messing up table presentation to just ignoring
some CSS rules. In a word, it is poor economy to save those precious bytes.

This is basically about good HTML authoring principles in general, so it's
something that might be best discussed in the Usenet group
news:comp.infosystems.www.authoring.html . Naturally, good authoring has an
impact on accessibility too, especially since if a page gets all messed up,
people will disabilities will often have great difficulties since they
probably cannot switch browser as easily as other people might.
