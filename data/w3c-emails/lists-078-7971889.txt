It is compliant with HTML, but not with XHTML. In other words you will be
backwards compatible still, but not forwards compatible. It saves bytes over
the network, at the cost of kilobytes in browser size, meaning more expensive
systems are required to read it.

(One of the reasons why phone systems all work on XML is that it can be used
in a smaller computer, and phones have small computers in them)

This is the classic chicken and egg problem that plagues accessibility, in
one of its easier forms. If developers do not produce forwards-compatible
code, then there is little point in having newer systems that are designed to
take advantage of design improvements. So the relatively expensive work of
developing accessible systems that take advantage of that will have a tiny
market.

In cases like this, unless bandwidth is a really extremely critical concern I
would recommend including the extra bytes. (And at $5/minute for a 9600 baud
connection I would still rather be sure that the code I am getting is going
to work on my system - the bytes saved are a lot fewer than if I download
half a page before finding out it  is no good to me)

   probably  to  safe  some  precious  bytes. and browser don't seems to
   care. is it still html compliant?
