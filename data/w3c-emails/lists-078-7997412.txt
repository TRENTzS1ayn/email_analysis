Yep, this is a good answer...

(the problem with having both the CSS and the dash included directly is that
in a browser that does CSS you will get repetition of the dash. You could
avoid it with something like

<q><span class="forBrokenCSS">&#8210;</span>blah blah blah</q>

and

  q:lang(pt)
  {
  quotes: '&#8210; ' '' '' ''
  .forBrokenCSS { display: none }
  }

to make it a bit more bugwards-compatible.)

cheers

  You can try this CSS:

  {
  quotes: '&#8210; ' '' '' ''
  }

  That's figure dash plus space, then nothing, nothing, nothing (for
  opening outer, closing outer, opening inner, closing inner,
  respectively).
