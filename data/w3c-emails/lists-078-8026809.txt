I would like to clarify that the City of San Jose accessible web design
standard was in place in 1996 and that the version of the standard posted at
ICDRI was as of March 1997.  This was one of the earlier versions that
evolved as we addressed difficult policy issues for implementation.

Best regards,
Cynthia Waddell
