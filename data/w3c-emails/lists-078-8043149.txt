Not only do the browsers have to be more complicated and expensive in terms
of footprint, download time, and development cost, but they will still take
longer to render such constructs.
Back in the day when </p> was optional (and worse - many browsers treated
</p> as significant) I speeded up some heavy pages (around 80k-150k for just
the HTML - don't ask!) by putting the optional </p> tags in. Even over a
28.8 on a bad phone line (generally functioning at around 20kbps) the time
from start of download to rendering of page was appreciably improved (can't
give an exact time as it was obviously faster and I didn't need to know
beyond that).
