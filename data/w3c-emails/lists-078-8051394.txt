(original message reinserted)
 i've seen google don't close <tr> and <td> tags with </tr> and </td>.
 probably  to  safe  some  precious  bytes. and browser don't seems to
 care. is it still html compliant?

This makes sense (though slightly counter-intuitive) - if the tags aren't
closed then the browser will have to keep piling the data onto a stack until
it can be (reasonably) sure of each block's intended endpoint, which in an
extreme case might mean getting right to the end of the doc and having to
backtrack all the way through to build the structure. Big memory/processor
cost. Come on Google, close them tags!

Cheers,
Danny.
