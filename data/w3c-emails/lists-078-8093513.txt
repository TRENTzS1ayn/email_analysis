Hi all

my colleagues and I are having trouble getting a longdesc for a car parking
map correct. The URI is below and we *know* that there are certain things
wrong (such as using reference numbers from the map in the description) but
we would really appreciate it if some AT/screenreader users could give us
some input. Many thanks in advance.
