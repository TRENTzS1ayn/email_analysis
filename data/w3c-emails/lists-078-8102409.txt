Well, I don't use much AT (does an external mouse and large fonts count?) but
as atypically text-only user who drives to car parks I would be looking for
street names and intersection information - carpark is at carver ste=reet,
between city hall and johnson st, etc.

  Hi all

  my colleagues and I are having trouble getting a longdesc for a car parking
  map correct. The URI is below and we *know* that there are certain things
  wrong (such as using reference numbers from the map in the description) but
  we would really appreciate it if some AT/screenreader users could give us
  some input. Many thanks in advance.
