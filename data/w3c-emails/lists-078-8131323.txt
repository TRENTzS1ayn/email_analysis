Thank you David for your extremely detailed and thorough response to my request for assistance re JAVASCRIPT rollovers. Thanks also Russell - and yes that does makes sense. I will certainly retain these suggestions for future reference as we have had requests for this kind of rollover pop-up window selection method in the past.
However in this case the requirement is less complicated. The rollover displays a list of items  relevant to the link but these items are not selectable - they are just additional descriptive information aimed at informing the user about the selection. Hence my request for advice about an alternative to providing lengthy alt attributes or longdesc for each selectable button. In this case, the rollover effect is an alternative graphic image displayed that provides detailed information about the link rather than just a simple alternative visual effect such as highlighter or whatever.
