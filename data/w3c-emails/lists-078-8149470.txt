My response:

Thank you, Nick, for taking the time to evaluate the accessibility of
this page.

I am not the developer directly in charge of the training or the page
that you reference, but I am the Technology Coordinator for WebAIM, so I
have taken it upon myself to answer your concerns.


1. I'm not sure why you complain about the use of video on the site,
since all of the video is captioned, a full transcript is available, an
audio-only format is available (with descriptions), three video formats
are available, two bandwidth options are available for each format, and
links are provided to help files for those who are unfamiliar with these
plug-ins. It seems that we have covered all of the bases here. If you
are going to complain, please do so based on accurate information, so
that you do not misrepresent us in a public forum.

2. At WebAIM we always strive to have valid HTML in our documents. This
is a high priority for me. Unfortunately, a couple of errors were
inadvertently introduced, which we have corrected. Thanks for pointing
that out.

3. Yes, we do have a link at the bottom of the page which asks people to
inform us of any accessibility errors. You are right that the link was
too small. I have enlarged it. I decided to leave the rest of the
copyright information in the smaller font still, because it is not
central to the page content.

Lastly, considering the fact that we do have a link which invites you to
inform us of any accessibility concerns that you might have, why did you
not use it? We are more than willing to respond to these concerns. If we
were not subscribed to this list, we would not have heard your concerns
and would not have been able to address them. Next time, please contact
us directly.
