I finally understand. Can we then have a link on the page that shows the
list?

Thank you David for your extremely detailed and thorough response to my
request for assistance re JAVASCRIPT rollovers. Thanks also Russell -
and yes that does makes sense. I will certainly retain these suggestions
for future reference as we have had requests for this kind of rollover
pop-up window selection method in the past.
However in this case the requirement is less complicated. The rollover
displays a list of items  relevant to the link but these items are not
selectable - they are just additional descriptive information aimed at
informing the user about the selection. Hence my request for advice
about an alternative to providing lengthy alt attributes or longdesc for
each selectable button. In this case, the rollover effect is an
alternative graphic image displayed that provides detailed information
about the link rather than just a simple alternative visual effect such
as highlighter or whatever.
