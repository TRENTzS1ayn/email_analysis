I apologise for being unduly harsh.  I've been on a rather short fuse
for the past few days for (thankfully temporary) health reasons.

Looking at your page I saw three forms of movie, and by the time I
discovered the transcript (why is it 1.7Mb .. oh, that's something else)
I was already geared up to flame you:-(  I see you've now moved it
to be a little more obvious.

Yes.  Call me a cynic, but when I see that much packaging, I tend to
dismiss the idea that there might also be a worthwhile product.  Like
the old adage whose expression today might be "if you have nothing to
say, then say it with powerpoint".

IMNSHO it's far better to ensure that your pages are automatically
validated (BTW, you have now introduced a new validation error).
Better still to use publishing tools that guarantee good markup.
See for example <URL:http://css.nu/markup/markup-entities.html>
for an illustration of why validation is necessary but not sufficient.

Long experience of being ignored - together with a "damned if I'm going to
use a link I can't read in my browser" attitude.

Anyway, FWIW, Page Valet issues a number of accessibility warnings
for your page.  My assessment of those is that the ones at single-A
can probably be ignored, but you'd clearly need to fix that
presentational markup to earn a double- or triple-A.
