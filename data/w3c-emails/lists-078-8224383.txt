Denise,

Hello. To add to Randal's mail.  We just developed a site with that very feature that he mentioned.  The client wanted rollovers with a hierarchal drop down menu.  Here is what we did instead http://www.healthysmilesforwi.org.  Once you click on one of the main nav bar links, the sub links are on that inner page.  

Or you you goto our home page http://www.ichp.edu
you will see something similar.  Click on one of the TOP links only (with the triangle arrows), and you will see drop down links.

Christian

An alternative would be to add a submenu to each page that duplicates what
is on the popup menus.

Let's say you have a Menu Item called "Company," and when you roll over it,
a menu pops up with four subselections.

If Javascript is disabled, then the popup doesn't appear.  So if the user
clicks on "Company," then they should go to the Company page, which should
have a submenu on it with the four subselections that are avialable in the
popup menu to a user with Javascript turned on.  Make sense?
