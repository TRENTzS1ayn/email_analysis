Hi Everyone,

We're writing  the HTML code for the forms of our website, and would like
some advice on how to best make the forms accessible.

What is the proper way to code a description for a form field?

Option 1:
<LABEL for="color">What is your favorite color?</LABEL>
<INPUT type="text" name="color"  id="color">

Option 2:
What is your favorite color?
<INPUT type="text" name="color" id="color" title="What is your favorite
color?>

Option 3:
<LABEL for="color">What is your favorite color?</LABEL>
<INPUT type="text" name="color" id="color" title="What is your favorite
color?>

...or something else?

Thanks so much for your help!

Warmly,
Hy
