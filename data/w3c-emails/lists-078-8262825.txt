Oops, hadn't even considered that. The alt text associated with those image
links is actually the direction that the arrow points in but I guess that a
more appropriate bit of text would be "move east" or "go east of here" or
something similar since this is essentially what the image says. The title
property for those links could (should!) give more details as to what's
happening. Also, since that whole map is a series of images held tightly
together in a table (we tried cssp, honest) it doesn't really make as much
sense when it's linearised. Hmmm.

I think a mixture of Chaal's street intersection idea and Simon's landmarks
will end up being used but this is going to be a long job for someone ;-)
[It may be easier to get all the car parks closed !!]


Oh, Simon, fyi the guy who wrote about the 'Gary' band is dyslexic and I
think we should consider ourselves unfortunate that his spelling mistake
this time was actually a viable word; normally it's quite easy for us to
spot them ;-) (Must have a word about spelling grey with an 'a' though
-that's just not British!!) 

[Everybody, please note that I'm not poking fun at dyslexics; I have a
couple of extremely close friends who not only have trouble with spelling
but also have an innate independence and drive to succeed that fills me with
admiration. I'm sure they wouldn't mind me writing about them in this list
like this.]


regards 

Julian
