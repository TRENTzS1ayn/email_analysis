The W3C is in the process of reworking the look and feel of the email archives a bit.  To ensure that the access aspects of the archive are as good as we can reasonably make them within the effort that is available to rebuild the archiving software; drafts of the redesign are to be discussed on the wai-xtech list.  See my recent post in the archives of that list for further information on where the reviewable materials are etc.
