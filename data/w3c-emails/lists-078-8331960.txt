the IWA/HWG do an online one run by Kynn Bartlett. I can thoroughly
recommend it but not sure about accreditation. As far as Uni courses go I
think they are pretty thin on the ground. I was told by a person from the
Government's E-Envoy Office that they had looked at this and the inclusion
of accessibility on web design/development courses was worringly low. A
colleague of mine is doing a course at Sheffield Uni and is trying to get
the tutors to include accessibility in next years syllabus. 

btw the bit about not being able to mutli-task is an urban myth. I am quite
succesfully, at this very moment, getting paid for doing a job, drinking a
cup of tea *and* answering a completley non-work related post to a public
mailing list ;-) (and last time I looked I was male!)
