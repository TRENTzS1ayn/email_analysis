As I would hope computing departments at higher educational institutions
across the world do, Dundee University's  Applied Computing undergraduate
and postgraduate courses include a strong emphasis on accessible and usable
design of software, including web sites, and we encourage student projects
in that area. But we don't offer a specific Accessible Web Design course.

Simon, can I ask whether your request is as a result of a need to prove to
potential clients a professional or academic qualification in accessible
design, or is the enquiry more from the aim of validating a CV or resume?

It would be very interesting to hear that there are organisations putting
design jobs out to contract who are now demanding from interested parties
evidence of accessible design expertise in the form of formal
qualifications!

Best wishes,
David
