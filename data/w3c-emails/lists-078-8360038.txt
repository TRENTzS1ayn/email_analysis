its a lovely idea, there has been some talk of wai running a course, but I
don't think details were ever finalised
take a look at:
http://www.iwaguild.com/cgi-bin/sql/pullout.cgi?template=listing/course_info
.htm&listing.ID=0008140
or
http://www.hwg.org/
they probably aren't what you're after, but worth a look
