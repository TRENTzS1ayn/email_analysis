This isn't exactly what you're looking for, because of the location, but
I'll respond to the list anyway in case others are interested. 

GW Solutions (a division of George Washington University) in the US is
offering a continuing ed certificate program in usability and
accessibility. They're still working on the distance learning side of
it, I believe; the first scheduled class on accessibility in a classroom
setting is either this month or early next month.

Subject: Recognised courses in Web Accessibility?


Hi all,
Does anyone know of a course offered at an educational establishment
that covers Web accessibility issues and how to overcome them? I am
particularly interested in UK-based courses, unless there are distance
learning ones available to UK residents. The reason that I ask is that
there does not appear to be any way in which I can prove my knowledge
prior to taking on a project, and also I would like to learn in a more
structured way.

I am aware of the course offered through WebAIM, but this is not
affiliated to a degree or similar. I've done a search and found that
York University offers something, but it is not quite what I require as
they tend to be leaning towards developers rather than general interest
such as I have - I mean, I can code a bit, but not to a level required
to do it full time without having to catch up in a big way.

If there are courses aimed at developers only, I am still interested; it
would just mean that I would have to ultimately learn about two subjects
concurrently and I am sure that the male species is not good at
multitasking (at least that is what the TV adverts suggest) *grin*

Thanks in advance
