Hi All, 

www.ntlworld.com uses drop down menus at the top of the page which I can't
read under large font settings and IE5.5. It appears that each item in the
menu is positioned using fixed values and so the next item in the menu
obscures the previous one up to the bottom of the list.

Problem is I'm not exactly sure how it's producing these menus and so can't
fix them. Assuming it's using CSS is there anyway that I can override this
fixed position in my stylesheet?

Many thanks in advance
Cheers
Ian
