I am particularly interested in UK-based courses, unless there are distance learning ones available to UK residents. The reason that I ask is that there does not appear to be any way in which I can prove my knowledge prior to taking on a project, and also I would like to learn in a more structured way.

  Hello Simon. Might I suggest that you contact the RNIB, and check to see
  if they might know of someone or some establishment that could be able to
  help you ?
