If you really want to make the page accessible...

Adding this to your user stylesheet seems to do a reasonable job...

.itemBorder { top:0px !important;position:relative !important;height:2em
!important }

it changes the position to relative, removes the top position and forces
the height to 2em, itemBorder is perhaps a common classname though so it
may effect other pages.
