One of the most annoying things about getting these kinds of media
coverage is that without fail, nearly anyone who interviews me (or
anyone else for that matter) on web accessibility will post the
article on a site with serious accessibility problems.

I am happy the news is getting out there, but I am discouraged that
it takes so long to sink in, even as people are championing the
cause.
