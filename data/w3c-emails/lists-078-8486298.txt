...to add to Randal's mail.  We just developed a site with that very feature that he mentioned.  The client wanted rollovers with a hierarchal drop down menu.  Here is what we did instead http://www.healthysmilesforwi.org.  Once you click on one of the main nav bar links, the sub links are on that inner page.  

Thanks Christian and Randal

Yes I understand what you are suggesting and that is how we have tackled most situations requiring sub-menus to be displayed from the main page. However, as per my last email, the particular cases to which I am referring are not sub-menus displayed as the mouse rolls-over the options, but rather, graphic text elaborating and expanding on the information relevant to the link. The idea is that users can "see" what sub-menu items exist in the particular section prior to making the selection. An example of what I am describing is here: http://www.library.unisa.edu.au/
As you can see the buttons have alt text but to apply this principle for each alternate rollover image would require unacceptably long alt text to capture all of the descriptive information.
David (P) thanks for your suggestion of a link on the page to show the list. The concern with that is the additional "clutter" on the screen as there would need to be links for each button to show the expanded information for each possible selection.

Thanks to everyone who has contributed to this discussion thus far.
