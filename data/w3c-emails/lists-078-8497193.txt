What Jim says is right -- but it just illustrates why there is a problem
with CSS and user style sheets to begin with. Without knowing HTML and
CSS in detail, and knowing how to set up a user style sheet, the end
user can't take advantage of the features of the cascade meant to protect
the user's interests.

This is something I hope to address if I ever get FUSSY (Free User
Style Sheet for You) off the groud, but geez, I need more time in the
day! :)
