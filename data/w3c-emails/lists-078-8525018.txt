judy has kindly reminded me of http://www.w3.org/WAI/training/
which whilst at first might not seem ideal, does link to many useful
resources.
and of course reading (with understanding and practice) primary sources such
as wcag and the training resources
here: http://www.w3.org/WAI/Resources/Overview.html#gl
will lend you credence and authority.
