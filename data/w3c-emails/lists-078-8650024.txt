>Hi All --
>
>NISO has posted the Z39.86-2002 DTB standard on their website, in HTML
>and PDF formats.  It is also available for purchase in print form for
>$99 (although the print version won't be available for several weeks).
> It is listed as the last standard in NISO's chronological list of
>approved and published standards at www.niso.org/standards/index.html. 
>Currently, there is no capability to list HTML versions, since ours is
>the first offered by NISO in that format, so click on the "Z39.86 
>Resources" link on that page to access the HTML.  They will be adding
>a properly-labeled link for the HTML version shortly.
>
>The direct urls for the two formats are:
>www.niso.org/standards/resources/z3986-2002.html
>
>www.niso.org/standards/resources/z3986-2002.pdf
>
>As the Maintenance Agency for Z39.86 (responsible for coordinating
>updates and corrections to the standard), the National Library Service
>for the Blind and Physically Handicapped (NLS), Library of Congress will
>host supplementary information about the standard and its use on its
>website at www.loc.gov/nls/z3986.  (The old url www.loc.gov/nls/niso
>will also work.)  Current versions of all the DTDs contained in the
>standard, background on their development, and a number of documents
>created during development of the standard are posted there.
>
>Kind Regards,
