Hi Kathleen, you are up early this Saturday morning. Oops you are on
eastern time <smile>.

Interesting point and I will relook at that. The issues I am seeing are
how novice people set up and use frontpage to work for them, more
specifically the web components.  I can point uou to church sites that
allow lay people to drop documents into the folder and it gets posted.
Unfortunately these methods do not get rendered properly and fail
validation miserably.  These methods are allowed under frontpage. I
would think these things would be seemless.  These are the web sites
that are being highly used by a large cottage population.

I have another personal beef with frontpage.  On the box it states asp
is supported, however, in the preview the content for the active server
page includes are not rendered.  Unless someone know different, here is
the code for the include:

<!-- #include file="includes/L0/L0_masthead-2.asp" -->

I have to go to take another step to make see this by going to the web
server if you have XP or Windows 2000 Pro where it may not render
properly or ftp to the test server.

These may be issues for the authoring group so my apologies if I have
over stayed my welcome here. Plus I think its how the authoring tools
view the rendered code - not sure.

Would like to hear how other tools like macromedia and adobe handle
includes and special functionality.


Remember, Frontpage does provide great functionality if you use the
server  extensions and I really like this.  This is a great way for the
web to be used by more people at home and small businesses.  I do not
like the problems with rendered code or the lack of viewing.  So I am
being negative on a good product because it falls short in two areas -
otherwise it's a great tool for someone in a small business who cannot
afford all the development tools and THEIR constant upgrades and the
configuration management tools to manage file corrections.

Hi Robert:
We use the FrontPage Include Component on just about every page on this
site: http://www.cmac.state.ct.us/access/   and have no problem getting
it to validate against the HTML 4.01 transitional spec.

Kathleen
