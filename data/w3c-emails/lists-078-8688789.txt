Hello all,

For people with low vision i recommand to use Opera 6. This browser can
linearize tables and switch easily between viewing graphics and alt text.
You can also easily switch between orginal CSS and your CSS.

If you use your CSS, you can magnify content at the desired level for
reading confort.

I have created to CSS, one positive and one negative, and use them
simultaneously with linearizing tables.

If someone is interested to see CSS. Write me and i'll send you.

Regards,

Jean-Marie D'Amour, M.Ed.
