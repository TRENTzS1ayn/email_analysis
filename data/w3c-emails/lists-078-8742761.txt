It seems that attribute selectors, like in
[lang |= "en"] { ... }
are somewhat better supported.

But unless I'm missing something, such use of attribute selectors implies
some restrictions. The selector [lang |= "en"] matches only those elements
that themselves have an explicit lang attribute (with a value that begins
with "en"), not an element that inherits the lang attribute from its
enclosing element (parent).

However, _some_ per-language styling is thus possible, on some browsers.
