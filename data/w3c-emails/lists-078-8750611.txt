I think we all share that feeling, and we've discussed some technical
drawbacks too, e.g., the alt text is real text to several search engines.

But there's hardly anything essentially better that we could do, except
complete reorganization (put navigation onto a separate page, and you'll
need just one navigational link; or put navigation at the bottom of the
page, optionally with a link to it at the start of a page).

I'm afraid we can't realistically expect that to work now or in the near
future. Even if we got modern user agents that actually implement aural
style sheets, there would be lots of people still using older software -
including even arrangements like Lynx plus a speech synthesizer that uses
Lynx output as its input.
