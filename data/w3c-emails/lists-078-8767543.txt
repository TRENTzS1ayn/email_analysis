There are still going to be problems with implementation of the logic in the style implementations.  But there is a prior problem.  Your statement of the page functionality you are trying for is backwards.  You can simplify the stylesheet logic and clean up your functionality at the same time.

The idea of "speech-only links" is ethically repugnant.  What lies are you telling the speech user that you are unwilling to have someone else be told?

Under the current draft User Agent Guidelines [Guideline 2, particularly Checkpoint 2.3] this content has to be discoverable by any user whether you thought they would want it or not.

Think in terms of "screen-only hiding" instead, as an optional optimization, and you will get the stylesheet logic right and understand the authoring groundrules for these links.  These links are to be valid, but OK to hide under some circumstances.  Not _only applicable_ under some circumstances.  You want

@media screen ... display: none

not 

@media aural  ... display: some

This is the logic for fail-soft design.  The content is valid content and the hiding is a hint, a situation-specific default optimization.  Then you're OK.
