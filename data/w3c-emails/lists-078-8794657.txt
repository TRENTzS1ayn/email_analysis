Harsh language Al, and I think you are wrong here, though I'm willing to be 
convinced otherwise. First, I'm not telling any lies. I'm attempting--key 
word, attempting--to provide some navigation shortcuts to non-sighted 
visitors  who use some form of screen reading technology. The visually hidden 
links are not necessary or useful to most of the sighted. In this particular 
case I'm trying to make the navigation through a crowded three column 
collapsed table as easy for a blind person as a sighted person. Take a look 
and have at me again if you like: http://www.joneslibrary.org

N.B. Off list I've been rightly taken to task because my coding so far does 
nothing for people who can see but not use a mouse!
