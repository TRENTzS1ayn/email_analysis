Hi Randal,

The case of Hooks v OKBridge is kind of complicated. The quotes that 
you included are not from the decision - there never was one, the 
matter was, I think, dismissed by the court on other grounds. What you 
were quoting from was the letter from the Department of Justice which 
is automatically consulted for an opinion as to what the law is (again 
my memory is hazy - it could have been a different department).

As such their submission to the court stated that they thought a Web 
site did come within the ADA and I believe that these submissions are 
legally binding statements of the law, which the court would then have 
to follow.

However, because the case was dismissed by the court later on in 
proceedings, this DoJ submission is not legally binding as the court 
never had the opportunity to follow it and adopt it.

Had the case not been dismissed then it would probably have been 
America's Maguire v SOCOG. However, at least we now know that if and 
when the DoJ is asked again for its opinion we can probably guess what 
it'll be.

The DoJ's view partly relies on an earlier case called Carparts v 
Automotive Wholesalers of New England (http://harp.org/carparts.txt) 
which was the case which decided that for the purposes of the ADA there 
was no reason to differentiate between a service provider that operated 
out of a shop and one who was telephone-based.

(I apologise if there are any errors in the above as I can't find my 
notes, but that is the general gist of what happened)
