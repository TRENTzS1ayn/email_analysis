Yeah, I can confirm that now I've found my folder. The case was rejected on 
the grounds that the defendant was unaware of Mr Hooks' disability.

There was an article in Washington Technology Online by Michael Mason 
(http://206.144.247.77/cgi-bin/udt/im.display.printable?client.id=wtonli  
ne-test&story.id=1815 for the printer friendly/accessible version) which 
discussed the Justice Department's 'friend of the court' brief, but was 
written before the case was rejected.

The only source I have about the case being dismissed was a post to this 
mailing list from Gregg Vanderheiden on Dec 29 2000 - but I don't know 
where that came from 
(http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/2000OctDec/0608.html).
