Hi,
Has anyone played with stylesheets to render SVG data down to good ol' html
image maps?
Whilst looking at some XSLT that went the other way around [1], it occurred
to me that this might be useful in situations where an SVG viewer wasn't
available and/or there was an assistive technology that could make some
sense of an image map but would baulk at SVG.

Cheers,
Danny.
