I am looking for a list of javascript commands in order
to see what it will take to bring at least some javascript
functionality to lynx.

Probably what I need  are javascript commands for
Netscape since it is not as proprietary as Microsoft Internet
Explorer commands.

My goals are bear bones functionality regarding the
navigation of links to start with.  I have seen a number of sites
that would probably work reasonably well with the lynx browser if only the
navigation and selection of links worked.

I would like to at least get things to the point where
something happens when one selects a link on a site that uses
javascript.  Many times, the underlying pages are straight html
but the links are relative links and the lynx browser doesn't
know what to do with them.

That is my goal for now.
We'll worry about what still doesn't work after the links work
and so on.

This all reminds me of a huge tangle of string or wire
that doesn't go anywhere until one finds just the right part of
the knot and it all begins to straighten out.
