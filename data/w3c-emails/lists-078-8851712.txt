core javascript is defined by the ECMAScript standard, IE6 and Netscape
6.1 are fully compliant bar bugs of which there aren't many.  If you're
bringing it lynx, then SeaMonkey is your obvious choice which is the
engine that Mozilla uses.

What you're actually talking about is the Document Object Model, of which
Netscape 4 is probably more proprietary and Netscape 6 less, however
there is a standard as defined by w3.org.  For Lynx support though the
most important and applicaple part is the so called DOM 0, which is not a
standard (or even a recommendation), but is extremely well supported by a
great many browsers.

Indeed, implementing the location object and the window.open object -
neither of which are in any standard, would open a huge number of very
poorly authored sites.

Personally I find Microsofts documentation the clearest:
for example, you'd want this object:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/author/dhtml/reference/objects/obj_loc
ation.asp
and window.open:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/author/dhtml/reference/objects/obj_win
dow.asp
and:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/author/dhtml/reference/methods/write.a
sp

(the functionality of those objects are basically fixed across all
javascript capable browsers other than window.open, however a window open
which provided links would be very useful.

Implementing those 3  would open up the majority of pages,  next would
probably be a form.submit() to cope with forms you can't otherwise
submit.

It's DOM 0 you need and all browsers have implemented it pretty much the
same, so look for documentation that you find friendly.

Jim.
