There is that!

The Netscape 4 documentation is rather flawed though IMO, as it confuses
core/object model and other things:

http://docs.iplanet.com/docs/manuals/javascript.html

has it though.

There's also:
Opera's   http://www.opera.com/docs/specs/js/
iCab's:   http://www.muchsoft.com/inscript/
