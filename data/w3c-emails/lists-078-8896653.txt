Using document.all has some very sensible arguments, it's supported by
all capable browsers bar Netscape including iCab, IceStorm, Konquerer,
Opera, and IE4 a huge number. and with appropriate object detection can
cause no errors, the arguments (which I support) for using DOM1 are
purely standards based rather than any expectation of working for the
most users.  In any case as using W3's DOM still requires using
proprietary the requirement to use standards is slightly flawed.

Yes, but mapping the location object to links in the page would solve
that, even give you a choice, no need to implement any of those features.
