That would seem problematic in the general case.

Rendering of static images is fine, for such situations, but I would
be reluctant to go too far down the imagemap /sliced table / ton of
javascript route because it dumbs down what SVG is capable of and, if
lots of effort is put into it, merely delays the general rollout of
SVG. And the result tends to be wildly inaccessible, slow, heavy, and
of poor quality.

That seems unlikely, and contrary to UAAG guidelines. A real,
interoperable XML DOM is a far better bet for an assistive technology
that either screenscraping or a problematic and browser-dependent,
undefined, 'HTML DOM Level 0'.
