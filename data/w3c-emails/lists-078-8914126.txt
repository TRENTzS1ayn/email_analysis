Hi Chris,

Very true.

Urrgh! I certainly didn't have a ton of Javascript in mind. Or a ton of
effort.

Image maps may be slow, heavy & poor quality, but on a browser that doesn't
support SVG they are at least visible. I personally would prefer the rollout
of SVG to be as quick as possible, and something like this might even
encourage SVG uptake as the source format would be SVG, though realistically
I doubt whether it would make any difference one way or another.

I must re-read the guidelines.
A real, interoperable XML DOM is a good aim (for the present) I agree, I
just thought this might be a simple pragmatic approach to make some material
more available.

Forget I mentioned it ;-)

Cheers,
Danny.
