Mapping the location object, in that case, is potentially impossible,
and in practice fairly difficult.  It involves simultaneously executing
all possible paths through the code.  In the most general case, this
is the halting problem, and is impossible in finite time, but in more
practical cases it requires something other than a normal ECMA Script
interpreter and rather more like (I think) Prolog, or a test coverage
analysis tool.

However, as much as anything, my point here was that, if you currently
get a blank first page it probably means that the site authors believe
that the site will be unuseable without browser specific extensions
to DOM0, and will probably give a "please upgrade" page for the fallback
case, if they have one.

(Also, although document.all may have been implemneted by many minority
browsers, it is for the same reason that Lynx would have to do it, namely
that authors believe that there are only two brands of browser.  As very
few authors feature test for it, it also means forging the browser identity -
something already common amongst Lynx users and which causes Lynx to be
under-reported in statistics.)
