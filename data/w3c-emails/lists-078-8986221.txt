Hi Danny, 

I assume that your question is specific to [1], where your SVG file
would only consist of a set of transparent paths with links, in front
of a background image (no filters, animation and other fancy stuff).

Even this would be hard to do in (pure) XSLT, since it takes rather
complex calculations to compute an approximation of closed paths using
the rectangles. Or maybe you would simplify the approximation down to
compute the bounding box of the SVG path. Even that wouldn't be
trivial, since XSLT 1.0 is not so good at parsing strings or computing
min/max over sets of values.
