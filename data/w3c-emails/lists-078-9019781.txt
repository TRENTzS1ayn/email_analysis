Not at all, you run the script N times with the navigator object (and
probably .all/.layers set appropriately for the NN4/IE4 simplistic object
detection) set to spoof the N User Agents you want to spoof, okay that
doesn't gaurantee all paths, but in practice it does cover all usage, and
suffers no scripting problems - I have implemented such a script  and it
suffers from no problems and can easily identify the different links
written into the script.  Obviously some paths may not be found, but they
are likely down to the author checking for some very strange browsers so
you've probably got enough to be vaguely accessible.

I think that's complete rubbish, most authors aren't even aware what
their script needs or doesn't need, and this browser detection is more
about choosing which html/css hacks to use to make it look "right" in
IE/NN.

The navigator object is very rarely used for statistical gathering and
spoofing here would(especially multiple spoofing which I believe to be
most appropriate for simply widening the pages lynx can at least access.
