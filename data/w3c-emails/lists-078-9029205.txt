If you live in the central Ohio area, this may be of interest to you.

I will be giving a presentation tomorrow on behalf of the Central Ohio
Macromedia User Group called "Alphabet Soup: A Web Designer's Journey to
Accessibility and Standards."

For more information, visit http://www.commug.com.

While I certainly do not puport to be the level of expert that many of the
people on this list are, I am an advocate of accessibility, and this
presentation is about how this came to be, and how I have reinvented my
approach to web design during the past year.  It also covers web standards
such as XHTML and CSS, and how to be conformant withSection 508 and WCAG 1.0
Level A.
