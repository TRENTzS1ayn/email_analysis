      Web, and ensure that as broad an audience as possible can use
      the sites you create, regardless of disability, browser type,
      or access method.

STUDENT FEEDBACK

      Here's what some past students of the course are saying
      about D201: Accessible Web Design:

      "I have no problem praising HWG's Accessible Web Design course.
      The course was thorough and enlightening.  I commented on the
      class with a friend who had taken another accessible design
      course and he was impressed by the level of this course.
      Apparently the course that he had taken did not possess the
      depth of discussion on accessibility issues nor the practical
      implementation of techniques that this course did. Consequently,
      he bought Paciello's book and is planning to enroll in a future
      session of this course." --Clay Berglund

      "Before I took this course, accessible web design was a confusing
      mishmash of federal guidelines and recommendations. Now I'm
      coding sites that meet guidelines..." --Gillian Murrey

      "This course was a great enrichment to my knowledge about Web
      accessibility, because it forced me to put my hands on existing
      tools rather than just read about them or discuss them verbally."
      --Gottfried E. Zimmermann

      "Kynn and Liz provided resources and food for thought which,
      along with the inputs of my classmates, helped me formulate a
      draft policy for web accessibility at LCC and an 'attack plan'
      to make existing sites more accessible." --Anita F. Lees
