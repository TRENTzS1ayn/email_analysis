Hi everyone,

I'm presenting on XML and Web Accessibility at the CSUN conference
on Technology and Persons with Disabilities this Friday afternoon,
and I'll be at the conference starting on Wednesday afternoon.  If
you are going to be there, let me know and we can try to run in
to each other.  I will also be attending the WAI meetings after
the conference.
