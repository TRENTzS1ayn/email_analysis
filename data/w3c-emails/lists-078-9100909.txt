Jonathan:  Your browser might be set to download the player reference automatically on encountering an embedded object for which you don't have the player.  Or the Flash might have seemed like a download to you.  Do you have the Flash player installed?  If the author puts an onLoad script in a page, do you let your browser justDoIt?  How severe do you have your security settings?

Bob:  What's in your user agent string?  If you didn't get the "download javascript now" page you may have fooled the server into a different sniff than what it got from me.
