I think it is best to give info on the "untested" points - probably 
not as a "nag" as you put it, but as a short summary of the other 
issues people need to be aware of. It wouldn't have to be part of 
every set of test results.

People using your tool may not be aware of the "untestable" WCAG 
items, and if using your tool is the ONLY thing they do to "cover" 
accessibility, they may never find out, unless the tool alerts them 
to the issues.

Cheers
