Erm No!!

From RFC 2616:

   The Content-Language entity-header field describes the natural
   language(s) of the intended audience for the enclosed entity. Note
   that this might not be equivalent to all the languages used within
   the entity-body.

       Content-Language  = "Content-Language" ":" 1#language-tag

Note the 1# and the (s).   Some more:

   Language tags are defined in section 3.10. The primary purpose of
   Content-Language is to allow a user to identify and differentiate
   entities according to the user's own preferred language. Thus, if the

I.E. it is to help resource selection, not to control rendering.

   body content is intended only for a Danish-literate audience, the
   appropriate field is

       Content-Language: da
...

   Multiple languages MAY be listed for content that is intended for
   multiple audiences. For example, a rendition of the "Treaty of
   Waitangi," presented simultaneously in the original Maori and English
   versions, would call for

       Content-Language: mi, en
