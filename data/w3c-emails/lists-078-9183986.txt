I am new to this list and have enjoyed reading and learning from the
variety of subjects.
 
I had the opportunity to present on the topic of assistive technology
and web accessibility at the British Columbia Community Access Program
2002 conference this past weekend. It was quite an enlightening
experience. I have been an assistive technology trainer for 10 years, I
didn't realize the level of ignorance that exists outside of the
assistive technology world. The presentation was well received and
several attendees stopped to thank me for the "enlightening"
information. 
 
I wish you the best at CSUN, Ohio, and Indianapolis and I am confident
that you too will have educated the attendees! If we keep this up, we
might just succeed in "accessibility awareness".
 
Cheers,
 
Kelly Boychuk
