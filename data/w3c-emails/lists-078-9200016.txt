Dear Jim,
I haven't used the suite myself, but I know that they are currently implementing accessible elements into their courses, as documented on their website. It is apparent that they are working with WebAIM and Equal Access to Software and Information (EASI) to ensure that those with disabilities to use this product. Perhaps you could email these people to find out more - although I am sure that WebAIM are on this list(?)

Sorry that I cannot help you any further on the product, but a quick review of their site seems to show that it is at least accessible to a degree. Further testing would be required - something I would love to help with but unfortunately I have no time this week. Do let me know if you would like me to perform the usual tests in the coming days and pass on the information to you.

Kind regards

Simon

Hi,

I am doing an accessibility audit of Blackboard for one of the course in my
University. Assuming there are people on the list who have used the product
- I would appreciate comments about how accessible or inaccessible they
found it to be.
 
Thanks,
Jim
