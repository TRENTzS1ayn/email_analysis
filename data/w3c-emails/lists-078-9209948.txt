Hi Jason,

I don't know of many cases which discuss the definition of 'undue burden' 
except for SOCOG (see 
http://scaleplus.law.gov.au/html/ddadec/0/2000/0/DD000120.htm). But for 
more general advice the UK the Code of Practice is an excellent resource 
and is designed to give service providers guidance and advice on what is 
likely to be held to be reasonable and what is not - see chapters four and 
five.

The Code is available at 
http://www.drc-gb.org/drc/InformationAndLegislation/Page331.asp.

Hope that helps,

martin.
