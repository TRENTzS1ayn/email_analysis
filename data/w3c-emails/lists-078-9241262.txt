>>I haven't used the suite myself, but I know that they are currently implementing accessible elements into their courses, as documented on their website. It is apparent that they are working with WebAIM and Equal Access to Software and Information (EASI) to ensure that those with disabilities to use this product. Perhaps you could email these people to find out more - although I am sure that WebAIM are on this list(?)

>EASI have a WebCast of an interview Norm Coombs and Dick Banks conducted with Reidy Brown who is the Senior Software Engineer and Accessibility Co-ordinator for Blackboard. In that interview Reidy states that there have been major improvements to the accessibility of Blackboard in its latest 5.5 release. However, he acknowledges that some sections of Blackboard are still not fully accessible (whiteboard and chat room) as they are licensed to third-party companies and Blackboard does not have the ability to change the source code. I gather they are still trying to address this problem. So I think the message is that Blackboard is committed to accessibility but their e-learning environment is not yet fully accessible. You could email Norm (nrcgsh@ritvax.isc.rit.edu) or Dick (dick@easi.cc) to arrange to listen to the WebCast with Reidy and/or ask for his contact details.
