 >Denise, what process should we follow to get this information consolidated and shared?  There are lots of customers for any information that you and other can glean.

Hi Al
Well if people send me any info they have on the different e-learn systems (ie their experiences using the platform or tests they have conducted, reviews they have read etc), I will be happy to prepare a report for circulation to anyone who is interested. I expect there will be gaps in the info and prior to compiling the report I could post up to the IG specific areas not yet covered. 
It would be really helpful if some interested members might be willing to (a) run accessibility testing on a few selected e-learning platforms (suggestions anyone for which ones should be in the list?) and (b) those who use screen readers, Lynx etc could actually try the systems out and report on their experiences. That will of course also be governed by whether or not the platform has a demo version available for review. 
How does that sound to everyone?
