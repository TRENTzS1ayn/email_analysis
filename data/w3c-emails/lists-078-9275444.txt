Hi,

actual assessment of stuff, or compiling information and publishing it,
sounds like a good idea nearly all the time. PLease note that in the case of
"learning support systems", or "courseware", or "tools that let you do the
things that the web lets you do, but all come in one box and get sold to
universities along with support" there are reviews done by the Authoring Tool
Accessibility Guidelines group http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU as part of the
implementation reviews they do - this is an important group of authoring
tools.

cheers

  Hi Al
  Well if people send me any info they have on the different e-learn systems (ie their experiences using the platform or tests they have conducted, reviews they have read etc), I will be happy to prepare a report for circulation to anyone who is interested. I expect there will be gaps in the info and prior to compiling the report I could post up to the IG specific areas not yet covered.
  It would be really helpful if some interested members might be willing to (a) run accessibility testing on a few selected e-learning platforms (suggestions anyone for which ones should be in the list?) and (b) those who use screen readers, Lynx etc could actually try the systems out and report on their experiences. That will of course also be governed by whether or not the platform has a demo version available for review.
  How does that sound to everyone?
