There is an often-cited Australian case in which Telstra (who may have then
been called Telecom Australia still) was the defendent, which discussed the
question of "undue burden". The actual case was about whether they had an
obligation tyo provide TTY phones at the same price as standard handsets -
the result was that tey did, and that the price (a large amount of mone, but
a very small proportional increase in what they would charge each client) of
doing so was not un undue burden.

Chaals is not a lawyer. Relying on his advice about legal matters is foolish
- check it with a good lawyer.

  Hi Jason,

  I don't know of many cases which discuss the definition of 'undue burden'
  except for SOCOG (see
  http://scaleplus.law.gov.au/html/ddadec/0/2000/0/DD000120.htm). But for
  more general advice the UK the Code of Practice is an excellent resource
  and is designed to give service providers guidance and advice on what is
  likely to be held to be reasonable and what is not - see chapters four and
  five.

  The Code is available at
  http://www.drc-gb.org/drc/InformationAndLegislation/Page331.asp.

  Hope that helps,

  martin.
