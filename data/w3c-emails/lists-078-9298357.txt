Thanks for this Charles. I think it may be best to complement the work of the Authoring Tool
Accessibility Guidelines group. We could do this in the following ways:
1. Contributing to the existing reviews already completed by the group (ie Blackboard 5.5, Domino 5.02a, Prometheus 5.08 and WebCT 3.6) by sending further information, comments etc to the reviewer for inclusion when the reviews are updated.
2. Suggesting courseware that needs to be reviewed and is not yet included on the list. There are procedures outlined on the site about how to go about this. However, Charles, what is not clear, is when the reviews are completed. I note there are several packages listed for review but no review links exist. I presume that means a review has not yet been completed? At the moment the reviews are limited in so far as only four products have been reviewed. 
3. Submitting reviews (using the draft template document which can be supplied)of courseware not yet listed or reviewed.

Al, I think this would provide the most efficient means for ensuring consistency in the reviews, adding to the limited list of reviewed packages currently on the site and providing a more effective means for dissemination of the findings. Are there any volunteers to contribute to existing reviews based on experiences using the courseware, suggesting additional courseware for review and conducting reviews of courseware not yet evaluated by the Working group?

BTW, the ATAG pages provide a link to Ocotillo Central which lists the URLs of reviews of many courseware applications: http://www.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/ocotillo/courseware/compare.html
