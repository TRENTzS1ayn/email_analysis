Hi All, I'm sure this question must have come up in the past before I joined
the list but the search facility on the archive is down.

Just wondered whether there is a definitive answer to the issue of how to
display labels for mandatory fields. 

I've always used an asterisk, not sure about whether before or after the
label is better? Sometimes also use bold font in addition. Can't see
anything wrong with this but is there a better solution? Using this approach
screen readers will say the asterisk I assume and was wondering whether it
might be helpful to use title text in addition containing the word
"mandatory" for extra enphsis.

Thanks in advance as ever.
Cheers
ian
