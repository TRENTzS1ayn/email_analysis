----------

I've been giving a lot of thought to things like this lately.  Would this
work?

<label for="firstName">
<span style="display: none;">This field is required.</span>
First Name:
<input type="text" id="firstName" />

IE, NN and Opera will hide the "required" statement, but Lynx will show it.
I'm not sure what a screen reader will do with it though.
