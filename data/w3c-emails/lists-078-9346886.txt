A screenreader will often not render it. Why does it need to be hidden
anyway?

  ----------

  I've been giving a lot of thought to things like this lately.  Would this
  work?

  <label for="firstName">
  <span style="display: none;">This field is required.</span>
  First Name:
  <input type="text" id="firstName" />

  IE, NN and Opera will hide the "required" statement, but Lynx will show it.
  I'm not sure what a screen reader will do with it though.
