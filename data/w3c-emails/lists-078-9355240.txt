How about using an _image_ of an asterix to mark the mandatory field, but
setting the alt attribute to "Mandatory: " or something similar? That way
you comply with common web practice (asterix = mandatory) but a browser such
as Lynx will replace the image with "Mandatory: ". 

So in a variation of Randal's suggestion:

<label for="firstName">
<img src="asterix.gif" alt="Mandatory: " />
First Name
<input type="text" id="firstName" />

The one big problem I can see is that, for visual users who turn images off,
the (small) space reserved for the image won't be big enough to fit in the
alt attribute, but that is a general problem of how common graphical
browsers render missing images.

Any comments?
