Dear All,
I have just read a press release from an agency that has built a site that is supposed to be accessible to the most current W3C standards for visually impaired people. Well, I have taken a look and cannot make haed nor tail of it through my Lynx browser and got most confused. As I don't rely on this all the time, I was wondering if someone else could tell me that either I am being stupid or that I am right and this website is not as accessible as it claims.
 
The URLs are:
http://www.peoplesnetwork.gov.uk
http://www.resource.gov.uk/
 
I am not looking for an in-depth report as I could run that myself. Just interested in opinions on the site as it appears to you guys that use Assistive Tech, etc.
 
Much obliged and kind regards to all
Simon
