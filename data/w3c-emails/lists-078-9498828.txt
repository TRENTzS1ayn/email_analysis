Yes, the reference to an *Entity Header* is exactly that: it describes
an entity.  However, that is a very general case.  My reference was
to its use as a *Response Header*, which is more specific.

That would be appropriate to a multipart entity, perhaps comprising
multiple copies of a document in different languages.  It's dealing
with bundled collections, and perhaps with HTTP PUT transactions.

It is not dealing with single HTML or XML documents, which is all
either a web browser or Page Valet normally deals with.

In an entity that is a single HTML page, it serves exactly the same
purpose as the lang attribute to <html>.
