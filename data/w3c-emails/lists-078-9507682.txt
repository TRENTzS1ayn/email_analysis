As far as I know the validator doesn't work on password protected sites. But
there is a maling list www-validator with archives at
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-validator where you can find
information like this if it is not in the validator page.

There are also a number of validators thhat you can download - iCab has a
built-in validator for HTML 4, and various editing software does too.

  Point validator to a copy of the HTML you get when you log in.
