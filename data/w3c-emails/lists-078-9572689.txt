       Thing that many people forget is that, whilst 2K had bits and pieces 
of DOS left...XP has NONE of that. At ALL. Thus, since a lot of programmers 
still used tried-and-true DOS stuff where possible, a lot doesn't work.:-)

       IMHO, it was a bad idea to scrap DOS totally. Too much legacy 
software.
