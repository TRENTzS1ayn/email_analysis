The English/Maori example seems very much to me to refer to a single
page, but, for a concrete example, try:

<http://www.ocrat.com/biling/pridprej/chap0101.html>  (note that this
is undeclared charset=gb2312 and has no language markup/headers).  
Whilst this particular example has a bias towards English users,
if you look at it without the automation features it could be used
in the learning of either of the languages.

Basically, the ability to use the HTTP Content-Language is a last resort
default, not, I believe, a suggestion that that is the preferred method.
If it were the preferred method, then including it with meta would have
to be the de facto preferred method, given the difficult people seem to
have with specifying charset with real headers.  As such, it would seem
to me a much more ugly solution (in my view, meta was largely added for
bad reasons, and, in some cases has actually caused the atrophy of much
more hyperlink like alternatives).
