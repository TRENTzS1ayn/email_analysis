Yes, I clicked on the no-frames version. Still awful. Try clicking the skip nav button and see where that takes you - yes, back to the top link that takes the user to the original homepage.

Still found this site a nightmare to navigate using Lynx and don't think that it is accessible. There is no text-only version that I could find.

Also Bob, you say "most everything was there"; is almost good enough now? Especially as this company is providing advice to UK and Australian governments?

I used Lynx itself and most everything was there or not obviously missing.
