The normally quoted source is thecounter.com, the problems with their
statistics are that they certainly aren't representative (the average
site gets ~100 visitors and it could just be the site owner checking
their site for javascript or in different browsers.)  thecounter.com's
counter domains are also quite often filtered out as they can ruin the
loading time of table based sites containing the counter.  Their
javascript is also rather poor, and likely to error in many browsers
(meaning they believe them to be script disabled.)

Even saying that I don't find thecounter.com representative, I believe
that is too low from support experience.

Unfortunately so many sites only need to work for the developer and their
clients - people do not complain when sites don't work (unless they
_really_ need the functionality and then all too frequently the
complaints end with the designer who will ignore them.) they just go
elsewhere.
