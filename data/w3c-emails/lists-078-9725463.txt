Yes, that's correct. You can load a 'DOS' prompt inside Windows XP, but
it isn't really the same code as the old DOS and it is running as a
sub-process inside the OS (just like Excel, Paint, etc.) instead of the
OS running on top of DOS. It makes a fundamental difference in terms of
the stability and scalability of the operating system.

It is DOS. It isn't however Windows.
Win3.1 and lower, Win9x and WinME run on top of DOS. The OS is a program
running in DOS.
WinNT (including NT5 which for some reason is called Windows2000) and XP
don't run on top of DOS.
