Thanks Paul. I'll definitely check out the proceedings for the Blackboard 6 
presentation. It's good to hear that improvements may be in the works.

We have used the Blackboard screen reader tutorial 
(http://products.blackboard.com/cp/bb5/access/screen_reader_tutorial.htm) 
in training our blind students on the necessary workarounds. Unfortunately, 
the problems we've had with JAWS losing it's place in the deeply nested 
framesets (or HPR failing to render the pages) has limited the tutorial's 
usefulness. (Freedom Scientific hasn't been much help on this one either...)

Point well taken on the need to continue to be constructive in providing 
criticism, and to provide credit where it is due. We will definitely share 
our final findings report with Blackboard in hopes that it may be useful in 
improving accessibility in future releases.

Mike

p.s. If anyone has had opportunity to test Blackboard with Window-Eyes, I'd 
be interested to hear your results...
