Thanks for this addtional link Carol. It was not one of the sites listed at http://www.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/ocotillo/courseware/resources.html (which hyperlinks from the "list of more courseware packages" link from the W3C Authoring Tool Conformance Evaluations Web page). It is another valuable resource for those of us looking for objective assessments of online course development applications.
