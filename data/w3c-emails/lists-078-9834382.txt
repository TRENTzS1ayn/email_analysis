Had a quick look and kind of like the idea. Obviously it needs websites to
download and configure it but in principle semms fine. Not sure about one of
the points under functionality in the Technical Outline though. Apparently
it uses yellow fonts on a black background to make it easier for screen
readers to read!!!*grin* 
 
I'm currently working on a variation on this theme to improve browsing
experience which maybe some people might find useful. Watch this space.
 
Cheers
Ian

Dear All,
This time it is not a news story, but something much better. Check out this
link as I think that the BBC has taken a novel approach to inaccessible
pages... I have only taken a quick look, so apologies if this is not quite
what it seems to be at face value.
