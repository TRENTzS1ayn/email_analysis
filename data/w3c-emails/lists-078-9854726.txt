Dear All,
Having taken a longer look at BETSIE and collated comments from a great many sources on this list, it appears that I am somewhat behind the times! I would also like it known that I am not a fan of text-only websites and prefer to make content available to all through the same page. Having said all that, I think that there is something within BETSIE that could be used more effectively than it is at present, which in hindsight I was trying to show with my post.
 
I thank everyone for commenting on the BETSIE articles and I wish everyone working on similar projects all the best for the future.
 
Kind regards
 
Simon White

Had a quick look and kind of like the idea. Obviously it needs websites to download and configure it but in principle semms fine. Not sure about one of the points under functionality in the Technical Outline though. Apparently it uses yellow fonts on a black background to make it easier for screen readers to read!!!*grin* 
 
I'm currently working on a variation on this theme to improve browsing experience which maybe some people might find useful. Watch this space.
 
Cheers
Ian

Dear All,
This time it is not a news story, but something much better. Check out this link as I think that the BBC has taken a novel approach to inaccessible pages... I have only taken a quick look, so apologies if this is not quite what it seems to be at face value.
