Hi Bob,

Thankyou for submitting your bug report about the Betsie site / Betsie to
the WAI list. I have no idea what exactly went wrong because you did not
say.

I'd be very grateful if you could send a more detailed bug report to me,
offlist. Otherwise I will not be able to fix the problems you have
encountered. :)

Cheers etc.,

Wayne
