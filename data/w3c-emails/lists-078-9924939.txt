Yeah, I think in a user interface it is helpful to be clear about what hasn't
been tested - especially in something that is basically involved in testing.

(By the way, there are strategies for automating things like simple language
testing and repair - at least to the point of having an interactive
machine-supported process. Wanna challenge? ;-)

  every set of test results.

  People using your tool may not be aware of the "untestable" WCAG
  items, and if using your tool is the ONLY thing they do to "cover"
  accessibility, they may never find out, unless the tool alerts them
  to the issues.
