Hi All,

Can anyone please tell me how to modify my stylesheet so that all the menu
text etc at the top of http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ is visible using
large fonts. i only see a narrow band. I thought they were contained in TD
tags with fixed height but I've added a line to set the height of TD and
these particular elements are unaffected. What's going on?

Cheers
Ian
