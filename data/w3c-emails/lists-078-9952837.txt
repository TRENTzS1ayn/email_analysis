Hard to say - they serve me a different version, so that the text is all
there except the right-hand side.

If you can post the relevant source sections, including style rules, we might
be able to get it...

  Hi All,

  Can anyone please tell me how to modify my stylesheet so that all the menu
  text etc at the top of http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ is visible using
  large fonts. i only see a narrow band. I thought they were contained in TD
  tags with fixed height but I've added a line to set the height of TD and
  these particular elements are unaffected. What's going on?

  Cheers
  Ian
