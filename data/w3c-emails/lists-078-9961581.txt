Dear All,
It seems that I have not received any emails from the list today, which I find quite disconcerting. I know that my email address has been playing up. If this has caused my exclusion in any way would it be possible to get back on the list. If there is another reason that I have received none, please ignore this message and please let me know the cause.
 
Sorry to post something that is, in effect, nothing to do with the list.
 
Kind regards
 
Simon White
