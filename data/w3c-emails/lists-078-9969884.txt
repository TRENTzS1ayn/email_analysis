Dear All,
It seems that I have not received any emails from the list today, which I find quite disconcerting. I know that my email address has been playing up. If this has caused my exclusion in any way would it be possible to get back on the list. If there is another reason that I have received none, please ignore this message and please let me know the cause.
 
Sorry to post something that is, in effect, nothing to do with the list.


Note: we _have_ been experience slow turnarounds through the list processor.  This is a known problem and is being worked on.  

However, this is a situation that happens to all of us sooner or later.  It just happens to be Simon this time.  When it happens we don't remember what we were told to do about it.  So this is a FAQ.  Compare with 

 http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/2002JanMar/1340.html

[We need a periodic posting of FAQs or at least a reminder of where to find them.]

One thing to check is: were there any messages that you haven't got?
+ check the identification [e.g. From: Subject: and Date:] of the last message you  
  _did_ receive from the list.
+ go via the web to the list archives and check how many messages there have been 
  through the list since then, and when.

Another thing to check: Is there a general slowdown in mail getting to you?  Look at all the headers for messages you recently received.  Compare the date and time when they were sent by the senders with the last 'Received' timestamp.  When was the last message you actually got sent?

If you have concerns that you may have been de-subscribed for some reason, for our lists for the moment you have to bug a person.  Better to bug one person than the listful who can't check for you anyway.  An email address you may write to to check your subscription status is <listmaster@w3.org> and say what list you are worried about.

Hope this helps.

Al

 
Kind regards
 
Simon White
