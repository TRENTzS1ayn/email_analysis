HiSoftware has recently published a book  "Understanding Accessibility"
(ISBN - 1-930616-03-1). This book, is a guide to creating and testing Web
sites that are developed to the U.S. federal standards for accessible Web
content, and the World Wide Web, or W3C, accessibility guidelines. This book
provides a reference on accessibility remediation. It also provides
guidelines for accessible Web design, and information that will assist
organizations in integrating accessibility into their existing quality
assurance and content management practices.

HiSoftware Publishing is currently in the process of developing the second
edition of the book, which will address WCAG 1.0 guidelines Priority 1, 2,
and 3 as well as Canadian, European and world wide accessibility guidelines.
This second edition will be available as print media.
