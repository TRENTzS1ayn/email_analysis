Hi Tom,

Yes - it's a problem with the event handler. Mind you, the real problem is
in the design of the page, which doesn't actually require a text field to
communicate the information on the page.

Either way, it's an easy one to fix - thanks for your help.

Anthony

The most likely cause is some script trying to change the focus, look
for things like onblur="this.focus()". You could also try disabling
script and trying to tab again, to see it definitely is that.
