Well the way I do it is by not using tables just for layout purposes. Really
simple (but not entirely true - I do use a tool for presentations that is
supplied to me and gets maintained and regularly updated by other people.
That uses a table to put some buttons on the page. I used to maintain my own
version, but it got too hard to keep up).

There have been discussions before about getting people to use
summary="layout table" (so should spanish tools look for summary="solo
maquetacion" or what?) or some similar mechanism.

It would also be possible to use a profile to identify this. It seems like
standardising ways of doing this and then getting that implemented in tools
is a lot of work compared with just not using tables for layout, from my
perspective.
