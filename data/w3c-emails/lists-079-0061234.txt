One problem I have observed with this is that if *every* table has a
summary, including the tables used strictly for layout purposes, users of
screen reading technology get inundated with more information than is
practically neccessary under *normal* solutions.

For example, if a page maintains a persistent table at the top of every page
for navigation "buttons", is it really neccessary to tell every user (every
time) that "This is a table for laying out the navigation buttons"? ("This
is a pen which is used for writing"). The net effect is that we are then
being "overly verbose" to this type of technology.

If, to avoid this, the user of the screen reader "disables" or reduces the
verbosity of their application, what then happens when they reach a table
which *really* requires an appropriate summary?  They don't get it...

Chaas has correctly suggested that the best way to avoid this problem is to
avoid using tables for layout purposes, but as we all know, in the real
world that may not be an option available to us.  I would suggest then that
Kirsten's approach of providing {summary=""} to the layuout tables satisfies
some of the testing tools which cannot mechanically ascertain the difference
between the layout table and the data table.

Perhaps the better solution would be to re-write the checkpoint
acknolwedging the difference between layout and data tables?
