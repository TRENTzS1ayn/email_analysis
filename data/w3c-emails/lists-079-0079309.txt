Hi All,

I tested this site for visual disabilities and the design held up at a 28 
point font and the colour combo was used by other major sites for the 
visually impaired. However, the organization and I are  curious about the 
following:

The colours and font that are on the site, are they accessible for 
Assistive devices and for persons with
visual disabilities?

What do you think? Here is a test page to look at:
http://www.entrepreneurdisability.org

Can I do better? How would you change it?

Thanks for the feedback

Lisa
