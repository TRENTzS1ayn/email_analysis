Lisa,

The home page has two priority 2 (AA) errors in Bobby - both of which should
be fixable. So, a pretty impressive start!

It all works in Lynx, so even though you have used tables, they linearise
well. (By using CSS styles to position the left panel, you could have the
main content first and that would be even better.)

Contrast: blue links on cyan don't have a very good tonal contrast - try a
greyscale screenshot to see what I mean - tricky for those with low acuity.
(Improved by the yellow hover colour, but you have to be on the link to get
the benefit - not helpful for scanning.)

More systematic use of heading structures is good, to help screen reader
users to envisage the structure of the page. E.g. on disability resources
page, I'd have used H1 for the title and H2 for the links, not H2 and P.

The font you use for headings doesn't look to be optimised for screen use
and isn't as readable as, for example, Georgia would be. Likewise, Arial vs
Verdana for the body font. Using a larger than default line-height to give
more space can make it less tiring to read big chunks of text, but you have
to take special action to avoid problems with Netscape 4 (if you support
that in style sheets)

BTW, two minor observations: "Your Invited to Our Annual General Meeting and
Showcase Fair" and "FAQ's" on newsletters page - don't just rely on Word to
pick up typos <G>; and the font for links in the last footer section is set
very small - I suspect a double percentage somewhere in the style sheet
without looking further into this.

If you want more info on any of these, get back to me off-list.

Kind regards,

Lois Wakeman
