Lisa,

The links on the left poanel are not readable to me, on
my system they are bright cyan on cyan, and when visited
they're bright purple on cyan. This is because the colours
of the link pseudo classes fails cascading.

Colour cascading also fails for the links at the bottom
of the pages.

I find it a bit confusing to have two links for one page.
To my humble oppinion it would be better to either have
one 'About' link, or to have an 'About NEWD' and an
'About IDEA NS' page.

The Membership application page (less confusingly also
called 'Membership Application Form') doesn't have
initial values. This had posed some trouble in some
assistive technology in the past (don;t know current
status.)


On the FAQ page the three links at the top do not have
non link characters between them. This causes my screen-
reader to rattle them as one continues flow of words.

On the FAQ the questions more meem to be the answers
and visa versa. Better take a more bold / larger
typeface for the question then for the answer.
As an alternative the same font like all other paragraph
text could be used, and then to have the answers indented
using a definition list. (This would also look great in
lynx.)

On the home page the logo's could be alted to let
everybody know whose they are.

At for last it might or might not be a bit overkill
to have the links on the left also at the bottom, since
the ones on the left can be useable for every one.
