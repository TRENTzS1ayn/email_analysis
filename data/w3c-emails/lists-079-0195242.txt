All

can someone help me with the validity of this as an html comment

<!#xx>

I have a list of valid sgml comments but the structure of the above doesn't
seem to be included in that list. If the above isn't a valid comment is it
likely to cause any problems. The comment is being put in by a CMS vendor
who assures me that it doesn't cause problems with Bobby (which I don't
doubt) but I'm not sure about it being valid markup.

tia as usual

Julian
