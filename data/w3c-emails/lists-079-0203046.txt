It's not a valid HTML comment. Nor is it something that could be even be
part of any XML document of any kind. It is what is technically known as
"some random rubbish some idiot thought it would be a good idea to put
there".

It works because browsers are supposed to ignore element tags that are
obviously wrong and although that can't be an element tag (begins with an
invalid character) pretty much all browsers (but not all html tools) will
recognise it as an obvious error and pretend it isn't there.

Any tool that produces that is buggy.
