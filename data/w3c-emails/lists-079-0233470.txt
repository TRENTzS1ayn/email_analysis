From a perspective of accessibility only many examples of invalid markup are
pretty harmless, so it seems reasonable that it is of less priority than
cases with clear and well demonstrated accessibility issues (some priority 1
issues are also examples of invalid markup, so the worse consequences of
invalid markup are handled at priority 1 already).
