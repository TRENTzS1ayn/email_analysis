Yeah... enforce accessibility shouldn't be option. It should be the 
default.

And a better implementation would be having an option between 
"Description (ALT)" and "Decorative Graphic" since presumably the end 
users of this product wouldn't know what's proper to put as an alt for 
graphics that don't convey any useful information.

I am excited about the product though... it would certainly be nice to 
have some easy means to preventing clients from screwing up my designs.
