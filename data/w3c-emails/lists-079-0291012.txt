That's an unfortunate design choice.  I can think of many sites I've worked 
on where there are images that are swapped regularly (like promo images on 
a main page) but an ALT text would be inappropriate because the page copy 
already tells you what you would theoretically need to know in an ALT.

It's really misleading though, since often an "image description" is what's 
better suited for a TITLE attribute.  ALT is about the message the image 
delivers, but too often is written as a blow-by-blow description of what 
the image is.  This just reinforces that problem.
