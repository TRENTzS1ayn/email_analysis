Could it not at least add empty alt text? Or give a warning?

I have to say that I disagree. Many, many images inserted into content
don't require alt text, or need something other than a description of
the image - which in my opinion will tend to make users describe the
visual look of the image, instead of its meaning.

Photographs that aren't essential to the understanding of a page most
of the time simply don't need alt text. I don't see why the prompt for
alt text shouldn't allow an empty string.

I have to say that coming up with a good non-technical label for alt
text is difficult. "Textual replacement" was the best I could come up
with, and that isn't too good. Personally I'd have thought inserting a
title attribute for a description would be more appropriate.

Maybe it would be best to have a little bit of information as to what
makes good alt text, or links to tutorials?
