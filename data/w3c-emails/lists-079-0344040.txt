In general I think what Jukka says is true, but would like to disagree on a
fairly small technical point. There is no reason not to publish your own DTD
and validate to that. And the modularisation work done on XHTML showed how
to include existing and widely-understood material such as the things in
W3C's HTML recommendations. The upshot of this is that where you have a
better DTD for accessibility you should use that - and this is the goal of
the work on XML...
