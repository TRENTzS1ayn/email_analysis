Interesting ideas.  Exceptions as follows:

The reasoning is that you can't do text-to-speech without knowing the
natural language.  One can fake it between different European languages, but
try that with a French TTS and Thai text.

You are reading the requirement a little stricter than it is.  While the
WAI would like you to prefer markup that conforms to W3C recommendations,
the requirement to stick to a published grammar has IIRC always been understood
to include the case Charles describes where you tailor your own DTD and
publish it on your site.  The standard on the Web of what is 'published'
is that it is available on the Web.

The matter of not breaking negative numbers is an interesting microcosm.
Instead of going straight to the 'nobr' formatting directive in the content
markup, there is the possible option of classing this token as a number and
enforcing the non-breaking directive in a style rule applied to numbers.
But in general the handling of word-breaking in texts is not yet fully
covered, and it is on tap to be on the table in the timed-text work.
