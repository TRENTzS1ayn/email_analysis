Sorry if this is OT but I've tried elsewhere and no-one can tell me the
answer and I don't really want to join another W3C list for the purposes of
this query. 

Can anyone tell me why form elements have to be enclosed in a <p></p> to
validate as html 4.01 strict? I know that it's like that in the html spec
but why? Why can't we just have all the elements in the <form></form> tags?
At first I thought it was probably a block/inline thing but I'm not so sure
now.
