Hi,

Yes I have/still intend to compile a list of accessible and good looking
websites - however I have held-off from starting this until the re-design of
the MCU is finished so that I could launch both at the same time.

However the redesign is taking longer than I expected so I have set up a
page to list sites at
http://www.mcu.org.uk/goodlooking/campaigns/accessible.html

Please feel add your site to the page using the form provided. When I have
some time I intend to create a more sophisticated listing/rating system.

All the best,
Jim
