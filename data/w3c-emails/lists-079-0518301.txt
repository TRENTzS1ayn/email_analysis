I am not sure how, but I have been added to this distribution list and
receiving these e-mails for the last week several times throughout the day.
Could you please investigate and have my e-mail address removed so this
discontinues?  Thank you.

Thanks to Lynn Alford for pointing out to me that there was a problem with
the form on the page I  previously mentioned, i.e. the page to add your
accessible and good looking site to.

Please use the page at http://www.mcu.org.uk/campaigns/accessible.html

This just uses a simple comment form at the bottom of the page - but it
works fine for now - and I will change it to something more sophisticated as
soon as I can.

Please add your great looking and accessible site to the list; make it easy
for other to find a list of well designed and accessible sites.

All the best,
Jim
