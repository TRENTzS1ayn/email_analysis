Hi,

We are working on a dynamic template that will be used for a number of 
charity based websites and are now trying to address the Accessibility 
issues.

A sample site can be seen at http://www.sample.charityskills.net.

The pages use XHTML (yes, there are some validation bugs that need to 
be resolved) and CSS, that degrades to present the content in a nice 
linear format for text readers.

We have added a facility (via the "Accessibility Options" link) so that 
visitors can override some of the colours, font size and font face 
styles to suit their particular requirements.  The settings are 
automatically stored as a cookie so that they are available should they 
return to the original site or any of the other charity sites.

Based on the above, I would be interested to hear your opinions on the 
following..

1. Should the 'Accessibility Options' page be formatted using common 
accessibility styling - the BBC use large Yellow text on a black 
background?

2. Do you think we should add an option to display the page in the 
linear text only format, even though the user may be using a modern 
browser that will support the positioning?

3. We are considering providing a facility so that the user can 
download their own custom style sheet based on the preferences they set 
and then provide them with instructions on how to use it in the 
browsers that support it - do you think this is worthwhile?

With the main target audience being the voluntary sector, we are trying 
to do as much as we can so any other tips would be appreciated.

Cheers,
