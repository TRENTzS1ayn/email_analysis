I've only one comment about the site. The links at the left flow
out of their containing box, and over the body text. Better set
the width of this box to a value in EM units, to have it scale along
with the links.

I find the 'Accessibility Options' a great idea, although I (and
most probably more people) have loaded their browser with a user
stylesheet that overrides all colour and fonts.

For the people that are unable to use user stylesheets because they
either use a computer in a public place, at work, or any other
place that implements restriction on the settings, it would be handy
if this page is by default in a more than default font size, and using 
colours with high contrast (like the yellow on black.)

Personally I don't think this is necessary, if a user really want
to have the page completely liniar, he could disable stylesheets
if he uses Netscape 4. But I doubt if anyone wants to do this.

This would be more the thing of a site on helping people who don't
know CSS to 'compose' a user stylesheet.
