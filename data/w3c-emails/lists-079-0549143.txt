I want to create a constant in my CSS file so that I can change all affected
properties in one place. For example, in order to provide alternative
schemes one might assign a constants "myfontsize", "myfontcolor". I thought
I'd seen something like @define somewhere but can't find anything about it
now. Can this be done and if so how please?

Cheers
Ian
