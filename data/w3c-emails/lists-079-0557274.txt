See rejections of this proposal on the www-style list.  Amongst reasons
for rejecting it are the need to do this implies that you are using styles
capriciously, which just confuses users; for styles used systematically,
the cascading rules and the ability to have alternative selector seequences
for the same set of rules should avoid any great need for this, especially
in an accessibility context, where you should be using a small number of
style in a way that reflects the structure.
