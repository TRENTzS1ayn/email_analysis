A link to the page would not suffice. At least a description of the page
(not about the contents of the page bu how it is made up) would be nice,
along with a small picture how it looked at the time of addition. I kown
not all people would be able to use the picture. To compensate for this
a
copy of the -- for instance the main page -- could be mirrored.

When a site is submitted it could be run through a verification tool
like Bobby. This check could / should be repeated periodicly and include
the dat of the last verification along with the site listing. When a
site
has been redesigned and doesn't meet accessebility anymore a warning
email
could be send to the webmaster, and a notice should be added to the
list saying the site was redesigned. When the site is not corrected with
a
specified period the site would be moved to the list of inaccessible
sites.

This last step should maybe be done by hand of the 'accessebility board'
to either move it to the list of inaccessibe site or the one with less
accessible sites.
