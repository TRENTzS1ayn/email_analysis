I agree that it is a problem - if only there was some way to identify 
someone's requirements when they visit your site, it would make life a lot 
easier.

We run a site aimed at the UK charity sector that provides facilities for 
charities to setup their own free websites and it's the template for those 
that I am working on at the moment.

We have configured it so that once a user sets their preferences on one of 
the free sites, it will automatically be applied across all of them.  We are 
also hoping in the coming weeks to extend this to our main site.

We have been looking at a way that this can be applied to all sites, but as 
you say it would be easier to educate the users about using their own custom 
stylesheet.

OK, good point, I will try to move the heading layer down the running order 
- also note that the warning will be a once off affair on first visit.

Thanks for spotting that - hadn't got around to Opera testing yet.

OK, so are you agreeing that it is a good idea to provide a facility for 
creating a custom style sheet and help on how to use them?
