A _general_ facility, yes, though it would probably need to be
browser-specific for practical reasons (different CSS support).
By "general", I mean something that stands on its own and it aimed
at helping people in Web surfing in general.

Basically, it would be an interactive page (a case for using JavaScript for
accessibility!) where the user can select between some basic options or
enter options of his own, and get a style sheet back, together with
instructions on what to do with it next on different browsers. The difficult
part is to decide which features are most important and how to make it as
easy as possible to make an informed decision.
