Hi,

Thanks for the comments about the list of accessible and good looking
websites campaign (http://www.mcu.org.uk/articles/accessibletext.html). I
agree with most of what has been said:

* The current listing service is not adequate for the job (this covers many
sins as outlined in the earlier comments).

* What looks good to one person doesn't look good to another; subjectvity
plays a big part.

*Some type of peer review system would be a great idea.

As soon as I get time I will write a more tailored solution.  I'm also happy
to work with a talented and willing programmer to replace the current simple
system (they would also need to be generous - because there is no pay).
 
I don't agree that Bobby should be used to verify claims - mainly because my
experience is that the results can be very misleading; human input is still
required. Also I think - in this case - the minutia of W3C guidelines and
compliance would become the main topic - and deflect from the goals of the
campaign; to demonstrate that good design is not the opposite of accessible
design (lots more can be said to explain and expand on this).

Perhaps Bobby along with validation of the HTML could, as suggest, be used
to notify the submitter of the site of possible problems - but I don't think
the results should then appear on the list.

Much more could be said - but I'll need to think about how to address the
current weaknesses first.

All the best,
Jim
