OK, that shouldn't be too difficult.  I have dabbled with IE's facilities, but 
have yet to test Opera and NS, although the impression is that all you need to 
do is provide a style for the body tag giving colours, font face and font 
size.  I'll investigate it further.

Did you manage to look at the accessibility page at 
http://www.sample.charityskills.net/accessibility.aspx?

I was basically thinking on expanding on that by putting a link to download 
the file and a link to instruction pages at the bottom of the page.

It's all server side, so no issues with client side javascript.

True.  The only think I haven't done is provide a facility for selecting your 
own preferred font, I believe the selection I have provided should be 
sufficient.
