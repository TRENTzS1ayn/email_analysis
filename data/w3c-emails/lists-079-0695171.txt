I have been told that this was one of the things that RNIB testing found. (if
I recall correctly)

Which just makes for a bug report on JAWS - unless it turns out the problem
is with what IE makes available to it. That would surprise me in this case,
since IE visually renders it.

This is a case where it would be nice to have Audio CSS iplementation - it
would make it much easier for users to solve these problems for themselves
and share their style rules, instead of waiting for the developers to have
work time available.

Cheers
