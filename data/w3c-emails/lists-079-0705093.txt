Summary:

1. Put a TITLE on each INPUT.

2. How can we educate your customer?  What they are insisting on is "eyes
and paper bigotry."  Assuming that everyone has working eyes is unfeeling;
but being hidebound about the way it works best on paper is costing them
money somewhere.  Being able to change items in the input *both* in an editable
summary *and* through step-by-step worksheets is a Best Current Practice that
is everywhere in retail 'clicks' eCommerce and tax preparation software etc.
An interactive medium makes it possible to make the transaction more usable
than is feasible on paper; not to do so is leaving money on the table.

You have done a great job of recapping the issue.

At the FedStats workshop on complex tables it was reported that there
is a Jaws command which will inspect a table cell and when it is invoked
the headers that are listed in the HEADERS attribute are read.  I am
sorry I can't give you precise information about this command.

But it probably involves leaving forms mode, and you can't expect that most
users will know about it.

Actually, you should us the TITLE for the INPUT, not the TITLE for the TD cell.

Nothing as effective under your circumstances.

Hope that the uptake of XForms is quicker.

Your analysis of the situation is completely correct so far as I know.

What you can do in terms of presently deployed assistive technology
in the context of a layout optimized for visual review of the summary
when it is all there is to embed field help in the form of the TITLE
attribute on the INPUT element.

What you can to do enhance usability would be to provide worksheets in
an expanded format in addition to interaction with the summary layout.
