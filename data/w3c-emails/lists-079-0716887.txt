Actually JAWS 4.5 does support these tags to some degree.  The user can ask
for the indicated font of text on a web page by pressing insert+f.  Text
marked with <strong>...</strong> will be indicated as bold.  Text marked
with <em>...</em> will be indicated as italic.

If the user chooses there are settings that can be enabled to have this
level of notifaction turned on automatically.  See the Format Notification
options available when pressing ins+v or the JAWS configuration manager.
