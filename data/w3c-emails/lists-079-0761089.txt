Why is <strong> and <em> anything less than an indication of meaning 
in the content? Using <strong> when you mean <b> is like using <th> 
to center something in a cell. The strength of inflection of a given 
word may affect meaning and in so doing needs to be interpreted by 
any device that interprets written words.

I don't think it's insane at all; I'd commend the programmers at 
Freedom Scientific for their insight.
