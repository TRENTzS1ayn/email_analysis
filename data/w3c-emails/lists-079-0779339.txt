 Hello all,

I heard that it is better to specify the font-size in 100% in stead of
em  in the body. Due to a bug in special IE6 browsersettings em seems to
be rendered very small. Other elements can have a property font-size em
as those seem not be influenced by this special bug that appears in some
IE6 settings.
Has anybody experience with this bug and in what IE6 browsersettings
this occurs?

Greetings
Ineke van der Maat
