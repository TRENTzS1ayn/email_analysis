  The strength of *inflection* is indeed meaningful. I doubt anyone would
  ever try to argue that.

  But, and please correct me if I am wrong, what seems to be the case here
  is that Jaws uses the thickness of lines (bold face) in order to determine
  the strength of inflection.

  If I am not incorrect in that assumption, then I am afraid that I'll agree
  with the phrase "insane" - which is otherwise a rather dangerous word to
  use.

  Hopefully I've just misunderstood. I'd really not like to put forth
  questions such as

    "If a webpage is rendered all in bold, should it be shouted ?"

  or

    "How bold should a bold font become before it means emphasis ?"

  or even

    "Does <em>this phrase</em> rendered thinly not mean emphasis ?"
