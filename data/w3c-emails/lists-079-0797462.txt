Hmm. I suppose since "insane" is a legal term it could be. However the term
seems so weakened as to be on a par with "tragic" and "terrific" as regards
to how closely current vernacular use matches the original intent.

This is only how it seems to me I suppose, and since this weakening of terms
can happen at different rates in different regions when on an international
list there is a risk of misunderstanding. I apologise if I caused offence.
