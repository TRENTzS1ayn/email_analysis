jaws does not do any enterpretation of the text.  it just reads as text
and relies on punctuation for inflection.  it relies on a narrow subset
of punctuation in fact which is period, question mark, comma, and other
pause charactrs as well as exclamation.  Jaws does not allow variance in
inflection but processes these indicators internally to arrive at an
approximation of meaningfull inflection depending on the speech
synthesizer used.

  The strength of *inflection* is indeed meaningful. I doubt anyone
would
  ever try to argue that.

  But, and please correct me if I am wrong, what seems to be the case
here
  is that Jaws uses the thickness of lines (bold face) in order to
determine
  the strength of inflection.

  If I am not incorrect in that assumption, then I am afraid that I'll
agree
  with the phrase "insane" - which is otherwise a rather dangerous word
to
  use.

  Hopefully I've just misunderstood. I'd really not like to put forth
  questions such as

    "If a webpage is rendered all in bold, should it be shouted ?"

  or

    "How bold should a bold font become before it means emphasis ?"

  or even

    "Does <em>this phrase</em> rendered thinly not mean emphasis ?"
