I think this is an IE thing rather than a specific IE6 thing. But yes,
it seems if you specify em for font-size in the body, then the fonts can get very
small in IE with the text size set to "smaller" or "smallest". Using
100% (or 80%) for font-size in the body, and then using em for
everything else <h1>, <p> etc, gets around this problem. With text
size set to smallest in IE, it's still readable - depending of course
on your eyesight! At any rate, the font size shown on screen for IE will only
"scale-down" to a certain size and no lower with this method.

As always, test this method across browers, but I've found it to work
quite well.
