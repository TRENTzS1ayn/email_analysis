If I understand your problem, which I'm not 100% on, you could try putting
this in your style sheet:

label.hidden {
 visibility: hidden;
}

And later:

<label for="mybox" class="hidden">Label</label>

Visibility, to my understanding, should only affect visual browsers, so your
screen readers will pick up the label, but it won't be visible to visual
user agents.
