I would like to see some sort of review process for sites submitted.  Open 
invitations to post your site are open to abuse, I recently cleared my 
guestbook of a couple of urls that lead to German porn sites.  I don't 
really want a guestbook full of such urls.

Good looking sites is more than a bit subjective, things like content, 
navigation consistency and so forth should be considered as well.  I 
submitted my site mostly because it follows all of the basics of accessible 
design in being valid html, valid css, consistent navigation and when 
styles are off, the navigation *follows* the content instead of proceeding 
it.  I am guilty of writing some very long pages though.
