To be clear, inflection does not indicate anything marked as <strong> or
<em> with JAWS.  This is definitely described in words to the user but only
when the user requests or configures JAWS to do so.  Otherwise JAWS simply
reads the words, using inflection based on any punctuation marks that are
found.

I'm not entirely certain why JAWS uses the terms bold and italic in these
cases.  It is probably what it is getting back from IE at that point but I'd
have to investigate a bit more.
