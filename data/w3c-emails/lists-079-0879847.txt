Most "screen readers" are visual browsers!!!   They use IE to render
the page and IE is a visual browser.  They could look deeper at the
object model, but there is a chicken and egg problem - unless authors
start using non-visual media types for their styles, there is no incentive,
and there is no incentive to do so until AT supports them.

In my view, making labels invisible suggests a misuse of label, though.
