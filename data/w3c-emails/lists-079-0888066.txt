actually, some of them do look deeper at the code but not for non visual
stuff.  msaa already provides this and I'd rather for one not go down
that road.  it is almost the reverse of text only where in this
instance, we get stuff others do not in this case.  There is no need for
non visual stuff and tricks as long as you say, it is coded correctly.

Most "screen readers" are visual browsers!!!   They use IE to render
the page and IE is a visual browser.  They could look deeper at the
object model, but there is a chicken and egg problem - unless authors
start using non-visual media types for their styles, there is no
incentive,
and there is no incentive to do so until AT supports them.

In my view, making labels invisible suggests a misuse of label, though.
