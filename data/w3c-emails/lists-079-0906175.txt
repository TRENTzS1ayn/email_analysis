Do you have access to any server-side scripting (CGI)?  The usual way 
would be to do something in JavaScript, but I think that it's probably 
not wise to make the assumption that the client a) has it and b) it 
actually works as it's meant to; server-side scripting eliminates any 
dependency on the client's browser - I write in Perl and my external 
style sheet is actually a Perl programme that can be fed parameters, 
like what browser you are dealing with, etc.

Hope this helps; if you want nitty gritty details of this, please feel 
free to contact me either on or off list.

Cheers

M
