   Commendable.

   If, as you say, you have access to no server-side techniques, there is
  no effective method to achieve what you seem to want. That said, I suggest
  you have a look at

     http://www.greytower.net/en/archive/articles/customcss.html

  for the method we used to achieve the same. This, however, demands access
  to one, or other, server-side technology.

   Personally I dislike the hacks mentioned. Then again, perhaps they
  fit your requirements.
