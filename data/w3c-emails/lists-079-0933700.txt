I've been working on a page that has a lot of fill in the blanks type examples 
on it and am wondering if the <input type="text" size="n"> tag makes good 
sense as a replacement for the underscores indicating where words and letters 
ought to be filled in.  I know I'm not using the input tags in a form but I'm 
hoping that it'll improve the page's renddering via screen readers.

The page is http://www.joneslibray.org/esl/stories.html.

Thanks,
Seth
