Using the w3 validator on our guestbook* form I get:

Error: there is no attribute "wrap" for this element (in this HTML 
version)

from:

<textarea name="Comments" cols="60" rows="10" 
wrap="physical"></textarea>

anyone know if/why wrap is deprecated? OK it is true that the user 
agent should have control of this, but the author can also, subject to 
the user having set.....

The validator used to point to possible help (I seem to remember) this 
seems to have stopped, anyone know why?

thanks
