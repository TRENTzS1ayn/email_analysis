AFAIK it has never been in any HTML spec and it was an attribute that
was created by Netscape back in the days when textareas behaved in a
different way from the now usual way -- now all browsers seem to have
wrap=virtual by default.

I'm not aware of a CSS way of achieving the same results as the wrap
attribute and for this reason I think it's an attribute that would
make sense to have in the transitional DTDs, but that isn't a debate
worth having again :-)
