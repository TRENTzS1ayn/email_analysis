jesper,

an interesting proposal, and you might consider that we've found a 
partial workaround

every few months we change the directory name where current files are 
archived and place a robot prevent in the old folder.

So this way researchers including me can find out what the state of the 
file was/is, but regular users only get to see current links.

of course this is a rose tinted perspective.

jonathan

as an aside it is a great pity that the wayback machine does not 
archive script links, so something like the above is essential, if you 
need an archive, I do.
