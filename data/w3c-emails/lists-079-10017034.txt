Kwickie kwestion about use of the label element across the closing
tag of block-level elements, as </td><td>.

In theory, you can use <label for="{element}">[item]</label>
anywhere on a page. In turn, {element} can appear anywhere else.
Cf. <http://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/html40/forms/label.html>.

But do screen readers actually understand this coding and
"associate," as the buzzword has it, the label with the control?
Genuinely? Really and truly?

Does anyone know this definitively? I suppose it's pointless to hope
for an answer from Freedom Scientific, but maybe someone with Jaws
could check. Meanwhile, Aaron of GW Micro, take it away!
