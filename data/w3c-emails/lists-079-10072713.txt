I'm sure Joe can clarify this himself, but I think the question was 
whether the labels would be associated properly in the context of code 
below. Would selecting the label move focus to the correct checkbox 
despite the label and the checkbox being in different cells:

<form>
<table>
<tr>
<td><label for="item1">Item 1</label></td>
<td><label for="item2">Item 2</label></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><input type="checkbox" name="item1" id="item1"></td>
<td><input type="checkbox" name="item2" id="item2"></td>
</tr>
</table>
...
</form>
