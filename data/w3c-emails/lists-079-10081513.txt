Yes, or something even as schematically easy as this:

<tr>
<td><label for="firstname">First name</label></td>
<td><input id="firstname"></td>
</tr>

You see this all the time on *cough* real-world *cough* Web sites--
form "label" right next to form control, as created by tabular
layout.

According to the spec, it's supposed to "work." How it works in
graphical browsers is one issue, but I am wondering if it actually
really and truly works in screen readers.
