I can verify that it works, really and truly, with JAWS 4.5 and Home Page
Reader 3.0 on Windows XP, IE 6. I don't have immediate access to other
screen readers or versions at the moment.

You see this all the time on *cough* real-world *cough* Web sites-- form

browsers is one issue, but I am wondering if it actually really and truly
works in screen readers.
