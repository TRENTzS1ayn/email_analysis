In fact, the form label works beautifully even if the label is separated by
a ton of other stuff. You could put the label at the top of the page, then
100 paragraphs of text, 50 images, and 15 other form elements and labels if
you wanted to , then, finally, the corresponding form element at the bottom
of the page(not that I would recommend it). 

When you tab through the form elements, the correct label is read with the
correct form element.

However, when you listen to the page in linear format, nothing special
happens. (And if the label were really that distant from its corresponding
form element, this would, of course, be confusing, because the label would
be read WAY before the form element.)

I can verify that it works, really and truly, with JAWS 4.5 and Home Page
Reader 3.0 on Windows XP, IE 6. I don't have immediate access to other
screen readers or versions at the moment.
