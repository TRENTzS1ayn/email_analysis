Description:

Whether you develop content for the Web, manage those who do, or train Web
developers, you won't want to miss WebAIM's online training event. Training
includes real-time audio discussions, streaming video, simulations,
tutorials, text chats, and an interactive discussion group. In fact, the
training itself is an example of accessible Web design.

Last year's Training Event was incredibly popular, attracting thousands of
people from all over the world. As a result, we have increased the breadth
and depth of the training, and have added additional resources about
international laws and standards.

Educational and group discounts are available. (See
http://www.webaim.org/training2003 for registration fees.)


There are 3 "tracks" or focus areas:

Track 1--Web Content Developers: This area is for anyone who posts content
on the Web--whether novice or advanced--and covers strategies and techniques
for identifying, fixing and creating accessible HTML and multimedia. 

Track 2--Administrators and Managers: Learn strategies and techniques for
developing institutional policy, coordinating technical support, and
defining organizational accountability 

Track 3--Accessibility Trainers: Learn how to help others understand the
perspective of users with disabilities, and to apply accessible design
techniques to their Web content. WebAIM has prepared multiple online
resources to assist you in your training efforts. 


What will you get from the training? 

1. New and exclusive content: 
WebAIM has created content especially for WebAIM Training Event 2003
participants.
 
2. Structured guidance in a "conference" style format: 
Although some of the same materials are or will be available on the WebAIM
site, it can be intimidating to sort through the site's resources. WebAIM
Training Event 2003 provides a structured framework which guides you through
the content and helps you prioritize your learning tasks. 

3. Live captioned webcasts: 
Once a week during the training, WebAIM will host live webcasts that are
relevant to the topics covered that week. We will interview top experts in
the field who will answer your questions as you call in or email them in
during the Webcast. These events will be captioned in real-time as they are
streamed over the Web. 

4. Networking: 
Just like a conference that takes place in a physical building, WebAIM's
Training Event 2003 provides plenty of opportunities to network with
like-minded professionals across the world. Rub shoulders with top
accessibility experts and find out how others are handling the same
challenges that you are facing. 

5. Self-assessment: 
WebAIM has constructed questions, exercises and tools that will help you
determine how well you know the principles and skills that are taught each
week. You have the opportunity to ask for and receive feedback from WebAIM
Training Event 2003 participants.
