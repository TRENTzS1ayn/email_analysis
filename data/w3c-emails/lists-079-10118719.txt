Context????

The system font is a platform issue, not an HTML issue.  If you are talking
about the use of platform features, like title bars and tooltips, you 
need to remember that many people still use Windows ME downwards, and 
these have no knowledge of Unicode, so work directly in the
localised character code (IE or NS provide local Unicode support,
as do some other related tools, like Outlook Express).

You also find a weird mix of localised and unlocalised text if you 
install and enable localised menus and dialogues (at least for Chinese)
in IE.
