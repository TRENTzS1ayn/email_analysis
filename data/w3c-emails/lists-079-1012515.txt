No, as David explained, wrap="physical" was never part of any HTML
specification. As far as I know, it was never even proposed. And
actually it would work against the way textarea elements have
always been intended to work: to allow input of multiple lines
with no limit on line length.

I'm not sure whether there are particular _accessibility_ issues
involved. But there's a long explanation of the history of the
wrap attribute for textarea at
