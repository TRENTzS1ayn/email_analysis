Does anyone know of a means to set the system font to wingdings in MS, 
or anything else that is not easily read? for some reason MS fonts all 
seem to be :-(
Linux or Mac would be great as well :-)

Sorry if this appears off topic, I'm giving an accessibility talk soon, 
and have been asked to provide some concrete examples that everyone can 
relate to.
