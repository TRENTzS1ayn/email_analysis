For many, if not all, versions of Windows, the System fonts has to be
a bitmapped font, not an outline (TrueType) one.    The font is typically
selected by the .inf file for the display driver, but I doubt there is
much of an aftermarket in bit mapped fonts, and non-Latin ones are 
probably not licensed for US/European Windows.

In character mode, you should be able to use "setfont" on Linux.
