This shouldn't work in a good modern browser with good modern fonts, as 
it should realise that the characters aren't covered by these fonts and
use a basic fallback font, or display invalid character markers.

The only reason it might work is because of prior use of the Symbol font
hack to output Greek characters on HTML 3.2 and earlier browsers.

I would would consider it a bug if it worked in the strict mode of 
a modern browser.
