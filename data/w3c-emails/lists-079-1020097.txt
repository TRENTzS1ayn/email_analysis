I guess "The snow man melted in the <img alt=
"(insert)" src="underscores.png">." would do.
Speech browsers can be expected to read a parenthetic
text "parenthetically" (in a different tone) or to
spell out the parenthesis characters.

This would probably be more understandable to everyone
if a clear description of the notational convention
is given at the beginning, e.g.
"In this document, the following will act as a
indication that student's input is expected:
<img alt="(insert)" src="underscores.png">."

One might even use
<var><img alt="(insert)" src="underscores.png"></var>
on the grounds that there's logically a variable involved,
in a sense, and advanced visual browsers will treat this
effectively as
<var>(insert)</var>
when configured not to display images, and this in turn
will probably make them present the content in some special
way, e.g. in italics, to distinguish it from normal text.
