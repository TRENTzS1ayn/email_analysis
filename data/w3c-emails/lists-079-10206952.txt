Without doing a serious assessment of your particular project it is 
impossible to give an answer I am certain of.

But in general, recording the text as audio is a poor way of improving 
accessibility for people with visual impairments. Many will not get any 
benefit at all, many will get minimal benefit. If this is done at the 
expense of providing a good navigable structure (this can be done in 
recorded audio but is difficult, and for general accessibility must be 
available in a non-audio form), clear communication, or other important 
facets of accessibility, then you will be doing an overall disservice 
to people with visual impairments.

You also put yourself at risk of doing a very significant disservice if 
you rely on the recorded audio to convey any information, or if it is 
not absolutely accurate as a representation of your content. On the 
other hand you are likely to help people with significant intellectual 
disabilities, if you have high-quality recorded audio available as they 
browse the content.

Sites that do this include Mencap - http://www.mencap.org.uk - and 
Peepo - http://www.peepo.com These sites are not directed at people 
with visual impairment, but at people with intellectual disabilities.

Can you explain more about why your customers believe there is value in 
recorded audio? It may be that I am missing something particular to 
your case.
