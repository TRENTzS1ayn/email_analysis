What gives me the jitters about these types of solutions is that they depend
on the existance on ones apparatus of data retrieval  of capabilities that
by and large, do not exist in many envoironments and even if they exist,
their use is precluded by barriers.  The device independant model is the way
to go here and anything else falls way short of the mark.  These are looked
at as regulation compliance solutions when they are not.  It is difficult to
persuade some already for instance that narrator is not a screen reader.

Subject: The Holy Grail?



An associate passed on this link to me, a press release dated Friday Feb.
14th.

I wonder out loud: Will it be cross platform compatible (ie: PC, Mac, Linux,
etc.)?  Shows promise, but I suspect it will always be a band-aid solution.
I wonder too if the software app will impart the structural logic required
to navigate a long document properly - even PDFs can have "bookmarks" (named
anchors) in them; will this functionality be carried through?  I would be
curious to see the application in play - how does it work with other
adaptive technologies (ie, can it peacefully co-exist with other screen
reading apps like Jaws?)  Also, how does it deal with images, charts and
graphs, etc. in PDFs? What will the business model be - a free plug-in or a
purchase add-on/software app.?  (Affordability is an accessibility issue
too) Many, many questions...
