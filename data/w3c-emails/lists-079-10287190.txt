EASI Online Course:  Learning Disabilities and Information Technology,
Starting Mar. 3 and lasting 4 weeks
http://easi.cc/workshops/ld.htm
This course can be taken as a single course or as one of the five courses
required for the Certificate in Accessible Technology:
http://easi.cc/workshop.htm

Support staff frequently are not aware of the benefits that adaptive and
assistive technologies provide users with visual and cognitive processing
difficulties.  This course provides an introductory insight into the ways
that these technologies can increase access to information technologies for
students and professionals with learning disabilities.

        Course description
The course will be delivered asynchronously using content on the Web and
interactive Internet discussion. Our goal is to help participants discover
Internet resources that will let them remain current with rapidly changing
technologies. Postsecondary students with learning disabilities have unique
information technology needs that are readily met through the use of
specialized software, handheld technologies, and attention to Web site
accessibility. In addition to examining the latest technologies with
hands-on application, participants in this course will be provided with
opportunities to deepen their knowledge of learning disabilities, as well
as curriculum development and instructional strategies, including
universal design in education.
