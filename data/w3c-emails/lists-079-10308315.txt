Just an FYI:

On my site www.accessibleware.org I use a plug-in from BrowseAloud. Once the
site is enabled, and you have downloaded the plug-in, you can "hear" the
site. It requires you to move the mouse or I assume tab, to get over the
sentence/line of text, and then you can "hear" it. The person to reach at
BrowseAloud is Garry Morrison <g.morrison@texthelp.com>. Let me know how
that works out.

Regards,
Asif./
