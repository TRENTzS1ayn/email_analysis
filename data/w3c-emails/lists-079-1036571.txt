Javascript is actually likely to be more reliable than any serverside
method (in that it may well hold its hands up and say "I dunno" where js
is disabled, but at least it wouldn't be positively identifying the wrong
browser), neither are going to be good enough to identify a browser
though, client-side javascript could at least distinguish between
IceStorm 5 and IE 5 for example.

http://pixels.pixelpark.com/~koch/hide_css_from_browsers/  has another
approach.
