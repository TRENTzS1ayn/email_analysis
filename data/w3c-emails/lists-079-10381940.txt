Hello All-

I am writing to let you know that HiSoftware Publishing's book,
"Understanding Accessibility," will soon be available in a Spanish
Language version. This book introduces the accessibility initiative and
its challenges and provides a complete reference on accessibility
remediation. It also provides guidelines for accessible Web design, and
information that will assist organizations in integrating accessibility
into their existing quality assurance and content management practices.
Understanding Accessibility is available at no-cost and can be
downloaded from the HiSoftware Web site at:
http://www.hisoftware.com/msacc/regbook.htm . The Spanish Language
Edition will be available on March 11, 2003.
