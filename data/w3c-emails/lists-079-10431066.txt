I will try to find a way to turn a broken link off when it is so old, or for
other reasons, that it does not make sense to fix it. When a broken link is
turned off, it should still look like a link, and still have the information
(URL) of the original link, but it should be marked as broken, and should
not be a real link using A-tag.

This is my conclusion from the debate.

Cheers,
Jesper

I don't think it is right, I think it shows that some people haven't
understood the web very well, or that things are lost (having been
trained as an historian, this doesn't strike me as progress ;-)

One of the general rambling documents produced by Tim Berners-Lee about
the Web is called "cool URIs don't change" - in my opinion one of the
more important documents he has written (others would include the
original specification for HTML, and much more important for URLs and
HTTP).
