Gah!

You're half-way through filling in the second field when the page finishes
downloading, document.onload kicks in and the focus moves in the middle of
your typing.

Making the first form field the first item in the tab order is often, but
not always, a good idea, but switching focus for no obvious (to the user)
reason isn't.
