and though some sites do it and some screen readers love it, I find it quite
disorienting.  I want to decide where my focus is going to go on the page so
would rather have it at the top or beyond the repetative links at least.  I
may be accessing the site for reasons other than to type something in.

Gah!

You're half-way through filling in the second field when the page finishes
downloading, document.onload kicks in and the focus moves in the middle of
your typing.

Making the first form field the first item in the tab order is often, but
not always, a good idea, but switching focus for no obvious (to the user)
reason isn't.
