True. And since javascript is a required to implement this
irritateUserByRefocusing(), there's no reason why the script can't check
where the focus is first before resetting it. Using a bit of logic like
"Well, if the focus is already on a form element, don't move it!" will
certainly be more useful to a visitor.
