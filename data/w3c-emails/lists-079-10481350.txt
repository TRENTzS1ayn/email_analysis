  Hello Sheila - welcome to the WAI IG mailing list. First of all I
 think we need to get a few concepts out of the way, namely that of
 "Validation".

  Typically that word refer to checking the HTML code for syntax errors,
 which is a straightforward matter for http://validator.w3.org/ - as you
 are probably aware, making sure documents are syntactically correct is
 a WCAG checkpoint though sadly a priority 2.

  What you seem to be looking for is a way to validate the
 *accessibility* of a website. This is a far harder task. There are no
 automated processes which can test for all aspects of accessibility. Of
 the ones that are available, "Bobby" may the most used. It seems to
 still have a few errors.

  My favourite is a tool called siteSifter, but it is strictly
 commercial. The one I would recommend you look into is called Site
 Valet, and can be found at http://valet.webthing.com/

  Good luck!
