Hi Shiela,

I agree with Tina that there are no tools that can do the whole job for 
you. If you are serious about wanting to keep accessibility as good as 
possible, I would suggest that you become as familiar as possible with 
W3C's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG - 
http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10 - in my opinion the best available single 
reference, although there are others), and then look for tools that you 
find helpful.

Having worked on WCAG since the first W3C draft I rely on having a lot 
of it in  memory, and on using the checklist as a reminder when I am 
verifying my work. In my experience the best tools are ones which allow 
you to monitor a whole site in development, and most of them are 
commercial. Of the free tools available I have found the Wave and el 
TAW (in Spanish) suit my personal preferences and working style. I 
would prefer tools that integrate with my authoring environment better, 
but I have a weird authoring process so have to think a bit harder. 
There are a number of tools that integrate with commercial web 
authoring software - in any event my advice is to, look for something 
that suits you, and interpret its results in light of your own 
knowledge and what you learn.

There is a list of tools for evaluation and repair, both commercial and 
free, that is more or less maintained by W3C, at 
http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/existingtools - I suggest looking there every 
so often for changes. This is a field with fairly significant 
development happening, so your choice today may not be the one you 
would make in a year, or would have made a year ago.

Cheers

Charles
