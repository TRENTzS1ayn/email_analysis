The address for the web site, discussed below is:

http://www.amazon.com/access

and it is easy to use, and nice and clean.

 Amazon.com (Nasdaq: AMZN) on Thursday launched an alternative version of
 its Web site, called "Amazon Access," that is designed to make online
 shopping easier for customers who use screen access software. Screen
 access software, which reads aloud text and links, is one of the main
 tools used by the visually impaired to tap the Internet.  Amazon's new
 Web site is basically a streamlined version of its standard site, with
 less text and graphics. "We created the site for our visually impaired
 customers so it would be easier for them to navigate," Robert Frederick,
 manager of Amazon Anywhere, told CRMDaily.com. Amazon has maintained a
 text-only mode of its standard  e-commerce site since it first went
 online in 1995. However, many customers still were having trouble,
 according to Frederick. "A number of Amazon's customers had either
 e-mailed us or contacted customer service about the problems they were
 having," he said. In response, the company created a specially tailored
 site to meet their needs.   "We wanted to make sure all of our customers
 had the best shopping experience possible," Frederick said.
