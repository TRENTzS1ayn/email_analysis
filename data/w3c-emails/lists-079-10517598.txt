After some time in development, mod_accessibility is now becoming
relatively stable, and I've recently installed it live at Site Valet,
where it is working with some fairly sophisticated applications.

I'd like to start a Beta testing programme, with anyone who could
benefit from an accessibility-enhanced server or proxy.  I've made
available downloads for Linux, FreeBSD and Windows (the latter may
be optimistic, but works for me in a very limited test case:-)

Anyone interested in this, please feel free to download the
relevant version.  A message to let me know you're using it will
be appreciated, and your experiences (good or bad), bug reports,
and suggestions for improvements even more so.

For anyone who hasn't yet seen the blurb, mod_accessibility is a fully
automatic aid to making websites more accessible. It serves to improve
Websites and Intranets for everyone:

* For users, a range of accessibility options to choose from.
* For developers and webmasters, an accessibility-enhanced version of your
  site for no effort.
* For server administrators, a simple plugin that doesn't hit your
  server, nor involve a learning curve and new support requirements.
* For managers, a major step towards ensuring you meet your obligations
  under disability discrimination law.
* For ISPs and Web hosts, a value-added service for your customers.
