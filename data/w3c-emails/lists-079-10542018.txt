Dave Poehlman says the new Amazon/Access site is easy to use and nice and 
clean.

This is tremendous news.

I don't think it any accident that this announcement closely followed the
announcement of Amazon's venture into voice browsing (partnered with AT&T 
Wireless).

Device Independent Authoring and a concomitantly more accessible face is
well on its way to being part and parcel of the ante, the minimum investment
to get into the game of eCommerce, at this rate.

Jeff Bezos has just put me out of the futurist business.  The future I've been
predicting is now on the street where every Yahoo can plainly see it.

Bad for my business.
Good for Web accessibility.

>  Amazon.com (Nasdaq: AMZN) on Thursday launched an alternative version of
>  its Web site, called "Amazon Access," that is designed to make online
>  shopping easier for customers who use screen access software. Screen
>  access software, which reads aloud text and links, is one of the main
>  tools used by the visually impaired to tap the Internet.  Amazon's new
>  Web site is basically a streamlined version of its standard site, with
>  less text and graphics. "We created the site for our visually impaired
>  customers so it would be easier for them to navigate," Robert Frederick,
>  manager of Amazon Anywhere, told CRMDaily.com. Amazon has maintained a
>  text-only mode of its standard  e-commerce site since it first went
>  online in 1995. However, many customers still were having trouble,
>  according to Frederick. "A number of Amazon's customers had either
>  e-mailed us or contacted customer service about the problems they were
>  having," he said. In response, the company created a specially tailored
>  site to meet their needs.   "We wanted to make sure all of our customers
>  had the best shopping experience possible," Frederick said.
