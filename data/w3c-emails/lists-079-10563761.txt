Hi wai-ig

In response to Nick and Bill, I would like to propose a new approach to the use of the ACCESSKEY.

Please consider the ideas in my article:

Use first letter as ACCESSKEY
www.klapmusen.dk/artikel.aspx?xml=20021031&lg=en
(a new approach to the use of the ACCESSKEY)

1. If we always use first letter of the link text as ACCESSKEY, they can be generated by code.
2. We do not have to mark the access key letter, because it is always the first one.
3. We can have scores of access keys on each page, because the same access key letter can be used many times.

Please read my article carefully, and think it over before responding. If we do it right, the ACCESSKEY could become a benefit to all keyboard users of the Internet.

Cheers, 
Jesper Tverskov
