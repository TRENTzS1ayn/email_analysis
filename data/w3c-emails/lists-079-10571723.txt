This is a good example of the disadvantage of having a "text only" copy of a
website for accessibility purposes. Apart from the argument that text-only
versions enforce segregation there is the underlying problem of keeping two
sites up-to-date.

For example, from http://www.amazon.com/ and enter "Accessibility" as the
keyword.
Do the same for http://www.amazon.com/access

For Books, the former returns:

1.) Maximum Accessibility: Making Your Website More Usable for Everyone
2.) CARM: California Accessibility Reference Manual
3.) A Basic Guide to Fair Housing Accessibility: Everything Architects and
Builders Need to Know About Fair Housing Act Accessibility Guidelines

while the latter returns

1.) Maximum Accessibility: Making Your Website More Usable for Everyone
2.) Web Accessibility for People With Disabilities
3.) Pocket Guide to the ADA: Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility
Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities, Revised Edition


I would expect to get the same search results no matter which front-end I
used (since Amazon is largely a database driven website), but this seems not
to be the case.

Recalling from Joe Clark's book (which I'm reading at the moment) "Separate
pages are not equal".
