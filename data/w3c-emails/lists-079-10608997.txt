Yes, it is absolutely reasonable for a first time visitor to think this.

No, it is not reasonable for the accessibility community to demand this.

So, once again for the gang:

The user gets the same 181 books in either case.

The difference comes in how these 181 hits are segmented into partial reports.

The decisions that affect how many and which of these hits show up on the
first screen are reasonable to change when the user does it himself with a
machine reader or with a human reader who can scan a longer list of hits
quickly.

The two intermediaries have different performance characteristics and it is
appropriate for the service feeding the intermediary to act differently in a
way that improves end-to-end performance independenly in each case 
(differing delivery contexts) without decreasing accessibility.

Accessibility in this case is the fact that you find the 181 hits and can
navigate to any of them.

Yes we care about usability and performance.  But it is better to give the
best performance under the changing circumstances by changing the behavior;
rather than the same behavior that is best in one case and not best in the
other.
