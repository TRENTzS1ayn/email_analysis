This isn't always true. That is how some browsers handle access keys,
especially on MS Windows systems. Other systems use different keys. A
list of implmentations on a number of systems can be found at

What is a browser supposed to do when two access keys share the same
letter? Currently (In Mozilla at least) you hit Alt+AK and the browser
takes you to the page. How do you deal with conflicts between access
keys?

This requires that users retrain themselves to stop holding down the
alt key when they press another letter to access the menu. It also
fails to address other uses of the key, for example in Internet
Explorer for Windows the key combination Alt+d gives the focus to the
address bar. This makes it easy to type a new address in OR to copy or
edit the existing URL.
