That's excellent news. What is old news, however, is that the Amazon
Access experiment is an arse-backwards idea that can, under
easy-to-reproduce conditions, return different results from the real
Amazon page. Moreover, there are still things you can do on the real
site that you can't on the allegedly-accessible site. (Gold Box,
anyone?)

It's all been well discussed by now, you know.

Amazon has quite enough money and skill to have done things
properly. Or to have at least fixed its myriad mistakes-- to have
unmuffed it, one might say in the vernacular.
