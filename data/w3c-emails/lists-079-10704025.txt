about the two ways of using the ALT-key:

This is not my experience with IE.  Taking the example David gave, Alt+d to
set focus to the address bar, this shortcut doesn't work unless alt is held
down.  The only shortcuts that seem to be saved by separating the keypresses
are f,e,v,a,t, and h.

Am I missing something?


My comment:
You are right about ALT+D! This seems to be the exception. I have learned
something new today! I am using F6 for the important address field in the IE
browser. This could be used instead of ALT+D.

But pleeeeeeeeease, this is not the issue. The issue is how to make the
ACCESSKEY attribute useful for millions of users. The traditional way of
using ACCESSKEY is of no use at all, it has never been used in real life to
any extend worth mentioning, and are never going to be used.

"First letter as ACCESSKEY" has a chance of becoming main stream
accessibility, if we give it a try.
