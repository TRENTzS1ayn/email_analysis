If you can (and *want*) to follow 2 threads at once you can opt to open
another window (shift+click, shift+enter or selecting from a context menu
being three ways of doing that that work on IE, NS and MOZ).

If you can't or don't want to why should somebody force you to try?

Ironically one of the problems with poorly written pop-ups (the ones that
use javascript from the href, or without using the href as a non-javascript
back-up) is that they break when someone actually does choose to open a new
window!
