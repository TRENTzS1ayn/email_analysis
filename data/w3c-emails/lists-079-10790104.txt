In a webpage context, yes.  When I raised the subject, I had in mind
an application context, in which users might learn a standardised set of
accesskeys for the application.  Since that's a learning curve, 
standardisation seems to be the key to usefulness.

Yes, that's precisely the problem, and the reason for my question!

mod_accessibility is an application.  But the users who will benefit
from it are reading web pages.  I'd like to assign default accesskeys
to the application, but in a manner that also works on webpages.

Use of first letter is one option, but could at worst be actively
harmful if it clashes with someone's existing UA controls!
