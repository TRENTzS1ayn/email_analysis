I think that may be a bit over-optimistic.  It cannot do anything about
information that isn't there, or is hidden away in Flash, PDF or (in
many cases) Javascript, nor can it add intelligent ALTs.  In a sense it's
at its best when a page is already well-structured: for example, the many
long pages at www.w3.org would certainly benefit from the outlining
capability.

Basically right, but it's a little more than that - it can fetch some
information from elsewhere.  But I'd regard its strongest point as
being the choice of views it offers.  A user who is struggling with
a page can switch view at a single click or (if I sort out some
accesskeys) keystroke.  In some cases, this might alleviate the GIGO
problem - though only experience will tell.

Thank you:-)
