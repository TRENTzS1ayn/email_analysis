Jon,

Is there a way to follow 2 threads using HTML* without using a pop up?

It seems to me there is not, and this might be a problem. Many 
interests involve activities that occur concurrently, cookery being one.
mash potato is normally made whilst the mince is being prepared. Cooks 
flick between the two recipes.
Given that our resources are full page photos of each step, and run to 
about 10-15 pages per recipe: the back button is not useful,

thanks

Jonathan

*I'd prefer not to have a pop up, please read the original email copied 
below.
the shepherd's pie link does not use a pop up, but the dhtml 
alternatives, seem complex.
We may need a techniques document just to explain them.

for example using image and text swapping to load the current position 
for each thread into a single window.

By having a popup window, I can follow 2 threads at once.

Is there a suitable way to do this with HTML?
or would anyone care to suggest a means using DHTML?

do popups have a use?

as an example of 2 threads visit the nearly complete shepherds pie 
recipe here: http://www.peepo.com/2k3/shepherds-pie/
one needs to make mince and mash at the same time, but interleaving 
these two processes would not be helpful.
