This is a really annoying number of years that keeps getting pulled out of 
thin air repeatedly.  There is nothing to substantiate it, or to make me 
believe it accurate.

Already from this thread we have some alternates to explore:

1) An implementation along the lines of Mozilla's Find as you Type.
2) Finding another trigger for accesskeys besides using the system modifier 
key (which forces accesskeys into competition with OS accesskeys).

There, that didn't take 5 years to think of.
