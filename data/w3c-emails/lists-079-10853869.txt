I consider this to be much less complicated.

Lets compare:

(1) Traditional access key support

* Hold down Alt and press key. May conflict with built in shortcuts

(2) First letter as access key

* Hold down Alt and tap key repeatedly until desired link is
  highlighted. May conflict with built in shortcuts
* Always uses the last link on the page to match in Mozilla
* Cycles links with that letter in IE

(3) Find As You Type

* Tap first letter of link repeatedly until desired link is
  highlighted (no possibility of conflict with browser shortcuts)
  (This is exactly like First Letter As Access key as handled by IE
  except a modifier key is not required and it can't conflict)

OR

* Type the link name (which is, for a reasonable typist, much faster
  if there are a lot of links on a page)

An it seems likely it will make it in to the preferences at some
stage.

Evidence? Microsoft has a something of a history of leaching good
ideas from competitors.

Besides, people who find such a feature really useful can usually
switch to a different browser..

(1) Users have to retrain to stop themselves holding down Alt when
    they try to activate menus with the keyboard.

(2) Mozilla (on my system) always activates the LAST link that matches
    the access key.
