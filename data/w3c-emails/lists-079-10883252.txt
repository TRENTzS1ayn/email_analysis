1)

There is no need to compare Mozilla's implementation of "Find As You Type"
with the old ways of using ALT (Cmd in Mac, etc.) for access key letters.

The Mozilla implementation is far superior, second to none. But not as it is
implemented as default at the moment. It took me several hours to try to
figure out how it worked, and after a lot of frustrations I had to read the
documentation before I saw the light. And I have already forgotten most of
the documentation!

If "Find As You Type" should be easy to use, it should by default only work
for the first letter in link text, and then move on to the next first letter
of the next link text beginning with that letter. If this is implemented as
default, "Find As You Type" is probably the very best solution imaginable
and even the best of all worlds!

Power users will be able to switch on all the advanced features of "Find as
You Type".

2)

When we think of Microsoft's great record when it comes to Accessibility (at
least they have made progress over the years), you are probably right, that
we could convince Microsoft to implement a similar feature in Internet
Explorer.

We should also try to get such a feature into W3C's User Agent Accessibility
Guidelines.

3)

"Find As You Type" has the potential of becoming a very great alternative to
the HTML ACCESSKEY and even to make it obsolete, and to solve all the
traditional problems of access keys to links in web pages.

But it depends on the willingness of other user agents to implement the same
ideas. Why not put pressure on them by implementing first letter as HTML
access keys already today on all our web pages, as proposed in my article
;-).

I consider this to be much less complicated.

Lets compare:

(1) Traditional access key support

* Hold down Alt and press key. May conflict with built in shortcuts

(2) First letter as access key

* Hold down Alt and tap key repeatedly until desired link is
  highlighted. May conflict with built in shortcuts
* Always uses the last link on the page to match in Mozilla
* Cycles links with that letter in IE

(3) Find As You Type

* Tap first letter of link repeatedly until desired link is
  highlighted (no possibility of conflict with browser shortcuts)
  (This is exactly like First Letter As Access key as handled by IE
  except a modifier key is not required and it can't conflict)

OR

* Type the link name (which is, for a reasonable typist, much faster
  if there are a lot of links on a page)

An it seems likely it will make it in to the preferences at some
stage.

Evidence? Microsoft has a something of a history of leaching good
ideas from competitors.

Besides, people who find such a feature really useful can usually
switch to a different browser..

(1) Users have to retrain to stop themselves holding down Alt when
    they try to activate menus with the keyboard.

(2) Mozilla (on my system) always activates the LAST link that matches
    the access key.
