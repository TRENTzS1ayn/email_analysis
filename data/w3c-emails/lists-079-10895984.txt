You could use popups for this, although they are annoying, and if 
people are going to be confused by getting several windows at once it 
is worth thinking some more about a better way.

You could split the screen using frames, or interleave the steps from 
each process into a single story about what to do. There may be other 
approaches.

Thoughts?

cheers
