You're comparing the wrong timeframe.

5-10 years keeps getting thrown around as a timeframe to invent and 
implement an alternative to accesskey.  You're citing how long since 
implementation of CSS2 it's taken for browser support to ramp up.

Yes, the time for UAs to implement something after it reaches 
recommendation is important, but that's not what I'm talking about here, 
nor what 5-10 years is being cited for in the thread.
