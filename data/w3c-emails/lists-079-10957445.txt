CSS2 is over 5 years old; there is no browser that supports it fully
and many with very broken support still in use.

5-10 years keeps getting thrown around as a timeframe to invent and
implement an alternative to accesskey.  You're citing how long since
implementation of CSS2 it's taken for browser support to ramp up.

I would like to add:
ACCESSKEY as far as I remember is from the HTML 4.0 spec from late 1997 more
than 5 years ago. A great user agent like Opera does not support it yet.
