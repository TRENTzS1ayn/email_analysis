Frames are not to my knowledge used for this purpose* elsewhere, if 
anyone knows different please post a URI.
Should the frames be equal or the current image large with a small 
window linking to the other thread?
Where are the usability examples? (For many of our students, having 2 
threads running in one window may be too complex.)

So the HTML bug is perhaps not that frames cannot be bookmarked, but 
that multi-threading is not too well supported.

thanks


Jonathan

*compare with a recipe book, the page is open on one thread,  with a 
bookmark in another, the bookmark is moved.
or two recipe books are both open, very few displays are suitable for 
displaying 2 pages side by side.
This means the additional complexity of using dhtml to switch frame 
content
