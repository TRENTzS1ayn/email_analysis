About Opera and ACCESSKEY

I have now re-tested this version of OPERA:

Version 7.0
Build 2345
Platform Win32
System Windows XP
 
The HTML ACCESSKEY attribute is not supported. At least not as default.
There could be some advanced options I do not know about.

Cheers,
Jesper Tverskov

Actually, it does - as of version 7. (In a quirky way, and some people could
not get it to work in the latest beta, but it did work for others. I have't
tried the latest release (7.02) yet.)
