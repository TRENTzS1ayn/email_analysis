In this case I am not sure that there are obvious reasons not to use 
frames. I don't see any obvious reasons, anyway. They would allow you 
to have all the information in a single Window, moving through each 
story independently.

The DHTML version is likely to be pretty simple too - two sets of stuff 
that you flip through (this lets you make sure you get to the right 
point at the end - rather than thinking you can make the pie and finish 
it without actually having the mince in there...)

Making it as broadly accessible as possible is a bit tricky - easier 
for frames, but the end point is harder there

cheers
