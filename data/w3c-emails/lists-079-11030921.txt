Chaals,

did you read the previous post? we are 5 years down the line and the 
web is still essentially single threaded.

frames in my experience are used as navigation, hence their name ... 
frames.
frames could do this job, as could DHTML, but they don't provide a 
standardised, accessible process.

the ability to identify where the user is is critical, perhaps not for 
this example, but consider where any problem or issue has been 
identified.
eg comparing 2 photographs. frames does not allow this. There is an 
additional serious problem: say they are copyright, if they are in a 
popup, that may be OK, in a frame they probably are not.....

you say the DHTML example is simple, I cannot see that it is, we dont 
have any usability/accessibility data. presumably each window at least 
needs a back button, but I wonder does it end there?
How do we log where the user is? presumably this could be in the URI, 
but as it is not a standard, and frames weren't designed with this in 
mind, it still remains to be standardised.
How about the case where a security guard is monitoring 7 smil video 
streams and wants to identify an incident? is this all going to be done 
on an individual coder's whim?
nb: games often rely on having a number of viewpoints.

My current solution is to run at least 2 monitors at a time, and switch 
between multiple windows. I use the history and back buttons plenty as 
well.
This hardly helps to keep things simple and standardised, and is very 
time consuming. For my students an impossible mess that could do with 
being sorted.

Has anyone got one of these 17" jobs yet, or a decent URI of a working 
example
I'd love to create a window with radio in one corner frame, news in 
another,  but as no one seems to have done this, probably one gets sued.
also if one wants to bookmark this window one cannot, and this is a 
serious defect.

Jonathan
