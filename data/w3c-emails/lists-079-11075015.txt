I've just run a Bobby check on a page containing the following code snippet:

 <form name="Login" method="post" action="validate.asp" onsubmit="return checkForm(this)">
 <table width="50%" cellpadding="5">
 <tr>
<td>DfES Number</td>
<td><input type="text" maxlength="4" name="LogonID" id="LogonID"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Password</td>
<td><input type="password" maxlength="6" name="PassID" id="PassID"></td> 
</tr>
</table>
<blockquote>
<input class="button" type="submit" name="Submit" value="Enter">
</blockquote>
</form>

Aside from the bad use of <blockquote> (I didn't write it) there seems to be a problem when checking for compliance using Bobby (online version). I was pretty sure before testing that it would return some priority 2 errors about associating labels with form elements but it didn't. Can anyone shed any light as to why?

thanks
Julian Scarlett
