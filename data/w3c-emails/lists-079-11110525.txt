I threw that code as is between body tags on an HTML 4.01 trans page and 
Bobby flagged the label issue.

Some possibilities:

1) Something else funny in your page's particular code is confusing Bobby 
(can you post the URL?)
2) You inadvertently didn't have it set to flag WAI AA issues.
3) It's Friday and it's just slacking off.
