 From the various responses to the 2 things at once thread, it seems 
there is still plenty of work considering what is possible, and very 
little yet done on setting standards.

given that if someone clicks on a 'listen' radio link, they expect 
radio to play.
the possible options are:in a frame, a pop-up, pop-under or an option 
to open in a new window

This relies on knowing the abilities of the user, or at least making 
assumptions about their abilities.

Frames are not great because they impinge on the rights of the 
originating station(unless...).
shift, assumes a keyboard, aquaintance with the shortcut, and there is 
an additional problem that the new window will not be sized 
appropriately.
DHTML techniques are available, but they are not publicised by WAI 
AFAIK.

Blind users, and others do have problems with pop-ups, but this does 
not appear to be an over-riding argument.

I'd prefer not to use pop-ups, but we need much better guidance on 
appropriate alternatives. A bland refutation is not sufficient.
