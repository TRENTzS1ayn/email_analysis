If one suggests a plain link as a possible option, should  it resize 
the window? as this apparently is not recognised by the back button, 
one can quickly get in a pickle, and it is somewhat irrational to 
expect the average user to desire a full-size window, together with the 
somewhat dubious pleasure of resizing the window under their own 
control.....(hence, one may need to differentiate shift click and click)

this was discussed recently in another thread, but to avoid confusion, 
thought it perhaps best to duplicate here.
