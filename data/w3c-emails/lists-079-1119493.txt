There are many other ways of hiding css from NS4x other than using  @import.
I'm working on a 'little' project to see if it's possible to set up a bunch
of css that will effectively sniff out as many browsers as possible. As soon
as I have something worth showing I will put it up live and invite people to
view the page and post back to me what they see as a refining process using
those browsers/platforms that I don't have installed( Mac and WebTV being
some of them). My aim is to develop a template for a css structure that will
be usable by developers to modify according to their needs. Of course, I
might find that it isn't actually possible but I won't find out unless I try
;-)

regards

Julian
