The negativity seems to be aimed at people "embracing and extending" (read:
redefining semantics to fit their narrow scope of their tools) what
semantics is about, not the Semantic Web itself. The example given was
"object-orientated" which became associated with a graphical windowing
system rather than a programming framework.

Although I think Mr Poutain is making the common mistake of thinking that
the Semantic Web will solve all AI problems and is a complete solution for
AI -- which it really isn't. As quoted:

"The best we can do is to try and encode the meaning some symbol string has
for us into the string itself, then get the computer to manipulate it in its
usual dumb-but-rapid way." -- Isn't that the actual aim anyway? The actual
"leap of logic" would still be done by a human being - based on aggregated
and filtered information provided by the automaton.

The objection that the Semantic Web creates exponential explosion of data -
well haven't we solved that "problem" with the Web itself - a distributed
scalable system? There doesn't seem to be a problem with exponentially
growing data on the web - with tools like blogs and RSS filtering out the
noise and returning the real juicy stuff? I'm pretty sure Google would love
the new opportunities of searching that semantically encapsulated data
contains

I don't think the article is too negative, its just a warning of the
catch-word bandwagon that tools like to jump on whether they implement the
technology or not. "Windows Notepad - now with Semantic Web Support!!!"

(Apologies if I'm preaching to the converted)
