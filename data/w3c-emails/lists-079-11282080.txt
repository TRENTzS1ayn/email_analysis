I get your point.  What would an attorney do with the phrase "identified
with functional text".  Clearly, most list members would believe that the
meaning of the rule is that any information generated by a script must be
provided in a way that can be accessed by assistive technologies.  In your
example, this would be the actual bus schedule, not just words that say,
"the bus schedule is below this text".

However, I've heard a lot of nit-picking over language in WCAG and 508, and
would be interested to hear what a lawyer would say about the meaning of
this specific phrase of the rule.  Any lawyers out there?
