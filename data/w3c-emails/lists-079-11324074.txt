Are there any list members familiar with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's
"Accessible PA" web site
<http://www.accessiblepa.state.pa.us/accessiblepa/site/default.asp> who
could comment on concept of having a separate, accessible set of web pages
for select state agencies serving people with disabilities?  According to
the site:

"Accessible PA combines the latest information on programs and services in
one convenient site for people of all ages with disabilities, as well as
their families and support providers."
