If not it shouldn't be too difficult to take an existing program such
as Hep, point lynx at it with --dump, pipe the output in to Festival,
then pipe its output in to an mp3 encoder. (All via Cron).

Unfortunatly this wouldn't be too good for RSS feeds that only include
article summaries and the audio output from festival rather gets on my
nerves :)
