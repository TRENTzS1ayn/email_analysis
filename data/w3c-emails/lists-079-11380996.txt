Hi,

I am developing a site using XHTML and CSS that degrades gracefully to 
a linear format for older browsers and text readers.

Users with their own stylesheets should be able to override the site 
colours and font sizes without any problems.

The problem we have is that the client wants the content to be centred 
on the page with some fixed width columns - if you try to increase the 
font size in the browser some of the content ends up overlapping from 
one column to the one beside it.  It only happens with the menu column 
down the left hand side when there are long words in the menu.

I can get around this by providing a 'text only' style link on the page 
so that users with problems can get the linear version.

Ideally I should try to persuade the client to move to more flexible 
columns, but I have failed so far.

What would you suggest the best way to go with this is?

I would appreciate your feedback.

Cheers,

Julian Voelcker
