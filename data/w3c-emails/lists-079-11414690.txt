Does the client know about the cost of fixing the width of the menus? Have
you established why the client requires the columns to be a fixed width?
Note that a client's perception of a fixed width is based on the current
font-size. From a CSS perspective, a "fixed width" in ems is an option,
since it follows the same perception.

AIUI 'text only' should only be a last resort if other alternatives cannot
present an accessible website. The purpose of accessibility-minded
legislation is to re-introduce equality between disbled people and
non-disabled. There is a general feeling that "equality through separation"
is no equality at all. I would tend to agree with that.

Well, you have tried. I'm curious though, what was the client's reaction
when he saw the overlap?
