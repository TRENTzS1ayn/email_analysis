That's a good question, the main thing though is that it is not a text only
page for two reasons at least.  one is that it separates us out as is
mentioned in another message and the other is that text only is not too
accessible.  call it the universal link or the alternate link.  I'm not sure
what to call it.  It is certainly not non graphical some call them low
bandwidth but only if that is the case.
how about wcag compliant version link?

Hi David,

OK, so you are suggesting doing the two versions, but rather than use a
'Text
Only' link call it something like 'Accessibility version'.

What's the best wording for it?
