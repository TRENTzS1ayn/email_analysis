It's a design issue, a process that I wasn't involved with.  Personally I 
think it does look a lot better fixed width in the middle of the screen as 
opposed to flexible full width.

Fair point.  I notice that the BBC have just revamped some of their sites and 
they have referred to it as 'low bandwidth' for a basic version of their 
site.

I still find that a lot of client's struggle to understand or be willing to 
understand the accessibility issues, most are B2B and don't believe that it 
is an issue.

Unfortunately, I don't think they will sit up and listen until something 
becomes law.
