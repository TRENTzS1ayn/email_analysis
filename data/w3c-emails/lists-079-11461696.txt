Hi David,

Thanks for the further comments.

I could use 'wcag compliant', but doubt that many people will know what it
means.

I think that I might just call the link 'full screen', 'flexible layout' or
something along those lines and get the link to change the styles so that
the
layout is a flexible full width design.
