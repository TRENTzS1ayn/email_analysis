As people in the usability field were preparing for 508 in the US to
take effect, many of them were beginning to realize how little
interaction they've had with the visual impairment world.  A consequence
of this lack of interaction is that many people who are concerned with
visual impairment issues are unaware of how the field of usability could
help improve the lives of individuals with visual impairements.

The "Usability for Visually Impaired People" (UVIP) mailing list has
been established to facilitate communication between people who are
interested in usability and people who are concerned with visual
impairment issues.  Some of the goals include:

    Helping each group understand the other group better

    Identify problems and explore possible solutions based on the knowledge,
    experience and background of each of the groups

    Share new information as it is discovered

    Explore ways to include people with visual impairments in usability testing

    Discuss approaches to improve efficiency and accuracy of visually impaired
    people when using computer interfaces

    Look at ways that people with visual impairments can handle asynchronous
    interactions, e.g. multiple instant messages
