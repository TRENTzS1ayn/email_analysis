   This topic has been around before, and I'm curious as to the overall
  opinion of the WAI-IG list as to this.

   To me it seems reasonable that three different browsers should identify
  themselves with three different User-Agent headers. Ignoring, for a moment,
  the misuse that this header has been put to, the idea to use if for
  "bug detection" as outlined in the HTTP specification seems a good one.

   Comments ?
