I'm not sure I understand the situation correctly (a URL would help). But if
an English article appears as part of an HTML document that is otherwise in
English, it should surely have markup with lang="es".

In addition to that, it might be useful to tell, in Spanish prose, that some
text in English follows, perhaps with a link for skipping over it. It would
be a warning to a person who listens to the page, and informative to anyone
who might not recognize the language. English texts are widely recognized as
being in English, but not universally. With other languages, it could be
very important to tell the language. (If the user knows the text is in, say,
Portuguese, he might, if he doesn't know Portuguese, try an automatic
translation service, or consult a friend who knows the language.
On Opera, for example, you can paint some words, right click, and
select automatic translation, but you need to select it by destination
language. Too bad the browser doesn't use the lang attribute yet.)

In principle, _any_ changes in language should be indicated in markup. In
practice, it's probably not very important at present to use language markup
for individual words.

More or less. Depends on the words used. For example, "monsieur" is probably
more commonly known among non-francophones than "bleu".

IBM Home Page Reader ( http://www-3.ibm.com/able/hpr.html )
recognizes lang attributes and uses them rather well, though
it supports a relatively small number of languages.

Besides, for a browser with sufficient CSS2 support, the user
could write a simple style sheet that presents elements
differently depending on their lang attributes.
