You would have:
<html
 lang="es"
 xml:lang="es"
 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <!-- stuff in Spanish -->
  <div lang="en" xml:lang="en">
    <!-- stuff in English -->
  </div>
  <!-- maybe more stuff in Spanish -->
</html>

lang and xml:lang are probably more important in this case, in the case of the whole document being Spanish there is at least some change of language being inferred.

A warning (in Spanish) of "this document is currently only available in English) would probably also be a good idea.

In principal you should generally use something like:

<p>
  He is a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cordon-bleu</span> chef.
</p>

In practice this could be impractical, and raises questions like "is 'cordon-bleu' English or French?" given that the term is used in English.

I take as a guideline whether I would italicise the term if I only had visual rendering available. Indeed I use a class="foreign" attribute and CSS that class to italics so that the convention of italicising foreign terms is there for graphical users.

I understand there is at least one screen reader that interprets language markup (lang and/or xml:lang).
