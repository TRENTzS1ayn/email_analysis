Dear WAI IG Participants:

Apologies for the mail flood.

Collyn Kenny has been removed from the list.

A reminder from:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/IG/Overview.html#Uselist
"If you use a vacation auto-responder on your e-mail program, make sure to 
exclude responses to any mail with w3c-wai-ig@w3.org in any header."

- Judy
