Well not that this is worth debating, but I followed the links
Jonathan gives and can find nothing remotely resembling
the subject described.  I *can* find stuff about bringing
unsolicited text messages, pop-ups, email etc. within
the kind of processes for acceptable content that other
advertisements come under but its a big step to say that
the mechanism of enforcement would be bans on these at
a technologically enforceable level which is my best guess
at the implcations Jonathan is hinting at.  Is this info somewhere
near the end of those hyperlinks and I just can't see it?
