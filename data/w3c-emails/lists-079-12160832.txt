I had a trawl through Google News earlier looking specifically for
accessibility related news ( I've documented most of them in my blog:
http://www.isolani.co.uk/blog/access.html ), but two in particular caught my
attention:

*
http://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Artic
le_Type1&c=Article&cid=1035777853292&call_pageid=968350072197&col=9690488638
51 : "Disabled Web-users flex their muscles" -- a positive story about
businesses using accessibility as a competitive advantage (non-web)
* http://www.prweb.com/releases/2003/2/prweb57151.php "Want Your Share of
$175 Billion?" -- the US version with PR spin.

Both articles highlight the point: "If the legal imperative doesn't scare
companies into compliance, sheer greed might."
