I have a friend that is totally blind that uses JAWS screen reader.  I 
asked what he felt about the "text only" concept.  He replied that his 
screen reader ignores graphics altogether.

If a graphic is in itself a link, it should be identified as such in the 
ALT or LONGDESC attributes. I think that would negate the need for "text 
only" pages.
