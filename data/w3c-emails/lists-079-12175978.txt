jaws does not ignore graphics.  It does some wonderfull things with them
depending on how they are marked up.  If a graphic has an alt tag, and you
are using ie with jaws, it will say "graphic alt" where alt is the
conditional content of the graphic.  If a graphic has an url associated with
it, we can get the url.  We can now configure jaws to do lots of things with
rendering graphics and the important thing to know is that many jaws users
are also sharing a computer and the person they are working with may not be
blind.  There are even some sighted people for one reason or another are
using jaws to work with computers.

I have been a jaws user for 10 years.

I have a friend that is totally blind that uses JAWS screen reader.  I
asked what he felt about the "text only" concept.  He replied that his
screen reader ignores graphics altogether.

If a graphic is in itself a link, it should be identified as such in the
ALT or LONGDESC attributes. I think that would negate the need for "text
only" pages.
