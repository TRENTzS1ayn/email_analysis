links are only useable in email if the function to activate them is
available.  I have not seen outlook express not be able to activate links
even as I do have html turned off.

Subject: making url links in email body useful for screen readers



Hi
I?m trying to send an email containing a url link to a testing usergroup
using screen readers.  One of my group has reported difficulties using the
link ? as ?clicking? isn?t an option and html is turned off in her outlook
express. Anyone got any ideas about sending usable url links in emails?

Thanks
