Are you sending the email as HTML or as text?

Many programs will convert http addresses in text emails to links.  Outlook
Express does this.  So if you send:
    http://www.w3.org/
then I can click on or tab to that link even though it's not encoded using
HTML.

Curiously, how did she turn off HTML in Outlook Express?
