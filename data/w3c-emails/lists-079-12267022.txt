The word is rather inaccessible to me. I can't even find any dictionary
definition for it, even in jargon or slang dictionaries, except for
the definition 'a twist-top bottle of beer'. Some googling suggests that
it might be some Adobe parlance for some kind of a clickable icon.
With further googling, I found some pages referring to triangular items
that expand to menus as "twisties".

Well, _that's_ something I know - to be horrendous. They're tiny, far too
small for even a man with relatively normal eyesight and hand-coordination
to hit, and confusing in functionality, and presumably often completely
dependent on Javascript. Isn't this enough?
