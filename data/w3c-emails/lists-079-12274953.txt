In this case, we have an arrow image as a clickable link as well as a
standard href which the user can click. I understand that the javascript is
an inherent problem, but we have a standard operating environment where we
know what programs people are using. We are trying to provide an efficient
solution for the business while trying to provide equal access to
speech-browser users. In some instances, the former outweighs the latter.
Against the will of myself and others. Can anyone suggest an alternative to
using twisties ?

The word is rather inaccessible to me. I can't even find any dictionary
definition for it, even in jargon or slang dictionaries, except for
the definition 'a twist-top bottle of beer'. Some googling suggests that
it might be some Adobe parlance for some kind of a clickable icon.
With further googling, I found some pages referring to triangular items
that expand to menus as "twisties".

Well, _that's_ something I know - to be horrendous. They're tiny, far too
small for even a man with relatively normal eyesight and hand-coordination
to hit, and confusing in functionality, and presumably often completely
dependent on Javascript. Isn't this enough?
