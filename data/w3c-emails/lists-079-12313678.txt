I wish Freedom Scientific would specify the date of issuance of
documents like these, *but* the release notes for version 4.51 of
Jaws are up.

<http://www.freedomscientific.com/fs_downloads/DL_JAWS451.asp>

I'm presuming this is a relatively new document. Googling for
previous mentions on this list found nothing.

At any rate, lots of apparent improvements in HTML interpretation.
