I've always wondered why people feel the need to do this.  This is not
an accessibility ghetto thing; it is something that was introduced in
mainstream web pages, but not done in the Visual Basic applications
which the design is trying to emulate.

A missing alt makes the HTML invalid.  I think the idea was that requiring
the attribute would make people think about it, but, of course, people just
use authoring tools that insert alt="", alt="<value of src attribute>",
etc., or don't validate anyway.

I'm not quite sure of the point, but I would suggest that this process 
leaves you with an accessibility/usabiliity problem, unfixed.  I.E.
it is hiding the problem from the checker without removing it.
