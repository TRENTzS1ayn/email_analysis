and if you are using text, you never know wheather it is "just for
pretty" or critical information...I think EVERY piece of graphic no matter
how unimportant the writer thinks it is (well it must be important he
coded it) it should be left to the reader to decide if it is
valuable. even if the alt tag is "pretty curlicues" it should be there.  I
don't think any alt should ever be empty for any reason if it displays for
any user the information should be there for every user.
