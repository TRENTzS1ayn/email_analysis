You bring up very good points here. As a native English speaker, a vast part
of my vocabulary is derived from other languages (hence the nightmare of
learning to spell correctly!). Most words I use are accepted as "proper"
English, even if perhaps they were borrowed quite recently from elsewhere
and may still be pronounced in a way that reflects their origin.

Perhaps less of a problem for pronunciation, but definitely for
understanding, can be different usages / grammar in UK and US English, for
example. I cannot even begin to think about how this might be tackled!

As language is a moving target (except in those countries with a strictly
controlled vocabulary), so will be the way we attempt to assist its
understanding.
