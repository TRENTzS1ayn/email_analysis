Hi everyone,

The next session of the IWA/HWG D201 online course, "Accessible
Web Design," is starting on March 17.  You can enroll until March
24.  The cost for this online class is $180, or $80 for IWA/HWG
members.  You can enroll or find out more at the following address:

This class is taught by me and my wife Liz, and features peer-to-peer
interaction as well as course readings and exercises.

This week I am working on the usual update before each class; if you
have taken the class before and have any constructive feedback, please
drop me a note at kynn-d201@kynn.com -- thanks!
