That's a fault in the user agent.  I think one should only work round those
when major user agents are at fault.

I think the reason that marketing people like these is that they believe
that users are too stupid to understand the basic controls provided by
their software, and, for some reason, don't like labelling the controls
properly, outside of the input field.

Of course, designers like hiding basic controls, particularly links, in
creative design.
