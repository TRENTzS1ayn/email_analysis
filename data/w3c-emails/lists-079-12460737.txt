I was just writing a news piece for http://www.accessify.com based on
Kynn Bartlett's announcement of the latest HWG accessibility course.

Whilst I was cosing the post I put in the necessary acronym tag to cover
HWG like so:

<acronym title="HTML Writers Guild">HWG</acronym>

Then I realised that the acronym title attribute actually contains an
acronym in its self. Can accessibility go too far?

What's a fella to do?

Tim
