Ref.: Problem with Narrator reading italicised words on a web page

Can someone please advise.

I am having difficulty with .htm pages where Narrator is not correctly
reading some of the italicised words. I've included example .htm code below
that illustrates my problem. 

The Narrator application (accessible via
Start>Programs>Accessories>Accessibility>Narrator) reads the first
italicised words (Golden Pages) correctly but not the 2nd, which are coded
the exact same. 

How can I ensure that every italicised word is read consistently by the
Narrator application?

Yours sincerely,

Paul Egan
