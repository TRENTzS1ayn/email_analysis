Joe,

I'll submit http://www.peepo.com as one-five page(s) or a site.

To my view this is something for the user to control.
Given the possible development of sites with enhanced semantic and meta 
content, this is likely to require even greater user specification, if 
it is to function.

That's really very amusing. Can you give us five examples of pages--
even single pages-- where the stylesheet declarations for the <a>
element make it absolutely indistinguishable from surrounding text
or content?
