although the target is not a bulls eye, we will not achieve comparable and
equivilant access till we knock down that barrier.

Oh, who cares? I use a Mac and even I think that there's nothing
wrong with operating-system-specific software. I'm having a hard

system. Access Systems' complaint here has nothing to do with
improved accessibility for disabled people. It's purely an
anti-Windows reflex.
