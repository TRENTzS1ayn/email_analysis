Should esteemed listmembers be interested, the speaking notes from my 
presentation at the South by Southwest Interactive Festival, entitled 
"High Design, High Accessibility," are up.

<http://joeclark.org/sxsw/>
<http://joeclark.org/sxsw/notes/>

They're rather similar to the notes from a previous presentation: 
<http://joeclark.org/tupa/>. I'll be expanding the SXSW notes later, 
with links requested by my adoring public.

And how *did* it go, you ask? Swimmingly:

Ask me sometime about dragging Ian Lloyd up on stage, karaoke-style!
