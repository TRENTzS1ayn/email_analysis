That's not what I was saying.  What I'm saying is that they like 
changing the design so that if one tells one's elderly relative to
look for blue underlined text, they will completely miss the links.

It would take me a while to find the article, but I once picked a page
on a relatively conventional e-commerce site that was most of the
way to having five different paradigms for links on one page.  Finding
pages that don't try to restyle links is more difficult than finding
ones that do.

Regular web users completely underestimate the amount of knowledge about
design conventions that is needed to work out how to use a web page
without waving the mouse around looking for links to appear on the
status line.

In the case of an neophyte elderly user, if you are to get them started,
the instructions for using the web need to fit on a single handwritten
page.  That would be possible if people didn't try to be creative, but
isn't in the real world.
