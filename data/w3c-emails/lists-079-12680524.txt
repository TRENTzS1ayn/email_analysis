This is a common practice though it would be better to use a completely
empty string ([alt=""] not [alt=" "]) as some browsers (Ahem, Win IE) will
display an empty tooltip artifact. I agree that images with no meaning other
than style (example: [alt="content box corner"] should probably be [alt=""])
should remain unspoken, but any graphic that conveys any real meaning should
have an equivalent alt description. The previous example [alt="pretty
curlicues"] may or may not be necessary depending on the circumstance.

There are, of course graphics, that are used as "spacers."  This may no be
"good design" but it is done all the time.  It seems to legitmate to
recommend that the alt tag for these be [alt=" "] rather than
[alt="space"]... Bill
