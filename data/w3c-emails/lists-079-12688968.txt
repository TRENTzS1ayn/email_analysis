Could someone advise me is it possible to change the default value for 
a button of input type="file" in a <form>

the default seems to be " browse" and that is not appropriate.

it may be my code but i have tried value="find" without success

thanks

No doubt this is not the correct place to ask, my apologies


Jonathan
