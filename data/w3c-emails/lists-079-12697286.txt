It seems to me that in providing text descriptions of graphics, we really must
consider the intent of the content provider in deciding the thoroughness of the
descriptions.  If the image is provided to "dress up" the page, not, therefore
adding to the substance of the content, then it would seem to me that the briefer
description would be appropriate for the alt tag.  If, on the otherhand, the image
is illustrative of some key point to be made that amplifies the rest of the content,
then a more detailed description would be appropriate.  If the designers are
enamored of a detailed description of the image used for decorative purposes for
some reason, in addition to the shorter alt tag, they can always add a "D" link
which can be by-passed by the reader in a hurry.
