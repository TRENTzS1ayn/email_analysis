If the implementation of file input involves a button, then the text in
the button is up to the user agent.

The text in the button tends to vary according to the language of the user
agent, i.e. the language used in its user interface like menus, help
texts, and error messages.

Why do you think "find" would be an improvement?

When I use, say, Opera (Finnish version), a file input element appears as
as a box for a filename together with a button with the text "Valitse" on
it. It may look odd on a page in English, for example, but that's what I'm
accustomed to as a user of that browser. If you managed to change it to
"find", it would look like a submit button to me.

The important thing is the recognizability of a browse button as a browse
button. When you first encounter one, you are probably puzzled. Later, you
will remember what you learned, and expect a button with some specific
text act as a way of browsing your computer's file system.

File input elements - or, rather, their poor implementation in browsers -
involves serious accessibility problems. Some of them are discussed at my
