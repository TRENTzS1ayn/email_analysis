Dear WAI Interest Group Participants:

For WAI participants who are attending the CSUN 2003 Conference in Los 
Angeles, please note that our traditional post-CSUN WAI Interest Group 
meeting will be held on Saturday 22 March, from 3:00pm to 6:00pm.

Pre-registration is available, and is required, so that we know how many 
people to expect at the meeting.
         An agenda page for the WAI Interest Group meeting is available:
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/IG/2003/03-agenda.html
         and pre-registration is available at:
         http://cgi.w3.org/Register/selectUser.pl?_w3c_meetingName=WIGmar2003

In addition there are meetings of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 
Working Group and the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines Working Group 
after the CSUN Conference, for people who are active participants of those 
groups, or who are interested in becoming active participants in these 
working groups. Information on those meetings is available, and 
pre-registration (required for attendees) is linked from the agenda pages 
for those meetings:

There are many presentations on different Web accessibility topics among 
the sessions during the CSUN 2003 Conference. Here is just a sampling of 
some of the sessions, including some sessions in which WAI staff and/or 
Chairs of WAI working groups are presenting, along with information on 
session times and locations (please confirm in your conference schedule
