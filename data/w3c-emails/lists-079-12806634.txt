To me, these look like tactics for defeating Bobby, not good practice.
As far as I can see, confusing adjacent links is not a problem limited
to screen readers.  To not require proper separation, one would probably
need something like the boxes around links that are displayed (at least
with ghostview) in the PDF version of the HTML specification.  Broken
underlines offer no clue; solid underlines need careful inspection; the
current practice of no underlines doesn't help at all.

Note according to the email header's character set, "bobbying" is surrounded
by a superscript 3 and and a superscript 2 and there is a soft hyphen,
surrounded by spaces between "something" and "and".  At a guess, you've
used a raw Macintosh character set file and sent it with headers suggesting
the more universally supported ISO 8859/1 character set.

I guess that the 2 and 3 are quotes, but I don't know what the soft hyphen
is meant to be.  I don't have the recode utility on this system to fix
it up to see.

Your email content-type header:

Content-type: text/plain; charset="ISO-8859-1"

Valid email formatting requires the IANA name for the Macintosh character
set, although best accessibility practice would be to use ASCII for the
quotes, and probably the HTML entity for the other character, assuming 
it was content, not punctuation.
