Just like the problem of making silk purses from sow's ears, you 
probably can't do it.

The problem isn't you, it is that Narrator must have a bug in it. The 
best you can do is write to the developer, explain the problem, and ask 
them to let you know if there is a new version that fixes it.

cheers
