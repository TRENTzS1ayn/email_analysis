All,

There is a new test tool being worked on called Cynthia(tm).  It may be
of interest to you. It is located at: http://cynthia.contentquality.com/

It is being developed jointly by HiSoftware, ICDRI and The Internet
Society Disability Chapter.  Please give it a try and let us know what
you think, and what problems you encounter.  Please send comments,
suggestions, and problem descriptions  to mburks952@att.net

"Cynthia" is a web content accessibility validation solution, it is
designed to identify errors in design related to Section 508 standards
and the W3C WCAG guidelines. It is also designed to educate web site
developers in the development of Web Based content so that is accessible
to all. This online test only validates one page at a time. Note this
demo will test about one (1) page per minute / per site.

The goal of this service is to provide a free, well supported,
accessibility validation tester for those who need to test a page; to
educate the tester about the underlying technology behind accessiblity,
the benefits of using a validator, and to promote accessible web design.


It is currently available in English and will soon be available in
Spanish


Sincerely,

Mike Burks
