I'm not sure who david is here but If I have not yet weighed in on this
thread, It is important to note that the us is a small part of the world and
in the view of the world, has to live in the world rather than the other way
round.  It is also important to note that wcag is not a standard but
something on which standards are based and if we let the bar slip, how far
will the standards slip in a knee jerk response or for other reasons?

I agree that 508 and WCAG are different. 508 would seem to allow,
according to the letter, text like "this applet is inaccessible" as an
appropriate replacement, with the proviso that there is a system wihch
meets 508's user agent requirements and which could have dealt with the
script.

WCAG requires that people can use the content without the script. It
also requires that for people whose user agent can handle the
technology, the onject is written so it is compatible with the user
agent. As an example, it is possible in an interactive SVG image to
include audio descriptions of the visual rendering, which can be
triggered with voice commands. Under 508 it seems OK to simply have "you
can't see this" provided to people without an accessible SVG viewer, so
long as such a thing exists. Under WCAG 6.3 there needs to be some way
to operate the functionality without an SVG viewer (although as Anthony
said this seems counter to the spirit). It is also required by WCAG 8.1
that the SVG in question does have accessibility features used - it is
not clear that this is required by 508 either.

So I agree with David that the Section 508 requirements seem a little
underspecified here in terms of ensuring actual accessibility to people.

just my 2 cents worth...
