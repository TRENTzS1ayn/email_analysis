Apologies for the cross-posting.

We are announcing the release of MAGpie 2.01, NCAM's free tool for creating
captions and audio descriptions for multimedia.

The press release at http://ncam.wgbh.org/news/pr_20030313.html provides
some additional information about this tool, but it is available for Windows
98, 2000, NT, and XP, and also for Mac OSX.

We would like to offer our thanks to MAGpie 2.01's funders; the U.S.
Department of Education's National Institute on Disability and
Rehabilitation Research (http://www.ed.gov/offices/OSERS/NIDRR/) and the
Mitsubishi Electric America Foundation (http://www.meaf.org/).

In addition, we want to thank the Trace Research and Development
Center at the University of Wisconsin (http://www.tracecenter.org/) for
supporting the development of MAGpie 1.0 and also our beta testers for
providing feedback during development of MAGpie 2.01.

When downloading MAGpie, we would appreciate it if you would complete the
registration form.  If you are already on the MAGpie list, leave your email
out, but we are interested in what MAGpie is used for and in what sectors
(e.g. education, commercial, non-profit, government).

MAGpie 2.01 can be downloaded at:

Please send comments and questions to the MAGpie listserv at
magpie@wgbh.org, or if you opt to not subscribe to the list, feel free to
send comments to me directly.

Thanks,
Andrew
