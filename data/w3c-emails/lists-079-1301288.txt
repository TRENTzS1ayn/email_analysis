All.
Does anyone know where I can download the talking browser Web Sound from the
University of Geneva?
There was a download link from the W3C alternative browsers page and I had
the application once before, but I need it again and the link seems to
suggest that it is "coming soon".
Thanks for any help.
Mat.
