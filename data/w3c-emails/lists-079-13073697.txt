> I've only seen <tfoot> elements used after the <tbody> instead of before it

You've only ever seen invalid use of tfoot, then.  tfoot has to come first
as it is needed, in general, in incremental rendering, before the end of
the table, as it should produce a page footer for the table.

tfoot after tbody violates the DTD.
