Not only is this the only place tfoot is allowed, but one of the points of
introducing it was to enable browsers to maintain structure during
incremental rendering.
<tfoots> generally contain some sort of summary information (e.g subtotals
and totals) about the entire row, and it is hence beneficial to be able to
get that information while waiting for the rest of the table to load
(especially if that information is all you need from the table and you can
then stop the download).
