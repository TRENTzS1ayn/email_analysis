One reason for JAWS honouring the visual behaviour, besides the fact that
it is a bolt on  to a visual rendering model, not an aural browser, may
well be that this sort of tactic has long been used to keyword stuff pages
for search engines (even though many search engine operators say they will
blacklist people caught doing this).  The old version of my employer's
web page used to have large amounts of white on white text and I've seen
that particular tactic on the pages of more well known companies, both
long after reports of search engine blacklisting.

It's an unfortunate fact of life that any technique designed to
provide alternative content for the blind is likely to be abused
in this way, and JAWS has to be designed for run of the mill pages,
not those written by people who care about accessibility.

(I don't actually know if JAWS detects and ignores white on white.)
