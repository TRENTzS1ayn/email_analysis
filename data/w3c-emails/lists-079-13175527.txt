A good plan for screen readers, if possible, would be to use the idea
of "quirks mode" as developed by a number of browsers for CSS
rendering.  There's a "quirks mode" which preserves the bad habits
that web developers have come accustomed to from legacy browsers,
and a "standards" mode which does things the right way.  The switch
is whether or not a certain doctype has been specified.

I'm not sure what the switch should be for "accessible" mode, but I'm
sure we might be able to come up with something to suggest.
