for those who have difficulty imagining how words might be illustrated, 
and presumably missed out on a happy childhood an example is here:

unfortunately the film isn't captioned, but some may prefer it:

Originally a certain top-hatted gent sprang to mind but the wonders of 
google suggest this as the present US understanding of the word.

images like words aren't absolute their meaning changes with context, 
and circumstances will determine which is most appropriate for a given 
instance.
