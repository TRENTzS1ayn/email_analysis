Word requires the use of particular operating systems.  Even 
then it requires the downloading of an additional viewer program,
or the purchase of an expensive product.  That is apart from
any accessibility issues with Word Viewer 97.

Currently, the file format specifications for Word are only made 
available on the condition that they may not be used at all for
products that run on systems other than Windows and may not be used to
create a word processor.
