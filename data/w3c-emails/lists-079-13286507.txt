This is NOT correct.  Viewers for word are freely available for all
windows platforms.  They are also available for MACS.  Free software for
Linux enables access to Word documents.

Word requires the use of particular operating systems.  Even 
then it requires the downloading of an additional viewer program, or the
purchase of an expensive product.  That is apart from any accessibility
issues with Word Viewer 97.

Currently, the file format specifications for Word are only made 
available on the condition that they may not be used at all for products
that run on systems other than Windows and may not be used to create a
word processor.
