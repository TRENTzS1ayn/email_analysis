Could someone give me the user-agent header for Internet Explorer 6? Bank
of America claims that lynx doesn't support SSL encryption which I know is
untrue. I tried Mozilla/4.05 [lynx], which was worse than just using lynx
alone. I don't mind using IE when I need to, but I don't like the idea of
being forced to do so. Ok, I'm done complaining now. I guess I'll try to
get 2 hours sleep before work.
