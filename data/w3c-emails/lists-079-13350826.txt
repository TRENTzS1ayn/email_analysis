What about if aural media is defined, it will ignore anything that is not
explicitly labled "aural" or "all"? Aural media could be defined in a
<style> or <link/> element, as well as with and "@media" rule. Of course,
this brings up the question, "If certain styles do not have a labeled media,
should that default be 'all' or 'screen'?" I believe it should be "all", but
I also don't believe screen readers should pay attention to visual styles
like display or visibility.
