Dan,

I think that perhaps the point is being missed here.  In terms of
collaboration, sure, use whatever tools you and your collaborators agree
upon, be it Word, Word Perfect or chalk and slate.

On the other hand, if you plan on posting one-way information (report, press
release, research paper, et al) then for accessibility's sake use HTML,
which is cross platform, non-proprietary and the basic foundation of the
World Wide Web.

Don't confuse the two issues, the comments made were directly in regards to
a "paper" which was only being provided as a word doc.  The author posted a
message encouraging list members to go and read said paper, and some users
went only to discover that it was, in fact, inaccessible.  Ironic...

As for controlling print, most of today's current crop of browsers do
support print CSS.  Or you could also provide both a HTML *and* print
version (perhaps in PDF, or word, word perfect, etc.).
