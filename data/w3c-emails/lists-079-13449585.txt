What I am saying is that its very difficult to
work on common documents when others are using
word unless you do also.  This is not an
argument for using word at all, just an expression
of frustration that so many people do.  You *can*
do it but have to accept many compromises in the
way you work and its hard to get good consistent
results that will work interoperably with different
platforms/apps.  Its not fun repeatedly saying
"don't use that feature because it doesn't work
with ....." and so on.

Now if there really were an open source word that
*was* completely and transparently compatible ........
there goes a flying pig again ....
