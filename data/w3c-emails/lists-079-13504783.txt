It probably would be better to use the save as word option and then run
the document through HTML Tidy rather than use PDF.  Or even if it is in
word Select all ...Copy it to Notepad to make it into straight text and
then copy it to your favorite HTML editor....Of course any images would
need markup.

Dear ALL,

Thankyou all for you taking the time to read my paper (if you could).

Sorry to those who are unable to read the Word Doc, unfortunately I use 
Word as my native word processing format and my intention was to allow 
those who wanted - to send me an edited version as some have done. I 
posted the origonal posting up while on the move and as such don't have 
access to produce other formats.

If you looked at the web page you should have seen that I do intend to 
put up a PDF version, but I have not been in my office for over a week 
and I do not have a PDF maker on the move.

I shall post a PDF version as soon as I can get a chance (I will then 
post a note to notify you all it is up).

I have had quite a few comments so far (especially thanks to Joe Clark) 
and will be attempting to encorporate them.

Pete Rainger
