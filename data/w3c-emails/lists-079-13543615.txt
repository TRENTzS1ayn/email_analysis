Hi

Without wishing to seem immodest, I have written a fabulous javascript and
table free site where all layout and navigations are controlled by css. It
works beautifully in netscape 6+ and IE4+ on Mac and windows and fails
gracefully where stylesheets are not supported. (it is also fully accessible
for people using screenreaders).

My problem is, my client, who is large and archaic, has about 7,000 PCs
running netscape 4 only.  So it is important to write a site that looks good
for them.  Thing is, while it works, it looks s*** in that lovely browser.

I have been fiddling around and found a few workarounds which make the
situation a bit better, but it still looks like a bad web design in NS4,
with boxes all misaligned, rollovers not working (which I can live without)
and "strong" citations misaligning.

What do I do?  I am sorely tempted to write to the head of IT at the client
organisation and say that if they want W3c compliant, accessible sites
(which they demand, quite rightly) that look good at their end (which is
important to them) then they have to install standards compliant browsers on
their machines. 

I have to stress that the site works in NS4, it just looks awful.

Any thoughts?

Julia
