These days I set things up so that IE4.x and NN4.x don't get _any_
CSS, and only better browser get the CSS.

I generally use this hack to block these browsers:

  <style type="text/css" media="screen" title="Screen style sheet">
    @import "http://example.com/example.css";
  </style>

It's not that I can't do CSS for these browsers it's that I have
been doing it for so long that I'm totally sick of it and would
rather not waste my time supporting them any more -- after all the
companies that produced them no longer support them -- when was the
last time anyone hear of a NN4.x security update?
