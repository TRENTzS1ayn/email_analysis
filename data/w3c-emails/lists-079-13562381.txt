I have never bothered trying to get things to look nice with NS4. As long as it's readable I'm happy.It's well known that NS4 just doesn't work properly. If upgrading their browser wouldn't impact too much on the computer performance (I'm guessing that they have old kit if they're still using NS4) then I would go down the road that you are tempted to follow. If it is all old stuff then they could install IE4 or an early version of Opera. They may be worried about the possible training impact or their staff freaking out because all the icons have changed and it doesn't look the same but that's their problem. I'll warrant that they're not using an old version of whatever word processing package or desktop publishing or whatever else they use to do their business ;-)

Of course, if they're are clients of your you'll have to use a lot more tact than I can mormally muster LOL

just my tuppence
