Without trying to be flip, you really should have asked what browser level 
the client wanted supported before writing one line of code.  I really 
don't understand how development can start without asking what the client's 
audience, be it internal or external, is using to view the site now, and 
what base/bottom-line browser audience the client wants to support going 
forward.

Trying to ram doing 7000 upgrades at an IT department that probably has 
full days as it is will probably not get you anywhere.  It's the last thing 
you want to do, particularly if the IT head is not the one who commissioned 
you to write the site in the first place.

What level of accessibility are you targeting?  Is it because the client 
mandated that particular level as a target (or the law in their 
jurisdiction requires it)?

In other words, was the client fully aware at the start that the coding 
techniques required to achieve whatever level of accessibility this is 
would be incompatible with Netscape 4?

If so, then you have a clear course to educate them that Netscape 4 may not 
be able to give them the accessibility they want, and render the site as in 
newer browsers.  They will have to make, with your expertise as input, an 
informed choice on how to handle it:

Leave the site as is?
Leave the site as is, do a NN4 upgrade?
Change the site to hide all CSS from NN4?
Rework the site to better support NN4?
Etc?

If not, then there is still an education process to go through.  But you 
will be on shakier ground.  Either an accessibility goal was arbitrarily 
picked that the client's installed browser base can't handle, or the client 
set an accessibility goal without understanding the ramifications of 
it.  The conversations that should have happened at the start will have to 
happen now.  The client will have to make an informed choice about how they 
want to balance the site's accessibility versus what browser base they want 
the site to do more than just function in.  And you go from what they decide.
