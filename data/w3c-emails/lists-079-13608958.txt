That's one possible approach, but you might also divide a style sheet into
two parts, so that _some_ of your styling gets thru to NN4.x, too. After
all, it implements e.g. font-family correctly, and colors seem to work too
(when used by CSS specs).

There are several "Netscape 4 exclusion" tricks, see
http://css.nu/pointers/liam-tip.html
http://css.nu/pointers/point-tip.html
but you might easily end up with excluding more than you want. In
particular, the hack above makes everything in the CSS apply at most in
computer screen rendering only. Many of the features might make printed
copies more readable or more enjoyable, for example.

My favorite is to use
@import url(unsafe.css);
at the beginning of my style sheet and to put there anything that might
confuse poor Netscape 4 too badly. That way all my documents can contain
just a simple <link> reference to my style sheet.
