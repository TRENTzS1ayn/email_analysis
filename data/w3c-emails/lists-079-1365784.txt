I am researching collated text transcripts (that provide text
descriptions of visual information within a text transcript of sound for
streaming video on the web). I have found very little - mostly just
references in WAI documents and list archives.

Do you know of any articles, publications, web pages, or such that
address the issues surrounding collated text transcripts? Or any
standards or guidelines - for example, guidelines that cover how to
indicate visual descriptions, such as surrounded in brackets (like
http://www-3.ibm.com/able/hprvideo.html), or preceded with "Visual
Description:", or other?

Thanks much for any pointers or information!

Cheers,

- Shawn
