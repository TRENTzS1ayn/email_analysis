You can get a lot of control from Tools/Internet Options then click on
Accessibility near the bottom of the form.

Subject: Windows XP - IE 6 - how to make text bigger?



Hi,

Can anyone tell me where to find the option in Internet Explorer 6 for
Windows XP to increase the size of the text beyond the largest (but
still not very big) option provided on the view menu? Surely this
extremely important control of text size has not been 'disabled'?

Thanks,
Jim
