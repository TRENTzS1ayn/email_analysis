perhaps an interface could be added for the purpose of allowing you to log
in from Cynthia Says.

Hi Rob,

I only just got around to doing a quick test. I certainly looks quite
useful, and the output is simple to browse.

One thing I miss though: file upload. I am working on an application where
users must always first login - which means that Cynthia could never test
more than the login page (which is about the easiest one).

Any plans to add a file upload feature?

I also wondered why 508 is the default choice - that seems inappropriate for
a web-wide service. WCAG 1 or 2 would be better as a default IMO. Or set it
to no choice (blank) and require the user to make a choice.
