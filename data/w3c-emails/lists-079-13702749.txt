Hi all

I just wanted to ask if anyone knew very much about making Flash Movies 
accessible.

The people I work for want Flash movies on the main site, against my advice 
really.

Does anyone have much experience in making accessible flash? can it actually 
be done? does MX do what it promises to do?

Specifically - do you know if creating Access Keys, in Flash, overwrites those 
already used by users using screen readers?

are there any opinions in general about Flash + Accessibility.

Thanks
Angela
