Question : Google runs no graphic ad banners. Can you describe your 
philosophy about online advertising? Is text more effective?
Answer : Our text-only ads outperform graphic ad banners. We feel no 
pressure at all to switch to graphic ads, either internally or from 
advertisers. It's a win-win. We want to present ads that are useful to our 
users, and advertisers can run things that are more targeted. They don't 
have to pay for production of the ad - with hiring a graphic artist and 
doing the graphics and animation, the creative cost can be very high. 
There's also the cost of development time.
