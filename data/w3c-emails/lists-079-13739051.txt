Some useful resources are available on Macromedia's web site.
Probably a good place to start, as they make Flash

MX seems to be more switched on to accessibility than previous versions.

Hi all

I just wanted to ask if anyone knew very much about making Flash Movies 
accessible.

The people I work for want Flash movies on the main site, against my
advice 
really.

Does anyone have much experience in making accessible flash? can it
actually 
be done? does MX do what it promises to do?

Specifically - do you know if creating Access Keys, in Flash, overwrites
those 
already used by users using screen readers?

are there any opinions in general about Flash + Accessibility.

Thanks
Angela
