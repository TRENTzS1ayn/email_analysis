As far as I know, the only way to set font size to something else than the
five alternatives in the View > Text Size menu on IE is to set up a user
style sheet.

This isn't as bad it as it sounds. You could simply write, using your
favorite editor, a file with a one-liner content like
body { font-size: 20pt; }
and then (on an English version of IE): Tools > Internet Options >
General > Accessibility
and check "Ignore font sizes specified on Web pages" and
"Format documents using my style sheet" and use then the "Browse" button
to specify the file you wrote.
