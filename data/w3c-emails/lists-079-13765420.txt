Thanks Peter

I've read through MM's site though - it doesnt seem to quite hit the mark 
though.

There are too few resources out there for this. 

I've done all the basics that MX allows, naming objects etc.....but it doesnt 
feel like it's enough.

I am sure I read somewhere that there are code changes that can be made.
