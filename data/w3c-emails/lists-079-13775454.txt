In my experience, your only options are:

* Browser-sniff to send different versions to NN4 and non-braindead browsers.

* Send essentially plain-text-only version to NN4 through CSS-hiding tricks.

* Start with one of the few NN4-safe CSS layouts and tweak ever so 
very carefully until it looks good in other browsers too. Warning: I 
did this and ended up bollocksing my layout in NN4 despite having 
valid CSS and HTML.

Craig Saila is the canonical source for NN4-safe CSS 
<http://www.saila.com/usage/layouts/nn4-layouts.shtml>, but there's 
another one I just saw the other day that I'd have to plow through my 
bookmarks for.

Please do do that.
