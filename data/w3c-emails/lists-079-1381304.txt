They are not even noticed by jaws 4.50.  I marked up the strings you
gave below and when the page was loaded with just those strings, it
appeared as though there was noting coded into the page.

Subject: How do screen readers treat empty paragraphs please?



I am trying to educate someone for whom I designed accessible web
templates
to produce clean and tidy code.  However, he wishes to use multiple
empty
paragraphs with non-breaking spaces to mess up my nice style sheets with
uneven spacing. My question is sort of related: if a screen reader comes
across code like this:

<.p>&nbsp;</p>
<.p>&nbsp;</p>
        <.p>&nbsp;</p>
        <.p><.br>
          <.br>
        </p>
        <.p>&nbsp; </p>

(horrible, isn't it?) -- will this cause annoyance to the reader, or
just be
ignored completely? If the latter, I shall have to bite my tongue and
keep
quiet, I guess.
