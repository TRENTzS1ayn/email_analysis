Apologies to the international list as my reply is grounded in US disability
rights-based law.

In rights-based litigation, damages are found due to the fact that a
technical standard for accessibility was violated.  The fact that the
discrimination occurred - even though the entity did not know they did not
comply - is grounds for a disability rights claim.  Traditionally, remedies
involve correcting the disability rights violation.  In other cases, the
enforcing agency seeks monetary damages depending on the grievance and
provisions of the rights-based statute.

This is why rights-based statutes like Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act
tie the entity's receipt of federal funds contingent upon not discriminating
against people with disabilities.  If discrimination occurs, then the
federal funding can be immediately withdrawn.  Now that the State of
California has adopted 508 into its State Statutes, the State can withdraw
state funding for covered entities that do not comply with Section 508.
This is because the State statute requires that any entity that directly or
indirectly receives funding and does not comply with Section 508- they will
lose funding AND still have to correct the violation.  State law now
requires the entity's technology contractor to resolve all complaints on
accessibility violations.

Interesting, isn't it?

I am leaving today for Nice, France to speak at the Accessibility for All
conference, so if there are further comments about my comments, I will not
be able to respond until I return in April.

Best regards,
Cynthia Waddell

There is damage though to the reputation of the entity and harm to the
entity if there is one envolved who assisted in the development of the site
and the list goes on.

How could a court set damages if no damage was done?
