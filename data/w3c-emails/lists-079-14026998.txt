Maybe an oversimplification, but the way I have always looked at it is: any Javascript that abides to the DOM is ok, as long as your site is still usable if Javascript is disabled, and it doesn't suddenly change the user's focus. For instance, a script that generates a navigation menu is not compliant, unless there is a good NOSCRIPT alternative. Scripts that effect a change on another part of the page (e.g. an onmouse/onfocus script that changes the visibility of a layer, a news scroller, or adds some descriptive text to the infamous status bar) are not accessible either, as far as I can tell. Last, but not least, the spawining of new windows, timed redirects, etc are also inaccessible.
Another important aspect would be how these scripts are triggered. As they should be device independent, you should not have things like onmouseover (or, if you do, provide an identical onfocus behaviour).

As I said, maybe I'm oversimplifying the issue. If that's the case, I apologise in advance...

I work for a University and we are trying to update all our web sites so
that they have full accessibility. Does anyone know of any good
libraries online that explicitly and clearly list what Javascript is
fully compliant with accessibility web standards and what script is not
suitable? Any URLs you can point me to would be vastly appreciated!

Thanks
