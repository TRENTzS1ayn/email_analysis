I have to disagree that this exemplifies how JavaScript is in itself a "bad 
technology." Used in a coherent manner, JavaScript can be quite useful. You 
can make an inaccessible environment in any programming language, so I 
would conclude that this example demonstrates the developers narrow scope 
of various JavaScript coding practices. I do, however, agree with the 
phrase "As long as people have to do extra work for accessibility, it 
'ain't gonna' happen.'" But I don't believe that this is a reflection on 
the language itself.
