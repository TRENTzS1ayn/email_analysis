Hi,

I am looking for accessible web design weblogs and XML/RSS feeds to add to
the updated 'blogs' page on the MCU website: http://www.mcu.org.uk/blogs/.

So far the only directly relevant feeds I have are from 'Made For All'
(http://www.madeforall.com/news/) and MacAccessibility
(http://www.maccessibility.com/). I am sure there must be many more that I
am not aware of? 

Please get in touch if you would like to be added to the list, or if you
know of other sites that should be listed.

All the best,
Jim
