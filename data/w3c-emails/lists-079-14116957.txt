Ian Lloyd of accessify.com has many tools including an Accessible Form
Builder assistant.
http://www.accessify.com/tools-and-wizards/accessible-form-builder.asp

There is a second version, too, but apparently the page is misssing content
for some reason. Perhaps it will be back up soon.

Good luck,
James Craig
