Well, how can we judge that without a link to your forms?

That could be taken as a comment about accessibility - and I
fancy you're not alone.

I think you're approaching it the wrong way.  There's no magic
bullet that says Form A is accessible while Form B isn't.
The basic requirements are
 (1) users should be able to use the form's fields as intended, even
     if they don't have the usual equipment (eg a mouse).  This
     puts some restrictions on use of javascript in forms;
     bottom line is the UI should (also) work without it.
 (2) users should be able to identify each form field easily and
     navigate between them, even if your conventional form layout
     is lost.
 (3) The overall purpose and function should be clear.

Ugh.  What a ghastly report!  I'd say that's pretty inaccessible:
looks like you have to work hard just to figure out what in your
page it's talking about!

Can I recommend you to my own company's accessibility testing
product at <URL:http://valet.webthing.com/access/>.  If its reports
aren't a great deal more helpful than the one you posted, then
it's failing in its purpose.
