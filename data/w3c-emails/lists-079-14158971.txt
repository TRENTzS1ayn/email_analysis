Hello everyone,

Please forgive any multiple messages regarding the subject.  It is in no way
intentional or of commercial nature.  However, I want to share this event
with all of you interested in accessibility and usability.  Lighthouse
International and Nielsen Norman Group are offering a one-day seminar in New
York City about "Making the Web easy to use for people with disabilities".
You can find more information about this at
www.lighthouseacts.com/events.htm.

Cheers,

Ziad Gemayel
