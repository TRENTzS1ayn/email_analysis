Donna,

I've been asking for working examples for something over 4 years with 
very little success, though it has to be admitted some.

thanks so much for your open and honest admission, you'll notice that 
most respondents are keen to point you in other directions.
Though any reasonable assumption would be that the standards setting 
body should put up or sh** up, there seems to be a feeling here, that 
'theory' is far more important than practice, and we don't want to get 
our hands dirty, do we.

unfortunately forms are something I know very little about.
keep pestering for examples, some of w3c's alt tags have to be heard to 
be believed :-(

Jonathan
