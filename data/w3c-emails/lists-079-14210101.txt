Hy,

I think the analysis provided by the Access Board is a very poor one in 
some respects. I think the best analysis widely available is Jim 
Thatcher's: http://www.jimthatcher.com/sidebyside.htm although I would 
disagree with his analysis in a few of details - the important ones are 
that the 508 provision allowing for a text-only alternative page is NOT 
the same as the WCAG requirement for an accessible alternative page as 
a last resort, and that WCAG requires scripts be accessible and that 
there be redundant ways of interacting, whereas 508 merely requires 
they are accessible (i.e. it assumes people have script-capable 
browsing environments).

I think WCAG conformance to level triple-A covers all requirements of 
Section 508 except the one that users can ask for more time if they 
need it.

I don't think the difference between the words compliance and 
conformance is significant, but the fact that one is a law applicable 
to a certain group of people, and one is a technical specification made 
available in the hope it will be used to improve the Web is important. 
(There are laws which refer to WCAG as a specification for improving 
accessibility, but WCAG itself is not a law).

cheers

Charles McCN
