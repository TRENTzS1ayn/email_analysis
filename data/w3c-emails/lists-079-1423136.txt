But is exactly the misuse that means there is a market demand for minority
browsers to allow their users to configure the User Agent string - it's 
almost an FAQ for Lynx as to what User Agent string one should use, as
default, to make servers believe they are dealing with a big 2 browser.

As I've pointed out before, IE pretends to be Netscape and has done for
more than half a decade.
