Is it the role of the W3C to do this?  It seems to me that the two
bodies produced different things. One a Recommendation on producing as
fully accessible websites as possible and the other a specification for
the purchasing of equipment and systems for a specific purchasing group.

Of course we all know the WAI Recommendations are the honey produced by
a host of bees working in a symbiotic relationship, the 508 the product
of a committee possibly those who set out to specify a horse and
designed a camel:))))

I would also publically ask that the W3C WAI publish their view of the
differences between the Web part of the 508 technical standard and WCAG
1.0.  Better yet would be a joint document from both the Access Board
and WAI that they both agree on.  I would recommend NOT including any
discussion of the policy stuff, i.e., conformance vs compliance, since
W3C does not really produce policy documents.

What the Access-Board has published that Larry Hull quoted is an
excellent start.  I also have an internal IBM version that I could
contribute.  The Web Content Guidelines Working Group (GL) also needs to
publish a comparison for the next public draft of WCAG 2.0
