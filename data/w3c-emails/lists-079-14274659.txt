Peter,

to clear up a possible confusion, can you confirm that you're use of 
SLD refers to specific learning difficulty or dyslexia, and not Severe 
Learning Difficulties or cognitive disability?

looks to be a great resource, we now link to it and 
http://www.techdis.ac.uk/seven/disability_and_the_web.html from 
http://www.learningdifferently.com/develop/papers.html where there are 
links to many other useful resources on LDD and the web

thanks

Jonathan
