I don't think the Access Board's comparison is anywhere near as good as 
Jim Thatcher's, and as noted in my response to this thread I don't 
think that is perfect either.

I agree that it would be helpful if WAI published assesments of other 
specifications in the same area, and how they compared (as well as the 
access board several major companies have their own), preferably 
joint-publishing agreed versions. But I don't think they have any 
particular obligation (they are an independent organisation) and it is 
an open question if this is the best use of resources - and how WAI 
sets is priorities is a separate discussion.

The above is my personal opinon and not necessarily endorsed by La 
Fundaci?n Sidar. Same goes for anything I write that doesn't say it is 
endorsed by someone...

cheers
