Phill,

As I think you know, we have already discussed this with the Access Board 
and have committed to do this. We will address not only the diffs on WCAG 
1.0, but also those on UAAG 1.0 and ATAG 1.0.

I expect that the initial work will mainly be on the WAI side, and we have 
allocated some time and resources to do that. In the course of doing those 
comparisons, we will definitely look at some of the existing comparisons 
that have been developed by different parties.

Regards,

- Judy
