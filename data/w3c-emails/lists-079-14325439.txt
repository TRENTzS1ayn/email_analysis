Yes, It is the job of the access board in this case to make their
law/standards clear.  OUr obligation begins and ends with appropriate
references to laws and standards which are required and where they are
required.  The more we work on comparing apples to oranges, the more we
dilute the quality of our fruit.

I don't think the Access Board's comparison is anywhere near as good as
Jim Thatcher's, and as noted in my response to this thread I don't
think that is perfect either.

I agree that it would be helpful if WAI published assesments of other
specifications in the same area, and how they compared (as well as the
access board several major companies have their own), preferably
joint-publishing agreed versions. But I don't think they have any
particular obligation (they are an independent organisation) and it is
an open question if this is the best use of resources - and how WAI
sets is priorities is a separate discussion.

The above is my personal opinon and not necessarily endorsed by La
Fundaci?n Sidar. Same goes for anything I write that doesn't say it is
endorsed by someone...
