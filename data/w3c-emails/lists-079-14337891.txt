hi,

The paper cover Dyslexia and Dyslexic-like specific learning 
difficulties. But it does it does not specifically cover the "learning 
disabled", "Severe Learning Difficulties" or Cognitive disabilities.

My remit is for those who could be potentially studying at a minimum of 
a Further Educational level. 

You might find that the paper covers many of the issues but it 
completely side-steps the issues when a student has a savere language 
difficulty or savere cognition problem... I would need to go into 
talking about the appropriateness of content, symbolic communications. 
etc etc.

I do hope within the future to write a similar paper about web 
accessibility for those with hearing impairment (including pre-
lingually deaf).
