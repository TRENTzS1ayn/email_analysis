Daniel

as far as I'm concerned using absolute sizes for things like borders is fine. Padding and margins gets into a grey area depending on how big you want them. For instance border-left: 600px may result in sideways scrolling for some users depending on screen res and whether the browser has any odd css parsing bugs. 

In general though steer away from specifying font sizes in absolute terms. I always try to use em as a measure rather than px.
