Wouldn't absolute sizes for width, padding, etc make a site potentially unusable (or at least difficult to use) on devices with smaller and/or bigger screen sizes ? (I'm thinking horizontal and vertical scrolling on a PDA screen, for instance)
If it has to be absolute sizes, it would probably be a good idea to offer alternative or media-specific stylesheets, in my opinion.

Nothing wrong with absolute sizes for layout (for example widths, paddings
and margins), as long as the text is still readable when resized. Most fixed
width layouts cannot handle textsize being increased, then readability and
accessibility are affected.
