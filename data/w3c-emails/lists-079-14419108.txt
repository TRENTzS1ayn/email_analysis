I haven't examined every accessibility verification tool out there, but it 
seems rather strange to me the ones I've looked at want me to manually 
examine each GIF file for flicker. Even *I* know that it's possible for a 
programmer to examine the contents of a GIF file and tell if it's animated. 
Are there any accessibility tools out there that check the GIFs for you and 
eliminate the ones that obviously aren't animated?
