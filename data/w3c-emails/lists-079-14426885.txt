Non-animated GIFs flicker as well.  If you have alternating dark and light
pixel rows (which is more common than you might think) and you view the 
image on an interlaced display (my monitor is over 10 years old - it still
works, so there is no point in sending it to ground fill) you get a half
scan rate flicker.  This is very distracting, although it may be too
fast to be an epilepsy trigger.
