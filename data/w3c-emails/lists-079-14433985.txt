A lot of web pages are for marketing purposes, and that tends to make
pushing the envelope pretty much standard practice.

Unfortunately pages for organisations with a mission to communicate,
rather than to sell, seem to either get outsourced to the same companies
that design marketing sites, or written by in house people chasing after
higher paid jobs in the private sector.  (The UK is particularly into
outsourcing governmental web sites.)

I think lock-in is a secondary benefit.   The main aim has been to
take a semantic medium and make money from using it in an environment
that abhors overt semantics.  As a result, it gets decorated with 
presentational features, then scripting is added to allow one to grossly
change the user interface.

The problem with idiom based script handling is that faces a moving
target, and has to be continually maintained to track current 
fashions.
