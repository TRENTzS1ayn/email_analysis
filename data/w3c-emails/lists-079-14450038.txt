Am I correct in thinking that it's not only the rate of change that 
matters, but the visual presence of the image in the page? I mean it's 
size, the proportion of the canvas that changes, maybe also the color 
contrast.

It would be useful to be able to spider a site and know whether there are 
any animated GIFs or not.
