David,

glad to see you're one of us, this thread was at html, however ig also 
has a place, though you may also want to post your response to html...
Its fairly inaccessible if you need a second degree to write it, well 
as I say I'm having problems :-]
I'm having real problems putting up an xhtml page that a browser will 
treat as xhtml.

I'd just as soon have a simple example, with a .htaccess file, 
javascript, css, and an xhtml file.

http://www.peepo.com/alfi-x/music-x/w-x.xhtml
is my current best effort, which validates at w3.  IE6 and Mozilla both 
want to download this rather than open it.

.htaccess file: AddType text/xhtml+xml xhtml

<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/xhtml; charset=us-ascii" 
/>
your point about the meta tag is well taken, thanks, a number of other 
respondents missed this:

document.write('<bgsound src="#" id="mysound" loop="1" />')
the IE specific javascript bgsound not being quoted, the code is mainly 
cross-browser,
however as mentioned elsewhere, I've had problems for some years 
getting sound-on-event to work without flash in mozilla, icab, opera or 
other browsers. this need is not yet recognised by w3

these files are transient, as I change them in response to replies, and 
my understanding :-]

thanks again

Jonathan
