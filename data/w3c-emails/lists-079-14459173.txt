take a deep breath...

and head for the frontline:

$ find . -type f -iname "*.gif" -print0 | xargs --null --max-lines=1
identify | perl -nWe 'print "$1\n" if /(.*?)\[/;' | sort | uniq

whew!

that should produce a list of animated gif files.
you'll need a standard unix compliment (find, xargs, perl, sort, uniq)
and imagemagick (identify).

there's probably an easier way...
