This is slightly different, but closely related: Deque
<http://www.deque.com/> creates a product called RAMP that detects
unacceptable flicker rates and fixes them.

From <http://www.deque.com/products/rampsection508.htm>:

"Section 508 Paragraph (j) Pages shall be designed to avoid causing the
screen to flicker with a frequency greater than 2 Hz and lower than 55 Hz.

"Automatically detects flickering rates with unacceptable frequency
Auto Remediation of animated gifs, marquee elements, and other blinking
elements." 

I just happened to go to a product demonstration recently, but haven't had a
chance to test it out for myself; they did use the product to change a gif
during the demonstration and it seemed to work well.
