RAMP's pretty kludgy for such an expensive piece of software, but it 
does do a decent job remediating flicker rate.

I think there's a lot of programming necessary to catch all the 
potential things that could cause a page to flicker. It's better as a 
user check; I think most people could tell whether or not their page 
could cause someone to have an epileptic seizure.
