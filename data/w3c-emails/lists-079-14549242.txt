Well, presumably all you would have to do is check that the text field 
isn't empty *and* doesn't contain the default text. Something like...

if ((textfield == '') || (textfield == 'default text')) {
echo "You need to fill out all the forms";
}

What are you using to validate the form anyway? Javascript? PHP?
