I'm not sure if it's an acceptable solution (maybe other members of this list might be able to enlighten me), but I have always added a single blank space as default text. AFAIK, the requirement for default text arises from the fact that certain user agents might not display form elements at all if they are missing a default value. value=" " does not usually cause any problems in terms of automatic validators, and - hopefully - with those user agents that exhibit the quirky behaviour mentioned above (btw...anybody know which exact browsers behave that way ?). as long as you strip the leading blank space from the form results after submission, you should be able to still check if a user left fields empty.

Subject: Form text field default & validation




I have been searching for a solution to this dilemma, perhaps I am
searching using the wrong keywords, I have not found a solution.

I want to validate my form so that the required fields each contain
data, entered by the submitter.  Accessibility demands that a text
area field contain default text.  When default text is included for a
form field it validates automatically, and the submitter does not
receive a reminder to fill in the required fields.

How can I include default information in the text field AND validate
that same text field?

Thanks
Donna
