The correct mime-type is application/xhtml+xml

It's unnecessary, especially in XHTML, where no UA should listen to it

There's no point putting IE specific code in an application/xhtml+xml as

an XHTML document, those few that bother are also likely to modify it in
other ways - IE specific sound can be done more efficiently just in
script with img and dynsrc in any case.
