UKOnline.gov.uk launched earlier this year. They have a newsroom section
which falls under their easy access channel. This UK government portal
has quite a few content types that are simultaniously mirrored and
updated across graphic and non graphic versions.

http://www.ukonline.gov.uk/NewsRoom/NRHome/

Also, both the graphical version and the easy access version have been
passed against RNIB and WAI Level A standards.

ciao,
Stephen
