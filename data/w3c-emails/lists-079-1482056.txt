Why not go to Google and check out their news linkk? You probably have a
better chance at finding what you want by searching for a newsire, since
all the commercial news web sites are pretty graphics-intensive, and few
provide a text-only alternative that I have ever found. Of course, it is
easy to miss such a thing when there are a few hundred links and graphics
all smooshed on one page. Come to think of it, Salon.com is pretty
low-graphics.
