The BBC's text only content quality and findability is rather variable, e.g.,
there are no links to it from some of the World Service transcripts, even
though the pages exist, and, because the main pages have a very narrow
central column, are more suitable for printing.

The BBC also suffers because the text only page is only a mechanical
transformation of the graphical page.

Generally, it depends on individual authors being aware of the issues,
and this awareness drops off the further you get away from the centre
of the organisation.
