I've found that ukonline is a very poor shadow of the original open.gov.uk,
which it replaces.  I had to resort to Google to find a departmental
site, because the necessary indexing doesn't exist - even the last resort
of going to the site map produced only a minimal document.  This would
have been relatively easy on the old open.gov.uk site.  At the moment
I'd treat it as a dumbed down graphical site with a token text alternative.

My own view is that it shows the bad effects of governmental organisations
outsourcing to big commercial web site designers.
