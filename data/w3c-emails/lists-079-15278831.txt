That's fine in the sense of "this will help you build popup links that 
don't break if JavaScript is off".

It's not fine in the sense of "if I don't want new windows to popup, you 
are forcing me to disable my JavaScript to prevent it" or "my UA blocks 
popups, so by assuming I have popups the site is broken for me" or the like.
