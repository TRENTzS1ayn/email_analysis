In general, yes, though Lynx does display tables visually, to some degree,
so it's not the clearest way to see the linearized reading order. 

The clearest and fastest way that I know of is to use the Opera browser, and
to toggle between author and user mode, with styles and tables turned off.
You'll have to customize the user mode to turn off tables, but once you do,
you can toggle between views with a click of the mouse (or keyboard).

I'd been wondering about that.  Does this mean that if I view the page 
in Lynx, I'll get it pretty much as the screen reader would?
