From the ICDRI Press Release at:

http://www.icdri.org/Press/NCD_ICDRI.htm

National Council on Disability (NCD) says that the Americans with
Disabilities Act applies to both commercial and other private web sites.
Today NCD released their report which is a careful and precise analysis
of the legal issues pointing out the arguments for both sides.  But
based on all authorities, including those opposed to the view that the
ADA should apply to e-commerce, the report concludes that the intent of
the ADA was to cover entities under ADA Title III.  
 
Among the authorities cited are the works of Cynthia Waddell, ICDRI's
Executive Director, as well as resources such as the Access Primer Page
by ICDRI; the book, Constructing Accessible Web Sites, co-authored by
three ICDRI Board Members; and the educational portal and web
accessibility validator, Cynthia SaysTM.  The report is posted online at
http://www.ncd.gov/newsroom/publications/adainternet.html.
 
NCD is an independent federal agency making recommendations to the
President and Congress on disability policy. NCD First proposed and then
drafted the original Americans with Disabilities Act.  Cynthia Waddell,
ICDRI's Executive Director, is the author of the first accessible web
design standard for government in the US and is a former Americans with
Disabilities Act compliance officer.
