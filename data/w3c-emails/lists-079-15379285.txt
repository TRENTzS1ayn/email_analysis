Please don't remove ordinary functions from the window (scrollbars, 
location, etc). It's nice that it is resizeable, but you have no idea 
what my text size is to start with, and if there is more than a 
screenful and no scrollbars after you already made me adjust everything 
I will be extremely frustrated in trying to use your content.

If browsers gave me decent control (permitted me to put back the bits 
that you had turned off) things would be more reasonable. There is 
value in setting window default presentation (an example is what 
http://www.mencap.org.uk do to ensure they don't cover anything 
important) if the user can override it reasonably. But at the moment 
that isn't really true.
