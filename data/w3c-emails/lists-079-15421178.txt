This would work well. I did a bit of googling for these, however, and 
found out that the word "Dolt" is fairly commonly referenced on Google. 
Hmmm...

Of course, I am aware I could create a Perl script, or something to the 
effect, and do this similar thing, but I have been unaware of anything 
that's already available. Additionally, your average web dev. package will 
allow the creation of such an item, but it's usually far less automated, 
and usually more complex (again, I reference my lack of time available for 
such a project).

This is all well and good on the development side, but let me go out on a 
limb here and suggest something... Wouldn't the capability for the user 
agent to import something (say using an @import or a <link 
rel='(whatever)' type="text/(whatever) href='/menu/menu.html'/>, based on 
a specification in the html, xhtml, css, or whatever, be more adaptable? 
This could decrease website loading times, decrease bandwidth, and could 
have many other capabilities. It's an idea, at least.

Definitely an idea, that I will continue to investigate. A heck of a lot 
better than updating the pages individually.
