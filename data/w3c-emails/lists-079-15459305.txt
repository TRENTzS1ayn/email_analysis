The real short term solution is to educate your users to make use of
right click | open in new window, and drag and drop links into a new
window.  That way you don't need to confuse navigation and contents.

Long term, my ideal solution would be for browsers to make effective
use of the link element to select an appropriate navigation page for
each detail page.
