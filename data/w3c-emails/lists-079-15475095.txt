Kevin,

I'm with you, and have raised the same issue in the past on more than 
one occasion.
please pester more people with it, how about the html / xhtml lists?
@include menu.html is every bit as valid as linking to an image, css, 
or script.
unfortunately there aren't enough of us to get this implemented 
immediately.

thanks again

Jonathan
