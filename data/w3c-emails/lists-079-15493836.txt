You've got Perl but no Web server access?  No problem!  Consider this 
simple example script fragment:

my $q=new CGI;
open (MYFILE, ">index.html");
print MYFILE $q->start_html();
print MYFILE "<h1>My Page</h1><p>Hello, World</p>";
print MYFILE $q->end_html();
close MYFILE;

Rather than sending our code to standard output - normally directed to 
your Web server, you simply put the output into a file instead.  NOTE - 
Don't use the CGI.pm header() when doing it like this, otherwise you'll 
be putting things in your file best left to the Web server.

If you use validation tools, this technique can also be handy for 
checking code that normally lurks in password-protected areas of a site 
where validators fear to tread.  (The alternative is to navigate to the 
page in a browser, then save the page source, but that's getting away 
from the original point.)

Cheers
