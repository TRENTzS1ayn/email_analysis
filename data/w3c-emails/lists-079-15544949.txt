Easily fixed, just don't hide the text - move it out the way:

  <h1 class="wai"><span>Web Accessibility Initiative</span></h1>

  .wai {
    background-image: url(http://www.w3.org/Icons/wai);
    width: 212px;
    height: 48px;
    overflow: hidden;
  }

  .wai span {
    display: block;
    padding-top: 48px;
  }

...although I'm still trying to work out a way to do it with just one
element.
