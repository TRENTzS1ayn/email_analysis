One of my solutions for this problem (which I now realize is 
impossible), is to use transparently colored text on top of the 
background image.  What I had *hoped* was that the text could sit 
nicely on top of such a background image, not be detectable by the 
eyes, but when a screen reader or text-only browser got ahold of the 
page, it would undoubtably see the text.

However, transparently colored text provides a problem for the user-
agent and the way the operating system would render such text.  If the 
user cannot see the text because its completely transparent, there is 
no such way for them to select the text (if you cannot see it, is it 
even there?).

The same holds true for the Terminal application in Mac OS X.  If you 
make the transparency of the window something close to 100% (fully 
transparent), then the operating system gets confused when you click 
"inside" that window... it thinks that because its totally transparent, 
your mouse clicks should go right through that UI element and hit 
whatever is behind it (whether it be the Finder, or another window, 
etc.).

In my non-exhaustive testing, if you set the color of text to 
transparent, the browser usually renders the color as the "default 
color" for that type of text.

Interesting idea/solution... any thoughts?
