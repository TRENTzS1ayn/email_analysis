  During that time I'll happily be vilified. Let's get it over with. I
  am not interested in debating this drivel with you. From the moment
  you started in with the "defeatist" talk, the entire debate is lost.

  Every time someone comes along and tells you that "That bridge is
  gonna fall down if you make it out of matchsticks" someone else will
  scream bloody murder and claim that you're "defeatist" 'cause "New
  anti-grav trucks will do wonderful on that bridge!"

  Very well. I am not willing to move onto your matchsticks bridge
  whether that makes me defeatist or not.[*]

  Until and unless you can present a method whereupon a client, which
  does not support the idealistic and forward-thinking methods of
  content inclusion (made by the good guys), can still get to the very
  same, and not a watered down version of, content I will stay over here
  in the camp of the bad, defeatist, opponents of accessibility.

  Answers of "Supporting X browser is asinine!" and "Upgrade!" will
  happily be rejected, as will "But CSS does this!". The latter is
  factually wrong, the former has no place in accessibility.

  Eagerly awaiting your answer and methodology, whilst wishing
  feverishly for a Sanity Clause.
