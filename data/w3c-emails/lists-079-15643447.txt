I've used 0.5 transparency of the same colour as the background to 
provide an area that is clickable, but not itself visible.
check the "stringed" area of the tennis racquet here 
http://www.peepo.com/svg/!home.svg
for comparison, the area between the strings and the handle is not 
active.

fonts do seem to behave slightly differently, for instance with the 
'a-z' in the same page, the clickable area is significantly different 
to the letters. Not sure why this should be.
