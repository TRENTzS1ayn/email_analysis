Kevin,

some of this has been dug over a few times.

in particular there are good reasons for backwards compatibility that 
may include:

embedded user agents may not be readily upgradeable.
third world users may not have the wherewithall.
some industries still rely on 20 year old software, my local car 
mechanic for one: "why spend the money".

none the less it is also reasonable to design standards for current as 
well as future UAs
and sometimes, we even get to discuss all 3.
