It's worse than just a virus since it gets you to voluntarily
agree to allowing it to do the things it does.  Here are more
details:

>will not read it. They're counting on that. When you scroll to the bottom 
>of it and click "Accept," you have agreed to the terms of the EULA.

>Part of what you will have agreed to is to have monitoring/spyware 
>software installed on your computer which will periodically report a
>vast array of data back to the card company. The other part that you've 
>agreed to is to have the software send mail to EVERY SINGLE ADDRESS IN 
>YOUR OUTLOOK ADDRESS BOOK.
