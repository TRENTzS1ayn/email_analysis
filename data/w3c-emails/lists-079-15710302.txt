Kevin, a rather late reply as I have been away, but to replace straight
frames with non-included menus etc, I assume every page should have
identical standard content? If so, then tools like HomeSite (and many free
specialist tools) have powerful search and replace functions that should be
more than adequate for what you want to do. Once you have the necessary
regexes set up, a button click or return key is enough to update every page
in a matter of minutes. Neither very tedious, nor ineffective :-)

>It's tedious and ineffective to update the <div class="menu"> section of
every top-level page of their site. If you
don't have PHP, a content management solution, or something, anything,
you're in trouble.<

(I suspect I have missed something important though, judging from the
replies you have had.)
