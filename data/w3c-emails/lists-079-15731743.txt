    YOU ARE INVITED to a virtual briefing on "distance education
    at degree-granting postsecondary institutions" on Friday,
    July 18, at 11:30 a.m. ET.

    The briefing, which will be webcast live, accompanies a new
    report showing that more people are taking advantage of
    distance education and more colleges and universities are
    offering courses via distance education.  The report,
    "Distance Education at Degree-Granting Postsecondary
    Institutions: 2000-2001," includes information on degree and
    certificate programs and distance education technologies.
    The report is being released by the Department's National
    Center for Education Statistics (NCES).

    John Bailey, director of the Department's Office of
    Educational Technology, and Bernard Greene, NCES project
    officer for this study, will discuss these and other
    findings from the report during the virtual briefing.  The
    webcast will be available at
    http://www.ConnectLive.com/events/distance.
