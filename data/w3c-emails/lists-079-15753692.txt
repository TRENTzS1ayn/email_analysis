I'm getting some feedback on the problem of the usefulness of Fahrner 
Image Replacement with screen readers. The original test page--

<http://www.fawny.org/spy/?FIR>

-- is of course still up and uses the "classic" FIR stylesheet 
mechanism of {display: none}.

On various people's suggestions, I have set up an alternative using 
{visibility: hidden}. Can everyone please give that one a whirl?

<http://www.fawny.org/spy/vh/?FIR>

Also, I need IBM Home Page Reader users to write me with feedback. 
Remember, in all cases what I'm looking for is an exact report of 
what the screen reader reads out-- nothing, if that's what it reads, 
or the exact words.
