I know he has made a number of sweeping generalisations in the article, 
but from my experience dealing with about half a dozen design agencies 
they really don't know enough about the web.

They can come up with innovative designs but these are often spoilt by 
wanting to have rollovers and flash everywhere to give the site more 
interactivity and sadly this always seems to be more important than 
making the content more interesting.

Unfortunately the other issue about the innovative designs is that they 
tend to be so different that users struggle to use them because they 
are unused to the formats.
