Hi All

We are currently looking at a project for an online survey system for 
students from 13 to 18 years of age.  The first stage of making the 
system Accessible is using software tools and viewing with different 
browsers to make sure that the work is correct 'by the book'.

The further proposed techniques, on which we would welcome comments from 
the list, are as follows:

1) Form focus group of students with varying disabilities.

2) Have focus group 'test drive' the questionnaire and record comments 
on their experiences with both the interface and the questions themselves.

   2a) Create mock-ups based on suggestions by focus group, which
   the whole group can then evaluate.

3) Based on the Mencap publication 'Am I making myself clear?' ( 
http://www.mencap.org.uk/download/am_i_making_myself_clear.pdf ), we 
have decided to create meaningful icons to sit beside menu options to 
assist those with learning disabilities, giving even those with 
permanent 1 to 1 assistance as much independence as possible.

Whilst it would be very difficult to implement this for every question 
(there will be many, at different levels), these icons would be used for 
all common controls throughout the system.

   3a) Set a challenge to student art groups to produce the icons
   corresponding to menu functions that we require - possibly with a
   prize for those used.  [This will engage other students and get them
   thinking about the issues of accessibility - catch 'em young!]

   3b) Pre-select icons that will work best with the Web, will scale
   well, etc.

   3c) Return short-list of icons to focus group for final selection.

All suggestions from the list are very welcome and will be taken on 
board.  Techniques will be published as part of our Quality Assurance 
process and made available for public scrutiny/use.

Thanks in anticipation.

Cheers

M
