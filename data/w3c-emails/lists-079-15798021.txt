Yes, I agree that there are 'horses for courses', but it is frustrating 
working with design agencies that want to have big Flash intros to 
sites and then massive graphics, image rollovers, fonts too small, 
complicated JavaScript, etc, that breaks virtual every 
usability/accessibility rule in the book.

Take a look at http://www.tafisher.co.uk/ for an example of the sort of 
site that they expect us to put together for them.

Nowadays we just refuse to do it.
