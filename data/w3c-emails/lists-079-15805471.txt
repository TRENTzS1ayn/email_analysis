Having been in this business for some time now and also having dealt with
design agencies in a number of different countries I think Jack Schofield
has got it bang on!

The business sadly, is too dominated by the "eye-candy" merchants who quite
often believe in either art for arts sake or just lets go for the most
cutting edge and obscure designs possible.

I am not against this where it is needed and believe that there has to be a
place for expanding the barriers of design and layout etc but this has to be
done in a responsible manner. Its just galling when your local hospital or
health trust web site has been designed by some art geek just out of college
that makes the site unusable!

I'm all for swinging fines and lets roll! Perhaps it is going to take this
to make designers in the UK certainly wake up to the fact they have a
responsibility to the general public as well as the client. Too often I have
sat in on meetings where the designers have sold the client on the fact that
the web site looks cool and have looked down on those of us who have
questioned whether the site actually works.

We work with a lot of design agencies and our brief quite often is to take
the designs and write the coding and programming that will make them work.
You would not believe the crap that comes out of some design agencies. This
business has too many people who do not understand the difference between
design for print and design for the web.

Just my 2p
