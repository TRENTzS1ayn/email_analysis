Hi

Yeah - I completely agree - that kind of flashy intro isn't suitable for
that kind of 'business' environment - they wouldn't want there printed
literature to look like an album cover, or a typographically designed
magazine.

I was really thinking in terms of business areas that might warrant a
visually designed site - such as pop groups, graphic design agencies
themselves [if the nature of there work is more art based].

I think the rift between designers and developers is only set to get
worse - where you have new technologies pulling in one direction and
accessibility/usability pulling in the other.

I have become exhausted with the arguments about even simple things like
fonts and why text, especially body text, can't be images.....let alone
the inappropriate use of flash and image rollovers.

Yes, I agree that there are 'horses for courses', but it is frustrating 
working with design agencies that want to have big Flash intros to 
sites and then massive graphics, image rollovers, fonts too small, 
complicated JavaScript, etc, that breaks virtual every 
usability/accessibility rule in the book.

Take a look at http://www.tafisher.co.uk/ for an example of the sort of 
site that they expect us to put together for them.

Nowadays we just refuse to do it.
