Maybe consistency could be balanced with creative freedom by using
font-variation of symbols. If we had code-points registered for the common
uses of icons on the web then a browser could be set to ignore the font
information, so it always represented these things in the same way (possibly
one that chimed with the browser's or OS's conventions, possibly replacing
them with words), while also providing great freedom to graphic designers if
the user tolerates it.
