Regarding your second iteration:
http://www.isolani.co.uk/access/rnib/rnib2.html

I'd suggest a few changes.

1) Add a default background color to the page. If they haven't noticed 
this yet, somebody will. Hypothetically, if a user had their default 
browser background color set to black, they couldn't read some of your 
text. However, if they override your specified one with !important and 
forget to add a foreground color, that's their own fault.

2) Add a min-width specification (maybe 100px?) to the main (middle) 
content DIV. This won't work in every browser, but it will help some 
browsers overcome the overlap problem that is still happening a little bit.

Good luck. Keep fighting the good fight.
