There is a group known as (I'm not kidding with the alphabet soup here)  
the ISO/IEC JTC1 SC35[1] (User Interface) and SC36[2] (Culture,  
Language and Function Accommodation) task forces.

The WAI Protocols and Formats Working Group is chaired by someone who  
is involved in some of this work and (fortunately) can translate this  
all for us. I know I wouldn't want to do it. <g>
