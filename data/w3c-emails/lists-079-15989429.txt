Apologies for barging in late on this, but I've been on holiday...
One thing that struck me in this discussion was Mike Rundle's comment

What do you mean exactly by "set the color of text to transparent" ?
If you're referring to a CSS similar to color: transparent, I would like
to ask how supported this is, as - unless I'm misreading the W3C spec -
"transparent" can only be used for background, and not for color.

Incidentally, what happens if display: none (which causes the problem 
in FIR) is changed to display: hidden ? Hmm...may have to do some testing...
