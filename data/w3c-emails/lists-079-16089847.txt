I would suggest that everyone start demarcating *all* URLs they provide in
E-mail with < and > (no spaces). Otherwise you get these kinds of
abortions:

> url:[15]http://news.ft.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=FT.com/StoryFT/FullSt
> o
> ry&c=StoryFT&cid=1057562607245
(as viewed in Lynx)

Don't just copy and paste an URL. Use delimiters and test your work by
activating it from your E-mail program.

As an example, see how this works in your browser or mailer program:

<http://news.ft.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=FT.com/StoryFT/FullStory&c=StoryFT&cid=1057562607245>
