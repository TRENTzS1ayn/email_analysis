Mike,

you might want to check the site out on a mac using internet explorer.
its barely usable, all the topic tags are missing, as well as the  
banner:-(
also the first link I tried, back on a PC 'learning: software' was 404
4 of the 6 navigation topics aren't linked at all.
The date is given as Thursday May 1st 2003, whereas in my diary it is  
Tuesday July22nd 2003.
Validation only tells one so much.

Did anyone notice the microsoft plug at the bottom of the homepage.

Jonathan
