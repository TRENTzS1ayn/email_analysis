Dear All

WACG 1.0
- 10.2 Until user agents support explicit associations between labels
and form controls, for all form controls with implicitly associated
labels, ensure that the label is properly positioned.
- 12.4 Associate labels explicitly with their controls.

I have a form which contains a table.  This table has a number of
questions and radio buttons that users can rate their response to those
questions.  In this case each radio button has two labels.  I've read
the two above links but I'm a bit confused about how to satisfy priority
10.2 & 12.4.  This is an example of my code for this table.  Is this how
it should be done?

<table border="1"
 summary="This table contains a series of question.
 Please rate your response to these questions appropriately.">
  <caption>Example Questions</caption>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th scope="col"><p>Question</p></th>
    <th scope="col"><p>Good</p></th>
    <th abbr="Neither" scope="col"><p>Neither Good or Bad</p></th>
    <th scope="col"><p>Bad</p></th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td><p>This is the first question.</p></td>
    <td><p><input id="Q1" name="Q1" type="radio" value="1"></p></td>
    <td><p><input id="Q1" name="Q1" type="radio" value="2"></p></td>
    <td><p><input id="Q1" name="Q1" type="radio" value="3"></p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p>This is the second question.</p></td>
    <td><p><input id="Q2" name="Q2" type="radio" value="1"></p></td>
    <td><p><input id="Q2" name="Q2" type="radio" value="2"></p></td>
    <td><p><input id="Q2" name="Q2" type="radio" value="3"></p></td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Thanks in advance for peoples help.

Kind regards,
Scott Rippon.
