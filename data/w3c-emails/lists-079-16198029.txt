"Easy use"?

"Easier use"?

I was in a bar the other day. The main toliets were up a flight of
stairs. There was a toilet on the main floor, labelled with the text
"Easy access toilet" which struck me as being quite a nice inclusive
term; it wasn't for disabled people, to was for people who couldn't get
up the stairs.
