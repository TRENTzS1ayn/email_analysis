I like the term "easy access", however it doesn't cover the 'carer products'
such as emergency pendants for the elderly that they can use to summon help
from carers.

All good stuff though

"Easy use"?

"Easier use"?

I was in a bar the other day. The main toliets were up a flight of
stairs. There was a toilet on the main floor, labelled with the text
"Easy access toilet" which struck me as being quite a nice inclusive
term; it wasn't for disabled people, to was for people who couldn't get
up the stairs.
