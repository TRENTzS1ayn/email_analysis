Why have a label at all?

For example, speaking from a UK perspective, what
about older people - surely having different options
benefits everyone doesn't it ?  I think using the categories
is starting from the wrong place.  There is repressed
demand I think (people choose from only standard
products as you point out).

ok, maybe that doesn't solve your problem.
