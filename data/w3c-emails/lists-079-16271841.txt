I have had the same response from some messages I posted on another 
list.

I guess there is someone from Watchfire where they have a new over 
enthusiastic spam system.

[Actually responding to spam is a foolish move because it just proves 
that the address is live and encourages spammers to try harder - the 
fact that they provide another email address as well is just being too 
generous!]
