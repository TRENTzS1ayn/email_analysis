Hi,

I like the idea of including the items in the most appropriate mainstream 
category (by product description) eg:

* phones (xyz brand big button phone),
* hardware (abc brand amplifier or visual alert signals)
* emulators eg TTY

Maybe the quick search categories could also include an accessible design 
options, but my experience is that most people would start looking by 
product description rather than a discrete category that is seperate to 
other 'standard' products.

People with disabilities also benefit from features such as cordless 
phones, handsfree/speaker phones and mobile phones (illuminated displays, 
vibration call alert, voice dial etc) - would these be classified as 
accessible or standard?

Cheers,
Sandra.
