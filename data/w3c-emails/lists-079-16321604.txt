Universal?
Inclusive?

Or if they're selling to consumers (so it's end-users making the
decision), some form of the wheelchair-symbol thingey?

"Universal" does makes good sense, Nick. 
yes, the wheelchair is great, and a 'magnifying glass' symbol might be good too.
I think the text "assistive" or "assisting" would be very appropriate. 
Perhaps you/they can "quickly" survey to determine what category name would get used - possibly a poll.  ?
