If the products are described in sufficient detail in such a way that
people can make an informed purchasing choice, then the 'accessible'
label *should* be academic. Labeling products as being specifically for
'the disabled' reinforces the idea of separateness, and runs contrary to
concepts of inclusion and universality.
 
For that reason, the best terms would be 'universal', or 'inclusive'.
Good idea to poll these though (if you have time).
 
For that reason too, definitely no to the wheelchair symbol. Although
it's easily recognized, the wheelchair symbol negatively and
inaccurately labels the range of people with a disability and reinforces
stereotypes. Far better if you can come up with a symbol for 'easy use'.
Good luck on that one!

"Universal" does makes good sense, Nick. 
yes, the wheelchair is great, and a 'magnifying glass' symbol might be
good too.
I think the text "assistive" or "assisting" would be very appropriate. 
Perhaps you/they can "quickly" survey to determine what category name
would get used - possibly a poll.  ?
