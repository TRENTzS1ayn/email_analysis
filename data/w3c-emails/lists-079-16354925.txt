(703) 961-9250 ext. 221???????????????????????????????? (703) 404-9557Chantilly, Va. On June 
20, Internet TV Channel and leading assistive technology portal AT508.com, an 
affiliate on the TVWorldwide.com network, offered a free live video webcast of 
the National Town Meeting to Rescue Section 508, on-line at <A HREF="http://www.at508.com/">www.AT508.com</A>. 
Since that time the response to this event has been overwhelming, according to 
webcast organizers, who are convinced they have hit a nerve on a very important 
issue and have planned a second webcast town meeting that will feature the 
participation of a federal representative from the GSA. The first town meeting 
featured prominent expert panelists from the community of those people with 
disabilities, renowned disability columnist John Williams of AT508.com and Mike 
Paciello, President of The Paciello Group (TPG), a leading international 
authority on Internet and software accessibility as the webcast elicited numerous 
e-mail responses from on-line participants, many of which are featured on 
AT508.com at <A HREF="http://www.at508.com/section508_emails.cfm">http://www.at508.com/section508_emails.cfm</A>. For the second webcast, 
Andy Imparato of the AAPD and Ms. Maxine Hill of GSA will join Mr. Williams and 
Mr. Paciello as they address specific points raised during the first meeting, 
including: 

1. An ???Accessibility Czar??? ??? Creation of a role for someone to have the 
authority to re-establish the visibility, authentic??importance,??of E&IT 
accessibility on behalf of the??federal government????2. Better systems for accountability 
-- GSA and DOJ administer 508, but there is little about their process for 
ensuring accessibility that holds an agency accountable for their decisions. ??3. 
Establish an organization for certification, measurement, and Q/A??of 508 
Standards -- a single point of entry -- a gatekeeper. An organization that 
represents the interests user needs of Federal Employees with disabilities, but also 
provides an consistent and reliable resource to industry.??4. Enhancement of 
purchasing processes between agencies and industry so that there is a better 
means for collaboration. That is, an agency and it's employees can work with a 
company to help that company better understand what it needs to do to make it's 
products accessible. ??5. Better, "deeper" Education -- for Fed contracting 
agents, 508 coordinators, and vendors around the requirements specified in Section 
508 (not it's interpretation, but technical understanding of the 
requirements).

6. Creation of a formal ???Federal Agency Report Card on Section 508 
Compliance???. 

7. An enforceable definition for the term ???Undue Burden???

8. A formal structure for polling industry and government on how Section 508 
policies are being implemented.

???Our goal with this town meeting webcast process is to generate mainstream 
awareness of the inherent weaknesses in the federal government???s implementation 
of the important Section 508 legislation and I???m excited about the response we???
ve received,??? stated Mr. Paciello. ???Its clear there is a??key flaw in the 
effective enforcement of Section 508 that involves a consistent and reliable??set 
of usability,??quality assurance,??and certification??measures??that ensure??E&IT 
product accessibility, thus federal agencies don???t comply and vendors are given 
mixed messages about what is or isn't accessible. This second town meeting 
will feature government participation as we come up with real proposals for 
Section 508 enforcement and federal agency oversight.???
??
???As controversial as it may seem, I think the ???Accessibility Czar??? concept 
that came out of this webcast is a good idea,??? remarked Mr. Williams. ???There 
over 56 million Americans with disabilities and its time that the federal 
government enforcement of disability legislation is granted the same dedication of 
resources as other ongoing federal efforts such as the war on drugs.????? 

???During and after the first webcast we saw on-line democracy in action.,??? 
commented Dave Gardy, CEO of TVWorldwide. ???Individuals with disabilities are a 
very close-knit community and we???ve found through the rapid growth of 
AT508.com, that the web is a strong enabling factor for this demographic so we expect 
an even bigger crowd for this second webcast.???

The meeting will be webcast with open captioning of the streaming video, or ???
webcaptingsm???, developed by TVWorldwide.com to assist federal agency clients 
in complying with Section 508. Visitors to the live webcast town meeting will 
be able to post questions to panelists and participate in Q&A via e-mail, 
providing a fully interactive forum for sharing of information.?? ??The event will be 
webcast live and archived for viewing at <A HREF="http://www.tvworldwide.com/">www.tvworldwide.com</A> and <A HREF="http://www.at508.com/">
www.AT508.com</A>. Participants should have the free Real Video Player installed prior to the 
event and should log on by 3:15 PM ET on Wednesday, July 30.
