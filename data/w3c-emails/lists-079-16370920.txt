XHTML attributes aren't supposed to have any whitespace in them.

I'm just looking for some verification on the idea that if I use the
title attribute, then I need to encode the whitespaces between the
words, correct?

So if I have title="A new link." I should code that as
title="A#x20new#x20link." And this would not affect accessibility I
hope.
