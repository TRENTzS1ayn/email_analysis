> Unfortunately it seems to work properly with IE5 but not netscape7

That's because IE is broken as a matter of policy (basically because
you get less support calls for this sort of error if you are broken
than if you operate correctly).  The fact that it attempts to be
in Windows-1252, also indicates its an IE only site, which is particular
bad as they are using Apache on Unix.   I think they have captured 
the source of a dynamic page and are serving it as a static page, but
haven't updated their .htaccess file to tell the server that .asp is a
type of text/html.

The HTTP headers are as follows.  Note that they clearly say that it
is plain text, not HTML.  As is not HTML, the meta element is not a 
meta element and cannot be examined by a conforming browser to fix
the problem, but IE says it starts <html> so it must be HTML, even if
it is really the source code of an HTML page to demonstrate the source.
