Dear David

Thanks very much for running this test for me.  I was hoping that the
table with the table heading marked up using the <th> element with the
"scope" attribute would help form an association between the table
heading (form label) and table cell (form control).  It sounds like this
isn't the case.

Would this be an acceptable work around?  Have a table, like my original
example, but link to an accessible form where instead of the series of
questions being formatted in a table they are separated and coded like
so:

<fieldset>
 <legend>Question 1</legend>
 <p>This is the first question.</p>
 <p><label for="Q1_good">Good
  <input id="Q1_good" name="Q1" type="radio" value="1"></label><br>

  <label for="Q1_neither">Neither Good or Bad
  <input id="Q1_neither" name="Q1" type="radio" value="2"></label><br>

  <label for="Q1_bad">Bad
  <input id="Q1_bad" name="Q1" type="radio" value="3"></label></p>
</fieldset>

I know it isn't perfect but would it work?

Kind regards,
Scott Rippon.
