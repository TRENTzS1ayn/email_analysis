This is really an internationalisation question, but since it is 
required for accessibility it makes sense to look for answers here.

three letter codes: According to XML 1.0 second edition you must use 
the two-letter codes -- http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#sec-lang-tag - and 
although it seems to foreshadow moving to 3-letter codes that change 
doesn't appear to have been made in the draft of XML 1.1. Same thing 
goes for HTML -- 
http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/dirlang.html#langcodes

Dialects: According to that bit in the HTML spec, you can identify 
languages as spoken in a particular country. Since simplified or 
traditional chinese are the common forms in different countries you 
might be able to use that. Latin American Spanish is not, in any case, 
a single dialect - so you may as well identify the source country...

just  my 2 bits worth - there are people more expert at 
internationalisation than me
