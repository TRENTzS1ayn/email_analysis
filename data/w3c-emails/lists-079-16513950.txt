Hi Richard and Melinda,

Charles is right, a Latin America Spanish doesn't exist. The Spanish
language exists (es) and diverse forms exist of using that language in
diverse countries, for example, Spanish that one speaks in Spain that is
coded: es-es, the one that one speaks in Mexico: es-mx, the one that one
speaks in Argentina: es-ar, etc.

It happens like in English that there is difference among the form of using
it and of being expressed in Great Britain, United States, Australia, etc.

Cheers,
Emmanuelle

Hello Melinda, Charles,

The use of language codes is described by RFC3066 (which obsoletes
RFC1766).  See the erratum E41 for the XML spec
http://www.w3.org/XML/xml-V10-2e-errata

I have requested a similar erratum for the HTML spec, and I believe it
is close to happening.  You should use RFC3066 anyway, as it is
backwards compatible with RFC1766.

RFC3066 says you should use the 2-letter codes where available - ensures
better interoperability.  So English should be 'en' not 'eng'.  3-letter
codes can be used where there is no 2-letter code.

The last time I looked (and I don't suspect it has changed) there was no
code for Traditional Chinese or Simplified Chinese (note that these are
actually scripts rather than languages).  Common practise in the
localisation industry seems to be zh-TW for Traditional and zh-CN for
Simplified (actually meaning taiwanese chinese and (mainland) china
chinese, respectively).

For South America I don't know the answer, although I must say I've
wanted to know for some time.

In terms of online references, you may find
http://www.w3.org/International/O-HTML-tags.html useful.

It's great to see that you are adding the lang tag to the html tag.
Note also (I had a discussion with WCAG about this just last week) that
if you are writing XHTML (which is a good idea, by the way) you should
also have a xml:lang as well as a lang attribute.  That is not yet in
the WCAG guidelines, but hopefully will be soon.

I hope this helps.
Best,

Richard.
