In a training we made this week, a student ask a good question to us and we don't have THE answer so i ask you this one.

Is there a rule about dynamic sessions (PHP, ASP ...) and time out of them ?

a lot of blind people have problems with forms for example and sometines the timeout of a session is over before they finish. 

Do you have an idea about that ?

thanks a lot
