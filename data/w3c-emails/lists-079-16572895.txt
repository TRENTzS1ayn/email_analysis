Ok, I'm not sure if this would work, but...here goes:
how about setting the session time out quite high (1440 minutes)
and then set a specific time out for the session cookie
(see <http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.session-set-cookie-params.php>)
depending on whether the user requires more time or not ?
There's probably a very fundamental flaw with this plan that
I'm overlooking (e.g. what happens when cookies can't be set, and
PHP dynamically adds the session ID to links etc), but maybe someone
more knowledgeable than me could fill in the gaps ?
