its Safari browser more than double since February, according to the

million times during its beta test, according to Apple.

developers to embed the Safari HTML rendering engine in their own
software.

indicated that
IE 6.0 took 66.3 percent of the overall market, IE 5.5 14.5 percent, IE
5.0 12.7 percent, and IE 4.0 0.8 percent.

Trailing Internet Explorer was Mozilla, the open-source Web browser
available for various platforms including Mac OS X, with 1.6 percent (an
upswell from
1.2 percent in February),
Netscape Navigator
had 0.6 percent, and Opera Software's Opera browser took 0.6 percent.
