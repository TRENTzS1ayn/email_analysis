If using STRUTS
(http://jakarta.apache.org/struts/doc-1.0.2/struts-html.html)

You can use ID attribute, but you must write it as

styleId="username"

Then the jsp processor will generate the

id="username"

in the final rendered html code and assistive technology will pick it up.

Hi Everyone,
Can you use the ID attribute with the Label tag while using JSP forms?
Will the example below work associating the label with the property
attribute?

<label for="username">Login:</label>
<html:text property="username" size="16" maxlength="16"/>

Thanks in advance for your help.
Scott
