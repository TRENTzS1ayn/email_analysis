The site will not even load in Mozilla, Safari, IE 5.2 on Macintosh or in
Lynx. In every case, the programmers have decided that I don't have the
current Flash plug-in (in the three relevant cases, I do), thus have no
right to enter the premises.

"You don't have the latest version of Macromedia Flash Player. This web
site makes use of Macromedia? Flash TM software. You have an old version
of Macromedia Flash Player that cannot play the content we've created. Why
not download and install the latest version now? It will only take a
moment."

Or forever, in this case, since I *do* have the latest Flash. (Not the 7.0
beta, admittedly.) Bit of an infinite loop there, I'm afraid.

I love Web accessibility for the deaf.

By the way, *how* much did this site cost again?
