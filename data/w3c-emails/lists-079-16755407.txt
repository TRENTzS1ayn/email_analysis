Hi,

I was doing some research for one of the universities here in australia and 
came across these chat rooms / conferencing options that may be of interest:

EASI Chatterbox:  http://easi.cc/cbox/chat.htm

SNOW:  http://snow.utoronto.ca/chat.html

iVocalize: http://www.audio-tips.com/

I've participated in an online conference using the EASI Chatterbox - one 
of the participants was using JAWS (4.5 I think) and it seemed to work 
reasonably well for everyone.  I am aware of SNOW and iVocalise but have 
not tried them.

Will post a seperate message with info I received recently about the latest 
version of the iVocalise software.

Sandra.
