I really don't know why I subscribe to this list. The behavior of a few of
its members is typified by the responses to Mike Burks' offering of Steve
Jacobs' article on the "Business Benefits of Access-for-All Design." Eight
messages responding to Mike's message and not ONE, repeat, not one, message
which was on topic.

I know there are lots of folks who subscribe to this list. Do you all
appreciate this nit-picking. Am I in fact the only one who is the
odd-ball-out, who is sick of the process that typifies this list?

The HTML is also broken, as you might expect from Front Page.  It's
got p within b, and, of course, a lot of presentational markup.
