If we accept the original posting as on-topic, then so surely is
a message pointing out that the article itself is not readable
due to a server configuration error, and likewise David Woolley's
explanation of why it is unreadable (I might well have posted that
myself if David hadn't got there first).  OK, there were further
MeToo posts as tends to happen in any public forum.

Bringing it back to relatively on-topic, I have in the past worked
with clients who use frontpage to generate relatively-sane markup.
This was a convoluted process, including extensive user-training,
validation to a custom-DTD, and cleanup tools for the FP-generated
markup.  Not recommended, but not entirely impossible.

On the subject of the MSIE bug, it's a Halloween-ism.  And I'm
on record as describing this before we even had the original
Halloween documents!
