Hallo all,

I can read the interesting article Michael Burks mentioned as
http://www.ideal-group.org/World_Bank/
in Opera 7beta and tried it in Mozilla 1.2 too.

I thought  correct code of a site is important for accessibility and is
on topic of this list

When I only see codes in stead of text, I usually go back to the
original directory and type very simple only that  in the addressbar to
see if there is an alternate version.

Greetings
