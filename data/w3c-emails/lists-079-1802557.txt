New on the Making Connections Unit website: how to increase the
accessibility and readability of your web pages by making informed font
choices.

Topics include:

* The two roads to accessible web text.
* Why would you want to control the text on a Web page?
* Fonts and operating systems.
* A selection of 'safe to use' fonts.
* Why not use images instead?
* What is the best font to use for accessibility?

Read it at: http://www.mcu.org.uk/articles/accessibletext.html

Your feedback is welcomed.

All the best,
Jim
