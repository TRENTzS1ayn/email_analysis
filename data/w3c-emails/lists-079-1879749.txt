As regards to the article, http://www.ideal-group.org/World_Bank/index.asp
I failed to see its basic point, since it contains so many details (even
presented in obscure, inaccessible notations like "1.6B" (intended to
indicate some sum I presume)), but I think second or third reading and
following some key links will help.

I think the basic code is: M = millions, b = billions, t = trillions (American
nomenclature, where "billion" = "thousand million" = 1,000,000,000). An
explanation within the document would help.
