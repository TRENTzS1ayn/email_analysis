Hi,

I saw Dean Jackson's SVG presentation at OzeWAI on Thursday.
http://www.ozewai.org/2002/program-full.html

He was generating his slide presentation from XSLT into a pure SVG slide
show.  This left me with the feeling that there is a much more flexible
alternate for Office suites, and that when Multimedia developers really
understand the power and flexibility of this, it may become the medium of
choice.

As SVG in now becoming installed in more and more devices, and is native in
Mozilla, could we see the default document type on the web becoming .svg,
given it's power and presentation?  I can see a lot of people wanting to
design like this.  I don't have a problem with it because it is XML based.

I'm just wondering about the consequences for the Sematic Web?  There
shouldn't be any, as far as I can see, only peoples abuse of the media by
not supplying real metadata.  And the questions with metadata, given the
report at http://searchenginewatch.com/sereport/02/10-meta.html most people
do not bother with it, not because they don't necessarily care, but time is
money, and to invest time doing something there has to be a return on
investment, and there is little evidence to show any ROI on it now.  But I
do feel that using Dublin Core as a CMS data repository and search
repository is a different matter and offers real value.

What do others think about these issues.

There is a side issue of dynamic SVG replacing dynamic HTML, especially for
pull down menus.  Does this have the same accessibility issues, or does it
overcome some or many of them.

Yours truly,
