Bob

that's a less than useful answer in that it doesn't really give a true
picture of the situation. Yes, it's true that AT cannot read pdf documents
created using Acrobat 4 but (correct me if I'm wrong) it *is* possible using
version 5 to produce documents that are accessible if the creator knows what
they're doing. We are now in a situation where pdf holds similar ground to
html in that unless the developer knows what they're doing the resulting
documents will be inaccessible to some extent. Given that people will still
continue to use pdf shouldn't we be giving a more upbeat message about how
to create accessible versions otherwise we're going to be stuck with
documents that theoretically can be made accessible but aren't because the
creators don't know that it can be done. This is an *interest* group and to
my mind that means exploring possibilities and trying to produce solutions.
Or am I yet another who has seriously misjudged the remit of the list?
