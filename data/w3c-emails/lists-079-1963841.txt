Hi All

Seeing the responses, I think that the subject may be worth persuing; 
however, I do not actually created PDFs using Adobe software - I'm doing 
it all in a Linux environment via GhostScript; think I'd better find out 
the core requirement for Accessible PDF and work out whether GS can do it.

Personally, I think PDF is very relevant to a web discussion; when doing 
electronic design, I spend a lot of time on the sites of semiconductor 
manufacturers; those sites are packed with datasheets and no, they're 
not in HTML format...  I have yet to be convinced that HTML/CSS is a 
good way to serve print documents from the web which is why I'm using 
PDF in the first place.

Cheers

M
