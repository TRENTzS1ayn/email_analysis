Unfortunately many users seem to think this, I don't I see them in very
different areas of the marketplace (although the area of "publishing on
the web" encompasses them both just like HTML/PDF)

I disagree with this, there's still lot of static drawings being done -
this is the only sort of SVG that could remotely be called accessible

Also because you can't really get a sensible linearised reading order,
because the only way to control this also controls the z-index of the
element, and the navigation index, so it's near impossible without lots
of fiddling.
