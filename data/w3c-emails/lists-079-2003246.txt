you are correct, print should not be served from the web but then much
of print is inaccessible anyway.  If you want to serve print from the
web, make it downloadable instead of viewable.

Subject: Accessible PDFs



Hi All

Seeing the responses, I think that the subject may be worth persuing;
however, I do not actually created PDFs using Adobe software - I'm doing
it all in a Linux environment via GhostScript; think I'd better find out
the core requirement for Accessible PDF and work out whether GS can do
it.

Personally, I think PDF is very relevant to a web discussion; when doing
electronic design, I spend a lot of time on the sites of semiconductor
manufacturers; those sites are packed with datasheets and no, they're
not in HTML format...  I have yet to be convinced that HTML/CSS is a
good way to serve print documents from the web which is why I'm using
PDF in the first place.

Cheers

M
