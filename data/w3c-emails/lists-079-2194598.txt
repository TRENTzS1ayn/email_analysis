Thanks Harry, this was the sort of overview that I had in mind.
Unfortunately I haven't the knowledge that is needed but that is why I
joined the list in the first place ;-)

In an earlier post John Foliot said "We re-engineer sidewalks with cut
curbs, so that
those in wheel chairs can get all the way to the steps....". I see it
slightly differently in that after those curb-cuts are introduced we still
get people parking their cars in front of them. People will always use cars
- we need to educate them to park in more considerate places. Similarly,
people will always use pdf format. If possible we need to educate them how
to use them more considerately.
