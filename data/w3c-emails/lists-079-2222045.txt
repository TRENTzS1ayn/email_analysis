I am currently publishing some materials in PDF.  The rationale
for offering PDF was precisely (and solely) to allow for
predictable printing of high quality hardcopy - by those users
who want that, and can benefit from it.

However, I hasten to add that I am using PDF only as a
*secondary* publication format; the primary format is HTML in all
cases.

I do this using free tools (on a linux platform) to output in
both HTML and PDF from from a common (latex) source. Getting the
HTML output into something reasonably (?) accessible did need
some significant hacking on the tools - which I'll try to write
up one of these centuries...

Anyway, here's an example, for what it's worth:

This toolchain is only suitable for a specialised niche
(essentially, publishing "academic" materials); but it seems
quite effective within that niche.  Comments/criticism certainly
welcome...

Cheers,

- Barry.
