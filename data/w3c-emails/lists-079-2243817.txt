yes, the user has to have the software but it *is* free and it doesn't
need
Windoze or IE. Don't get me wrong, I would always rather see content
delivered as hmtl but my point was that others won't and we need to at
least
get them creating accessible pdfs rather than inaccessible ones.

And if I do find one that i think is accessible you shall be the first
to
know ;-)
