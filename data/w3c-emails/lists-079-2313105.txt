That's not really true.  A design aim of PDF was that you could extract
text from it.  Some authoring tools abuse it in a way that makes this
difficult (and the original machine readable source has to be text).  
Also, PDF has what is now calls digital rights management in mind, and
provides ways of instructing the browser not to let you access the 
machine readable text.  This latter point could be seen as a weakness
in HTML and SVG, that may discourage its use where intellectual property
is a big issue.

Version 5 adds a feature to allow deep structure to be represented, but
most HTML pages don't have deep structure correctly represented!
