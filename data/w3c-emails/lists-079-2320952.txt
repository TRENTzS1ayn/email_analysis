It's one, flexible file format, that can convey different forms of 
information in different combinations, although the tagging feature 
is a new addition.

It's basically a combination of graphic primitives for drawing the pages
and structuring information (which in earlier versions included the outline
structure of the document, and the sequence of an article in the sort of
magazine where an article skips a few pages and may have the final column
in a convenient gap.

Pure scanned PDFs have basically one graphic primitive, an image that
fills the whole page, but that is no different from the smaller graphics
on a page with real text, in terms of the primitives used.

Different profiles of the contents have more to do with the authoring tool
than the file format, so, if you wanted to, you would have to refer to
a scan with OCRed underlay as a Acrobat Capture document, although Acrobat
Capture can, presumably, be configured to create one without the underlay.
Many graphic applications may produce the latter.  If GIMP currently doesn't,
it could easily be made to, so naming those by tool is more difficult.
