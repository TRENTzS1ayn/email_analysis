If it is of any use, I published an article on Evolt that provides an easy to 
follow introduction to accessibility and tables:

http://www.evolt.org/article/Building_accessible_tables/4090/42090/index.html

There is also a good discussion below the article from readers along with a 
link to an online table builder that someone submitted.

Hope it is of use to you.
