Most often I find that a complex table is the result of laziness.

Oh good, so it's not just me.

OK, that's good.  I haven't found any really comprehensive documentation
about how all of the attributes are meant to be used.  And when I look at
the table in Opera's author mode (which can linearize tables), I can't tell
if the attributes really *work* or not.

Agreed.  I was just trying to throw somethign together quickly.  Which is
what most people do when they design a table.  Most people being the ones
who don't take accessibility into account:)

Agreed.  I think that the proper approach is to create the table in a manner
that allows for only the scope attribute to be used.

I just threw that in there to have a summary.

I use those attributes along with CSS to speed up table rendering.  The
point is well taken though about the name being on two lines.

As always, thanks for the feedback, Jukka.
