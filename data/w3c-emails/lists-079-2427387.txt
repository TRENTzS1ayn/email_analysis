Agreed.

Agreed.

You may find that my post to the TAG list entirely in agreement with
what you are saying, here.

I didn't quite get my remark about the TAG into a PS in the first instance,
but it was clearly an afterthought and widening of the context.

I did do and write up the homework to explain to the confused what was
going on in the present instance.

I could have linked in my TAG post at the first instance.  I should have
made the line between the Finding and what I could recommend clearer.

The 'natural order of things' to which I referred is that a type agreement
assertion based on successful processing is more reliable than a type
agreement asserted in MIME headers.  When theories clash, it helps to check
the facts.

TAG list post comparing type checking and fixing with the management of 
conditional content:

Please also read the contributions of Tantek Celik to that debate in the
TAG.  You have to understand the truth of what he is saying to come up with
a practical plan for what to do.  Saying we just need the servers to be
better administered is not a practical plan.  Saying browsers should just
throw an error is not a practical plan, either.

We certainly need to be waging a campaign to arrive at more orthodox coding
on the Web.  But saying that browsers simply shouldn't fix things is too far
out of the bounds of reasonable approaches to be an effective strategy in
that campaign.  Browsers shouldn't "simply fix things" but neither is it
true that they "simply shouldn't fix things."  We need a practice
that is less simple; enough so that it includes both error rejection and
error correction, each in its place.

See

  BCP DTDs would get used

for an example of what I think might prove effective as a tactic in an
orthodoxy campaign.  And yes, it involves fudging the line on orthodoxy
relative to the current W3C understanding.  [In a controlled way...]
