I've had similar problems, that turned out of course to be bugs in a
particular level of Netscape, Mozilla, etc.  The combination of styling via
the DIV element, the TABLE element,  and the LABEL element were the
symptoms of the bug.  Can you try removing/replacing the DIV element and/or
the TABLE and see if the problem goes away?

Also view the code in Opera, IE and other levels of Netscape to see if it
is just a Netscape version 6.1 problem.
