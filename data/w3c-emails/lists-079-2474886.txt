I think the problem is that people like Microsoft look at who gets the blame
and who bears the support cost.  If the browser successfully handles the
common mistakes, they don't get blamed and don't get support calls.  People
making more sophisticated use generally are competent enough to work out
what the browser did and work round it without calling for support.
