In my version of IE 6 (6.0.2, SP1 on Win2K): I get nothing.

In my version of Mozilla (Mozilla 1.2a - Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U;
Windows NT
5.0; en-US; rv:1.2a) Gecko/20020910)): I get the following:
http://plugins.netscape.com/plug-in_finder.adp?mimetype=audio/x-wav

In my version of Opera (Version:6.03, Build: 1107, Platform: Win32,
System:
Windows 2000): I get nothing.

In my version of IceBrowser (ICEbrowser v5_2_3): I get nothing.

In my version of IBM HPR (Version 3.0, Build  3.0020001121, Win2K): it
reads
the Alt Text only.

(I'll leave Lynx to Bob...)

Developers should be cautioned that unexpected sounds, or auto-launching
sounds, can cause confusion to users of screen reading technology
(and/or
voice recognition technology employed by mobility impaired users), and
occaisonally hardware conflicts depending on the quality of the sound
card.
Better cards can handle multiple streams, cheaper cards can handle only
one
audio "source" at a time (non-technical explanation.  Hardware gurus can
elaborate if required....)
