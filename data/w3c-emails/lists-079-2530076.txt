or like where I work we have a firewall that literally stops dang near
everything, no attachemnts, no msword docs, no self loading anything, 
(and anyone who thinks were paranoid send a private e-mail and I will tell
you privately some of the stuff we handle, then you tell me if I'm
paranoid?)

but the internet is also a critical part of doing our work, most of our
private e-mails etc are encrypted
