http://www.peepo.com/w3/sound-on-event/test.html

this is a first example of something other than 'ie' playing a sound 
onmouseover, SO something of a celebration :-?

using osX.2: ie5.2, moz1.3a 20021115, work fine, Of course it's just as 
possibly, a fluke...

the code* could possibly be reasonable and supported standard code, I 
just don't know :-{ can anyone comment on this?
(I'm jolly grateful for the feedback, looks like this will need further 
testing...)
