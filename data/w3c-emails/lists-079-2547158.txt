unfortunately onclick does not suit our users, ie how do you click a 
link which has an associated sound, by onmouseover, having to learn to 
click a separate symbol takes up huge amounts of screen, visit peepo 
and imagine where would the extra symbols fit, we are advised that 80 
pixels is a minimum size for a graphic.
