Being able to visually navigate pages and get sound feedback as you move
seems valuable. This is a bit different to what most visually impaired people
do which is navigate by sound and structure alone. So as Jonathan says, it
implies different requirements.

It seems that SVG or XHTML, and a bit of SMIL, are a likely way to solve this
easily, although it isn't a trivial problem. It could of course be done more
or less just in SMIL for visual presentation, but it would seem a bit
artificial. (You define layout regions for each image or letter in peepo, and
then you use interaction events to play a sound - less ideal than the
integrated approach).

The SVG 1.2 working draft says

  The SVG Working Group may produce a W3C Note which defines an SVG+SMIL
  profile, similar to the XHTML+SMIL profile [XHTML+SMIL]. Alternatively, SVG
  could include more of the SMIL elements within the SVG namespace (e.g. the
  par, seq, audio and video elements).

There are demos of doing this that I have seen, although I couldn't find one
in 15 minutes of looking. Maybe X-smiles has one...
