I've had a small thought about why screen readers are no use to our 
clients...
it requires work*:

blind people can't see the distance, and so hear things sequentially, 
and remember these temporal sequences.
SLD people can recognise some spatial relationships, but frequently 
have problems with temporal ones.

in some ways this explains why sound onmouseover is essential, but very 
different from a screenreader.

icab reads a few of the peepo pages very nicely, however, the user has 
no transparent means to relate each sound to a link, to repeat, for 
confirmation, etc
this and much more is provided by sound onmouseover

thanks
