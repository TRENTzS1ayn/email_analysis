It's reasonably complete as is there's not much to simplify, the book
explaining it all is in your local book store :-)

Eh?  clippath can be completely scaled with image, I do it with all the
cutout people in foafnaut for example.

There's serious authoring problems, and with the 1.1 spec there are also
still outstanding issues making accessibility problematic.

you can implement this with relatively simple scripting (see the Tirol
maps from Andre Winter at
http://tirolatlas.uibk.ac.at/maps/thematic/?lang=de for example), I do
not believe it is a good thing for general use though, as it breaks the
convention of other web useragents where enlarging the canvase reveals
more stuff.
