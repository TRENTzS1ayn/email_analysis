Re: Tirol this is a great example and a relief, the zoom tool in adobe 
was really broken, but this is very smooth, great....

Re sound on event code sample"
it may be complete but it runs to hundreds of lines, requires a plugin, 
and seems buggy in xp/ie6, whereas the mac version I wrote is one line 
long.
*SVG really cannot be an appropriate technology if a hundred lines is 
needed to create a sound on event example.

Re: Eh?  clippath can be completely scaled with image, I do it with all 
the cutout people in foafnaut for example.

Does the user have any control over your cut out images?
Why are they better than gifs?
what is the purpose you are putting the transparency to?
this wasn't clear to me, the backgrounds are plain, but images are not 
placed in groups overlapping, unless I missed something.




imagine a group photo of people at a meeting, in which one can blow up 
individuals, and alpha channels ensure they remain in the right depth. 
clip paths would also define hotspot areas. one would have to describe 
objects such as tables that pass thru levels, and decide how these 
affected transformations.

the beta, using gifs is here: http://www.peepo.com/crap/argo3/
unfortunately the hotspots remain extremely confusing....
it does not scale with the window, but this is doable, as per the 
homepage.


thanks
