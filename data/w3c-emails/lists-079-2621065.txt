another dumb question: how does one tab through links in mozilla for 
macosX.2?

David Poehlman mentioned that the sound on event example did not have 
an onfocus event

it does now: http://www.peepo.com/w3/sound-on-event/test.html

and http://www.peepo.com has also had the bgsound onfocus event added.


thanks
