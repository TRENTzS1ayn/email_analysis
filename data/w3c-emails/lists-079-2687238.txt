Hi Tim,

There is an extension for Ie 5.0 that includes:
"Text Highlighter: This Web Accessory lets you highlight text in a document
just like you would in Microsoft Word. It's easy. Select your text, then
right-click and choose Highlight. This tool is very useful for reading long
documents."
It can be download from:
http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/previous/webaccess/ie5wa.asp

Regrettably this extension doesn't work with Ie 6.0 or superior. And I don't
understand why they have eliminated that option so useful.

Best regards,
Emmanuelle

| Hi all,
|
| I have a question about the W3's WAI documents.
|
| I was recently reading the Requirements for WCAG 2.0
| http://www.w3.org/TR/wcag2-req/ and I noticed that in Mozilla 1.2.1 when
| any text is clicked, the whole scope of the paragraph changes color to
| red. I am not sure if this happens in other browsers. Does anyone know
| why this is so?
|
| This also raises a question as to whether this would be a worthwhile
| accessibility feature. For example, an area of text (e.g. Paragraph or
| list item) could be made bolder or slightly larger when clicked. The
| immediate benefit I saw in this technique for for dyslexics, who could
| highlight or enlarge sections of the text by clicking on them
|
| I would be grateful to hear thoughts on this.
|
| Tim
