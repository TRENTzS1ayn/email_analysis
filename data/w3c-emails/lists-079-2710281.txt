IBM HomePageReader can be configured to show this.

Select View -->Show --> Text View

and/or

Settings -->Miscellaneous -->Highlight Progress in the Graphics View

As an added bonus, this makes IBM HRP a useful tool for users with cognitive
impairments... dyslexics, illiterates, users who's mother tongue may not be
that of the page (i.e.: non-anglophone), etc.
