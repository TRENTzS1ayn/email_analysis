SVG has no ability to do sounds, so SVG will never be an appropriate
technology for sounds in a standard environment, I was purely providing
an example of how sound+SVG is available today.
I don't recall there being a hundred lines, as I say check the book the
explanation there certainly isn't 100 lines, I didn't author it, and
whilst I can probably work out what's going on, there's other things I'd
rather be doing.

There's plenty of examples which do use it in that way, there's nothing
stopping the svg elements from overlapping or anything similar:

probably does what you want, as described (and blatantly ripped off at
http://people.w3.org/maxf/Parallax/ )

This would be no problem in an SVG viewer, however given SVGs limitations
you could not make it more accessible than your current version, indeed
it would probably be less accessible, however many parts would be easier
