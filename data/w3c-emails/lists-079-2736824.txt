It is a great pity that SVG and WAI don't have stronger links. It may 
be that in the future with XML around the corner all this has the 
potential to change, but for now people are getting into bad habits....

my concern is that:
http://www.peepo.com/crap/argo3/ degrades reasonably
SVG examples do not, eg noplugin=nothing in many if not most or even 
all cases currently
it is reasonably accessible, SVG examples are not, i've yet to see one 
that uses a keyboard for navigation, the parallax one could easily use 
the arrow keys for instance
it is modular, whereas SVG is monolithic, and that is why it degrades 
so badly.

as well as good accessible paradigms of javascript usage, we need good 
examples of accessible SVG, that degrade beautifully, and they are so 
scarce.

thanks

Jonathan
