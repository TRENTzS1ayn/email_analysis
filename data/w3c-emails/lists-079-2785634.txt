Whilst most of what you say is probably true, this attitude is normally
considered a management virtue, and it is the technical people who have
to be kept from exceeding the literal specification.  This was particularly
true when (before HTML) I worked for a big software house, in which case
succcess on a fixed price contract depended on doing as little as possible
whilst still complying - their ISO 9000 definition was "compliance with 
specification", by which they meant comply with the specification but no
more.
