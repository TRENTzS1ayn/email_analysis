The web page backing the article is at:

http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/intouch_factsheet.shtml

and the real audio should be at:

http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/rams/intouch_current.ram

I don't have Real Audio tools on Linux to verify this.

It's about the National Library for the Blind's web site awards, but
the audio should cover the lack of difficulty of creating accessible
sites, as well; I missed the start, so I'll have to listen to the 
audio from Windows to get the whole item.  I can't find a transcript.

Fortunately they haven't used the random serial numbers in their content
management system, so it is possible to preeict the long term name for
this page (in some cases one has to wait for the next week, before the
archive name is assigned and then search on content).  The archive name
seems to be:

http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/intouch_factsheet_20021210.shtml

The archive name for the audio is almost certainly:

http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/rams/intouch_20021210.ram
