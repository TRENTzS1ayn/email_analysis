See also http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/intouch.shtml ,
the program's front page.  There's a link entitled "text only"
(white, on a white background - I saw it as the page was coming
through my slow modem!) at .. Oh, it's not the program, it's a link to
betsie.  Ugh.

It was only a short article forming part of their weekly program
"for and with" the visually impaired.  They mention the Web from
time to time.

I heard it all (except where I was distracted by getting my supper).

Only 2 (of IIRC 10) judges were visually impaired; both the two were
using Jaws.  Where does that leave the majority of blind people who
couldn't hope to afford such top-end kit, or who just don't want to
deal with a virus-ridden operating system and mandatory GUI?
