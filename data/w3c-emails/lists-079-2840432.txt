has anyone looked at the 6 winning websites:
I can't imagine how
http://www.whichbook.net
got shortlisted let alone won anything.
it's a great service and in some parts not badly executed but IMO doesn't
deserve an award.
it forces the screenreader to use the text only link, and as if that weren't
bad enough it then restricts you to searching only for audio or large print
books.
having the option to search audio or large print would be very handy but
restricting people to only these options in unacceptable.
