Oh cool. It is nice to know people have thought of this.

Two questions:

Have you looked into how strong handedness really is? I write or use a stylus
with my left hand, but mostly use a mouse with my right hand. (I can use a
mouse left-handed, but don't much as it aggravates my overuse problems)

Do you have specific examples of where the problems are? One that I noticed
is positioning of scrollbars. Systems like X have always allowed you to set
the scrollbars to the other side (so you can see what you are scrolling) but
I can't figure out if that is possible on my palmtop which is currently
running windows. Drawing programs tend to allow for floating palettes, which
I realise is a handy feature...

cheers
