Just for fun, I tried to validate theri page at the W3 validator, and
received the following:

Fatal Error: No DOCTYPE specified!
I could not parse this document, because it does not include a DOCTYPE
Declaration. A DOCTYPE Declaration is mandatory for most current markup
languages and without such a declaration it is impossible to validate this
document.

I guess that it might not be accessible to alternative devices either...

Al suggests (below) that accessible means "usable by people with
disabilities".  With all due respect, if we continue to try and sell that
message we will never get ahead.

Might I suggest instead that we say:  "Accessible to any user regardless of
what type of technology they may be using.  This includes, but is not
limited to, cell phones, PDAs, and various types of adaptive technology used
by some people with disabilities."  It comes down to ROI, not humanity I'm
afraid.  One of the best "tricks" I use is to employ a cell phone emulator
to review a client site... the suits get that way more than they get JAWs.
