Very interesting.  Do you have any information on the rates of left
handedness occuring in general populations?  How large of a group of users
are we talking about?  Is the occurance increasing or decreasing in most
populations or is it a characteristic that occurs with relative stability
over time?  Are there any other identifiable user characteristics asoociated
with or directly related to left handedness?
