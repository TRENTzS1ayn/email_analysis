I don't have hard statistics. Quite a lot of research has been done, so if
nobody here has it to hand I can go look for it in my non-existent spare
time.

I understand that the proportion is generally reckoned as on the rise, but
that may just be because it has traditionally been viewed as an aberration to
be corrected, and although that still happens it is much less common in many
large countries.

cheers
