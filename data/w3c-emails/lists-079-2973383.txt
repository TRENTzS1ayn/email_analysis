Well, I wrote one - having to cover what is being srolled in order to scroll
it is a problem. Anyone can respond to this and add thoughts, although
keeping the thing neatly formatted might be kind. I don't see enough
information yet to require a formal process, and don't think this is critical
enough that i will devote resources to it for the moment. If someone is
interested in doing that, I'd love to know.

Well, there are various permutations of left-handed, and various reasons
(when I was a kid they usually had to do with broken arms after playground
accidents - now they tend to be overuse injuries) why people change from one
to the other. I thnk what is also intersting is other problems in the same
class - using a headwand / mouthstick or similar device.
