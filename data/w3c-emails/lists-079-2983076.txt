Bev,

It is generally estimated to be round about 10%, AFAICR.  However, the
incidence has been shown to be different in different demographic groups -
for example, higher in gay men, lower in women than men; higher in younger
than older people (partly because it was "beaten out" of people in the early
C20 as an aberration. I am left handed, as was my Grandad, but he was forced
to sit with his left hand tied behind his back when learning his letters at
school.)
