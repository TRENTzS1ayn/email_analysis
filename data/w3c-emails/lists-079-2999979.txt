Chaals,

  regarding learning disability and input

I've always felt it should be relatively trivial, (or easy) to change 
the contents of toolbars, or personalise them this is one of the 
benefits of linux.

for instance when introducing an email program, it would be much 
simpler if only the compose and send buttons were present, at least 
until a message was received.

ctrl click and drag for all elements of all applications, pass it on to 
UA
