Hello All,

A Quick Note to say that HiSoftware's Enterprise Metadata and Search
tools, Release 6.0, are released. The main areas of Interest for these
lists is what we have done in the way of Integrating Accessibility,
Usability, Metadata Policy, Searchability and Overall Privacy /IP Policy
Management.
http://www.hisoftware.com/press/mds60.htm

In the New Release, using our open database architecture you can now
customize the search result set and interface to communicate with the
AccMonitor Server to filter results based on internal policy as to what
results should be returned.
More Info on AccMonitor:
http://www.hisoftware.com/access/newmonitor.html

For the web site/search engine user: 
They can specify that they want to see accessible content where a
certain level of accessibility is achieved or if a certain level of
accessibility is achieved by a specific W3C WCAG or Section 508
Checkpoint. Additionally the same is true of any custom checkpoint or
Privacy/other Web Site Exposure policy that an organization may publish
as an available selection. Additionally they can select to view only
results where the Page has also had a validated visual review of the
content that cannot be accomplished by a system.

For the content manager: 
They can use a Filter for their Web Server to Prevent content from being
sent as a response to the client if it does not satisfy specific
Accessibility or other Corporate Policy, such as Privacy, IP or Legal
Policy, etc... Allowing for total control of what is served to the user
at point of presentation. HiSoftware Will have search examples as part
of the Internet Search Developers Kit of Metadata Server and we will
release the full source of our Microsoft Internet Information Server
Extension that will be distributed with the developers kit. 

These enhancements and Open API can also be used with any other search
engine or content management system. As always thanks for the feedback
to all who participated during the beta period.

Regards,

Rob Yonaitis
