Good thinking Jonathan. Reminded me that we did that, with the following in
the user agent guidelines:

11.7?Tool bar configuration. (P3)

+ For graphical user agent user interfaces with tool bars, allow the user to
  configure the position of user agent user interface controls on those tool
  bars.
+ Offer a predefined set of controls that may be added to or removed from
  tool bars.
+ Allow the user to restore the default tool bar configuration.

(This covers your use case, which is more serious, more than mine, but
suggesting techniques to the working group is always a good thing).

cheers
