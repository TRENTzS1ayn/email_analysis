Hello Hy,

You wrote:
They didn't even use ALT on their links. <grin>


Is not it  tragic (or to laught at) that such an "accessibile" web
design company-page needs an alternate text-only version as an alt will
be ways too long  to render it correctly in most devices and a longdesc
or d-link  nearly will contain the whole page text?
To render the text-only version correctly in all the browsers, the code
also needs a doc type .

Cheers
Ineke van der Maat
