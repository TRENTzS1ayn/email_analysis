Dear WAI Interest Group Participants:

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) has 
recently started an Interest Group on accessibility issues in Web research 
and development, the Research and Development Interest Group (RDIG). The 
RDIG will host teleconference events every other month.  A core group of 
participants will plan each of these events by selecting a research topic, 
identifying researchers who are investigating and willing to present on the 
topic, inviting others to discuss the topic with them during the 
teleconferences, and summarizing potential follow-up research topics after 
the teleconferences. Samples of topics for teleconferences are included in 
the charter [1].

If you are interested in becoming a regular participant in the planning 
meetings, please read the charter [1] then follow the instructions in the 
"How to Join" page [2]. Please make sure that you are familiar with WAI's 
other areas of activities as well [3]. Our first planning meeting will be 
held Wednesday, 18 December 2002 at 2:00 PM (UTC) [4]. You will need to 
call to a phone bridge that we will provide you. This first planning 
meeting will include preparation for a teleconference event on the 
accessibility of remote Web collaboration. It is also possible to join 
after that date. Topics and times for individual teleconference events, 
apart from the planning meetings, will be announced on the WAI Interest 
Group mailing list.
