Hi -- is anyone aware of any efforts voice content to develop search 
capability?  I'm aware that this is not a trivial problem and would 
require major advances in voice recognition technology.  IMHO we are 
approaching a time of both need and availability of hardware power to 
make such efforts feasible.
