Greetings all,

I'm looking for insight into browser/agent support for related links (<link 
rel="">) in header data.

A very primitive example is available at:
http://www.esoterraka.com/eg/linktest/


I seem to recall that Lynx renders related links as hyperlinks at the top of 
the page? I'm wondering if this treatment is commonplace in other browsers, 
and what alternate rendering schemes people have encountered.  Highly useful 
would be information on how helpful these links are to those using 
text-to-speech or braille oriented technologies.

Furthermore, I suspect the various types of relative links are supported 
differently in each agent? Are there practical advantages to using <link 
rel="bookmark" href="#search" title="Search This Website"> over <link 
rel="search" href="#search" title="Search This Website">? I notice this is 
done on the W3C home page. Any disadvantages to the creative use of both?

Any experiences or information you fine folks can share would be greatly 
appreciated.

Cheers,

JRB
