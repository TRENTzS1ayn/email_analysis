This came up recently on this or another W3C list.

No.  IE does not support it.  (Latest versions of other browsers, e.g.
Netscape 7, do, although it is disabled by default in, at least,
the earlier Mozilla versions that support it.)  The options for
Mozilla are: no-display, always display, display only if at least one
is present.

They are essentially unknown to mass market authors, so there is little
precedent for their use.  rev=made dropped out of the spec, even though
it is better than meta author, which was introduced without consideration
for the link mechanism.  Quite a lot of meta keys would make sense as
URLs, and therefore would be better suited to link (my own theory is
that meta is mainly a way of dumping the document info from MS Word into
HTML).

These too have rather different meanings.  I would argue that the first
should only be used on "a" elements.  Search means that you are going
somewhere to do searches.  Bookmark means that you are going direct to
a sub-heading in a larger page, but is normally used as part of page
that only consists of an outline of the bigger document.  (Note that 
rel and rev can be use on a elements, not just link.)

Same as for any abuse of markup.

Mozilla prefers certain link types and relegates others to a second level
menu.
