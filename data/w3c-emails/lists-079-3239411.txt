rel and rev are hard to understand, one of those inordinately
complex HTML attributes. I probably have flubbed them slightly in my
book pages (and the many, many other places I use them), as
here:

<http://joeclark.org/book/sashay/serialization/Chapter02.html>

(as also found on the book's CD-ROM), but I dunno. You're not gonna
find many other pages online with 29 link elements. My pages light
up nearly the entire Mozilla links toolbar. But until some variation
of Internet Explorer begins to support this *basic* part of HTML 4,
people will continue to pretend they don't exist and don't matter.
