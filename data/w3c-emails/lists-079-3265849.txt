Hi All

Before I started producing Accessible material, I developed a kiosk 
system, the user interface of which is a touch screen displaying a 
server-generated web page on a Mozilla browser.

I need to re-engineer this system and would like to incorporate 
accessibility features where possible.  I would appreciate any comments 
on my ideas:

1) All code to be valid XHTML with CSS formatting.
2) Menu bar - available in "normal" and "huge" icon sizes and 
positionable on either side of screen to cater for "handedness"; this 
would allow the scrolling of pages (the Dark Demon of touch screens?) by 
existing in a transparent layer above the displayed text.
3) Additional visitor preferences of:
      * Show pictures y/n
      * Change text size
      * Change language (subject to availability of translations)
      * Change colour schemes [black & white, black & gold]
4) Optional use of four physical buttons for those who find the touch 
screen hard to use.

I plan to look at a speaking version, once IBM releases the ViaVoice 
toolkit for Linux.  If anyone can suggest a working (preferably free, 
since this is a not-for-profit project) TTS system for Linux that's 
accessible through Perl and only requires a standard sound card - 
there's a pint of beer waiting here for you ;-)

Finally, does anyone know whether it is possible to make a JavaScript 
mouse event emulate the tab key?  (Tabbing between links using touch 
screen).

Cheers

M
