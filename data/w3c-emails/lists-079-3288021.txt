If you have Mozilla embedded you could use CSS absolute positioning, and just
change the style sheet to change the size...

Festival/mbrola is used a lot in linux screen readers - it's free and
available for several languages. The blinux list archives, details at
https://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/blinux-list might be a good place
to look for more information...

<body onclick="focusnextlink()">
 will work if you keep an array of links and where you were at - for a click
on anything that doesn't already have an associated onclick action. If you
have a particular button to do this it should be where the onclick attribute
is...
