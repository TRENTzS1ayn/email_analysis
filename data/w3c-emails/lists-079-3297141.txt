There are issues around touchscreens that I've yet to understand. for 
instance how to change focus....

timing is one route ie tap for redirection, hold for tab, this way 
sighted users notice nothing unusual, unless they hold.
but this is not a standard, so might need to be learnt.... double click 
may also be possible.
bearing in mind that not everyone has the same idea of tap, hold or 
dble.

alternatively:

a tab button on the screen seems a reasonable possibility, who is this 
for?
a blind person might need guidance as to where the tab key was, 
assuming no keyboard is provided.

thanks

Jonathan
