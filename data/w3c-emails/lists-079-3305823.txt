There is classic work at Trace.  I can't tell if you are aware of this as yet.

For your work, you have the luxury of adding functionality in the 
client.  So in a sense you should be looking at software or kiosk 
accessibility resources, not Web Content guides.  The latter are for stuff 
that has to play in a user-selected common denominator of WebTop Client.

An example:  the fundamental blind/touch mode in the EZ package of 
strategies is a single linear menu running up and down the left-hand margin 
of the touchscreen, such that if you rest your finger against the 
mechanical frame around the display surface you are touching the menu entries.

It does rely on a small mechanical button array for things like confirm and for
users with reach limitations.

What is new since that work was done is that there are actually cell phones 
that work like this with a one-dimensional touchbar for selection.  The 
point is that nowadays you will want to consider using one of the Device 
Independence single-authoring tool environments to develop your content and 
mode the html at the server, not entirely adapt it at the client.  Plus you 
will have the access modes supported with browser wrinkles in the software 
in the kiosk.

Best of luck.

Review the DOM Level 2 HTML module to see if there is a built-in TABINDEX 
iterator in this collection of services.  Otherwise, as Charles says, you 
can build the iterator yourself.
