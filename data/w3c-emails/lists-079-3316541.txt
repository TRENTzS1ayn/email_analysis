As between using layers and this idea, I would suggest you keep the layers 
and lose the standards.

Layers are such a natural aid in configuring an assistive capability over 
commodity stuff that I don't think you should reject it yet.

If you can just play SVG in the client and the SVG is a big image map, with 
title and desc supplied so it is a client-side self-documenting image map, 
then you can
provide the interaction smarts at the server where you control the code and 
it's a lot easier to support.

Look at a Web Service talking XForms.  The touch mode is XForms in 
SVG.  The other modes are different bindings of the same service with the 
same content at the XForms level.

Google for "Dave Pawson SVG FAQ" and enjoy.
