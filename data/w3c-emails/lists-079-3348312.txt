Hello, my name is Abhijit Ghosh. I currently work at the National Cancer
Institute in the Communication Technologies Branch. As part of the 508
initiative, we are looking to test our website with low vision to no
vision users using JAWS, Window-Eyes, and in the future Screen
magnifying software.

The  Communication Technologies Branch at the National Cancer Institute
is helping lead an effort  to evaluate different federal web sites and
make them usable and useful to users with disabilities of various kinds:
vision,
hearing, motor.  Recently we have started trying to assemble a panel of
volunteers with low vision or no vision who would agree to be web site
testers and join a database of volunteers we could call once or
repeatedly to help us evaluate federal websites. Users will need to be
in the Northern Virginia, D.C, Maryland area.

We will pay every volunteer for 2 hours of testing time at our facility.
We
would pay $100 to each user in cash. In addition, we would cover for
transportation cost.

They would make a huge contribution to aiding multiple agencies who
provide web information to users with disabilities.  For the low vision
part of the
project, we would like to have both expert and novice users of screen
readers (Jaws and WindowEyes) as well as users who require magnification
devices/techniques.

Our group is responsible for the web site http:/www.usability.gov>
which is a rich source of information presenting and advocating
evidence-based principles regarding web design and usability.  We also
do research on
user-centered design in our a state-of-the-art usability testing and
training facility near the White Flint Metro stop in Rockville,
Maryland.

Please ask any folks you think would want to volunteer to contact:
Abhijit Ghosh
ghoshab@mail.nih.gov
phone 301 594-9080
fax 301 435-6069

We certainly would appreciate as wide a distribution of this message as
possible.
