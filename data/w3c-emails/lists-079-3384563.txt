I suggest you keep a couple of things in mind.  this is a usability
organization and they are testing for section 508.  508 is fairly narrow
in its assumptions and while it might be prudent (I certainly do) for an
organization to test with as broad a number of environments as possible,
it is also prudent that they start with what section 508 is asking for
and what most people use.  In the message, it is indicated that this
will expand but thanks for the discussion.
