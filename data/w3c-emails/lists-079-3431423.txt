As others have mentioned, this is not the right approach to testing
website accessibility.  At best it tests one narrowly-defined aspect
of accessibility; at worst it risks reinforcing any bad practices
you may have - such as authoring to browser behaviour at the expense
of presenting the website contents clearly.

Both JAWS and Window-Eyes deal with one particular disability.
Both are themselves inaccessible to many users, by virtue of cost
and the prerequisites required to install them.
