I recommend not using transparency for icons, with the possible exception of
a background that isn't what is internal to the icon, and where the outer
border of the icon (minus the transparent background) isn't important anyway
(for cases where it is the same colour as the user's background - similar to
what you are getting on the high-contrast setting).

Cheers
