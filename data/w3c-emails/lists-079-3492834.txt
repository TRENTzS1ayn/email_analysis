NO! the point is web sites should be designed to work on ALL adaptive
browsers not ONLY the most expensive.  
  and much adaptive technology is given away, nothing against anyone
trying to sell it, but don't by design limit it to the software that cost
money

and explain how Jaws or Window-Eyes work on a Mac, or Uinx operating
system, or on a 286 with 100mb harddrive and 10mb Ram???
  heck explain how Jaws or Window-Eyes will work on my Pentium with a
dual hard drive 40gb/4gb and the latest and greatest Red Hat 8.0 OS, and
logging onto the web in Lynx (latest version)  

it works both ways

was using some major Non computer examples, didn't want to discuss em, but
sometimes showing a non computer example is usefull

Oxygen is not that common and certainly not free, but less expensive than
having purified tanked air in a hermetically sealed enviorenment.

and I'm still waiting for you to explain how they work on a Mac or Unix
system....

  for less than $100 I can put a top of the line Linux operating system on
a computer that won't even run Jaws, and get it talking in emacspeak..it
works both ways....

I understand your bias, and sell JAWS to the big corporations but at least
allow the little smuck in his subsidized apt running a donated second line
computer on his dial up regular telephone to access the web too.  Because
there are a lot more of the later, and the census is the evidence of that.
