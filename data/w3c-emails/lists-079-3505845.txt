Hi Bill,
I know that Autonomy has the ability to search video and voice and can also transcribe both into text in real time (with about 85% accuracy). It is expensive, but it is also very good at natural language search. I'm sorry to add that the Autonomy site is not accessible, but if you can look at it, go to http://www.autonomy.com/

I hope that this helps. I have seen and used this technology and it does work, although, like  anything, it ain't perfect.

Cheers
Simon

Hi -- is anyone aware of any efforts voice content to develop search 
capability?  I'm aware that this is not a trivial problem and would 
require major advances in voice recognition technology.  IMHO we are 
approaching a time of both need and availability of hardware power to 
make such efforts feasible.
