if the site followed the standards (WAI/508) there should be no major
problems because the standards are well tested.   but this test does not
appear to be to a "standard" but to check out their own website to see if
it works with a limited set of assistive software and equipment rather
than to the established standard.

of course the expectations are way up there, as someone who has been on
what passes for the internet for over 20 years I am seriously dismayed by
the degradation of accessibility over the years, the equipment and
software is getting better but total access is getting worse...would you
not be dismayed?
