As I get more and more involved in Web development, I cannot ignore that the
situation is only going to grow worse.  This is in large part due to
programmers who are moving from software development to Web development.
They rely too much on WYSIWYG tools, such as JDeveloper, Struts and Visual
Basic.  Because they have, in the past, had little or no constraint in how
they've had to create code, except for the platform, they have no desire to
put the effort into properly writing markup.  As long as the pages display
and work in Internet Explorer then they think that their job is done. This
is a huge problem that I'm having to deal with on a daily basis.
