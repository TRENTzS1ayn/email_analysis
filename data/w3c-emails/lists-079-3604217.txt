Precisely.  I think that's it's just been in the last few months that I
realized that uneducated developers are just as bad as uneducated designers.
And in my case, through the use of tools such as Struts, our developers are
having to jump through hoops to make it produce proper markup.  I think
they'd be better off just leaving it behind and writing everything properly
from the start.
