right, I'm not a web designer but rather an engineer but I always tell
anyone to "write it up and put your whole web site together completely
using ascii text then when it is done and working right, add in your
little "pretties and eye candy" but make sure you have a fully functional
and understandable site BEFORE putting up anything but clear text"  not
perfect by any means but they have to put something together that is not
dependent on graphics so it is a lot easier to clean up what they still
manage to mess up.

and NO pdf, period!
