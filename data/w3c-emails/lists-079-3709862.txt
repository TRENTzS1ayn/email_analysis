jaws for dos with lynx for dos and unix with lynx through telnet via
jaws for windows or dos and jaws for windows with netscape and as bob
has said, lynx on linux.  I dare say that there are others if I am not
missing your point but my and bob's point is that even with the latest
netscape we cannot access current sites.  some of this is more due to
the browser/useragent/at combo than the sites, but none the less, if
pages are coded to standards and all the malarky left out of them that
does not need to be there in the first place or ok, Ill bend from your
article, if they are served up propperly, we should be able to access
them with other than those two ats and ie.
