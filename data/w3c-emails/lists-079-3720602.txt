According to www.m-w.com, the meaning of "post" includes:
a. to publish, announce, or advertise by or as if by use of a placard
b. to enter on a public listing

and "publish" includes:
a. to make generally known
b. to disseminate to the public

I "post" to a  mailing list like WAI-IG. I "publish" Web sites, as my
purpose in doing so is to communicate to as wide an audience as possible,
not solely to a specific list.

In my Web site work I both "design" (content, look-and-feel) and "develop"
(code and other techie issues). Both correctly done code and well-designed
content and visual layout support accessibility. 

While it's important that Web pages read correctly with screen readers,
conscientious layout and use of images may help people with certain
cognitive disabilities better access the Web, as well as provide a more
pleasing and usable Web experience for sighted users in general. I, for one,
find heavily text-based sites with poor/no use of images and white space
hard to access.

Hear, hear!

Another issue is dealing with content creators who are accustomed to writing
material and seek to "publish" there tomes on the internet.  We also have
"designers" who approach web development strictly from an esthetic
perspective, with little thought to underlying functionality.

Everybody, repeat after me: "We don't *publish* web sites, we POST them.  We
don't *design* web sites, we DEVELOP them."  (I'm thinking of getting a
t-shirt printed.)
