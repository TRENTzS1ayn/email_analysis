You then are the exception to the rule.

I deal with visually oriented civil servants who cannot fathom why it is not
enough to take their powerpoint presentations and export them as HTML, or
take their MS Word Docs and "print" them to PDF and publish them on the web
like some modern age guttenberg printing press.  I make the distinction to
impress upon them that it's not simply "click, click, click" and voila, web
page.  Remember, these are the same people who "highlite" text in Frontpage
and make it Bold and Font Size 6 instead of using the Heading Element.

Thus, I use the technically correct term of Post (the companion of Get) when
uploading completed web content to the web server.  It's a mind set thing.

Same with design.  I appreciate that esthetics and usable design is an
integeral part of web development (not to mention one of the things that
gets the signed contract in the private industry world); I also spent half
an hour with a designer last week who argued with me over scalable font
sizes because "it didn't look nice".  Give me a break!  Photoshop should be
one of the tools used in web site development, not the only tool.  I once
consulted with a group of developers who told me that "the designer gave
them a series of PSD files and told them to turn them into web pages".
Puleeez...  Doesn't that sound like putting the cart before the horse?

So Blossom, pardon me if my position seems strident (there *are* more
radical voices on this forum), but we gotta start drilling into their heads
that web pages are not a cross between TV and Newspapers or magazines...
it's a whole lot more (and sometimes needs to be a little bit less) than
either.
