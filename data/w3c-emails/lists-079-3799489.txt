Dear WAI Interest Group Participants:

The Evaluation and Report Language [EARL] 1.0 [1], an RDF schema, was 
published on the W3C Technical Reports page [2] as a W3C Working Draft on 6 
December 2002.

The EARL 1.0 Working Draft explains how to use EARL, a general-purpose 
language for expressing test results, and defines a basic vocabulary for 
EARL. While EARL is flexible enough to be used for any kind of test result, 
the accessibility benefits include:
1. storing information about conformance to the Web Content Accessibility 
Guidelines [WCAG] 1.0 [3], the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 
[4], and/or the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 [5];
2. searching for Web content that conforms to specific WCAG checkpoints;
3. generating evaluation and conformance reports.

A Working Draft status means that the document is under development and 
that public comment is invited. The Evaluation and Repair Tools Working 
Group [ERT WG] [6], which is developing EARL 1.0, welcomes your comments by 
31 January 2003 on the ERT WG mailing list, at w3c-wai-er-ig@w3.org. Public 
archives of this list are available. [7]

Please address any questions about the document to the ERT WG 
(w3c-wai-er-ig@w3.org).

Regards,

Wendy Chisholm, Chair, Evaluation and Repair Tools Working Group, W3C
and
Judy Brewer, Director, Web Accessibility Initiative, W3C
