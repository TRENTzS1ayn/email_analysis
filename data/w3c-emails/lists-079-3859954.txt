BUSH SIGNS E-GOVERNMENT ACT
This week President Bush signed the E-Government Act of 2002, which is
intended to foster more effective and efficient electronic
communication among government agencies and with government employees
and the public. The bill creates an Office of Information, within the
Office of Management and Budget, which is directed by a federal chief
information officer. Groups such as the Information Technology
Association Of America supported the bill and said its passage
relatively soon after the September 11 attacks--which highlighted
breakdowns in government systems--was coincidental. The bill also won
support from privacy groups, which typically are opposed to measures
that facilitate greater and easier gathering and sharing of personal
information among government agencies.
