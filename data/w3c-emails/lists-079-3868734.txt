Chuck,

I'd like to mention, that if it were open source, other people would 
most likely mirror it, and help with development, and bug reports. I 
find the lock out very unhelpful, we check pages say once a quarter, 
and need a run at it, drip feeding is very nearly useless, and 
generally resort to assuming that pages are OK rather than wait 
interminably.

As a non-profit, with a low and remarkably irregular income, its not so 
much the one off $99 as the regular licensing that puts me off, perhaps 
you could consider a once in a lifetime fee, with indefinite upgrades, 
after all you most likely need to spread ownership rather than keep 
users.

thanks

Jonathan
