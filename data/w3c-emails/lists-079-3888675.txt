Jonathan,

Just two quick comments in response.  First, CAST is a not-for-profit
organization too.  Most of our funding comes from foundations and
federal grants.  What little comes to us from product sales and
royalties goes right back into product development and free support.
Secondly, decisions about licensing will be made by Watchfire, not CAST.
They now own Bobby.

Chuck

Chuck,

I'd like to mention, that if it were open source, other people would 
most likely mirror it, and help with development, and bug reports. I 
find the lock out very unhelpful, we check pages say once a quarter, 
and need a run at it, drip feeding is very nearly useless, and 
generally resort to assuming that pages are OK rather than wait 
interminably.

As a non-profit, with a low and remarkably irregular income, its not so 
much the one off $99 as the regular licensing that puts me off, perhaps 
you could consider a once in a lifetime fee, with indefinite upgrades, 
after all you most likely need to spread ownership rather than keep 
users.

thanks

Jonathan
