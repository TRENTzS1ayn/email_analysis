Could not this problem be dealt with by simply checking the referer page
and if there referer field was not CAST (or, now WatchFire) either
reject the request, or throttle back the service?

I'd like to mention that the free page test limits are due primarily to
the abuse of developers who wrote scripts to run against the Bobby
server attempting to replicate the functionality of the $99.00 Bobby
client. 

Those scripts were taking the CAST server down so often that there were
periods when Bobby was not available at all.  I understand that
Watchfire had the same experience and found it necessary to impose
similar limits.
