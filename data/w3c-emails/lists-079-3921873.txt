It gives good access to the Grocery services of Tesco, which I think
would be the best part of the site for users with disabilities. I know
if I was going to Tescos site it wouldn't be for half of the other
nonsense on there (although banking services are disappointingly not
there)

Also, I like the way they have explained on their sign up form:

"This is the first of two registration pages"

If I was buying my groceries online, I think I would be using the access
version.

Is one of those seriously meant to be a "version" of the other?
