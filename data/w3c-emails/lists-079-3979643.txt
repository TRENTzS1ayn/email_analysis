This actually brings up a good point.

With all the time that is spent on great open source "free for all"
products on sites such as SourceForge, what do list members actually
think is the reason that no large scale "open-source" accessibility
validation tool exists.

By this I mean a tool that is developed in the true open-source way -
not by a for profit or not-for-profit organization, but by developers
not even connected geographically.

You are right, I did not describe my views.  We made a choice and no
longer have such rights.

Chuck,

You didn't describe your views on open source.
Have CAST signed away right to help develop such a product?
