probably because there needs to be enough folks interested in a project
before it is done...accessiblity validation is apparently a project that
is either low priority or of low interest in the community.

 probably one of the major drawbacks of open source at this time is the
lack of business software which is a catch 22, folks don't use open source
because the lack of business software and business software isn't written
because there are so few useres

heck it wasn't until just recently that we got decent open source
accounting software.....
