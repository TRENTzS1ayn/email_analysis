 U.S. & Canada Adopt New Braille Terminology

 The Braille Authority of North America (BANA) announces a change in
 terminology to what has been traditionally known as "grade 1" and
"grade
2"
 braille.
 These categories will now be referred to as "uncontracted" and
"contracted"
 braille respectively.

 The change is being made at the request of many in the blindness
field.
 People often confuse grades of braille with first and second grades in
 elementary
 school. BANA believes that the change to more accurately descriptive
 language will increase awareness and improve the overall understanding
of
 how braille
 is learned, read, written and transcribed.

 BANA urges all organizations, agencies, teacher training programs,
braille
 production facilities, software developers, professionals in the field
of
 blindness
 and braille readers to incorporate this terminology into writing,
 publications, presentations and general practice. The ultimate goal is
to
 enhance understanding
 and more accurately reflect what braille truly is--a versatile and
effective
 reading and writing system for people of all ages who are blind and
visually
 impaired.
