  As far as I can recall, what you say about Microsoft mail clients, in
 particular Outlook, is correct. I am afraid there is very little their
 users can do, save change mail client.

  May I suggest a mail filtering software that deletes "Out of Office"
 replies ?

  It is, so far, the only way I have been able to survive on public mailing
 lists.

  Happy [insert festive season of choice] to you all.
