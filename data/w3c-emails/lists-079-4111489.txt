On a single Linux box, that could be duplicated comfortably for $100
in todays market (that's the HTML validator - not sure about the CSS).

But Bobby spent its last three years or so at CAST based on very, very
broken technology.

Having just bad-mouthed bobby, I should say in their defence that I
would reserve the right to limit access to Valet if I thought it was
being abused.  And that doesn't necessarily imply abuse of a kind
that would put a strain on the server.  OTOH, I would at least seek
to do so without flagrantly violating HTTP.  W3.org is different:
their tools are - as they can and indeed must be - explicitly
non-commercial.
