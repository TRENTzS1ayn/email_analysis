Hi All

Thank you David for this important reminder.

When I worked for a major multinational, I saw the entire mail system 
"die" as the result of an auto-responder; one user had set up a "Reply 
to All" rule.  The infinite loop caused major network disruption, not to 
mention major headaches for those of us who had angry users on the phone 
saying that their mail was not working.

So, please folks, just un-subscribe if you really do have to use one of 
these beasts.

Cheers & Happy Holidays
