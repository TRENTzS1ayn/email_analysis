Hi Barry,

This is an interesting report. A couple of quick observations:

I thought that the report very clearly identified the limitations of the
methodology and how valuable this kind of work can be despite those
limitations. That struck me as a very valuable part.

It would have been good to have an analysis of when tests were 'not
applicable' - for example approximately 1/3 of sites had problems with the
way they used frames, but it is not clear in the report if that is all the
sites that use frames, or if 1/3 of the sites surveyed used frames but didn't
introduce the same barriers.

As the report points out, delimiting what a site is is a tricky business.
However the use of description and keywords metadata as a key requirement was
an interesting choice. Do you have any data (or know of any) on what
proportion of sites, and what type of sites, don't have these? (I imagine it
is low, but it is certainly not zero, and I find myself wondering...).

Thanks (also to the students who worked with you) - I found this a
well-thought out and interesting read on a Sunday morning.

cheers
