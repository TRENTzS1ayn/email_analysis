Matthew, did you have any comments?

having thought about this a little more and tried out our new Donuts 
'recipe' site*, I realise that this is a really serious problem.
Using an ipaq many students had problems learning the pressure that was 
sufficient to work as a tap,
nearly the whole screen is an image linked to the next page. yes the 
screen was walloped and still failed to click....
few would be able to navigate, if the screen size of a link was less 
than 1/4 screen size.

so tab and enter buttons are certainly a bonus.  the ipaq would seem 
not to offer these, except in linux(if I remember rightly) it does 
offer scroll options.

thanks

Jonathan
