I would disagree with this. I don't think accessibility is low in
priority.

Primarily, tools like Bobby would not get overloaded and neither be
viable for a commercial company like Watchfire to own if there was
little interest in accessibility validation.

Secondly, the sheer amount of work on accessibility that has gone into
the Gnome Desktop Accessibility features, which is entirely open-source,
and won an accessibility award this year for the community effort.

This is slightly off-topic, but what is meant by "business software"? I
use the Linux OS to run a business and have no problem locating very
high quality software that suits my needs.

I still stand by the point that it is quite amazing that no open-source
accessibility software has been developed, and I cannot believe given
the dedication of the open-source community that the reasons above ring
true.
