Hi Charles -

Thanks for the helpful and constructive feedback

For the record, a somewhat more concise and integrated (?)
version of the report has now been formally published in the
journal First Monday, at this URL:

That's a fair point.  Because we just used bobby off the shelf
this sort of thing does not fall out automatically (e.g., bobby
doesn't generate any diagnostic just for using frames per se, but
only for misuse of frames).  But it should not be too difficult
to add some such analysis.  We'll certainly discuss it in looking
at further development.

We certainly don't have any data on this; and, indeed, in the
survey we have just reported on, descriptions and keywords did
not really play much of a role - they were referred to only in
passing, when we were trying to get a quantitative estimate for
the total size of the "Irish Web".  But they will potentially
play a greater role as we look at scaling up, and automated
sampling (using, for example, the Open Directory Project
database).

Thanks again, and best wishes to all for the holiday season,

- Barry.
