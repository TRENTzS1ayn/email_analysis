Dear All,
I just wanted to thank you all on this list for all the valuable help that I have received over the past two years since I joined this list. It is a sad day today as I am leaving my full time post here at JKD and leaving the accessibility arena. I have recently found that my email address has been closed for much of the past month and I have already been unsubscribed. I am taking up a part time post here at JKD while working elsewhere doing what I like to do best - write.

I wish everyone on the list all the best in the future and I hope that accessibility will shortly be top of every webmaster's agenda in 2003.

Thank you all once again.

Kindest regards

Simon
