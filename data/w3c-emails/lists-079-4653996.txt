"Even for literate users, however, icons are quicker to scroll through 
since they are easier to recognise than text"

http://www.learningdifferently.com/cybertracker/  is a page taken from 
the helpfiles of this 'greensource' download.
Their homepage is http://www.cybertracker.co.za

there is an excellent icon viewer to see the hundreds of symbols 
available.
