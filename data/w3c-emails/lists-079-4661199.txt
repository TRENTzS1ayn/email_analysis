Relatively simply, by having an icon (favicon or other) that loads the 
webpage on the desktop.
or having a local carer who navigates to the page. We have users that 
do both.
This right clicking problem can be physical, drug induced, related to 
learning difficulty, or other....
In an ideal world this introduction to the web could be semi-automated, 
memorise where you got to blah blah but we are not there yet.
This might in any case interfere with the spontaneity that motivates.
