Hello -

Are the public identifiers in a DOCTYPE statement case-sensitive ? 

For example, the DOCTYPE for HTML 4.01 Strict is specified in the W3C's
recommendation as : 

!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN"
            "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd"


Should the following declaration be considered as a valid DOCTYPE
statement too ?

!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//w3c//dtd html 4.01//en"
   "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd"


Thank you
Carmen
