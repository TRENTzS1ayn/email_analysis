Just so you know what the techniques group is up to, we are indeed thinking
of issues around browser support. For techniques that are only supported in
certain user agents, or that go awry in certain user agents, that
information will be stored with the technique. It should be possible to pull
up lists of techniques that work on certain setups or that you should avoid.
We've also identified a potential need to create techniques that are
specifically workarounds for user agent problems. How we'll do that exactly
is not yet determined and it could be an endless task, so we'll probably
narrow it down by restricting it to moderately recent versions of
technologies, but hopefully that addresses the issue you're raising. As far
as architectural materials go, that is likely to be minimized in the
techniques themselves, but we will explicitly link to relevant resources. So
the information should be available in context even though it's not part of
the substance of the techniques themselves.
