I am aware that some people also swop between different settings, ie they 
may choose to work with black text on a white background in the morning, 
then as their eyes tire they might change their preferences to white text 
on a black background.

Also, when implementing the style switcher it is important not to prevent 
people from using their own style sheet or browser preferences.  I have 
seen some switchers that do this and if the choices offered do not suit 
someone's needs it can be quite limiting.

Cheers,
Sandra.
