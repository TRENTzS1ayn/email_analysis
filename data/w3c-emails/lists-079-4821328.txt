My understanding is that the original reason for using white (or green or 
orange) on black was that flicker is more obvious on large areas of solid
white.

Viewing GUIs on CRTs, I get the impression that some rasterisers on some
fonts don't handle white on black well (you need to handle them differently
because a white pixel is larger than a black pixel, to ensure that adjacent
white pixels overlap, when using a write white device, like a typical
CRT.
