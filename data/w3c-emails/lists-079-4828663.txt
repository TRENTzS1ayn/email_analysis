http://www.a-sites.org A web portal for visually impaired people

from yesterday's Guardian (Sight Aid):
http://www.guardian.co.uk/online/webwatch/0,12443,793949,00.html

we hope that http://www.peepo.com might be the first accessible web 
portal that they list.
however as many of the sites we link to are not accessible to their 
users, this may not be appropriate.

Accessible portal designers eat concrete for breakfast :-)
