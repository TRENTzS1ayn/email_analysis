Nick.

top right and left are images, they are blue text, but on a light fawn 
(complementary?) background, where is the light blue?

FYI: creating an accessible portal can be a problem, and if one limits 
oneself to only linking to accessible websites it could become a 
headache.
Similar then to eating concrete for breakfast, constipating. Of course, 
it does depend on the audience, W3C doesn't have a problem.
