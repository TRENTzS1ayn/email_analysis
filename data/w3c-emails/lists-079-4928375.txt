Hi Everyone,
I have a questionnaire within which the questions can have 1 of 4 types 
of answers.  Answers can be either textbox, dropdown list, radio 
buttons, or checkboxes.  The problem lies within the multi-answer types 
(radio buttons and checkboxes), because I can't associate the question 
text with them.  Furthermore, if I associate their respective answer 
text, then the singleton answer types (textbox and dropdown list) have 
no labels.

 From what I could find with my own research, the only solution to the
problem is to use FIELDSET and LEGEND.  The problem with this solution
is that FIELDSET puts boxes around everything within the FIELDSET, and
there is no way to turn off the border.  So, for now, what I did was to
conditionally associate the question text with the answer - when the
answer is either a textbox or dropdown list.  In cases where the answer
is a set of radio buttons or checkboxes, I associate the answer text
with its respective radio button or checkbox.

If you can provide me with any other solutions, or input of any kind on
this issue, it would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Scott
