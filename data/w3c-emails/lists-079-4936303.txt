I'm not 100% I followed exactly what your problem is, so please
forgive me if I'm giving obvious answers...not trying to sound
patronising, simply trying to cover all bases first...

Boxes as in visual boxes ? Use CSS

<style type="text/css">
fieldset {
border: none;
}
</style>

Look at the source of the below test page...maybe that will shed a bit
