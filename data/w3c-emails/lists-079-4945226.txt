Re-reading your original question, it may be useful to add the
following to my (fieldset-centric) reply:

Fieldset should be used when you have multiple inputs relating
to the same question (ideal example would be radio buttons or
checkboxes). In the case of a single textbox or dropdown list,
you wouldn't need to use a fieldset (unless it's to logically
group multiple questions within a single topic area), so a normal
label associtated with the textbox of select should suffice.
