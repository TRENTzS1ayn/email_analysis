Full Text of Release:

State of Florida Governors ADA Working Group in Collaboration with Florida
s State Technology Office Selects HiSoftware Content Quality and
Accessibility Solutions

Concord, NH June 06, 2003  HiSoftware Company, the leader in enterprise
content quality management solutions, announced today that the State of
Florida Governors ADA Working Group will be implementing AccVerify,
AccRepair and AccMonitor Server from HiSoftware Company to manage state-wide
accessibility initiatives. This project is a collaborative effort between
the Governors ADA Working Group, the Florida Department of Management
Services, and the Florida State Technology Office (STO).

This initiative is part of an emerging policy framework that recognizes the
vision of Governor Jeb Bush to maximize the accessibility of Florida
Government to all of its citizens. By so doing, citizens are empowered with
information to make informed choices to improve the quality of their lives,
which is particularly critical for persons with disabilities.

This is one component of the Working Groups Accessible Electronic
Information Technology (A-eIT) program. It is tied to the Working Groups
mission and also incorporates their federal Systems Change effort know as
the Real Choice Partnership Project which is part of President George Bush
s New Freedom Initiative spearheading community living for persons with
disabilities across the nation.

HiSoftware provides out-of-the-box testing and reporting for
accessibility, privacy, searchability and usability standards, empowering
organizations to keep up with ever-changing Web technologies and standards.
The software will be made available to evaluate, remediate and manage the
State of Floridas websites and web applications for conformance with
accessibility guidelines as directed by Governor Bush in 2002. The Governor
s ADA Working Group coordinates plans and oversees accessibility education
for State government agencies.

The State of Florida Governors ADA Working Group and the STO join a growing
list of government agencies turning to HiSoftware Company for content
quality and accessibility compliance solutions, including the U.S.
Department of Transportation, Internal Revenue Service, and Department of
Defense. HiSoftware Company also works with Fortune 1000 corporations
including Microsoft Corporation, Mercury Interactive, and Commerce One,
State and local government agencies and educational institutions:

Under the terms of the agreement, HiSoftware Company will provide an
enterprise license of its AccMonitor Server software to the Governors ADA
Working Group for use by its webmasters, application developers, and Section
508 compliance experts. The Governors ADA Working Group, in partnership
with the State Technology Offices (STO) web application developers, will
also be able to utilize HiSoftwares user-driven interactive desktop
solutions, AccVerify and AccRepair, and AccVerify and AccRepair for
Microsoft FrontPage to test and remediate their projects for compliance with
Section 508...

Section 508, an amendment to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, requires
electronic and information technology that is used, developed, and procured
by the Federal government to be accessible to people with disabilities.
Governor Jeb Bush adopted Section 508 as the standard for state government
in all electronic information and the purchasing of information technology.
