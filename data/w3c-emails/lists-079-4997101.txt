SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION PURCHASES WEB EYES? FROM ION SYSTEMS, INC.

(June 7, 2003)---Crystal City, Missouri.  ION Systems, Inc. announced
today the sale of Web Eyes? Enterprise and 6,000 copies of Web Eyes
Personal to the Social Security Administration. SSA is the largest
client to date to purchase a combination of Web Eyes implementation -
one for the external public who come to the SSA Web sites and one for
internal employee usage.

"Web Eyes is an intriguing IE browser plug-in that not only solves the
tiny-typeface problem of Web sites, but also makes it easier to read
long Web documents by extracting the content and displaying the text in
columns - in the typeface and type size of your choice", said Jill
Thomas, President of ION Systems.

The Web Eyes plug-in creates a new IE toolbar with buttons that give
surfers much more control over the way pages are displayed. Click an
"on" switch in the toolbar, and you can adjust the size of the Web
browser's standard typeface from 4 points (too tiny to read) to 144
points, (which makes each letter almost 2 inches high).  Unlike IE, Web
Eyes will override the type size on most sites that lock in their
typefaces. That alone would make Web Eyes a good tool for middle-aged
eyes - and an excellent choice for those with more seriously impaired
vision or sites concerned with Section 508 compliance.

Even more useful for heavy Web users is a feature called the Web Eyes
Reader, which grew out of ION Systems' experience with electronic book
publishing. Web Eyes Reader extracts the content from any Web site and
displays it in a separate window, a page at a time, formatted more or
less as it would be in a book or magazine. The reader can even display
the text in columns, which use ION's patented continual reflow as you
move through the document. The size of the type is adjustable and Web
Eyes never repeats text.

ION Systems sells two versions of Web Eyes. The consumer version, called
Web Eyes Personal, installed on a user's PC, works on any Web site. A
version for Webmasters allows visitors to download a plug-in that's good
for any Web Eyes Registered site.  A trial version can be obtained at
www.IONWebEyes.com.
