State of Florida Governor?s ADA Working Group in Collaboration with Florida?s State Technology Office Selects HiSoftware Content Quality and Accessibility Solutions
Concord, NH June xx, 2003 ? HiSoftware Company, the leader in enterprise content quality management solutions, announced today that the State of Florida Governor?s ADA Working Group will be implementing AccVerify, AccRepair and AccMonitor Server from HiSoftware Company to manage state-wide accessibility initiatives. This project is a collaborative effort between the Governor?s ADA Working Group, the Florida Department of Management Services, and the Florida State Technology Office (STO). 

 

This initiative is part of an emerging policy framework that recognizes the vision of Governor Jeb Bush to maximize the accessibility of Florida Government to all of its citizens. By so doing, citizens are empowered with information to make informed choices to improve the quality of their lives, which is particularly critical for persons with disabilities.

 

This is one component of the Working Group?s ?Accessible Electronic Information Technology? (A-eIT) program.  It is tied to the Working Groups mission and also incorporates their federal ?Systems Change? effort know as the ?Real Choice Partnership Project? which is part of President George Bush?s New Freedom Initiative spearheading community living for persons with disabilities across the nation.

 

HiSoftware provides ?out-of-the-box? testing and reporting for accessibility, privacy, searchability and usability standards, empowering organizations to keep up with ever-changing Web technologies and standards.  The software will be made available to evaluate, remediate and manage the State of Florida?s websites and web applications for conformance with accessibility guidelines as directed by Governor Bush in 2002.  The Governor?s ADA Working Group coordinates plans and oversees accessibility education for State government agencies.

 

The State of Florida Governor?s ADA Working Group and the STO join a growing list of government agencies turning to HiSoftware Company for content quality and accessibility compliance solutions, including the U.S. Department of Transportation, Internal Revenue Service, and Department of Defense.  HiSoftware Company also works with Fortune 1000 corporations including Microsoft Corporation, Mercury Interactive, and Commerce One, State and local government agencies and educational institutions: http://www.hisoftware.com/access/scustomers.html

 

Under the terms of the agreement, HiSoftware Company will provide an enterprise license of its AccMonitor Server software to the Governor?s ADA Working Group for use by its webmasters, application developers, and Section 508 compliance experts. The Governor?s ADA Working Group, in partnership with the State Technology Office?s (STO) web application developers, will also be able to utilize HiSoftware?s user-driven interactive desktop solutions, AccVerify and AccRepair, and AccVerify and AccRepair for Microsoft FrontPage to test and remediate their projects for compliance with Section 508...

 

Section 508, an amendment to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, requires electronic and information technology that is used, developed, and procured by the Federal government to be accessible to people with disabilities. Governor Jeb Bush adopted Section 508 as the standard for state government in all electronic information and the purchasing of information technology.
