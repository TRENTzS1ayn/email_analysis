I volunteer teaching web design to students at the Indiana School for 
the Blind. We would recommend oranges, yellows or light-lime green 
for link and probably white for visited link, even knowing some 
people won't see a difference. Those students who see only black and 
white find boldface and underscoring more helpful for identifying 
links.

Our low vision students practically detest the blue-and-purple cliche 
since those colors are so difficult to see on light backgrounds, and 
desaturating that clumsy combination when inverting to white-on-black 
hasn't helped.

And actually, we don't automatically feel compelled to make a 
distinction between link and visited link, especially if the overall 
design is such that making the distinction feels contrived.
