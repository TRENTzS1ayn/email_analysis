OK, sounds interesting, I'll have to look into it in more detail.

Our CMS is written in C# and I really want to introduce a facility to 
check the accessibility of new content before signoff.

Whilst we can check that the page templates are accessible, we will want 
to be able to report on the added content blocks (obviously bearing in 
mind what they will look like in the templates) and then provide a 'plain 
English' report to the contributor highlighting any problems before the 
pages are made live.

Is this the sort of thing that I can use Site Valet for?

If yes, I see there is a windows dll version - do you have any samples or 
know of any developers that have used it with C#?
