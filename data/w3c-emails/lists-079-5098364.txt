Hi All

I have to agree with David on this one; the traditional colouring and 
underlining of links says to me "this is a link".  For those who can see 
and differentiate colours, I feel this to be an important cue and that 
displaying them otherwise could be highly confusing for some.

The less said about the use of underlining as a means of emphasis in 
(X)HTML text, the better.  (I have even seen heading elements inside 
text anchors before - looks like a link but the only action is "confuse 
user".)

Cheers
