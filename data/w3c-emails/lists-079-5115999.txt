Pretty simple question really. If I use one of those lousy Macromedia
Dreamweaver Menu Behaviors, can JAWS read it? The menu is completely
generated by Javascript, so there is nothing in the markup but a bunch
of JS. I am working on something that I inherited, and it uses one of
these menus, which I personally can't stand.

If it would help for me to post a sample online, I can. I just thought
that it might be a common enough question that someone with JAWS could
answer right away.
