Kynn,

Andrew is correct. Win32 programmers would use the SystemParametersInfo API 
(with the SPI_GETSCREENREADER flag) to determine whether an application has 
set said flag or not. This is a nice generic way to see if any screen 
reader is running. If you want to determine whether a specific screen 
reader is running or not, you would simply need to find out if that app's 
window is available.

For Window-Eyes:

// check to see if Window-Eyes is running
if (FindWindow("GWMExternalControl", "External Control"))
{
         windoweyesLoaded = TRUE;
}
else
{
         windoweyesLoaded = FALSE;
}

Don't quote me on this, but I believe VBScript can be mangled to work these 
features (security restrictions implied).
