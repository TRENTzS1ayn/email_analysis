Kynn,

That's the billion dollar question. You can do this through a signed 
ActiveX control (in the ActiveX language of your choice), or an HTA (again, 
using VBScript and/or perhaps JavaScript) without security restrictions. 
Otherwise the user will most likely receive an error stating that the page 
is attempting to do something that is not secure. Baring that, using the 
functions listed below should allow you to determine whether a screen 
reader is running. Given that information, you should be able to load the 
content of your choice.
