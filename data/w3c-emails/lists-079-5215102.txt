There still are security restrictions.  Use of signed controls relies
on the user having elected to accept them (or rather not elected to 
reject them) and that they believe in the principle that anyone certified
for code signing by any of the certifying companies that Microsoft choose
to include in IE is totally trustworthy.   Note that the certifying companies
only really confirm that they have seen documents that demonstrate that
the person providing the key for signing probably has authority to act
for a particular company; they don't generally positively vet those companies
for trustworthiness.
