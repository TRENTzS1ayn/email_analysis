I have a feeling that the W3C WAI interest group could at the very least 
put significant pressure on them to do so. It might just be enough. What 
do you believe would be next step to get the vendor to open the code? What 
license do you think we should push for? GPL? FreeBSD?

This is the inevitable fate of any proprietary software (though the
dropping of it more often gets disguised as an upgrade - give us more
money or get lost).

Is this worth rescuing?  If so, perhaps we could suggest to the
vendor that they release source code for the community to continue
development.
