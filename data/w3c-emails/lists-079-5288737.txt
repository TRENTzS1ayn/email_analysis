If that information is visible on the wire, either explicitly, or in
terms of an observable change in behaviour, you have a privacy issue,
and will need to write a Privacy Policy document and include it on the
site.  You will also need to encrypt the session.

This assumes that you cannot get explicit permission from the user up 
front, which you presumably cannot, as they would be able to tell you
what you wanted to know at the same time.

The better solution, in this purely Microsoft Internet Explorer on
Windows environment, would be for the installer for the assistive
technology program to install a "safe for scripting" ActiveX control
locally, after getting the necessary consent.  People who followed
one set of recent Microsoft security advice will still get warnings.

The dependence on IE makes none of these solutions particularly
accessible.
