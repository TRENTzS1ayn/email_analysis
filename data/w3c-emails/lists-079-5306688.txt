If anyone is interest the cost of attending is ?240 
(http://www.cie.uce.ac.uk/ukwac/booking.html) and I believe all floors of 
that building are accessible by lift, although i cant quite remember where 
the accessible entrance is. Based in Birmingham.

Eric Meyer (needs no introduction), John Knight (Usability Specialist, 
Birmingham Institute of Art and Design), John Colby (Lecturer, School of 
Computing, UCE), Julie Howell (Campaigns Officer, RNIB), Bruce Lawson
