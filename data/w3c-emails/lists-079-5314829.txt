There is a way to persuade IE running javascript to run an ActiveX control
without checking security settings, however this is obviously a hole and may
have been patched since I played with it (on my own systems only before you
ask :)

For that matter there is arguably a security risk in proposed systems like
CC/PP. In identifying yourself as a screen-reader user you are identifying
yourself as a member of a group who are sometimes actively discriminated
against as well as discriminated against due to mere neglect of their needs.
For example CC/PP would enable a company to prevent blind people from
getting past the first stage of a job application process while giving the
company a plausible claim that they didn't know the applicant was blind.
