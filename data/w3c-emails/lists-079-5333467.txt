This page has a similar type of menu.

http://www.mass.gov/portal/index.jsp

There should be sub-options under "home & health." David Poehlman sent
me the JAWS output yesterday and they weren't there. I could handle
using a Javascript menu like this, but only if it uses DOM to manipulate
a UL with nested lists. At least that way the menu options would be read
by Lynx or JAWS.
