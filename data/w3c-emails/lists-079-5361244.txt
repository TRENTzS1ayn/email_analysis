Quite simply, it is the right way to do development. Although there are
too many sloppy developers in this world that would rather use
Javascript for as many things as possible, rather than server-side
scripting as they should.

There are users without disabilities that use browsers that don't
support Javascript. Try using a Web site with Javascript from a cell
phone.

Because they don't like the clutter.

This is my biggest problem with 1192.22, but I think that Javascript is
more of a usability issue than an accessibility issue.
