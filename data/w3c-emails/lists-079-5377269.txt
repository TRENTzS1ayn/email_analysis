  It would seem that it benefits people that use non-Javascript browsers,
  yes.

  Why do some people like the colour blue when we have so many more modern
  colours like beige, and black ? Lynx is a very, very, VERY nice browser
  in my view. I like it - I use it all the time. It's my preference.

  If you can't afford the ?? needed for Jaws and Windows, then perhaps
  Lynx and Festival is an alternative; if not a perfect one. Or even
  Emacspeak. No Javascript - why should there be ?

  The *reasons* for why a person makes his or her choices can be many - but
  very, very often none of our business. To quote RFC 1958:

   "Be strict when sending and tolerant when receiving."

  A person choose the tool he or she finds most suitable or personally
  preferable. Lynx supports HTML *very well*. That is all that should
  concern us.

  The ways of Section 508 ... I too would be interesting in learning why,
  as it is a natural guideline to have.
