Hi Jesper

> 2) Why do some people want to use a no-JavaScript browser like Lynx?

Just to play Devil's Advocate, why would we want a browser that *does* 
support JavaScript/ECMA Script?  To cite some common uses of client-side 
scripting:

1) Opening pop-up windows (not Accessible - don't use pop-up windows)
2) Image rollovers (not Accessible - generally only used as "eye candy")
3) Form submission (won't work with JS turned off)
4) Form validation (should be done server-side: not secure because it 
can be turned off)
5) Dynamic generation of content (should be done server side with Perl, 
PHP, ASP or whatever; will not work if scripting is turned off)
6) "Back" buttons - see recent discussions on this list regarding this.

Whilst I fully acknowledge that there are specialist applications, 
including some designed for Accessibility, that make good use of 
client-side scripting, I would not deem scripting support to be an 
essential browser feature unless one is proposing to make use of such 
applications.  (JavaScript is also very handy for "quick and dirty" 
touch-screen applications.)

Lastly, do not underestimate Lynx; it is a very, very powerful tool, not 
just something for "no frills" Web browsing.  (I use it, for instance, 
in a script to update the dynamic DNS record for my DSL connection.)  As 
others have pointed out, Lynx can make a very handy talking browser in 
conjunction with other Open Source components.

Cheers

M
