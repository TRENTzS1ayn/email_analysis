What I am about to say only applies if pages are being generated by a 
script or programme:

If I were being asked to do this, I would probably use a REFRESH in the 
header; this would cause the same page to re-load at a set interval, 
checking on each load how much time is left.  When the critical time 
were reached, I would switch on a warning message when the page is re-drawn.

Possible problems: I don't know how this would work with screen readers.

Another alternative is Server Side Push; I mention this out of interest 
only because I believe that it is only supported by the Netscape browser 
family.

Practical suggestion: rather than warning just before a session is about 
to expire, state somewhere that "your session will expire in xxx minutes 
unless you do xyz."

Cheers
