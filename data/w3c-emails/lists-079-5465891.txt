Oh, definitely, yes.  Mac OS X has never been accessible to people who
can't see -- due entirely to the lack of any working screenreaders.

Note, by the way, that Mac OS X pretty much passes Section 508, which
requires a lot from operating systems but does NOT require the
_actual existence of a screenreader on the platform_.

Thus, the federal government really could buy Mac OS X if they wanted,
even if no blind people are able to use it effectively.  This is a flaw
in Section 508 -- it was clearly written from an Windows operating
system perspective, which assumes there will be multiple screenreader
packages available from third parties, or at least ONE available.

508 only requires interoperability with assistive technology, and
Mac OS X does indeed provide an accessibility API.  Nowhere does 508
require that blind people actually be able to use an operating system.
