WCAG 1.0, Checkpoint 6.3 -- Ensure that pages are usable when scripts,
applets, or other programmatic objects are turned off or not supported. If
this is not possible, provide equivalent information on an alternative
accessible page. [Priority 1]

508 ? 1194.22 (l) -- When pages utilize scripting languages to display
content, or to create interface elements, the information provided by the
script shall be identified with functional text that can be read by
assistive technology.

Are you suggesting there are significant differences between the two
standards? In reality, why would a "developer" simply identify, in a
functional manner, an instance of script usage (as required by 508) without
ensuring the information is usable as well?

This is my biggest problem with 1192.22, but I think that Javascript is
more of a usability issue than an accessibility issue.
