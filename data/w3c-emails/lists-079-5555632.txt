Skip navigation can be confusing to sighted users. And I could see not 
wanting to have a link on your page that appears to do nothing for the 
vast majority of your audience.

It should be fairly easy to differientiate between a Skip Nav and a 
spam link. Skip navs are almost always simply links to anchors on the 
page itself, whereas spam would probably be external.
