If the link is worded so as to be clear, it would not be confusing.  If
someone can read and realize they don't need it, that is better than someone
needing it and not knowing it is there.

Skip navigation can be confusing to sighted users. And I could see not
wanting to have a link on your page that appears to do nothing for the
vast majority of your audience.

It should be fairly easy to differientiate between a Skip Nav and a
spam link. Skip navs are almost always simply links to anchors on the
page itself, whereas spam would probably be external.
