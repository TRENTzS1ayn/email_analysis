If it is being used to develop software for in house use (or as an
agent of someone else, with no rights being retained), you don't need
to release the source code.  [L]GPL type licences make source code
availability a condition of distribution, not of use.  (In the agent
case, the commissioner gets to own any IPR added to the source code.)

(You don't actually have to provide source code up front when you
distribute externally, but the penalty is that anyone downstream of
you can then request it at no more than the handling cost, whereas, if
you provide it up front you only need to supply to the people that you
directly supply with the binary.)

The rules on mixing with commercial software with full GPL code only 
apply to distribution, as well.  In house, you can mix with impunity.

IANAL.
