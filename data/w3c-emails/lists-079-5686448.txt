David,

You are merely expressing an opinion, my definition of games, was 
stated as:
"Game is used to mean interactive experience on a single page."

a drop down list falls into this category, are you claiming this is not 
a document?
there is clearly an ill defined continuum, and we need to progress from 
the work on documents.
