>> For Immediate Release
>>
>> Cambridge, MA -- MathSpeak is bringing spoken math to your web 
>> browser,
>now.
>>
>> MathSpeak(tm),  the new HTML creation mechanism in MathEQ 4.0 
>> Expression
>Editor,
>> provides web pages with mathematical and scientific notation to be 
>> parsed by computer screen-to-voice readers for visually-impaired and 
>> blind internet users.
>>
>> MathSpeak relies on currently available and common technology used 
>> today by visually-impaired and blind web users.  A variety of web 
>> development organizations, such as Mozilla, W3, and the MathML 
>> community, have plans to provide an advanced support for special 
>> screen readers for mathematical symbols and expressions using MathML.
>
>> The goal of MathSpeak is to work with current technologies, today, so 
>> that visually-impaired and blind users may glean information from 
>> current webpages for science and mathematics, although less advanced 
>> than these ambitious plans.
>>
>> Theorist Interactive, LLC, of Cambridge,  developers of the LiveMath 
>> and
>MathEQ
>> computer algebra software line, introduced this tool with the release 
>> of MathEQ 4.0 for Windows and Macintosh computers.
>>
>> MathSpeak is a set of special HTML tags that all speech-to-text screen
>
>> readers can access on a webpage, and correctly read the expression as 
>> spoken speech.  Although webpage authors can manually create the such 
>> tags for their math expressions, the task can be
>cumbersome.
>> MathEQ will automatically create the correct MathSpeak tags when used 
>> to create either images or MathML-based math expressions for webpages.
>>
>> Previously, when a visually-impaired or blind internet user surfed to 
>> a webpage with mathematical formulas presented on it, the standard 
>> screen reading tools, of which the most popular is JAWS, could not 
>> interpret the mathematical formulas into to synthesized speech, either
>
>> because the formulas are images on the HTML page, or, if using the new
>
>> MathML markup language, their screen reader is not adapted to 
>> converting MathML into spoken language.
>>
>> Now, if this example webpage is created with the additional MathSpeak 
>> tags, then the screen readers will correctly convert the mathematical 
>> formulas and expressions on the page to
>synthesized speech.
