The fact that skip nav links *are* typically "hidden" seems to cause several
problems: the Google issue; poor usability for sighted keyboard users; and,
probably, lack of widespread implementation because the standard is,
literally, invisible to most users and designers.

Given these drawbacks of the hidden link, would it make more sense to shift
the convention to visible skip nav?
