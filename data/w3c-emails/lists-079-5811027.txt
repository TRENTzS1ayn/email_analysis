I totally agree it is better to display skip-nav links, but I just did add an
invisible skip-nav link to one site for the first time, because I had
consensus to clean up some accessibility and other errors that would not
change the look of the site.  Adding the invisible link may well allow the
site to be more accessible sooner than if I had to go through a possibly
lengthy process of getting everyone to agree to change the look.

And I have also noticed that a lot of U.S. government sites use invisible
links.

I sent an email to Google about all this and they are supposed to get back to
me - maybe others have as well?
