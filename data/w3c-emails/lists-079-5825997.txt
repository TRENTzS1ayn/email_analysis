I'm sure the assumption is that nobody but a blind person would want a "skip
nav/skip to main content" link, and we wouldn't want to clutter the vast
majority of people's displays with something intended for such a minuscule
market.  Sighted folks, of course, all use mice and can just click where
they want to go.  There is no such thing as a sighted person not using a
mouse.

This might sound a bit snide, but I'm sure it's very close to the thinking
behind the approach.

Regards,
Jerry

http://www.firstgov.gov/index.shtml

http://www.pegglegg.com/noname11.htm

Both of these sites have a skip link
the gov site in fact has 5
the next site has 1
the 5 are invisible
the one is in plain site at the top of the nav box.
My question, is why hid the link? other than it can be done?
