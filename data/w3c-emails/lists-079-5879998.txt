This is how I have been laying out pages for some time now.  Truth to 
tell,
now that I've started this, I can't imagine doing it any other way!

However, I usually provide "skip to navigation" links when I'm on the 
ball, or
even a <link rel="bookmark"> (which is the standards-compliant way to 
introduce
entry points, as you allude to later).

Well, this could be a good argument for frames.

I'm serious.  If you have one frame for navigation and another for 
content,
and they're properly labeled and used, it _would_ solve this problem.  
Your
navigation and your content will be separated quite nicely.

There are other factors, of course, but this, perhaps, is one case where
frames can be used to enhance non-visual usability.
