On the contrary, HTML provides distinct <HEAD> and <BODY> elements,
designating the former to contain metadata and the latter the
document to be presented directly by a browser to human readers.

HTML also provides a <LINK> element, which is ideally suited to
navigation.  The problem arises because certain popular browsers
fail to support the LINK element.

It would equally well be solved if the ideas in HTML 2.0 (and later
versions) were adequately supported by browsers.

This presupposes authors taking any notice of the XHTML structure,
which again brings it back to the same situation as with current HTML.

I agree that "skip navigation" is a particularly nasty hack, but it's
not the fault of HTML.
