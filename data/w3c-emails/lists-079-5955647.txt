Those aren't distinct content sections, though.  They're not sub-parts
of content -- they just divide content from metacontent.  This is a good
thing, but this is clearly not all that is sufficient.

Actually it's not well-suited for navigation.  You can't construct, for
example, a hierarchical navigation bar via <link>.  You couldn't 
replicate
the W3C homepage via the <link> element alone, of course.  If I'm
misunderstanding what you're saying, please correct me.

No, it's not well-solved.  Which HTML 2.0 ideas, anyway?  <link>?

No, because current HTML doesn't allow, for example, a distinction 
between
which section of a page are navigation links.  You can't "skip 
navigation"
or "skip to content" automatically because there's no way to designate
these in HTML, structurally.

(<link> is not structural; it's metadata about structure, which is
different.)

Sure it is.  The reason that "skip navigation" is necessary is that HTML
does _not_ adequately describe Web content as it is used on the Web, nor
does it really describe Web content which is not structurally identical
to a physics term paper.

If we don't have the tools in HTML to adequately describe the basic
distinctions between types of Web content -- which is "primary content"
and which is navigation -- then something's wrong with HTML, and needs 
to
be fixed.  The proposals in XHTML 2.0 address this in the same way that
the longdesc attribute in HTML 4.0 solved the problem which had, before
that, been addressed only by the D-link hack.

Which, like visible "skip navigation" links, introduces vague and
ultimately less-than-useful markup atthe expense of the visual design
and the integrity of the content model.

<link> solves some problems, but using it to skip groups of navigation
links just means it's a well-applied band-aid rather than a cure.  It's
metadata attempting to fill a hole in the structural model, when really
the structural model needs semantic enhancement itself.
