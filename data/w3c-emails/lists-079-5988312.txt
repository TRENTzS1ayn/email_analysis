Which of the following categories, taken from the CSS 2 specification,
best matches screenreaders?

Begin quote::

The names chosen for CSS media types reflect target devices for which 
the
relevant properties make sense. In the following list of CSS media 
types,
the parenthetical descriptions are not normative. They only give a sense
of what device the media type is meant to refer to.

all
   Suitable for all devices.
aural
   Intended for speech synthesizers. See the section on aural style
   sheets for details.
braille
   Intended for braille tactile feedback devices.
embossed
   Intended for paged braille printers.
handheld
   Intended for handheld devices (typically small screen, monochrome,
   limited bandwidth).
print
   Intended for paged, opaque material and for documents viewed on screen
   in print preview mode.  Please consult the section on paged media for
    information about formatting issues that are specific to paged media.
projection
   Intended for projected presentations, for example projectors or print
   to transparencies. Please consult the section on paged media for
   information about formatting issues that are specific to paged media.
screen
   Intended primarily for color computer screens.
tty
   Intended for media using a fixed-pitch character grid, such as
   teletypes, terminals, or portable devices with limited display
   capabilities. Authors should not use pixel units with the "tty"
   media type.
tv
   Intended for television-type devices (low  resolution, color,
   limited-scrollability screens, sound available).

If screenreaders are attempting to use rules that target type "screen",
it's no fault of the designer.  By the CSS spec, a designer can
write rules and reasonably expect that speech synthesis devices will
not read them unless they are media type "all" or "aural".

If a screenreader is written to only scrape the visual content, then,
well, what do you expect?
