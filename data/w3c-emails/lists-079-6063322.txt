While I agree with Kynn's point that screen readers are aural devices, 
and people who want to target aural devices differently should be able 
to rely on screen readers understanding the standard, the fact that 
they don't isn't particularly relevant to my argument.

There were two points I was making. The major one was that keyboard 
navigation is important for many people who are not screen reader 
users, and it is therefore helpful if it is visible.

The minor point was that using display:none to hide things except from 
screen readers is a bad move because in practise it hides them from 
common screen readers. It would be nice if one could use CSS to provide 
optimisations for aural browsing, but that seems to be a while away 
still.

In any event, I would still like to be able to see the navigation links 
when I am browsing. Poor keyboard support is one of my big gripes 
against many otherwise nice browsers on MacOS X.

cheers
