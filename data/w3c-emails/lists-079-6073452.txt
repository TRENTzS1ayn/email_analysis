Hmmm. "Skip navigation" links are providing for deficiencies in HTML 
browsers. In particular IE, one of the few browsers not to implement 
link. But also for the many browsers (Opera, Amaya, and Jaws used with 
IE are notable exceptions) which don't allow navigation of the 
structure - getting to a heading in many otherwise horrible sites is an 
effective strategy.

So I do think they are a hack, but I don't think they are a 
particularly bad hack architecturally (for example compared to the alt 
attribute) and they more or less do the job in the 80% simple case. I 
do think it is important to look towards a future and not assume that 
what we have now is as good as it gets.

Interestingly for Kynn's original point, that XHTML 2 is trying to 
explicitly note navigation structures, there is a requirement in the 
draft XML Accessibility Guidelines [1] that languages identify the key 
navigation structures. The approach taken in XHTML 2 is one way of 
doing so (another would be to use xlinks which identify key elements, 
or to provide an XSLT that gave just the key waypoints, and there are 
other possible techiques)
