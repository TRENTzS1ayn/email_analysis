A legal pre-amble is almost certain a case where a skip mechanism is
unacceptable.  The reason that document structures are distorted to 
put legal notices at the beginning is so that the reader cannot argue that
they never saw the notice (although the reality is that it is easy to
skip them in paper books).  There might even be a need for a special
element type for material that users must explicitly waive viewing.
