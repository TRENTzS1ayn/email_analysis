That is not an argument for aural not being the best media type to 
describe them, but one for a new media type.  The real reason that
JAWS etc. don't act as being of aural type is that authors don't 
write style sheets for that type.  The same would apply with a more
refined classification.

My impression is that the CSS authors were thinking of screenreaders when
they created that type.

PS "auditory interactive experience" sounds like its straight out of 
a product brochure.
