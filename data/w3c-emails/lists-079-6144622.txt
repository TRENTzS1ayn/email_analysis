The best use for an aural css is for aural devices for delivery.  Since
there are so many different screen readers and since they controll the
presentation themselves, aural css does not yeild anything for them.

No.  It's a chicken and egg problem.  Screenreaders won't handle aural
style sheets in preference to visual ones until the majority of
authors use them properly, and one reason why they don't do that is
that screenreaders don't handle aural ones.  The main reason, of course,
is that authors don't care about screenreaders.
