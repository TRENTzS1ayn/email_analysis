I disagree fairly completely here.

Screen readers are used by people who have reading problems but 
navigate happily with the mouse. And many browsers support people 
navigating with the keyboard better than screen readers do.

Screen readers are used to give an aural presentation - sometimes 
augmenting the information on the screen with other information it gets 
from the operating system.

This strikes me as being close to a definitive example of an aural 
device, which should allow the user to customise the aural presentation.

just my 2 cents
