I'll conceed that some screen readers are used with a mouse, I do not
understand the keyboard reference though at least on the windows sied, there
are things you can do with a screen reader using the keyboard that you
cannot do without one or some other at.  Take mouse keys for instance, they
are not as good as jaws which allows you to do much more with the mouse
pointer via the keyboard.  The difference between an aural rendering engine
and a screen reader is that the aural rendering engine usually does not have
a navigable interface as such but rather the internface is confined to
controlling the aural presentation.  Any navigation is passed to something
else.

I disagree fairly completely here.

Screen readers are used by people who have reading problems but
navigate happily with the mouse. And many browsers support people
navigating with the keyboard better than screen readers do.

Screen readers are used to give an aural presentation - sometimes
augmenting the information on the screen with other information it gets
from the operating system.

This strikes me as being close to a definitive example of an aural
device, which should allow the user to customise the aural presentation.

just my 2 cents
