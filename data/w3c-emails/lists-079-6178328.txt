I think the value in aural CSS is precisely that it would allow people 
to customise the presentation without having to worry which screen 
reader they were using at the time - in the same way that CSS allows 
authors to get reasonably reliable presentation across a variety of 
browsers.

It is true that browser develpers haven't done a very good job of 
implementing CSS until now (if they were building aeroplanes I would 
travel by boat, but a friend of mine who teaches aero engineering does 
that). But for many straightforward things CSS is now the easiest and 
most transportable way to customise presentation and think that most 
people will get a similar experience.

Cheers
