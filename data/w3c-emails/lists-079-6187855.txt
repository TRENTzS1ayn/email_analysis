in my experience with aural css, it only works with sapi complient speech
synthesizers.  Mine is not sapi complient and in fact, does not even relie
on software except for rudimentary communication.  All the speeking is done
in the box.

I think the value in aural CSS is precisely that it would allow people
to customise the presentation without having to worry which screen
reader they were using at the time - in the same way that CSS allows
authors to get reasonably reliable presentation across a variety of
browsers.

It is true that browser develpers haven't done a very good job of
implementing CSS until now (if they were building aeroplanes I would
travel by boat, but a friend of mine who teaches aero engineering does
that). But for many straightforward things CSS is now the easiest and
most transportable way to customise presentation and think that most
people will get a similar experience.

Cheers
