Sure. But I would suggest that it is a better idea to think of a future 
where styling information can be passed to the synthesiser, than to 
think of one where speech synthesisers don't allow customisation of any 
sort.

There is a separate question of whether CSS is a good styling mechanism 
- for audio browsers I would suggest that it is a good approach, but 
what about Window-eyes, which is expected to work with all the 
different programs a user runs on their machine? (Actually IMHO if it's 
a good enough mechanism for MS Word and my IRC client it probably does 
make sense for screen readers too).
