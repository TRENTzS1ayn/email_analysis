There are lots of problems with forcing audio rendering controll down the
pipe though.  What happens if the instructions are garbled?  There is no
fall back if the synthesizer has been handed a mess other than static.
screen readers use internal controlls to recover and to prevent this in the
first place.  Also, If I use aural css, what happens if am viewing rather
than listening?  Let's say for instance, that aural css is the only
presentation mechanism being used.  I have a braille display, I have a
screen and no speech.  It seems as though the content will be quite jumbled
under those circumstances.  AS you also point out, screen readers are used
for multiple activities such as word, irc interacting with media players and
the like.  Aural user agents are confined to one thing and that is rendering
content which is marked up for aural presentation.  To ask a screen reader
to reduce its self to being remotely controlled is to ask it to devolve, not
evolve.

Sure. But I would suggest that it is a better idea to think of a future
where styling information can be passed to the synthesiser, than to
think of one where speech synthesisers don't allow customisation of any
sort.

There is a separate question of whether CSS is a good styling mechanism
- for audio browsers I would suggest that it is a good approach, but
what about Window-eyes, which is expected to work with all the
different programs a user runs on their machine? (Actually IMHO if it's
a good enough mechanism for MS Word and my IRC client it probably does
make sense for screen readers too).
