Of course you find it unrealistic.

And your point was?  You seem to be saying that <link> isn't useful
now, is that right?

So...maybe we need a hack, such as "skip links", in order to get around
that?

Which...is just what I was saying, but for some reason you refuse to
acknowledge it.

Sure it is important.  You can't claim that browsers are failing to
conform if there's nothing to conform _to_.  Even HTML 4.0 doesn't say
what should be done with the meta-data.

The specification does _not_ say that the browser needs to present the
<link> information at all.  It says "may."  Do you understand the term
"may"?  (This is not a sarcastic question.  This is a real question,
related to "must", "should", and "may".  If you are going to claim a
failure to conform, you need to identify what the browsers are doing 
that
is not in conformance.)

And hopefully we'll leave the days of 4.01 and move to a better 
standard.
Why does that claim seem to bother you so much?

You keep saying "1995" as if the <link> specified something that 
browsers
were required to implement and did not.  Can you please identify which
part of this mythical 1995 document is being violated by commonly used
browsers?  (Where did "THE most common used browser" come from?  This 
isn't
just some misplaced Microsoft hostility, is it?)

So, if all browsers magically allowed you -- overnight, tomorrow, when 
you
wake up -- to skip to navigation whenever you wanted, would you still 
encode
"skip the table of contents" links in your page?

No, you wouldn't -- because they're not an intrinsic part of the 
content;
they're something you added on to a specific presentation.

Nobody is arguing it's _not_ a good accessibility tool.  I'm saying the
functionality should be directly supported in HTML in an explicit, 
structural
manner -- rather than relying on the <a> tag (or even the <link> tag) 
for
something that _should_ be easily and sensibly derived from the 
structure
of the document.

If HTML were designed from scratch, based on what we know now about how
the Web works, the text-formatting parts would be the same -- but the
structure would be (and SHOULD be) vastly improved.

Isn't that what I've been saying?  We need a simple, generic language 
like
HTML which is robust enough to handle the _basic functions of the Web_
without requiring everyone to come up with non-standard solutions for
Every. Page. On. The. Web.

What do I mean by non-standard solutions?  Well, quick, without looking 
at
it, tell me about the name of the skip-link is on http://kynn.com/, and
what it's named, and what the URL is.  Each Web site will have a 
different
variation, both in the text, the name of the link, the URL, what it goes
to, and so on.  This lack of standardization -- the fact that everyone
has to grow their own -- points out that there's a deeper problem than
just simply slapping an <a href="#skip"> band-aid on all pages in
existence.

For that, we need to get to the root of the problem, and that root is
poor structural identification within HTML itself.
