Skip Navigation links allow users to skip past repetitive content that
they don't want read/listen to/feel/etc again.

There is no deficiency in HTML, we have the <h?> series of elements to
mark up the beginning of sections, all the user has to do to skip past
the navigation is to skip to the next heading - but most browsers
don't implement features that make that possible, hence the use of an
element that browsers do implement.

A skip link is not presentational markup, it defines a relationship
between some inline content and another part of the
document. (Admittedly 'Skip to main content' would be more meaningful
as the link text then 'Skip navigation').

One specific media type? I have personally used skip links when
navigation a page on a set of speakers, on a handheld device, on a
projection and on a normal screen. That's FOUR media types!
