Are there any more recent documents on SVG and Accessibility? articles,

Would anyone be able to contribute any resources?
Is anyone interested in updating this document?

Hello Jonathan

John Gardener from Oregon State Uni is conducting research relating to
accesible SVG. He has developed an early prototype of an accessible SVG viewer
which can also output SVG in tactile format using the Tiger Braille embosser(
see http://dots.physics.orst.edu/graphics.html ).

John may also be able to suggest more up-to-date documentation.
