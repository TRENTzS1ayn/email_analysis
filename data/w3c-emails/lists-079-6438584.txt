You don't always do it, though...an example would be radio buttons,
which need to have the same name to effectively be mutually exclusive,
but need a separate ID for the "uniqueness" aspect of it.

e.g.:

<input name="question1" id="question1chicken" type="radio"
value="chicken" /><label for="question1chicken">chicken</label>

<input name="question1" id="question1egg" type="radio"
value="egg" /><label for="question1egg">egg</label>
