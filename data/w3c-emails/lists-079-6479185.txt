  Yes. It is *valid* for the input element. It is, and I'll go out on a
  limb and make a blanket statement, pointless for anything ELSE than a
  graphical button.

  There is very little in the way of an accessibility benefit to seeing
  the example:

    <input type="text"
            name="lastname"
             accesskey="L"
              tabindex="1"
               id="lastname" 
                alt="Last Name">

  rendered as

    Last name

  without any ability to actually *input* a last name. nor any real
  possibility of understanding what was just read, and why. Take note of
  the specification of ALT, which states:

    "Do not specify meaningless alternate text (e.g., "dummy text").
     Not only will this frustrate users, it will slow down user agents
     that must convert text to speech or braille output."

  Now, I'm guessing that you answered my comments - frankly it would be
  much easier if you quoted a little (hot tip) - and I must admit that
  strictly you are correct. There is nothing inherently wrong with the
  above example, save that the ALT text there is utterly meaningless.

  Placing ALTernate text on text inputs for display if, and when, a
  user-agent without  for support shows up means that the same UA will,
  quite happily, fill the user with ALTernate content which, basically,
  only informs her that her browser can't access the content at all.

  However, it means she have to *guess* - say from what is being read -
  that that is what happens. Meaningless and confusing.

  ALT is valid. LABEL is valid - but they are two entirely different
  beasts.

  Certainly. I'll agree with that. My reply was hasty.

  Well, it depends a little on the definition of a 'screen reader', but
  also with the sad fact that even if HTML of all varieties are quite
  limited - this is the benefit of having them - not all browsers
  support them.
