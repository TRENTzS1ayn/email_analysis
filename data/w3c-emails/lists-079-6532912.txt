Yep, because it is an inheritance problem, not one related to units.

The key is to remember what things are going to inherit from what - the 
most typical is lists, but there are other possibilities.

If you set a rule like

li { font-size: 1.2em }

and you have an li inside another li the rule will be applied twice. 
Fortunately, you can set a rule specifically for that case

li li { font-size: 1em }

so that the inside list is that same as it would have been before (but 
already inherits the first magnification).
