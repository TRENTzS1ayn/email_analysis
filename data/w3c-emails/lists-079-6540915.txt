The issue was mentioned in the discussion though, if I recall 
correctly. There are those who believe that the problem isn't really 
that severe, given the nature of accesskeys (although it would be nice 
if the browsers figured out how to implement a solution - only a few 
have come reasonably close, including Opera and a screen reader other 
than JAWS, which provide a pass-through key).

Interestingly there has been a very active discussion on the topic over 
the last few days in the italian list humana (for those who read 
italian, anyway - otherwise it will just be a ot of incomprehensible 
rambling :)

cheers
