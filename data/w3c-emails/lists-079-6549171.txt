The title attribute is good for people who have screen readers set up 
to work with it, but that is only a tiny proportion even of people with 
disabilities using the web.

The label element is designed to allow visible labels to be provided, 
as the author sees fit, and still have a way for people using assistive 
technologies to get all the information and navigation control they 
need to fill out a form.

(until Xforms comes along, when things will eventually get nicer again. 
At the moment though it seems that xforms-capable systes are only at 
the start of figuring out how to implement the accessibility stuff that 
the spec includes).

cheers
