To me, it seems obvious that it is optional because DTDs cannot
distinguish between the cases where it is and is not optional;  to me,
it is clearly intended only for use with images, and exists because an
input field can be an image map.  Especially with XML, because it is
not as powerful as SGML, there are a number of cases where the formal
syntax allows constructs that the narrative forbids.

For forms, I would assume that the intention is that the whole form 
should be suppressed, e.g. for a non-interactive aural browser.
