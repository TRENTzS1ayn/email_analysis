I find that the best way to avoid inheritance problems is to
keep your documents very simply (and logically) structured
and marked up.
I've only had major problems with it when trying to quickly
replace all font tags with CSS rules on old-style, deep, dark
triple nested table layouts...

But yes, your mileage may vary...
