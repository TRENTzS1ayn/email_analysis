You can still get into inheritance issues, in exactly the same way as
when you specify everything in ems or percentages. It's a valid method,
and I often use something similar, but there really is no advantage over
going all ems in terms of inheritance issues.

Inheritance issues - in my experience - arise mainly due to
(unnecessarily) complex nested markup and styling (and also, what I have
often seen, "overloading" - not sure if that could be the correct term -
stylesheets, e.g. html,body,p,td,strong,em { font-size: 0.95em; }, where
you would obviously end up with quite obvious problems, such as a strong
elements in a paragraph, which happens to be inside a table, ending up
with 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 = ~0.8145em  ) 

Your example could be styled like this:

body{ font-size: 0.95em; }
h1{ font-size: 1.3em; }
h2{ font-size: 1.2em; }

and achieve exactly the same as with percentages.
