I can't speak for the W3C, but personally I think that, although
it is not yet (wishful thinking ?) supported by browsers, it is still
structurally preferable to have the longdesc attribute, rather than only
relying on the d-link. It makes it possible to have DOM scripting and
fancy CSS, and it's directly associated with the image/object/etc
itself, rather than only being associated by virtue of being a link
positioned directly after an image/object/etc.

Wouldn't it be nice if someone coded a little extension for
Netscape/Mozilla/Firebird to sanely handle longdesc ? Again, wishful
thinking perhaps...
