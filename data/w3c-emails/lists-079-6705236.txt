I make a little test of source code :

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN">
<html lang="fr">
<head>
<title>Test attribut longdesc</title>
</head>
<body>
<img src="tut.jpg" londesc="tutu.htm" alt="test londesc"> 
</body>

</html>

i look a the page on IE, Opera, Netscape and phoenix and i don't find how to go to the tutu.htm page.
