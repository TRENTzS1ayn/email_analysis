Jesper

I don't have that book; could you elaborate on your/it's argument? I don't accept that a term's length of usage or perceived professionalism is reason for using it. Pixel is a professional term in web typography but we don't want that used for font sizes do we? 

Again I would say that since em and % produce the same result in terms of accessibility then there is no reason to use one over the other. Unless you have another (better) argument.

Please don't think that I'm being pedantic; it's just that your argument doesn't make sense and since you stated categorically that using em is 'best practice' I feel you should qualify it.

regards
Julian
