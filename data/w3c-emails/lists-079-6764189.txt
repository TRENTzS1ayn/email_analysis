iCab also presents it.

And intermediate proxy systems, such as mod_accessibility, can use it 
to represent a page for a browser like lynx with a description 
available of each image.

And it can be reasonably reliably searched, allowing people who want to 
illustrate content but cannot see to create pages on their own. Tools 
such as a-prompt make use of this facility to support accessible 
authoring.
