Tina, it's not so much a specification but rather a "recommendation" (now
somewhat dated) which emerged from the (primarily) blind user community in
the States.  My first encounter with it was via the WGBH
(http://ncam.wgbh.org/); early on Bobby also "spoke" of it, and continues to
do so (http://bobby.watchfire.com/bobby/html/en/glossary.jsp).

Netscape 7.x (PC) does this.  Place mouse cursor over image (see example
above) and rightclick >> choose properties.  The hyperlink to the
longdesc.html file is active and "clickable"
