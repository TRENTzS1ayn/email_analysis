Yes, exactly...the original email by yoan did ask if we should drop
the use of the longdesc attribute because of inconsistent/missing browser
support for it.

(rereading the way I worded it - "I think you may have slightly
 misunderstood" etc - I realise it may have come across as rather
rude...apologies, it wasn't meant to be)

For what it's worth, that was the basic gist of my first reply to yoan.

I think we're all pretty much in agreement then that the concept of
longdesc is well worth keeping - of course - but that browser support
for easy ways of "using/accessing" the longdesc url could be better...
