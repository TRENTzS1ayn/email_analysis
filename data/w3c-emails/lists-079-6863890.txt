  If you are referring to my comment "1,800 distinct user agents", then
  that is based on the last run of statistics off some rather large
  weblogs.

  The number is of course an approximation, and I would suggest taking
  25% off it covering for such "agents" as

    "Um, ...no." (5 entries)

  and

    "contype" (10 entries)
