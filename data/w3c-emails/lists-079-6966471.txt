This shows the problem with small, medium, etc - "very large" is a 
really unreliable number. At the moment I am working mostly on 20pt 
fonts (having lost my glasses), and they seem small and hard to read 
(but I struggle away because I like having a scannable screen - 
comfortable would be about 30pt.

My experience has been that em and percentage do this a bit better - 
the other thing is that at larger base sizes I want to reduce the size 
difference - the gap between 36 and 42 pt is much easier to see than 
the gap between 10 and 12 pt, although it is a smaller percentage 
difference. When I get a CSS-3 capable browser I will be a happy camper.

cheers
