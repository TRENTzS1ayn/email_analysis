Sorry folks, didn't see this post when I replied to John's (that'll teach me to scan for subject lines; or to get a mail client that can handle threads ;-) ).
I can't remember any times when specifying font sizes in % has created any presentational problems but if there are potential css parsing bugs it probably _is_ safer practice to specify units in ems wherever possible.

One final thought, since font size is inherited, specifying it in the rules for body should get round any potential problems shouldn't it? Has anyone come across css bugs where a UA suddenly decides that a font with a % size should be set relative to something other than it's parent container?
