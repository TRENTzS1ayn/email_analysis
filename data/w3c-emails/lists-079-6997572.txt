Julian,

the main problem are older browsers (NN4.x for instance) which
do some funky stuff with the CSS' inheritance. In particular
their handling of tables caused much grief for early CSS adopters,
and that's where the practice of "overloading" the CSS started.
This now obviously causes inheritance problems, as the font
sizes in browsers which do honour inheritance is compounded.

e.g.
html, body, table, td, caption { font-size: 0.95em; }

Have a read through
http://devedge.netscape.com/viewsource/2002/table-inherit/
for instance.
