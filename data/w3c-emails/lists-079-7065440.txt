Sorry, sorry I sent this in html first. please bin it.

I should have added that this is a useful measure for determining font size
when you have a font that is either inordinately large or small in the
x-height ? a small x-height font can look a bit tiny at the same size as
a perfectly legible average x-height.  This doesn?t apply much, however, to
the more usual webby fonts, which tend to have quite big x-heights.
