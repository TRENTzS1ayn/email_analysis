WCAG says  that the names have to be clear enough to make it obvious 
what is happening. "nav" is not obvious, but "site navigation" or is 
more so. The name attribute can not include spaces, so in many cases 
you will want to use a title attribute (you are writing for people to 
read, where french may not be their first language - avoid being 
cryptic - which is a P1 checkpoint). But I can't see anything in WCAG 
that makes it compulsory to use the title attribute. 
name="advertisement" is one example of something that probably doesn't 
need a title to expand further. (Make sure the ads are accessible 
though - everyone wants to be able to ignore them, but also when they 
try to find out what is being advertised they like to be able to.

It is also helpful to provide noframes content that makes the site 
workable anyway. There are examples of this "in the wild" (i.e. on 
Websites that don't make any particular claim to be accessible) but 
they are rarer than they should be.

Charles
