Which wouldn't do a lot of good when someone replied off list, keeping
the subject prefix. There are plenty of things in messages to w3c
mailing lists that are unique to each list, filter on those instead. I
use the List-Id header.

(The actual rule looking like this:)

:0
* ^List-Id.*w3c-wai-ig.w3.org
$HOME/mail/lists-w3c

Try "Reply to all"

This isn't really on-topic for this list, but I can't find a more
appropriate place after browsing the lists section of w3.org. Is there
a place for discussions of mailing list policy?
