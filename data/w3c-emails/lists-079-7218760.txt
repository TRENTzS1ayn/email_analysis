Hi all

I've had a nosey in the archives but can't find a definitive answer. I know that JAWS and HAL can read in a number of languages but they seem to be Euro-centric. Does anyone know if there is support for Asian languages. I want to put some pages up in the community languages of our city (Somali, Urdu, Arabic, Chinese and Bengali) and want to put them up as text but I'm wondering whether a screen reader will be able to read the text out in a language that the user can understand. 

thanks

Julian
