After lots of experimentation, I finally discovered how to create a filter for the numerous (but mostly imformative and thought provoking) messages from this list.

As the principle of these instructions can work for most email clients, I hope this can put an end to this OT thread.

The instructions were tested on Microsft Outlook 98.

I promise you, the filter works if you follow these instructions exactly. However I offer no guarantee and will not enter into private correspondance on  this.   

Good luck!
