True enough. And you're navigating by name there, not title. That
reinforces my point: It is nearly impossible to find a browser that can't
handle frames. And it is the content of the frame, not its name or title,
that people read. I suppose that is really an argument for ignoring
noframes content, which essentially no one can use.
