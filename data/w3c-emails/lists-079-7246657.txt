Hi Julian,

Currently, IBM HPR supports the following languages: American English,
British English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Brazilian Portuguese,
Finnish.

JAWs screen reading software supports: American English, British English,
Castilian Spanish, Latin American Spanish, French, French Canadian, German,
Italian, Brazilian Portuguese, and Finnish.

Not sure if there are plans for introducing other language modules to these
apps, nor if there are other applications which extend screen reading to
other languages (I would think off hand that there would be Russian and
Chinese applications at a minimum...)

HTH

JF
