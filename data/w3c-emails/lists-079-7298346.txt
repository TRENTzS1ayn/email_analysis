Actually, without something in the subject line, Outlook seems to have a
terrible time sorting this list into its correct mailer. 

Also, most spam rules run on the subject line, not on the body of the email
(for those who are using yahoo or other such accounts).

Best regards,

Denise

I disagree.  We have computers to automate administrivia like sorting
incoming email into folders.  Lists that work the way you describe
waste a large chunk of what could otherwise be a meaningful subject line
as presented by a mailer.
