I created a rule in Outlook that moves all emails sent to "w3c-wai-ig list"
(where I selected 'w3c-wai-ig list' from my outlook address book) out of my
inbox into a specified folder.  So far (about 4 weeks) it has worked
perfectly.  The rule would not work for emails sent outside of the list.
And, I don't know how well something like that would work for other
browsers.  But it seems to be reliable for Outlook.

I disagree.  We have computers to automate administrivia like sorting
incoming email into folders.  Lists that work the way you describe waste a
large chunk of what could otherwise be a meaningful subject line as
presented by a mailer.
