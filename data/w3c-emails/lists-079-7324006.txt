I believe there are Japanese versions of Jaws & Home Page Reader available 
in Japan. It's difficult to get information in the US (in English) about 
local versions of screen readers.

HAL supports nine languages (the usual European suspects).

The Dolphin speech synthesizers support(ed) 40 languages under DOS. Not 
sure what the current status is.

Keep in mind the difference between a screen reader that can read text in 
another language (but with menus, prompts, etc. in its native language), 
vs. a screen reader written for a particular language.
