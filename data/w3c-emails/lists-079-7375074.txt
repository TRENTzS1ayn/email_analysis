Again not terribly helpful for the original question, but a Google tangent 
led me to these pages:

Compu-Arabica listserv:
http://www.accesstechnologyinstitute.com/lists/topica/compuarabica.html

(Discussing computer access for blind Arabic speakers. I'm not sure of the 
date on this one or if it is still accurate. According to a message on one 
of the Jaws listservs the  Arabic screen reader Sakhr is priced at $3000.)

UB Access - Hebrew and Arabic Accessibility
http://www.ubaccess.com/hebrew-access.html
(Info mainly on Hebrew accessible web markup, but explains difficulties 
screen readers will have with any language where vowels are inferred from 
context.)
