Newer list software -- e.g. Majordomo 2.0 -- allows the user to set
the subject line to contain the prefix or not contain the prefix
as per her preferences.

Some mail agents allow the subject line to be edited based on filter
rules.

I think it's tangentially on-topic, as this illustrates a case where
a preference may or may not be configurable, and may or may not be
an accessibility problem.

(For example:  Let's consider someone with a learning disability
trying to use a mailing list.  Many people WITHOUT cognitive
impairments have problems setting up mail filters -- so an
indication in the subject line may be considered an accessibility
solution for some.  However, it is redundant and annoying for
others, and may present usability problems for them.  The best
solution is the one taken by Majordomo 2, which allows each user
to configure to taste.  This type of solution currently is not
widely deployed on Web sites.)
