   The wording is "title", and the background information on the
   checkpoint in question says: "For instance use the TITLE attribute".
   Rather clear-cut I'd say.

   As for the tooltip ... remember, what a user-agent, graphical or
   melodious, does to a certain piece of information in order to present
   it to the user, is not something that should in any way be used to
   argue *for* or *against* using that structure.

   The NAME attribute has one use. TITLE has another. The WCAG mentions
   TITLE since that is what it is *for* - "advisory information".

   Not by the WCAG - and unless and until someone comes up with another
   standard for accessibility, for better or for worse we are stuck with
   the WCAG. It has gotten itself into several goverment bodies - and as
   such it would be a really None Too Good Idea to go

     "Oh, we support the WCAG. But not 12.1, because we don't want users
      of graphical browsers to see tooltips ... "

   as that would, and quite correctly, return you a

     "Non-compliant. Go back and do it right"

   whether or not it is *functional* or not. The NAME attribute is not
   required by WCAG. TITLE is - well, titling is required, using TITLE
   to do it is suggested.

  I have never seen such a case since 1993. Care to help out with an
  example ?

  Use both, and regardless of family connections you'll be doing it
  right.

  Of course. Frames are still not a good choice for presenting
  information even if user-agents such as Lynx is hacking around the
  problem - just 'cause the Lynx developers are bloody nice and willing
  to put effort into their product doesn't mean that frames *work*.

  As for browsers (aka user-agents) not understanding frames: Google ?
