Filtering on To:, From:, and CC: is _not_ sufficient.  (For example,
someone could BBC the list.)

Filtering should be done on a header that is more likely to be uniquely
set by the list.  For this list, those include any of the following
headers:

Sender: w3c-wai-ig-request@w3.org
X-Mailing-List: <w3c-wai-ig@w3.org> archive/latest/17423
X-Loop: w3c-wai-ig@w3.org
List-Id: <w3c-wai-ig.w3.org>
List-Unsubscribe: <mailto:w3c-wai-ig-request@w3.org?subject=unsubscribe>
X-Archived-At:  
http://www.w3.org/mid/FFD34CC6-A5CF-11D7-BFA6- 
000393CC268A@redchocolate.ca

Of these, "Sender" is the most preferred and standard one to use, but
you can really use any you like.
