If your version of PINE shows you something that it claims is
the Sender: header but is actually the From: header, then something's
wrong with your email program.  *shrug*

You could, if you want, get yourself a better email program -- such as
using procmail as a filter on incoming email.

None of that changes the fact that From:, To:, and CC: are very poor
choices for mailing list filtering.  Mailing lists should be filtered
on the Sender: mail header line (or, if that's not set, on another
unique header).
