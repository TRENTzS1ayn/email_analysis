Subject: Re: what languages can screen readers read in?



Melingo in Israel has developed a text to speech program called Kolan
http://www.melingo.com/kolan_ab.htm  because of the specific problems of
ambiguity (the omission vowels) and the rich morphology in semantic
languages this tool is excellent, claiming 97% correct vocalization.  Right
now it's only in Hebrew but they intend to duplicate this program to Arabic
as well.
