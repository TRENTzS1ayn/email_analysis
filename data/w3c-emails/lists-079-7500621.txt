I have asked you directly a number of times to correct your address.  Please
do so as many of us try and filter our mail.  This is not the address you
should be posting too; it should be this one w3c-wai-ig@w3.org

Subject: New Assistive Tech Book A Must Own



Hello,

        As you know Assistive Technology is playing a major role in ehancing
independent opportunities for people with disabilities worldwide. AT
products are becoming more universal and people want to know more about
them.   Too often, it is difficult to find products needed.

       Assistive Technology News and the CTC Foundation are preparing to
publish the most comprehensive book on AT products ever published. The
attached news release discusses the contents. Advance orders can be secured.
Please read the e-mail on the contents and respond.

         This is a book you will want to have.


           Thanks,

           John M. Williams
