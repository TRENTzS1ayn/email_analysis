Hi Tina,

Firstly, I realise Ian can stick up for himself, but I believe his comments
were along the same theme as mine. That the RNIB could have achieved much
more, and should have considering their market is not only blind users.

Now I will address in a civil manner accusations levelled at Made For All's
comments. XHTML does contain much inherent accessibility.  The very first
thing standards based development addresses is the issue of making our
documents available to the largest number of web users regardless of the
client software they use. Accessibility may I remind you is far from just an
issue of physical disability.

I would be willing to wager that on the vast majority of occasions where a
developer chose not to worry about accessibility but conform only to XHTML,
her document would be far more accessible that someone who took neither into
consideration. Good standards based development takes into account good
structure, which is as important as alt attributes and table summaries, or any
other accessibility feature you may wish to build into your web content. XHTML
also makes alternatives obligatory for objects, frames, scripts, applets, etc.

XHTML does contain inherent benefits to accessibility.

As for the style sheet that doesn't exist on Made For All, we will look into
this. Naturally, I have heard of not one case where this has realistically
affected the user experience or the accessibility of the site.

Regards,

Tim Roberts.
Editor: Made For All.
