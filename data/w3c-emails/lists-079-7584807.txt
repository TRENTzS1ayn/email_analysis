  So they could.

  I am glad you choose to address these items - not accusations - in a
  civil manner. That benefits us all.

  Very well. Let me then set up a hypothetical situation. An author
  writes a document. He does not take into account any accessibility
  issues in particular, but he _does_ follow the grammar and spec of

    (a) HTML 4.01 Strict
    (b) XHTML 1.1

  Our author now publishes both documents on the WWW. In both cases he
  conforms to good standards-based development guidelines, and the
  specifications in question.

  Would you still say that alternative (b) is, in terms of accessibilty,
  better than alternative (a) for the vast majority (and minority) of
  users ?



> XHTML does contain inherent benefits to accessibility.

  I'm sorry, but I have yet to see the proof for this. I know that XHTML
  contains *difficulties* with accessibility when done utterly right,
  i's dotted and t's crossed, but I have not seen a proof that it has an
  inherent *benefit*.
