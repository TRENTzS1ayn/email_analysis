Which exemplifies why I think it is a hack, and in the long run not 
much good. I filter all my WAI mail 3 ways (not into boxes, just so 
they are marked in my client), mostly based on the mailing list. Some 
people want all their WAI mail together. Some want to filter it out if 
it comes from me and is sent to WAI. etc...

hacking the subject line isn't a  nice solution to this, filtering on 
the headers is. They are not fundamentally incompatible of course, just 
one works better and one works even in broken clients.
