Yes, by design.

The most common problem with designers' use of <h1> to <h6> is their 
reliance on the visual presentation (that is, the built-in style) of 
the elements, rather than using the elements structurally and altering 
their style. In fact, on my personal site, my <h1> is actually smaller 
than the <h2>s. It's more important to have that structure than to deal 
with the header elements as presentational.

No, it wouldn't. Nobody said you can't have more than one <h1> in a 
document. (Unlike XML, where you can only have one root element.)

People should think of their header elements like outlines, since that 
was really what they were designed to do.

XHTML 2 is introducing a <section> element, so that headers within a 
given section would "know" which level they are.
