Hi all,

My name is Farez Rahman and I manage projects for a web accessibility 
consultancy in central London, UK, called Checkpoint 
(www.checkpoint-access.co.uk).

I would like to invite members of this list to join our User Panel, which 
is a diverse group of people with a range of disabilities and who use 
assitive technology for web browsing, eg. screen readers. From time to time 
we consult our User Panel when auditing our clients' websites for 
accessibility. Of course, panel members that we consult are remunerated for 
their time and effort.

If you're interested in this, all you need to do is reply indicating this 
and I will keep a record of your name and email address. We will get in 
touch with you along with the web page(s) we'd like you to look at and a 
questionnaire to fill in, as an when new projects arise. We then arrange 
exchange of your reply with our payment to you for that work. There are no 
obligations.

Hope to hear from you soon.

Regards,
Farez
