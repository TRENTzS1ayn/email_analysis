As long as the different header levels are used reasonably
self-consistently (i.e. all things which are meant to be most
important share the same heading number, be it <h2> or <h1>;
in other words, a RELATIVE scheme is used and used consistently
within the document), what accessibility barriers are
introduced by the practice of skipping <h1> or jumping
from <h2> to <h4>?

It's my contention that as long as the _relationship_ between
the headers is reasonable, the exact _numbers_ employed need
not matter -- you will still be able to construct an appropriate
hierarchical structure of the site even if the document
only uses the even-numbered elements (<h2>, <h4>, <h6>).

This is actually support for my position -- it shows that the
exact numbers used are unimportant, and that what matters is
the relative hierarchy established by the heading tags.  If the
exact numbers mattered -- if <h1> _had_ to be the first tag,
for accessibility's sake -- then the XHTML 2.0 proposal of
<h> tags would be an affront to accessibility.  However, the
truth is that it's a boon to accessibility (as well as
portability).

Ergo, the exact numbers do _not_ matter.  And an insistence
on <h1> as the first header (instead of <h2>) is inappropriate.
