Kynn, your reasoning is not totally flawed, but why then not start with
<h7>?  Since we can style away the look of our <h> tags to suit the
particular design considerations of our sites, the "look" is less important
today... very often the reasoning for starting with an <h2> was that the
"<h1> was too big".

The logic would suggest that we start with 1 and progress from there.  While
intellectually (and technically per the specs) there is no real reason to
*not* number our headings H2, H4, H6, does it really make sense?  And while,
as you stated, as long as all headers within a site are relative to each
other, and their cousin pages, there really is no harm caused, what happens
when the user moves on to another document/site?  A consistency between
unrelated sites seems to me to be a laudable goal as well, and everybody
starting with <h1> seems to be a pretty simple starting point, no?

furthering the debate...
