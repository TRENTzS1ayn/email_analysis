Such as what, though?

XHTML also has the drawback that, if there is a single error, it will
not display in any XHTML browser or XML parser.

Note:  If you have an XHTML document with an error -- say you forgot
to close a tag -- and your browser displays it anyway, your browser
is in VIOLATION of the XML standard.

Any standards-compliant XHTML browser will reject invalid XML, if
you declare your document as XHTML.  HTML is more forgiving and thus
more appropriate for general Web use.  Why would you want to use
XHTML in such a situation?

PS:  Converting from valid HTML to valid XHTML (and thus being
      usable by any XML parser) is trivial.  C.f. HTMLTidy.
