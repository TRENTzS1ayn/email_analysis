Indeed, why not?  There is no logical reason for not doing so, save that
there is no such tag. :)

Which is still a concern for Web developers who are following the W3C's
own guidelines about making pages usable without style sheets.

It could very well make sense, for the reason that in Applesoft BASIC we
used to number lines 10, 20, 30, etc.

It makes it easier to insert a line between the others.

In the same way, someone might want to insert a heading between other
headings.  There are good reasons for allowing this flexibility as
a design consideration, especially if it does not cause any harm to
accessibility.

Actually, that's not helpful at all.  A simple example will illustrate
why the HTML 2.0 <h> tag is superior to relying on <h1> being the
"topmost" heading and everything proceeds down from there.

Let's say that I'm posting something on a Web site where the headings
go <h1> for the page, <h2> for the section, and <h3> for articles in
that section.  I type up an article which is divided into three parts
and naturally I use <h4> for those parts.

Now I want to republish that same article on another site.  That other
site also starts with <h1>, then <h2> for article titles.  I paste
my text in -- but now because it's an <h4>, you'd claim it's out of
order.

With <h> this is solved (as the index numbers are automatically
generated).

The problem here is that you can't enforce a hierarchy across
divergent sites.  If you decide "<h1> is the page title" -- well, you
run into problems because you _can_ have multiple <h1> pages.

An article's title may be an <h1> on one page, an <h2> on another,
and an <h4> on a third.

What's my point?  Any attempts to claim that a strict <h1>-and-down-
from-there hierarchy is going to be consistent across sites is
simply provably wrong.

For each site, we rely upon the Web developer to make the decisions
as to how headings will be used -- for example, she chooses which
heading corresponds to an article title, and that may very well
vary from page to page on the site even.

Thus, we should also allow her the flexibility to decide at what
level she places (and starts) items within that hierarchy.  The
assumption that <h1> _has_ to come first is much, much less
important than the very valid requirement that structure
exists and the structure is navigable.

The requirement must be "a navigable structure"; whether it begins
at <h1> or not is really beside the point as long as the relative
hierarchy of headings is properly maintained.
