Should we not encourage developers to write well-formed code.

It is similar to saying it is ok to produce written material if some of 
the print is smudged or a page is upside down. Is it really fair on the 
people we are producing content for.

In accessibility we are working towards getting things as "good as we 
can for the greatest number of users". And in reality, who has an XHTML 
browser that will not display an XHTML page correctly. The reason that 
badly formed XHTML still displays fine in browsers is for the allowances 
originally made for bad HTML coding. If we think that poor mark up is 
fine then lets open the floodgates to a horde of Front Page sites and 
build sites that don't hold up across browsers. That is not accessibility.
