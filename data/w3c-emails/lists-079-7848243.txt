Yes, but I argue that the relative relationship is more important
than the absolute relationship.

Good point!  Another argument for <h>.

Well, let's take for example your site, which you brought up as an
example (since you style the headings using CSS).

Take a look at:

http://www.bestkungfu.com/archive/?id=156

The best searchable content on this page is, I'd argue, _not_ the
<h1>, but the one you have marked as <h2> -- the individual
title for this archived blog entry.

<h1>bestkungfu weblog</h1>
<h2>Libraries, mandates, and guys in robes</h2>

On the main page ( http://www.bestkungfu.com/ ), the <h1> _is_ the
most important, but in this case, no, it should be indexing the
specific content of the article as more important than the generic
name of the site.

So there's a conundrum here.  How exactly do you structure the
headings for this page if you require that the most important
content be in the <h1>?

Answer:  You can't, and you don't, because the requirement is a
red herring.  We have to be careful about such requirements, as
in truth what we need is a perceivable, navigable hierarchy.  This
page establishes that, and thus there's nothing wrong with it.

Let's not add on extra requirements for well-made pages!
