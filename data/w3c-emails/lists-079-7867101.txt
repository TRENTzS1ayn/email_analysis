HTML makes the same demands.  If you are comparing XHTML Strict to HTML
Transitional, then you're making a bad comparison.  If you're comparing
XHTML Strict to HTML Strict, you find that the statement above applies
to both languages.

HTML 4.01 requires this.

XHTML is not necessarily backwards compatible, and there's little to
indicate that HTML support will be going away -- ever.  The argument
that newer technologies are necessarily better is not logically sound.

Yes, but that doesn't mean anything in the real world. That's marketing
spin, not a technical requirement.

The statement "XHTML has more inherent features that steer developers
toward accessible development" is puzzling.  What exactly are you
talking about?  There is no difference between HTML 4.01 and
XHTML 1.0, save for the specific requirements of XML.  And there are
no inherent accessibility features in XML.

What's more, HTML 4.01 -- by being more forgiving than XHTML 1.0's
XML rules -- may in fact be more accessible to people with various
disabilities to _author_ because of that reason.  XHTML 1.0 is
slightly harder than HTML 4.01, so it raises the bar a little bit
higher.  Whenever you raise a bar, you have a chance of excluding
someone.

In this case, the exclusion is probably minimal, but the very fact
that such could exist is a good counter to the notion that XHTML is
automatically more accessible than HTML.
