Today, there's not much direct accessibility benefit, since most modern 
ATs are designed to work with HTML 4. (Personally, I think that HTML 
4.01, its ancestors and error-ridden code are going to be with us for 5 
years or more, but that's no reason to prolong it.)

However, the benefits of XHTML continue to accrue over time. XHTML 
allows transformation using XSLT, which makes repurposing content more 
convenient. It can be built with profiles, such as XHTML+SMIL, or 
XHTML+MathML+SVG, which presents the opportunities for richer, more 
customizable interfaces than HTML alone. It'll be easier to embed 
metadata (including accessibility claims) into XHTML than using a 
zillion <meta> tags, as we do in HTML.

So? Same's true of HTML 4.01 Strict: Amaya refuses to render invalid 
Strict content. But the other browser makers (rightly) assume that it's 
better to accommodate the user by working around errors in authored 
content than to punish them.
