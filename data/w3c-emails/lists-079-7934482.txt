Good question!
In the archive section of my site, I would (hmm. I guess that's "will", 
now) make the title of the entry into the <h1>, since it is the only 
meaningful header in the document, and change the title of the site 
into a <div>, since it's not as relevant in the rest of the site as it 
is on the home page. (I would additionally change my <title> to include 
the name of the site and the content of the heading).

(To tie the threads together a bit: how can I do this all after the 
fact? XHTML and XSLT! It sure beats manually editing 150-plus pages...)
