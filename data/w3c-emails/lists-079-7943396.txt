It is my opinion that XHTML makes more of a fuss about the same demands. 
You relabel standards as "spin" further down. All this marketing may 
just encourage developers to pay more attention to their coding and thus 
do a better job. Also, you refer to raising the bar with XHTML. To be 
accessible requires more initial effort than to write valid XHTML (right 
Doctype, lowercase elements and all tags closed). Agreed?

Only time will show whether you are a mark-up luddite or I have my head 
in the clouds. I do believe that XHTML will become a choice of the 
majority of serious content developers, not only for the increased 
benefits to site users, but also the simplification of development

So are CSS, HTML and WAI just products of spin? There cannot be one rule 
for one standard and another for the rest. Standards are standards.

I explained that XHTML does make more of a fuss about being correct. I 
am quite sure that were it not for the"spin" or "marketing" techniques 
of the W3's XHTML group, many people would still be unaware of the 
plethora or development standards available including the WAI.

Once again, how forgiving should we be as developers. We should offer 
constructive criticism to fellow developers when we can recognise the 
effort that has been made to build a well structured site and minor 
errors are found. But do we stop at saying sure, you could have met all 
the WAI guidlines, but proirity 1 is good enough.

Agreed, exclusion is minimal. Agreed, XHTML is not automatically more 
accessible. I just believe it has some inherent qualities (most likely 
from the "spin") that
encourage developers to be accessible.
