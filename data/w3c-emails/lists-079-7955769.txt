How are those arguments for XHTML?  What are the advantages of XHTML
over HTML in these cases?

XHTML is no more "semantic XML" than HTML is "semantic SGML."  We're
not talking about the difference between <font> tags and <h1>.  We're
talking about the difference between the same page and the same tags,
but one of them is written like this:

      <br>

And one is written like this:

      <br/>

What argument can you provide that the latter is more accessible?
Cars downloading their own OS updates?  Huh?  Are the new car-based
browsers going to refuse to display HTML pages?

Except I'm not hung up on that at all, so you need a new explanation.

A better explanation is "people are hung up on XML, because it's 'new'
and thus buzzwordy, and they haven't stopped to consider whether or not
XHTML is -really- more accessible than HTML."

Yes, yes, your flying magical car.  Let's talk reality:  Your nifty
car will continue to understand HTML for years and years.  Arguing that
something which doesn't exist yet is a reason seems to be a poor reason
for doing something.

Back to the main question:  Please tell me what accessibility benefit
you gain from writing a page as valid XHTML 1.0 instead of valid HTML
4.01. (The answer is:  There isn't one.)

Sure, you can pull up other advantages -- "I can use my XML development
tools on it" -- and that's all well and nice.  But by itself, XHTML is
not automatically more accessible than HTML, and anyone who claims
otherwise is simply incorrect.

Because it doesn't do anything to the Web developer, just to the Web
user. It puts the problem on the wrong person.

No, this is historical revisionism.

Besides, we are talking about non-lazy, valid HTML 4.01.  We're not
talking about spaghetti code in either XHTML or HTML.
