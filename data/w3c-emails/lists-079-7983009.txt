Except you've just eliminated one level of the information hierarchy
entirely.  That's not a good thing.

As it existed, there is a valid and proper hierarchy of information
within your page.  With your change to a <div>, you've eliminated that
hierarchy and thus lost important metadata.  The fact that this specific
article is part of something else (called <h1>bestkungfu</h1>) has been
lost; "bestkungfu" is now just a generic bit of text.  This is a _bad_
thing, Matt.

The problem is your insistence that the <h1> _must_ represent the most
important content:  no, the <h1> _must_ represent something in the
hierarchy that applies to the entire page, and which includes the
following <h2> (etc) headers.

You were right the first time:  It's your insistence on "most important"
which is incorrect, not your Web page.

I was avoiding that particular issue, but you also need to look at your
meta tags as well, especially the dc.title meta.

That's one way to do it, but it's not an advantage of XHTML.  There
are plenty of other tools you could use to do the same that don't
rely on XHTML in order avoid manually editing pages.
