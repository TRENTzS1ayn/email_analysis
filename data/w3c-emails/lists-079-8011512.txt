That's a nice opinion, but can you support it?  On the face, it's simply
an incorrect statement.  HTML 4.01 makes the same fuss about 
consistency,
well-formedness, etc as XHTML 1.0.  Why do you claim that XHTML "makes
more of a fuss?"

No, I label the statement that XHTML is meant to supersede HTML as spin.

How is this different from HTML?

Agreed, so how is this different from HTML?

Actually, no, I'm far from a mark-up luddite.  The fact that
you're considering such a possibility shows that you simply are not
paying attention.  I will accept that you probably have your head in
the clouds, because if I thought you were seriously calling me a
luddite, I'd have to (a) prove you quite wrong, and (b) demand an
apology.

That's not an accessibility argument.

No.

Sure there can.  And the statement above is not by any means the
type of "standard" that a W3C recommendation is.  By the way,
you do know that CSS, HTML, WCAG, etc are not, technically speaking,
"standards"?  It's easy to spout off platitudes about "standards are
standards," but it really helps if the person saying it knows what
a standard _really_ is.

You stated that as your opinion, but you certainly did not support it.
XHTML does not make a "bigger fuss" in a way that benefits 
accessibility.

The only way in which XHTML makes a bigger fuss is by refusing to
display anything of a document is not well-formed, but this does not
benefit accessibility -- in fact, it hurts it.

What marketing techniques have been undertaken by the XHTML group, and
to what extent are those relevant to the discussion of the accessibility
of XHTML vs. HTML?

This argument is not an accessibility argument.

I don't see the relevance here.  It's not up to us, as developers, to
mandate how other developers do their work.  It's up to us involved in
education to make other Web developers aware of the issues and allow
them to make their own choices, but it's not OUR job to do THEIR jobs
for them.

Oh, good!

Okay, so when you said this:

...by "inherent features" you meant "marketing spin done by the XHTML
working group to convince Web developers that they should make more
accessible pages" and not really any features of the XHTML 1.0 language
that differ from HTML 4.01?

If that's what you meant, then so be it, but that seems an awful strange
way for you to state your claim.  It would seem that when talking
about "inherent features", you're talking about features of the
language itself.  No wonder I misunderstood.
