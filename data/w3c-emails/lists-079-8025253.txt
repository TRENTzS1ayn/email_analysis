It can't be true as it is self contradictory.  An AAA, or even AA
rated page cannot trigger a popup Window until the normal situation
is that browsers can disable popping up the Window, so whilst disabling
is not generally supported (in terms of installed base), it is not allowed
to popup and claim AAA, and when disabling is supported, it cannot assume
that any attempt to trigger a popup will actually work, so the second
part of the statement would be untrue.
