XHTML browsers, which encounter a document claiming to be XHTML but
which is not well-formed, _are_ obligated to throw fatal errors by
the XML specification.

Matt, do you agree that a user agent parsing an XHTML document which
encounters style rules within <!-- comments --> in the <style> element
should completely ignore those style rules?

That is what the XHTML and XML specifications demand, but it is clearly
not backwards compatible, or standard practice.  Should the browser
conform with the spec, or should it ignore it here again too?
