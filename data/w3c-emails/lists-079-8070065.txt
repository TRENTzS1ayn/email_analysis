You're right, there is no MUST NOT clause in the Conforming User Agents 
section of the HTML 4.01 spec.[1]

Nor is there one in the XHTML 1 spec.[2] In fact, they're pretty much 
identical in terms of recovering from elements and attributes they 
don't understand. The XHTML spec says that it has to parse the document 
as XML, but doesn't say thou shalt not render if it fails.
