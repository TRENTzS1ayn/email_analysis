No, I haven't. It's only an <h1> on the home page because it is the 
most relevant descriptor of the document. Elsewhere, it's metadata, a 
component of consistent user interface -- and arguably useless to 
people browsing in header view.

Please, Kynn, won't you please let me tear down my own site? :)

In this section of the site, though, the main content is and will only 
be relevant to that one heading. I won't have more than one heading per 
page in the archives, and it's the only reason to visit that page. So 
in this case I wouldn't say that I'm insisting on the most important 
content; rather, it's the only content that applies to the page, and 
therefore, in my mind, should be an <h1>.
