  So an XHTML aware user agent should parse the document as XML. It
  would seem that it is, then, what the XML specification calls an "XML
  processor".

  The XHTML specification also states that

    "In order to be consistent with the XML 1.0 Recommendation [XML],
     the user agent must parse and evaluate an XHTML document
     for well-formedness."

  Looking up "well-formedness" in the XML 1.0 Recommendation - which
  XHTML wants to be consistent with - gives us:

    "Definition: A rule which applies to all well-formed XML documents.
     Violations of well-formedness constraints are fatal errors."

  So ... wouldn't it seem that a XHTML processing UA should, indeed,
  treat violations of well-formedness as fatal errors ?
