  Then we agree. Valid HTML is as good for accessibility as valid XHTML.

  http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#uaconf

    "In order to be consistent with the XML 1.0 Recommendation [XML],
     the user agent must parse and evaluate an XHTML document
     for well-formedness."


  http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml

    "Definition: A rule which applies to all well-formed XML documents.
     Violations of well-formedness constraints are fatal errors."

  It would seem to me, and to others, that this means: An XHTML
  supporting user agent should, when encountering a XHTML document that
  is not well-formed, treat that as a violating of the well-formedness
  constraint, aka fatal error.

  I am quite sure that there is something here I miss. I hope I miss
  something here. Tomorrow will be a *good* day if someone can show me
  exactly what I miss.

  Sticky indeed.
