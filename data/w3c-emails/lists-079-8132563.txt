If you want me to state that there are differing levels of severity in 
validity flaws, I'll be happy to state that, especially as relates to 
style and CDATA, it's not a severe violation, or a reason to fall out 
of standards mode. As it is, the spec doesn't say it's invalid. What it 
does say is that an XML parser could be thrown off if a < or & is 
present in the CSS code.

http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#h-4.8

But your thesis, that browsers do and should refuse to render XHTML 
content if it's invalid, is itself invalid. Browsers simply don't do 
this, and they never will. A "fatal error" in this context merely means 
it can't be parsed in standards mode, and a browser can claim to be a 
Conforming User Agent by dropping from standards mode to quirks mode 
when this happens, just like it does with HTML.

I'd say "let's not get hooked on semantics," but I suspect my Semantic 
Web colleagues would take that the wrong way. :)
