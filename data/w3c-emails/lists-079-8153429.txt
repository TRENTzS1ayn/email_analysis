No, that's not what I'm saying.

Anything in an XML comment can be dropped out at any time, for any
reason.  Important information (such as styles or javascript) should
/never/ be encoded within comments in an XML-based language.  You
have no guarantee that comments will be passed along intact and you
should _never_ depend on that happening, in XML.

My point is this:  There are consequences of XHTML being an HTML
language which I believe that most people who argue "XHTML is newer,
so it's better!" will rarely think about.  One is the issue of
XML "fatal errors."  Another is that XML does _not_ allow for
important content or meta-content to be contained in (and preserved)
within comment tags.

That's an interpretation I've not heard before regarding XML parsing.
Can you support it?

(It seems that some people feel that XHTML failing to display would be
a good thing, as it would eliminate "lazy" or sloppy Web coding
practices.  Aren't these people troubled by "quirks" mode?  BTW, I
don't which W3C recommendation promotes "quirks mode.")

Semantics are what we're all about. :)
