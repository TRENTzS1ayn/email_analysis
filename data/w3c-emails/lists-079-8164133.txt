To answer this one from my angle, the ability to apply XSLT translations 
to XHTML is an advantage, and a big one.

I am developing systems, including an Accesible kiosk where content 
needs to be served in different formats.  Originally, I was going to use 
my own flavour of XML which would then be translated into (X)HTML, WML, 
Voice XML, etc.  I realised that I could economise here by writing 
everything in XHTML, ready to use for the Web, then apply various XSLT 
stylesheets to get the other formats.

Although this is probably a shaky argument, I could conclude that the 
ability to translate XHTML to other formats using XSLT makes it more 
Accessible since the /original content/, through conversion, can be 
presented to a wider audience.

Whilst it would be possible to write software to do similar conversions 
to HTML, this would be re-inventing the wheel somewhat.

Cheers

M
