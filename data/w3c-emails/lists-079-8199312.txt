  But that brings us back to the starting point of this little debate:
  is XHTML, done according to spec, more inherently accessible than HTML
  done according to spec ?

  If an author follows the HTML specification, grammar and semantics,
  then he'll get the same basic accessibility (ie. valid code) than if
  he follows the XHTML specification.

  There really is no point in recommending XHTML for *accessibility*
  reasons - perhaps unless one is doing server-side XSL transformations.
  At this point in time, however ...
