Currently the Accessibility Toolkit Frequently Asked Questions project
commissioned by Multimedia Victoria's e-government Strategy and Policy
Unit at
http://www.egov.vic.gov.au/Victoria/StrategiesPoliciesandReports/Reports
/Accessibility-FAQs/Accessibility-FAQs.htm, has contracted Parisfirst to
provide answers to questions often asked by users about accessible
websites or in the development of accessible websites.
One of the questions we have been asked is if we are aware of any
Australian survey's or research conducted over the last 12 to 18 months
that ranks which websites users with a range of disabilities regard as
the most accessible.
We are particularly interested in linking to any Australian sites being
used by Australians with a range of disabilities.
If you are aware of any current research or survey's being conducted, we
would appreciate you forwarding any details of the research or contacts
to Gian at gian@parisfirst.com.au.  We would also welcome circulation of
this email request to other relevant groups or organisations.
As this project is finishing at the end of June, we would be grateful
for your response by the end of this week - Friday June 27th to allow us
to collate your responses.
Yours Sincerely, 
Gian
