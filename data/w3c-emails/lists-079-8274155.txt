How can they be losing presumed accessibility benefits if the document is:

Well structured, with style seperated from content.
Equipped to apply any of the operations that could be applied to XML on the
server side to accommodate alternative browsing devices.
Possibly lighter on bandwidth if CSS/XHTML combination is used correctly.

It seems like occasionally this discussion is veering towards an anti-XHTML
stance just for the sake of it.
