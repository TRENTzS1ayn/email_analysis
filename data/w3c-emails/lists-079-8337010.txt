Geoff,

If it was defined, I also missed it. I'll try to provide one. If 
anyone feels they can do better, go right ahead. You won't hurt my 
feelings. LOL

A general principle of robustness: be conservative in what you do, be 
liberal in what you accept from others.

Under this principle, validators and programs that produce code 
should be as conservative as possible; user agents, since they accept 
code, should be as liberal as possible.

Regards,

Larry
