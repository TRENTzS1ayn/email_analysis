That's not an advantage of XHTML over HTML.  (An HTML 4.01 could very
well separate content from presentation.)

Except that if something is sent as text/html -- and not as
application/xhtml+xml -- what justification is there for using
XML tools on it?  It's just HTML, right?  Even if you coded it
as XHTML...

(You'd have to make a bad assumption, and then be prepared to handle
SGML-based HTML if you're accepting text/html and assuming it's
XML -- so you lose the benefits of XHTML here.)

No, there's nothing about XHTML+CSS that makes it lighter on bandwidth
than HTML+CSS.  In fact, XHTML is often going to be slightly "heavier"
than HTML:

      <br>        four characters
      <br />      six characters

Um, nope.  I'm trying to make several points here:

1.  The "benefits of XHTML" presented are generally just the
     benefits of XHTML _or_ HTML (such as your "separation of
     content and presentation" argument).  In these cases,
     XHTML and HTML are equal.

2.  There are a number of complications with using XHTML
     (such as the mimetype and the possibility of poorly formed
     documents breaking entirely) which are not well-known even
     to proponents of XHTML.

3.  Thus, XHTML 1.0 may actually be a less reasonable choice than
     HTML 4.01 for general use on the Web.  It certainly is not
     a slam dunk that XHTML is superior.

The notion that XHTML is boon to accessibility has to be carefully
considered.  Many will take it for granted because it's the
latest-and-greatest; it may be the latest, but when it comes to
accessibility considerations, it's not necessarily the "greatest."

Does that make me "anti-XHTML for the sake of it?"  Gosh, I hope
not.
