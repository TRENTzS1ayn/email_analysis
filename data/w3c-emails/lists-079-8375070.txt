OK, I didn't say anything about advantages over HTML.  Refer to what you 
were replying to above to see this.

Yes, agreed. You can easily reformat your valid XML (XHTML) document 
into HTML and in many different ways, including
a total overhaul of your content if you wish. And all without altering 
the original document. Is this bad?

OK.

Why is it then that many HTML sites contain much less seperation of 
content and style than XHTML?

Not really. How to present XHTML is well documented on the internet. It 
is forward thinking. You don't need to serve the correct mimetype at 
this time, but you can easily adjust that in the future.

I don't think it is less reasonable. HTML and XHTML are very close in 
what they do. It is *my opinion* that XHTML has a slight edge. More like 
a pleasent dribble to the hole and a gentle roll off the palm into the 
net. (sorry I am english, I hope my basketball terminology works). My 
argument was never about a gaping difference. Just what I feel from 
experience has made development slightly easier for me.

Nor am I anti-HTML. I just prefer XHTML. Is that hard to swallow. Gosh I 
guess so.
