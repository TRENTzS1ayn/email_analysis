It is quite common for some of the cheap/free hosting sites to actually
prefix the advert popup code before the opening HTML tag, relying on
browsers to be tolerant of such errors.

afford the relatively small annual cost of doing things properly, at
least as far as having their HTML served exactly as they wrote it.
