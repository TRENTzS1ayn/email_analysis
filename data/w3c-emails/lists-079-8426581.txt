  Correct example. All elements which, today, are 'open ended' should,
  in XHTML, be closed. That *will* increase the bandwith.

  Because IT and in *particular* the Web field contain by far the
  largest amount of self-taught, delusional, shitty poor authors any
  professional industry have ever seen ?

  Granted, harsh words. But I'm damned if I ever saw a kid with a 3
  weeks course in Frontpage ever cut it in any *other* professional
  field.

  Now hold it for just one moment. Are you saying that we should
  strive towards standards compliance in what we do, but *ignore parts
  of the standard at leisure* ?

  What on earth makes THIS mess any better than the one we have, barely,
  just left ? What, *exactly*, is the difference between:

    "Oh, I don't need to serve my documents with the proper content type
     today, since no browsers CARE about it"

  and

    "Oh, I don't need to use the LINK element to create document
     collections today, since no browsers CARE about it"

  then ?

  Am I utterly mistaken in that you wrote:

   "XHTML does contain much inherent accessibility.  The very first 
    thing standards based development addresses is the issue of making our
    documents available to the largest number of web users regardless of
    the client software they use. Accessibility may I remind you is far
    from just an issue of physical disability."
       Tim Roberts in <20030625132800.M27123@wiseguysonly.com>

   Because if I am *not* mistaken, then how on Earth are you going to
   reconcile "standards based development" with "you don't need to
   serve the correct mime-type at this time" ?

   IF XHTML is better for accessibility than HTML - everything else
   being equal - because it FORCES an author to be standards-compliant,
   then it follows that the document needs to be served up according to
   the same standard - which means it won't *work* for users of Lynx and
   IE, among others.

   Frankly, I'm getting abit afraid of the dark here.
