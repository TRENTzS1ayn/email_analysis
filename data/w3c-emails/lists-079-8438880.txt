Hi David,

I cannot agree with you when you say:

"My feeling is that anyone with a serious site ought to be able to
afford the relatively small annual cost of doing things properly, at
least as far as having their HTML served exactly as they wrote it."

I believe that the seriousness doesn't have anything to do with the quantity
of money that one has. And this can be specially excluding if we takes as
norm, because there are places created by people or for organizations (for
example organizations representatives of people with disabilities) that
cannot approach what supposes a relatively small annual cost for you, for
diverse circumstances.

I believe that, in fact, one of the objectives of the accessibility is to
facilitate the access to that type of people, to those that are not as
fortunate as us and they don't have access to new computers or devices,
connections of wide band, and services of payment hosting.

But this it is only my humble opinion.

cheers,
Emmanuelle
