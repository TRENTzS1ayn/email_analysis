It's not so much a question of "can't work" as "shouldn't work".

My understanding is that at the heart of a programme which applies the 
XSLT translation, there is an XML parser.  With HTML not being 
well-formed, the parser should not, if complying with specification, be 
able to read the HTML file.  Even the best-designed, valid, HTML should 
not parse because, basically, it is not XML and that is what the parser 
is expecting.

That is not to say that one could not write a translation utility based 
on an SGML/HTML parser.  One would have to be very careful that HTML fed 
to this is valid, otherwise unpredictable results would occur - this is 
the very reason that XML parsers are designed to stop as soon as they 
see something that is not well formed.
