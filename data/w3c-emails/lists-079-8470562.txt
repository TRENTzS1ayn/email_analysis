On Cost vs. Seriousness

On Cost, I wonder what it would take to make the ads accessible. Perhaps we
should look to the 50 Million a quarter company to go ahead and update their
ad delivery process and the advertisers should demand it perhaps. For some
people it is a real had decision where 10 bucks a month goes. Just my two
cents.

As we do more with flash, vs.net, all dev environments it seems like mere
childs play for a web host to deliver accessible ads, and perhaps make more
money in the long run.

Cheers,
