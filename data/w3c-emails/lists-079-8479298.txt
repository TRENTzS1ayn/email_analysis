Tantek ?elik <http://tantek.com/log/> graciously authorizes me to 
pass on his response:

>This is much ado about nothing. Or at least a lot more noise than signal.

>If a document is sent as text/html, no matter whether the insides

>Appendix C compatibility guidelines), the browser can be quite 
>reasonably expected to render broken content.

>If a document is sent as text/xml or application/xml or 
>application/xhtml+xml, then the browser can be expected to NOT
