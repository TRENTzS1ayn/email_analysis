Automating the process that Tantek suggests is preferable, the dialogue 
is an unnecessary burden, life is short.

The purpose of explicitly agreeing that invalid code is not to be 
rendered, may be to prevent embedded devices including mobile phones 
rendering content, where they don't have any code to cope with errors.
