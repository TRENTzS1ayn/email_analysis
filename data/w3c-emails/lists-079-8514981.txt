The error correction can be done at source, e.g. by using a tool
like HTML Tidy, or an editor, like Amaya, that should not be capable
of generating invalid syntax.  That way, provided the author looks
at the corrected code, you will get rather better consistency than
if each brand of browser used its own error correction rules.
