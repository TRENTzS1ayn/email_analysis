This stuff is at last accessibility related again.

While *XML languages generally provide the greatest accessibility*, 
there has been major progress in the development of document formats 
which had previously provided a barrier to access for many people with 
disabilities.

HTML -- Extensible HyperText Markup Language -- is the reformulation of 
HTML according to the rules of XML. XHTML is a clean, structured version 
of HTML that allows for greater separation of content and presentation, 
and compatibility with XML tools. Information stored in XML can be 
easily converted to XHTML for display in Web browsers, and that XHTML 
may be tailored to the needs of specific users.

Rather than being afraid of future advances and their potential to shut 
out audiences with special needs, we should embrace the concepts of the 
21st Century Web, employing them to their fullest to ensure 
accessibility for everyone. While HTML continues to serve as the most 
common language of the Web, accessibility for the new millennium is not 
merely about checking your alt text.

The *accessibility benefit* of this approach, which is a single source, 
multiple interface model (rather than the traditional single source, 
single interface model of earlier web design) is that it allows for each 
user to receive an optimal user interface -- one which is not merely 
"accessible" but also "usable." Rather than the screenreader version 
being a derivate of the graphical user's design, the screenreader user 
receives her own interface to the same content, made to work with her 
needs and preferences. Conflicts between accomodations necessary 
different disability types can be mitigated with such an approach, since 
different transformations can be used for different users.

These are great resources (I am being serious). They assure me that I am 
making the right choice in using XHTML as my base for accessible 
development.
Its good to have these kind of resources to affirm the way I feel.

Many thanks Kynn.
