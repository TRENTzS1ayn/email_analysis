Nice how you can demonstrate your ability to quote out of context.

Thing is, you still haven't proven how XHTML is more accessible
than HTML.

You said this conversation should be dropped -- and you whined when
I actually dropped it -- and now you're trying to quote me in order
to make your point?

Sorry, kid, this one isn't even worth refuting.

You've become incredibly petty once you realized you couldn't prove
your point about XHTML.
