The links are all on the email as well as sizeable chunks of what you 
have written.

There is no out of context argument.

The articles are called:


      BEYOND HTML: WEB ACCESSIBILITY FOR THE 21ST CENTURY


      XML AS ENABLING TECHNOLOGY: EMERGING DEVELOPMENTS IN WEB ACCESSIBILITY

You wrote them..

They demonstrate many points I have raised, and you won't refute because 
there is nothing to refute. I am not being petty; the arguments are good 
and I encourage people to read them.
