There is a mailing list that deals with css issues with some extraordinarily knowledgeable people on it (including a few names that you'll recognise from here).  
http://www.css-discuss.org/mailman/listinfo/css-d 

Your problem is almost certainly caused by IE's css parsing oddities but without further investigation I'm not sure what. A box model hack might solve it but bear in mind that not all hacks produce valid css. I'm not sure if there is an @import hack to serve up a css for IE only. You could do some php server-side sniffing to detect for IE and then serve up an alternative css based on that. Another alternative is to take advantage of IE's conditional HTML comments to serve up a completely different style sheet for all or certain versions of IE. I tried doing that as an experiment and it seems to work OK. If anyone knows of any accessibility base reasons not to use conditional comments then please could they let me know.

thanks

Julian.
