Ok, but after reading WCAG 3.1 and 3.3 checkpoints,
the sentence "...unless the table makes sense when
linearized" seems senseless.

Those say that you must use StyleSheet to control the
layout, this says you can use tables which make sense
linearized. something sounds wrong.

by the way, please, can you tell more about those
linearized tables and why they are so infrequent? I
think whats told on Techniques about it is not enough
clear.

Thanks,

Pablo Enr?quez.
