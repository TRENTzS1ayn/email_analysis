I'm interested at how you arrive at that statement. Has work been carried out into the probability of layout tables making sense when linearised? If not you should be aware of the import of that sentence. Effectively what you are saying is that if web designers/developers are left to do whatever they want in terms of page layout then more often than not they will come up with an accessible tabular layout by accident. Monkey? Typewriters? Shakespeare? ;-)
