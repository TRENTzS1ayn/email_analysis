  It never left.

  This, the entire debate, is important. It is important because of the
  myths it is exposing *even on the WAIG IG* list.

  I see us quite clearly moving into a situation in which more and more
  people will write XHTML because "someone said it is accessible!",
  sending it as text/html, and every browser there is error correcting
  for the same, foolish, mistakes that are done with HTML today.

  This'll be a GREAT step for accessibility. Backwards.
