Is that what I am trying to say? I seriously don't know becasue I am asking
for some clarification in a few areas that I would like to know more about.
The DOCTYPE I placed in the example for comment is one I regularly use. So the
question is how does that affect the example you gave. Was I implying I meant
XHTML 1.0 Transitional. I didn't intend to, but did I?

Once again, I am not debating here. I am asking advice from the list.

Yes, Bollocks and ass are not that offensive to me, just a bit unprofessional.
