I can understand the example in data tables, but
Checkpoint 5.3 seems to deal only about tables for
layout. I think often layout table cells are very
context independent and can be understood anyway you
should linearize.

For example, a typical 4-row 2-columns web page layout
table could contain another nested tables like that:

           header-table (colspan=2)

      topnavigationbar-table (colspan=2)

leftnavigationbar-table    contents-table

          feet-table (colspan=2)


When linearized this should be perfectly understable: 

header-table topnavigationbar-table
leftnavigationbar-table contents-table feet-table.
 
All the contents of these nested tables should be read
before starting to read another table. So anyone who
should read 5.3 could think he can use this kind of
layout for priority 2, when in other checkpoints (3.1
and 3.3) its said he can't. This way it seems a
contradiction for me.

Thanks,
