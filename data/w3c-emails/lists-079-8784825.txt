Regardless of whether it was done in XHTML or HTML, how does the rest of the
group feel about the initial relaunch of the RNIB site. This is where the
thread started and it really hasn't been addressed.

Also Ian Lloyd has also managed to get hold of a 2 interesting screenshots:

Firstly, a screenshot the RNIB site as it appears in a pocket PC in the
original relaunch state.

There is also a HTML /CSS redesign of the same site:

Julie Howell who has done great deal of work promoting accessible web design
has also posted her own comments in response to the relaunch:
