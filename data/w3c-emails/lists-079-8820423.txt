Indeed, I just encountered this on the XHTML-L list.  I asked about
this issue and someone well-meaning repeated exactly that -- "it's more
accessible than HTML!" -- but had no good reason why.  On the other

respect, had this to say:

The key is to make sure that everyone has the same understanding of
XHTML as Simon -- a difficult task, to be sure!
