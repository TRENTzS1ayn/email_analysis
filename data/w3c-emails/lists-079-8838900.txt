That is a fair comment. I am not really interested in the witch hunt side of
things. My initial thought was that it just seemed like a step backwards from
the original. 

Can I rephrase the question to say, do you think that for a site that promotes
accessible web content the job is good enough?

I do realise that had any other site relaunched I doubt its accessibility
would have come into so much question. This then leads onto the question of
how important it is that these sites lead by example.
