Make sure to pay attention to the note afterwards:

  "Once user agents support style sheet positioning, tables should not
   be used for layout"
    -- http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/#tech-avoid-table-for-layout

I'd say that note is now in effect, and thus no site using tables for
layout can claim WCAG AA compliance. But that is a largely a matter of
opinion.
