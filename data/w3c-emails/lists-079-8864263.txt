Where do you get that XHTML fails 11.1? It is explicitly mentioned in  
the core techniques.

Which browsers do this? IE6 handles valid doctypes in standards mode:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/ 
dnie60/html/cssenhancements.asp

The same is true of Mozilla (standards mode for XHTML 1.0 Strict,  
"almost standards" mode for Transitional):
http://mozilla.org/docs/web-developer/quirks/doctypes.html

And Opera 7.1 (and 7.0 to 7.03 if you leave out the XML declaration):
http://www.opera.com/docs/specs/doctype/

11.1 reads "Use W3C technologies when they are available and  
appropriate for a task and use the latest versions when supported." You  
seem to be saying that XHTML is not widely supported, but then bring up  
11.1 as if it is.
