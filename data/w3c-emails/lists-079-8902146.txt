  XHTML 1.0 fails 11.1 since there is a later version of XHTML released;
  a version which works in supporting browsers. As mentioned, this is my
  interpretation of 11.1.

  I won't insist on that interpretation.

  IE 6 does not support XHTML. This has nothing to do with the DOCTYPE,
  and everything to do with the content-type. 

  Serve XHTML 1.0 Transitional with the content type
  "application/xhtml+xml" and you'll get a download prompt - or rather:
  *I* got one when trying this with IE 6 / Win 98 / default settings.

  The link you are referring to outlines how to get IE 6 to use the CSS
  box model instead of it's own hack, and nothing to do with making it
  accept XHTML as XHTML and not tag-soup HTML.

  Note the word "widely" in your own comment. XHTML 1.0 is "supported"
  in that user-agents treat it as tag-soupy HTML. XHTML 1.1 is supported
  by Gecko-based UAs, Safari, and iCab (afaik).

  Is XHTML supported ? Yes. Is XHTML more accessible ? No. It providesno
  more and no less structure than properly written HTML, and fails
  spectacularly in several popular UAs, including IE. (yes, I am talking
  about XHTML 1.1)
