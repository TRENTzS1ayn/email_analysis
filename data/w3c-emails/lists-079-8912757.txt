  I am not entirely certain I understand the basis for your question.
  However, I'll try to answer it.

  The list above is an attempt to show how - following standards - the
  various versions of HTML and XHTML function in terms of accessibility
  alone.

  XHTML 1.0 SHOULD be sent with a content-type of application/xhtml+xml.
  XHTML 1.1 SHOULD be sent with the same.

  However: the latest version of XHTML 1.1 *should not* be sent with a
  content-type of text/html - compatible or not.

  Ah, but XHTML 1.1 has only *one* appropriate media type, though there
  are optionally the generic text/xml and application/xml ones.

  The interpretation of 11.1 boils down to "supported". There are
  user-agents in wide-spread use which understands XHTML 1.1 - and even
  more that understand XML and should be able to handle XHTML.

  Other user-agents handle XHTML as slightly tag-soupy HTML. Even
  Netscape 4 swallows XHTML. If, either, XHTML 1.0 or XHTML 1.0 served
  with slight disregard for standards.

  But the original argument was: XHTML is inherently accessible. I
  believe this thread has shown that not only is it no more inherently
  accessible than HTML, but has certain - inherent - difficulties[*]
  that makes it a questionable suggestion and even more questionable
  critique.

  They are the most recently released specifications of HTML and XHTML
  respectively.
