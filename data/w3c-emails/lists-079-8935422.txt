XHTML 1.0 isn't the "latest version" of XHTML.  1.1 is.  Therefore,
if you are using -- for example -- Transitional markup in XHTML,
you are in violation of WCAG 11.1.

Which, I think, is part of the silly implications of WCAG 11.1's
specific wording -- it was written to mean "use HTML 4.0, not HTML
3.2," and it fails badly when you attempt to apply it to XHTML 1.0
and 1.1.

I agree with Tina's interpretation of what 11.1 is saying -- I think
this is an example of a poorly written checkpoint.
