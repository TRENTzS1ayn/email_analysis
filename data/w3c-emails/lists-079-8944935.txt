Once again, good point.

But I guess at the end of a day it cannot be judged by anyone. I think a 
better way is to help with useful comments. I think you and I both try 
do this Kynn, and I know we both do more accessibility work for love 
than the sort which lines our pockets.

I really was interested, because the RNIB site was quite a bit off the 
mark and I think they realise that. They do after-all welcome comments. 
So lets not judge, lets maybe help.
