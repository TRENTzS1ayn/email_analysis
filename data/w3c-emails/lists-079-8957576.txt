that's easy to answer, if "I" can use the site and get the information I
want/need then it is good enough, if "I" cannont use the site or get the
information I need/want then it isn't good enough

the problem of course is when there is more than one "I"

and this is as it should be for an educator

and your example below is a very good one...but  unfortunately
accessibility is rarely a winner in cost benefit equations with the
stereotype assumptions made about people with disabilities being the
determining factors

so there is also that part of the education equation, that there is
"value" not just in compliance, but in accessibility
