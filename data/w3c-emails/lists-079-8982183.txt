Hello All,

I wanted to post to the list that I have received specific feedback from an
ISP, regarding the advertisement and the accessibility of users sites
because of the ads. For privacy reasons I will not mention the isp's name
but I wanted to report back that the ISP was very receptive and asked us to
fully describe the issue and to make a recommendation for correcting the
issue.

This is not a new customer nor did we try to sell, we just had our Ed &
Outreach coordinator contact them. I will keep the list posted at the end,
because if this is successful this could be a good boilerplate request.

I find that large corporations tend to be very receptive if you can get to
the right person.

Cheers,

Rob Yonaitis
