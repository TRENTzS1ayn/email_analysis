For the popular sites that I am thinking of, it would be quite a difficult
AI problem.  Currently the scripting that pops up the ads is just prefixed
to the user's file and it's unlikely that they would give up scripted popups
as banner-blindness is now so high that embedded adverts would be relatively
ineffective (scripted popups are becoming ineffective amongst power users
as they use browsers and proxies that suppress them).

Doing it using scripting in a syntactically valid way is probably not
too difficult, but doing it embedded, given that the site authors are
not cooperating in the insertion of the adverts, would be quite a difficult
AI problem in the general case.
