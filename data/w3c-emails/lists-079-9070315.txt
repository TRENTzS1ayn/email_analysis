  Supported. Whilst WCAG 1.0 may be an old, dead, deficient
  specification - not all agree there - it is still one which is nailed
  to the wall in several places. The EU adopted it as their standard as
  late as 2001; the Swedish equivalent recommendations in May of 2002.

  Whether we like it or not, we'll be stuck with WCAG 1.0 for some time
  to come.
