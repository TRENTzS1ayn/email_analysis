Hi All

Referring to http:/www.thedesk.info :

Good question - I just ran it through Bobby 4.0.1 for level A only - 
comes up 'repair needed'.  Main failure point is lack of ALT text on an 
image.

Unfortunately, the 'Bobby Approved' icons have become meaningless; 
whether or not you like the tool, it is let down by people seeing an 
'approved' message but not actually reading the report and performing 
the manual checks.

Cheers

M
