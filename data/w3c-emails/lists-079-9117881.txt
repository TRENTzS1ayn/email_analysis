Technically there is already an errata for WCAG 1.0, but I think that
a cohesive effort needs to be made in order to fold those problems,
and other issues, back into the original WCAG 1.0 and issue not an
errata, but a "second edition."

Many major W3C recommendations (such as XHTML 1.0) have published
"second editions" which don't increment the version number -- they
remain 1.0 -- but which clear up problems, confusion, or errors in
the original document.

This is the approach that should be taken with WCAG 1.0, in preparation
for WCAG 2.0 -- I think that by explicitly identifying and solving
the small changes in WCAG 1.0, it will actually help to produce a
cleaner, tighter, and more usable WCAG 2.0 eventually, somewhere
down the road.

As Tina said, we're going to be stuck with WCAG 1.0 for a while,
and it's important that the W3C be seen as properly managing that
document throughout its lifetime.  (This also involves giving
definitive, but date-specific, information on the "until user
agent" clauses in WCAG 1.0.)
