Hi all,

Has anyone any thoughts on the use of the title attribute in links on
navigational structures (read as the main navigation on any site). I am trying
 to come to some kind of consensus (with myself) as to the implementation.
Here are some questions:

What accessibility benefits does the title attribute hold with particular
relevance to navigation links?

Is it useful to include a reference to the accesskey in the title attribute?

How is the title attribute handled in various assistive technologies.

Tim
