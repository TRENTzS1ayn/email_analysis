Well, I would judge it the way I do other judging - get a copy of WCAG 
and see how many things it meets (I don't yet know of a tool that does 
testing, but there are certainly some criteria that should be 
automatically testable). Things like being adequately illustrated or 
using clear text are obvious things to check flash for - and clear 
consistent navigation...

Certainly flash is considered almost indispensable by many people 
working with intellectual disabilities - Jonathan Chetwynd on this list 
has worked hard to try and use technologies more familiar to us to do 
the same things, and ensure accessibilty not just to the target 
audience but anyone else as well. It is, of course, difficult, and in 
the end the target audience is the one that usually gets considered 
more important.

There is a company in Australia that uses flash to produce sites - 
including an authoring interface, keyboard controls, and many other 
accessibility features. They provide a backup text-based version which 
is autogenerated. http://www.composmentis.com
