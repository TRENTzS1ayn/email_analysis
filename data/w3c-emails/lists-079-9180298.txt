In principle yes, but that page title would be bad, as it doesn't work well
out of context.

I would also think it would be acceptable to replace the company name with
a suitable pronoun, where, as I assume you meant, it is the company that
the referencing site is about.

But I also meant that a direct link to a JPG or PDF might reasonably have
the title that would have gone onto the page which might otherwise have
been used to wrap it.

It's a preview because some browsers will capture the title element
into link summaries if you actually fetch the page, but will use the
title attribute on the link until they first see the actual page, or
always for a standalone image,  plain text, etc.
