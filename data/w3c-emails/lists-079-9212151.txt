Hi All

Can anyone give me an indication of what metadata is actually essential 
for accessibility as opposed to merely desirable?  (Checkpoint 13.2 - 
http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-TECHS/#tech-use-metadata )

As regards the actual format, should I use Dublin Core?  I've had a look 
over RDF ( http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax/ ) which looks great if 
one is working in pure XML, which I'm not.  (I am using XHTML, but 
served as text/html for compatibility with XML-unaware browsers.)

My current application is a community directory ( 
http://www.community-connect.net ); all pages are generated on-the-fly. 
  Should I on, say, the search page, produce the same metadata whether I 
am displaying the default page, a shortlist or the final record, or 
should I produce different metadata for each?

Cheers

M
