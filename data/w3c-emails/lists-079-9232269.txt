I suspect there is no information that is "essential" for accessibility.

There are some useful things that could be put there - common Dublin 
Core metadata is one, a link to an EARL statement (giving more detailed 
conformance information than an icon does) is another. (I link to RDF 
rather than including it in anything, as a rule).

At the WCAG meeting taking place tomorrow and the next day I hope this 
will get some discussion...

cheers
