I would be most interested to hear people's ideas on
what is desirable here (does it have to be *essential*
to be worthwhile.

We are just starting some work on how to use Meta-data for
accessibility with the LOM in CEN-ISSS WS-LT and all feedback as
to what should go in there is at this point very useful.
Opportunities do not come every day to start work like this
so if there's something that should be there please say so.

Do you want to be more precise about the link to an EARL
statement for a start off Charles ... what could such a link
look like ?  Could you post an example ?

Other ideas very welcome.
