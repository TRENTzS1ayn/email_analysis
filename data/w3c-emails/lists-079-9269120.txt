There are two ways to answer this.
1. There's a contradiction and a WCAG 1.0 errata is needed.
2. WCAG 2.0 should resolve the Note about browser that don't support CSS
and eliminate the table layout discussion.

But then there are still millions of pages that use tables for layout.  To
make them accessible they don't have to be converted to CSS do they?  My
point is that the guidelines should focus on the reading order, not whether
it is layout tables or CSS being used.  In other words, what accessibility
concerns are there if you use tables for layout vs CSS for positioning
content? none in my opinion;  it depends on **what you do** with either
technology - not **which** technology!
