This could certainly help improve navigation structures - now that I've 
discovered what that weird bar is which pops up on Mozilla for some 
pages ;-)

I take David's point that meta information and tags/elements are not one 
and the same.

I'm starting to think that I need to put two things in:

1) RDF or "library" data (Dublin Core or derivative thereof)
2) Header links.  Due to the nature of the data that I am presenting, 
the site doesn't read like a book; there would be no FORWARD links 
available since going forward would generally be selecting from a list. 
However, I could use BACK to return to a list, although it would mean 
that I would have to preserve state and send the original query data on 
to the detailed records in order to do this.  INDEX could go back to the 
beginning of a programme, or even the front page of the site.

I suppose that as long as I am consistent in the way I do this, it 
shouldn't be too bad, although it would be nice to have standard 
functions for these.

Cheers

M
