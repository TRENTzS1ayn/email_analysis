I think it's www.ventrilo.com.  Is that right, David?

It is more of an online community than a conferencing resource.  I think

the chat software is developed inhouse - it is designed to work with
JAWS 
and Window-Eyes and run from the GFTB server.  At the moment the program
is 
being updated and I noticed on their web site that it has been taken
down 
(as they were under attacked).  The developers have it running on a test

server for authorised users only.  However I did try it when it was open

access and it worked very well, so might be worth following up.
