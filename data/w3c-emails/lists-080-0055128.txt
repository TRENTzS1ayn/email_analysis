Hi-  As you know accessible collaboration technologies are a critical 
element for certain types of webconferencing. Therefore, you might find 
the first W3C WAI Research and Development Interest Group 
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/RD/> Workshop, "Teleconference on Making 
Collaboration Technologies Accessible for Persons with Disabilities," of 
interest.  You can see (or listen to) the position papers at: 
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/RD/2003/03/announce-collab.html>.  You can access 
the material provided for the accepted presentations at: 
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/RD/2003/03/agenda.html>.  A proceedings is 
planned, but has not yet been posted.  Bill
