Anybody want to join me in lobbying them?  "special needs" is hidden
down in their functionality criteria, but they sure could do more.

I'm blind and use a screen reading program to surf the Internet.  Over
the last ten years I've noticed a lot of improvement in accessibility of
websites.  Unfortunately, the improvement has been most pronounced in
government and nonprofit sites.  Some businesses have done great things
and others apparently are not aware that accessibility is both good
business and good sense.  Would you consider adding an accessibility
category, or adding accessibility to the criteria in the "best
practices" category?  As I'm sure you're aware, most accessibility is
not rocket science; adding alt text tags that give a five word
description of a product instead of saying "book1.asp" is not that hard
to do.  From the platform of the prestigious Webby awards, you could
help educate people and lead to much happier surfing for those of us
with disabilities. Thank you for considering my request. Katherine
