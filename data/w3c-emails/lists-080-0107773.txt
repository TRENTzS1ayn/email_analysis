Thinking aloud for a Perfect World:

Should ALL software not come with some sort of metadata (RDF?) which 
identifies what it is, what it does, version information, license 
conditions, where to go for support, etc.?

A specific call to the programme (standard across all software) would 
then return the required data.

Example:
mozilla-firebird.exe --rdf=title

Returns:
Mozilla Firebird

I'm starting to use a similar technique for CGI-generated Web content; 
for instance:

http://www.foo.bar/cgi-bin/baz  ...delivers a page
http://www.foo.bar/cgi-bin/baz?rdf=all  ...delivers all RDF for the same 
page.

Back in the desktop context, an operating system could keep a database 
(Windows Registry or /etc/rdf.db) of this information which could:
a) let AT users [and others] know what resources are available on the 
machine
b) provide an easy means of performing a software audit on a machine - 
handy in a corporate environment where you need to track thousands of 
licenses.

I know that this is a bit off-topic, but I see this as a logical 
progression towards an holistic approach to accessibility.

Cheers
