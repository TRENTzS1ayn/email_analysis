Because I hadn't seen it noted on here, I'd like to call attention to 
the new accessibility forum. Nigel Peck launched the Accessify Forum 
launched last week in conjunction with Ian Lloyd's Accessify.

http://www.accessifyforum.com/

It should be noted that the forum has some accessibility flaws left over 
from the default install of phpBB but these were left on purpose. Nigel 
hopes the site users give feedback on how to improve the accessibility 
features. It's getting better all the time and he hopes to have it up to 
  WCAG Level AAA standards within a few months.

Cheers,
James Craig
