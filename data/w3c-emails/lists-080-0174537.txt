HTML validation is not related to the CSS (as long as the link between the
HTML and CSS is done correctly), so while I'm not sure it is wise to make
<h1> inline it isn't the problem.

You have the <h1> element inside a <span> elemement. They are not allowed
there, even if the h1 is no longer visually a block it is still a logical
block.
