Note: this was previously posted to the WebAIM discussion forum [1]:


If you haven't yet tried WAVE Web Accessibility Tool 3.0, I encourage you to
do so.

It can be found at www.wave.webaim.org. It's a free online tool.

One of the new features is the WAVE Toolbar. You can add the toolbar to your
browser (Netscape 7, Internet Explorer 5+, or Mozilla), which lets you use
WAVE on any page that you're currently on. Similar functionality can be
obtained by using the WAVE "bookmarklet." Instructions for installing and
using these features are available from the WAVE home page.

Also, for the adventurous Web administrators out there, you can download and
install WAVE on your Web server. Note: JSP Web server administration
expertise is necessary to set this up. WAVE is a Java/JSP application. See
the WAVE site for details.
