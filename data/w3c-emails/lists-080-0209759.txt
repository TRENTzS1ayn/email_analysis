I use inline H1 on my three main pages at www.SmackTheMouse.com, the homepage, Contents and Search. The pages are valid XHTML 1.1 rendered as text/html for the time being.

I have been wondering for some time if it is acceptable from an accessibility point of view to use inline H1. Here is a chance to hear what others have to say.

My idea is that the menu item telling you where you are on the three mentioned pages are great for being H1 as well, making my pages as clean and simple as possible.
