Hi Bill

I'm new to all this!  I guess my subjectline is confused because I am. I
cant validate my CSS until my XHTML validates. I guess because I have both
in the same file at the moment it is straining my brain.

Anyhow, it turns out that what I did wrong was to put the <h1> inside a
<span>, not that I treated it as inline. It turns out the span wasn't
necessary so I fixed it easily enough.

What is proving harder is the fact that my horizontal <UL> also sits within
a <Span> at the moment and that is causing the XHTML not to validate too.
Need to scratch my head a bit more about that.

Cheers

Carl
