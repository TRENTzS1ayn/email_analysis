Carl,

Try replacing your <div><span><ul> with <div><ul> and /maybe/ try to mesh
the styles you have defined for the classes using CSS inheritance rather
than the nesting of tags - that should fix the validation problem.  You
could also more direclty influence the <ul> tag with a class applied to it
via CSS.

Hope this helps, Matt.

Hi Bill

I'm new to all this!  I guess my subjectline is confused because I am. I
cant validate my CSS until my XHTML validates. I guess because I have both
in the same file at the moment it is straining my brain.

Anyhow, it turns out that what I did wrong was to put the <h1> inside a
<span>, not that I treated it as inline. It turns out the span wasn't
necessary so I fixed it easily enough.

What is proving harder is the fact that my horizontal <UL> also sits within
a <Span> at the moment and that is causing the XHTML not to validate too.
Need to scratch my head a bit more about that.

Cheers

Carl
