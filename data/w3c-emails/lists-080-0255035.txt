Hi All,

I've seen a few sites that use a form field to contain terms and conditions.
I suppose the assumption is that the terms and conditions are basically a
form in that they typically end with the user clicking an "accept" button.

This seems like a clunky way to handle this. I would have thought an HTML
text page with an "Accept" button (possibly even as an image) would be
simpler.

So, I'm wondering which is better from an accessibility perspective: the
form approach or the HTML text page. Assuming that the form is correctly
coded of course.

Cheers
Anthony
