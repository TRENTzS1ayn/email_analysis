I agree wholeheartedly, this is the best way to do it.

Forms are the only way to use normal HTML to send a POST (there are a few
more convoluted ways, such as javascript submitting a hidden form or
javascript transmitting an XML document). Therefore without POST you are
left with GET and the semantics of GET don't agree to anything; GET is
"looking" where POST is "doing".
See <http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#safe-interaction> and
<http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/whenToUseGet.html>.

Two cases where the semantics have a practical effect is with robots and
links that bypass the T&C page. In these cases the T&C cannot be agreed to,
as they haven't been seen.

Users can be held accountable for what they POST but not for what they GET.
