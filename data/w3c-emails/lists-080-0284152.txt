Does anyone else know if other screen readers notify a user that an edit 
field is disabled or read-only? If not, this seems like a problem with 
the readers, not the pages.

Just to clarify, I agree that the Terms content should be in a div, not 
a textarea. I am just wondering about legitimate uses of disabled and 
read-only form fields.

Thanks,
