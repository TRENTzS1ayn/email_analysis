Subject: [webwatch] How to return from longdesc?


What is the best way to code a return link from a longdesc image
description document?

An obvious solution is to use JavaScript, but the user may have
switched off JavaScript, or the screen reader may not support it.

Is it sufficient to suggest the user should hit the back arrow or
back key combination?

Thanks,
Nick
