Nick,

Window-Eyes 4.5 will bring up long descriptions in a new browser window, so 
as not to interrupt the flow of the current page (although having to 
traverse to a new window does cause some interruption, the user can always 
go back to the original page, and leave the long description up in the 
background.). So an ALT-LEFT wouldn't do much for them in this case.
