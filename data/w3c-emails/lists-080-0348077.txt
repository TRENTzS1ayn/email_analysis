Hi All

Further to Bill Mason's question last week regarding displaying an 
application name in a titlebar, I would like to draw the list's 
attention to:

ISO/TS 16071, 2003-02-01 - "Ergonomics of human-system interaction - 
Guidance on accessibility for human-computer interfaces".

This document may be of interest to list members as it covers similiar 
issues to the WCAG, but in a broader context.  I obtained my copy from 
Standards Australia <http://www.standards.com.au> although others may 
wish to go to their friendly, local, standards supplier.

Cheers

M
