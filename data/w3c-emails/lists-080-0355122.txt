Hi,

I have just set live a new version of my mathematical puzzle site,
and I'd very much appreciate any feedback regarding its
accessibility.

This is a non-commercial, hobby site, and therefore is free of any
budgetary constraints!  So please feel free to make any suggestions
as to how I could improve its accessibility.

Thanks,
Nick
