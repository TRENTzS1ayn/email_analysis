longdescs should be separate files. It's too easy to get lost in a single
document, whether a main document plus descriptions or a single page of
every long description on a site. This of course increases the
already-massive inconvenience of longdesc.

Also, I've never seen the suggested technique before: longdesc="#text1".
No doubt it works, but canonically longdesc refers to a separate file. Or
at least that has been the interpretation; the spec is actually neutral on
that topic.

<http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/struct/objects.html#adef-longdesc-IMG>

> <a name='img1'></a>
> <img ..... longdesc='#text1' />

You don't have to use an <a> anchor. Just add an id to the <img> and use
the <img> itself as the anchor. Let's be more semantic.

<img longdesc="#text1" id="IMAGENAME-img" />
<a href="#IMAGENAME-img" title="Back to image"></a>

I have, of course, an entire section in the "Image Problem" chapter of my
book on linking back from a longdesc. I think I could have taken my own
more-semantic advice there.
