Does anyone have any way of hiding email addresses from spidering that doesn't use javascript? We use a CMS and have no way of stopping content authors from using their work email address as a contact (and in the interests of open government we wouldn't want to anyway) which means that our organisation is opening itself to huge amounts of spam. If there was some bit of server-side witchcraft that we could use to obscure these from email harvesters then I would dearly love to hear it. I realise that we could use &#64; instead of @ in the mark-up but I'm petty sure that spiders are wise to this now. Obviously I'd rather not use client-side scripting if at all possible.

A couple of constraints: 
the address must be a useable link (mailto: unless anyone knows any other way)
the address must appear on the page so that non-IT-savvy users recognise that it is an email address i.e. no replacing "@" with "AT" or "." with DOT

Thanks all.
Julian
