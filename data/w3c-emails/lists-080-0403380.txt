The best solution would be to use a server-side script for sending the
email to the desired person/department.  This way NO client-side version
of the email address exists to be harvested.

For those of you in the US Federal Government, this could also be said:
"A good government web site will comply with Section 508 sub section
1194.22 (web applications).  The use of mailto: would not be as clean and
would require compliance with an additional sub section 1194.21
(client-side applications).  Web aps should be web aps, not web aps plus
client-side aps.
