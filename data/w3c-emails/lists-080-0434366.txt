mailto: URIs do not make an application a client-side app; they provide
information which can be processed by another application, which may or may
not be a client-side app. This no more violates some concept of what a web
application is or is not than the fact that many of them feature
human-readable text that must be processed by a brain rather than another
part of the web-app.

The application that may process the mailto: URI would need to comply with
1194.21 if appropriate, but that's not your problem.
