One question: why use the abbr for "@" and "." ? Surely they are not abbreviations. 

Also, any idea why encoding part of the mailto: works the way that you have done it (m&#97;ilto:) and not by using m%6Dilto: ?

I personally take the entity-encoded example a step further and
URL-encode parts of the email link as well. An example:

<a href="m&#97;ilto:username&#37;40hostname&#37;2ecom">username<abbr
title=" at ">@</abbr>hostname<abbr title=" dot ">.</abbr>com</a>

I have no idea how "smart" email harvesters are these days, but it
probably isn't worth the effort for them to decode this kind of address
considering how many plain-text emails are available.  Note that there's
nothing special involved - if the email harvesting script is attached to
any browser, it would have no problems reading that.

This solution works with no apparent side-effects in the browsers I've
tested.  It foils simple searches for mailto: or username@hostname.com
without changing the link's appearance.

Further protection can be provided by substituting an image for any
characters in the displayed email address, usually either the '@' symbol
or the entire address.  That's not as accessible, of course.

Any suggestions, questions or improvements are welcome.
