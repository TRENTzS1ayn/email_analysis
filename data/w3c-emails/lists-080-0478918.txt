  Yet again I am receiving a number of automatically generated messages
  in response to a posting made directly to the W3C WAI-IG mailing list.

  I am not willing to throw people left and right into our company spam
  filter for this, but: I would like to request a clearification of W3C
  mailing list policy on this topic.
