Does someone have convincing evidence that the use of JavaScript for such
a trivial task constitutes any form of accessibility barrier whatsoever in
2003?

What is the complete list of "user agents" in widespread deployment that
cannot understand that kind of rudimentary JavaScript? How many people use
those?

Where is the evidence that anyone other than a few privacy freaks and
Slashdot-reading Linux nerds turn JavaScript off? How many of them are
disabled?

Why are people still clinging to the myth that JavaScript and
inaccessibility are one and the same thing?
