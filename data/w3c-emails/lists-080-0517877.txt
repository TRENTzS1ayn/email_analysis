  What does it matter ?

  Each visitor to a website perceive reality in a different fashion to
  her neighbour. This can be as subtle as enjoying the colour blue more
  than the colour brown, or as extreme as vision vs. no vision.

  But each visitor has a different physical reality. Yours is different
  from mine - for which I am ever so grateful - and mine is vastly
  different from yours.

  Accessibility involves making as few assumptions about the physical
  realities of others as possible:

    "Be liberal in what you accept, conservative in what you send"

  The exact version of a browser is of no particular interest. The very
  nature of a browser is only marginally more so. What is interesting is
  making very certain that what we send out has the ability to adapt
  itself to the physical reality of the visitor - a reality we do not
  know anything about; one of which we should assume as little as
  possible.

  Javascript is not automatically inaccessible. Noone - and I mean NOONE
  - has ever claimed otherwise. Why you bring up this void point is
  beyond me - but, after all, I am not a "leading independent authority
  on accessibility".

  Frankly I find this offensive. Is this what you teach people who come
  to you for advice and knowledge about accessibility ?
