I'd rather not. I'm quite happy providing content in a way which can
be accessed by people who can't, or won't, use browsers capable of
coping with the above.

I find it unsurprisingly difficult to access websites that depend on
large images and complex JavaScript while sitting on the train using
the browser built into my phone.

Lets continue to treat the term "accessible" as "accessible to as many
people as possible, including those who use a browser that supports
HTML but not images, scripting, or multimedia".

Bodies become rather important when no existing user agent, is able to
present the user with the content, and the only theoretical ones
demand more processing power then is available to the average user.
