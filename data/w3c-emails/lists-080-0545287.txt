I visit Slashdot once or twice a year (mainly because of referred URIs), I run Windows and a command prompt scares the life out of me. I do however regularly use my browser with javascript disabled until I find a need to enable it. I regard myself as a pretty average bloke and wouldn't be at all surprised if there are quite a few people with my surfing habits. The fact that I am not disabled is irrelevant; I still need sites to work properly.

By the way, this is exactly the same argument that people in my organisation use when I ask them to write descriptions for images and summaries for tables to go along with their copy for a web page. "But how many disabled people will be using the site Julian? Why should we bother? What's the point?" I normally look forward to your posts and the fresh approach you take but I think this comment is harmful and ill-conceived.

At no point in my original post did I say that. One of the main reasons that I didn't want to use javascript to do this is because for anything more than a couple of addresses on a page it becomes unwieldy to manage.
