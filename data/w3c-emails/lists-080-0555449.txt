If 100% of the people for whom javascript is inaccessible are able-bodied
(for whatever threshold of that term you wish to use) does that make it
accessible?

As a developer I care about whether people can use what I produce, and if
they can't then the reason why is frankly none of my business except in so
far as knowledge of it might help me to fix the problem.

Now as a matter of civil rights and social justice it is important to ensure
that developers do not, by intent or by neglect, discriminate against people
with disabilities. However when a developer wants to avoid something that
causes an accessibility problem it doesn't matter who has that accessibility
problem, and acting as if it does benefits neither the developer, the users,
nor the civil rights campaigns.
