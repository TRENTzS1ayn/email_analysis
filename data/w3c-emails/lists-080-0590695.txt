Lots of people do, but they disagree with each other so widely that they are
of no use to anyone; except someone who wants to merely select those that
back whichever view they have on the subject and ignore the others (this is
not always consciously dishonest, sometimes it is subconsciously dishonest
as people only pay attention to those which are "likely").

Well, actually the wide disparity between different sources of such
statistics could be an interesting field of study in itself for a student of
computer science and/or statistics.

all statistics are made up on the spot.</span>
