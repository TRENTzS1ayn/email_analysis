One source I know of is www.thecounter.com/stats/

You might want to dive around in the site to work out exactly how they
compile their figures, but the headline numbers they give are, for May 2003:

Javascript 1.2+: 32815350 (86%)
Javascript <1.2: 128196 (0%)
Javascript false: 5170035 (13%)

(Incidentally, I'm not sure why May 2003 is the most recent figure - have
they stopped measuring?)

Two other possible starting points:
http://www.upsdell.com/BrowserNews/stat_trends.htm and
http://www.eleganthack.com/toolbox/browser-stats.htm - a list of links;
apparently no longer maintained but still useful.

Macromedia claim a 97.4% penetration of the Flash plugin as at June 2003 but
of course they might be biased - see
http://www.macromedia.com/software/player_census/flashplayer/penetration.htm
l. There is a thread on this at http://www.webmasterworld.com/forum36/78.htm
in which various people gave various figures, but generally in the 70 - 80%
range.

Hope this helps,

Tom
