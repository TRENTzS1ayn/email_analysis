As I said, I'm a bit sceptical about the figure, but I'm only reporting the
one that Macromedia report. On the URL I gave on their site, they do give
the source of their figures.

As for the question "why would a blind person use flash?". I guess they
wouldn't. But I can imagine a scenario in which, for example, a blind user
had a modern graphical browser (with Flash pre-installed) but also using a
screen reader. Presumably, this would just report back to any
stats-gathering package that Flash was installed. Which just says be
careful; the numbers may (truthfully) say one thing but the actual ability
to use may be something else altogether.
