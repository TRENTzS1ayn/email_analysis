Tom,

Your scenario is real...and can create interesting problems such as 
when Flash is used to create the navigation if it is detected as 
installed/active.

I actually had a case where the author of the page simply assumed no 
blind person would have a browser with Flash installed/active thus 
didn't bother to remove the script from a "text only" page. Naturally 
the Flash code executed generating inaccessible navigation rather 
than the accessible navigation that was supplied as an alternative 
being produced. Screen reader users couldn't get beyond that page.
