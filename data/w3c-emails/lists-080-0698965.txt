Okay, I've defended IEs "support" for longdesc in the past on the grounds that AT using IE6 can access longdesc. Still it would be nice if other users could get to it, particularly developers wishing to test the links.

So I wrote a little BHO that adds a "Long Description" item to the context menu IE6 uses for images, available from <http://www.spin.ie/jon/longdescLink/>.

Hope it proves useful to some of you (or at least doesn't break anything).
