That is not the right question for this forum. You should be asking "Does
anyone have any stats on the percentage of users with relevant
disabilities who surf with JavaScript turned off?"

(Here being a single-leg amputee would not be a "relevant" disability,
while blindness, deafness, or a learning disability would be, *depending
on the application to which JS was put*.)

Indeed they wouldn't, unless the numbers are relevant.
