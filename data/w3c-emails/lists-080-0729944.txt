Thank goodness for that!  It needed to be said by someone who gets
listened to on usability.

I find it a constant problem, for the simple reason that it's grossly
inflexible.  I usually need to increase the text size, but even without
that a PDF viewer needs an uncomfortably wide window that precludes
having anything else of meaningful size visible.  At best it hogs the
desktop - and gives me a headache after the first two or three pages.

That's more a usability than an accessibility issue, though.
