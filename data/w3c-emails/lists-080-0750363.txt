(chop specific points)

It seems to me that your points apply to HTML as much as to PDF, which
would seem to be an argument in favour of it (since arguments against
PDF as a Web format hinge on it presenting more problems than HTML).

Are you saying it's inherently worse than HTML for blind users, even
setting aside the additional cost of equipment capable of reading PDF?
Or merely that it's often problematic in practice?

My point concerned usability for sighted users!
