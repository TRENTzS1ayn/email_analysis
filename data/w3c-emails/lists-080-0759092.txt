PDF is not accessible for a broad range of people, again I emphsis this is
a WORLD Wide Web and just because folks in the more developed counties are
running the latest and greatest does not mean that is the case in the rest
of the world,  in many countries linking to the web is based on time, and
the longer your on the more it costs, and if you are on a dirty telephone
line at 2400baud you don't want pretty you want accurate and fast..LYNX
or PINE are the solutions of choice, and I have yet to see either of these
do anything with pdf except choke.  and if it is a doctor in remote
Nicaragua who needs some help with a diagnosis pdf isn't going to save a
life...!

PDF is for printers, leave it there 

lots of other reasons but it is late and I am tired
