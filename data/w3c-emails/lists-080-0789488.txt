I use a perl program from
http://willmaster.com/master/spambotbuster/index.shtml

So that you could put the addresses in the control panel of the
program and then the link
http://www.yoursite.com/cgi-bin/mail.cgi?1 opens the default
e-mail program of the user.

No spam comes to you, and it's accessible.

The above page explains it much better.

Free program as well.
