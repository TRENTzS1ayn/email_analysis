Hi:

Since this is an international forum:

1. Does anyone know where there might be new emerging markets for creating
accessible websites?

2. What "new countries" are starting to embrace the notion of "accessible
websites"?

3. Where are new laws emerging?

4. And do they use any of the US/UK/Canadian/Australian etc. laws as the 
de
facto standard?

 5. In what areas of accessibility is it having a hard time of being
promoted in your country/any country that you know about (e.g. lack of
hardware/readers, lack of software etc.)?

6. Is there special pricing for software and hardware to enable
accessibility on the web for folks in developing nations?

7. How does a company accept a country as a developing nation?

Any data to promote/support your point will be welcomed. I am trying to
gather data for a graduate project.

You may write to the Listserv or directly to me at:  asif@studynook.com ,
whichever  makes you comfortable.

Thanks in advance. I have learnt a lot from this Listserv.

Asif Daya.
