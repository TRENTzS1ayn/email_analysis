I don't know if that's necessarily the case, Joe. Accessibility, and 
hence the Web Accessibility Initiative, is about providing access to 
all. Historically, the disabled have been overlooked so a major focus of 
WAI is advocacy for this group, but accessibility should also include 
people with substandard equipment, slow Internet connections, and even 
people who surf with JavaScript turned off, for whatever reason.

Of course I don't have to remind you that many new devices such as 
mobile handhelds or phones work without JavaScript, whether the user is 
disabled or not.

Cheers,
James Craig
