Was there ever any resolution to this? I'm about to update the 
OpenCourseWare site with our "final" default text for our search field. 
Seeing as that will require republishing roughly 5500 pages, I'd like to 
make sure I get it right. ;)

I'm leaning towards "Enter keyword here" or "Enter search keyword". Any 
suggestions?

Thanks in advance.
