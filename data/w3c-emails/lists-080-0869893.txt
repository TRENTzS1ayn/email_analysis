I have to agree. Way back when I started encouraging and teaching 
accessibility as a part of the authoring process, I moved away from 
singling out those with disabilities as the only reason one should make a 
site more accessible. People will only tolerate waving of the ADA and Rehab 
Act in their faces for so long.

I have used the same approach James mentioned above almost to a T. If you 
add up the number of people who use the Web that have a disability and 
include those with older browsers or "substandard" equipment, slow Network 
connectivity and those with JavaScript turned off as well as people 
utilizing the Web via hand-held devices and various Web-enabled appliances, 
the number increases substantially. This not only focused on 
backward-compatibility but future usability as well and really makes people 
think about what they're doing from the start rather than an afterthought.

Thanks.
