Hi Carl

The consensus points to 'open' fonts (sans serif ones) as are your examples.

Maximum Accessibility (Slatin & Rush, pub: Addison Wesley) recommends 
these fonts for those with low vision.  Mencap's "Am I Making Myself 
Clear"* says to use a 'clear' typeface such as Arial or Univers for 
those with learning disabilities.  (I guess that Univers is another 
sans-serif font.)  The Mencap document appears to be done in Helvetica. 
  Can't check my other books because my wife's just turned the lights 
out - bedtime over here!

Hope this helps.

Cheers

M
