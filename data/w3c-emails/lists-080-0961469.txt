There is also American Printing House for the Blind's APHont:
http://sun1.aph.org/products/aphont.html
developed by APH specifically for low vision readers. APHont embodies
characteristics that have been shown to enhance reading speed,
comprehension, and comfort for large print users.
Alas, with all fonts, it must be installed on the users computer in order to
render, but specifying it doesn't hurt. In general, sans-serif is easier to
read on the screen.
