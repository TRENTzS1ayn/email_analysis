Serving people with disabilities *is* the only reason to make a site 
accessible. Anything else is an unrelated benefit.

I suppose "by the widest audience possible" means we can never 
support anything later than Netscape 0.9, but the thrust of our work 
on these issues is clear: Accessibility to people with disabilities 
is why we're doing it. Everything else is gravy.

Note that a browser or device is not a person, hence is not also a 
person with a disability. A browser or device that cannot understand 
JavaScript is also neither a person nor a person with a disability.

And how long is that going to last?
