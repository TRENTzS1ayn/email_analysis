It seems that everything starts with language of one form or another.
Images stand for words, words stand for images, groups of each stand for
each other.  I have not encountered an abstract graphical representation
that cannot be put into words.  I have not looked at the guideline being
discussed here but we've already got plenty of textual transposition
mechanisms for the web and they are being less than half used and often miss
used.

I certainly appreciate Al's efforts here (he can always be relied on
to give a solid theoretical basis), but I don't think the proposed
WCAG guideline deals with the same thing he's talking about.

>The right goal for our effort, as Tom has suggested, is "what tip of

Unfortunately, that formulation assumes that a diagram or
illustration (the canonical example that WCAG continues to flub) has
one or two easy-to-summarize main points. A *gist*, you might say.

There are lots of those, and I cover them in my book. But they are
not the norm, and the entire reason we draw diagrams and
illustrations is to make relationships that are hard to express in
words visible and comprehensible. Through the diagram or
illustration, the entire iceberg is available. It simply is not
possible to reverse-engineer that iceberg into a simple "tip" that
can be plunked into an alt text.

Some things *cannot be expressed in words*. That's why words are not
the only form of communication we use. It follows-- pay attention,
Chaaalz-- that there aren't "alternatives" or "equivalents" for
everything.

>If we can communicate the right questions to the authors, they will

No, that perpetuates the fallacy. Some or indeed most diagrams and
illustrations are permanently and unchangeably resistant to summation
in words. You can't rephrase the question because the question cannot
be asked.

People aren't going to put a full workday into modeling, in some
as-yet-specified language, every relationship that is apparent in an
illustration. Nobody's gonna write some kind of script for a screen
reader (similar to Jaws configuration files) to enable a single
illustration to be read. Even then the experience won't merely fail
to be the same, it won't even be adequate. *Some things can't be
summed up in words*.

I've used that model myself in other contexts. But it doesn't work
here. Many or even most diagrams and illustrations (to continue with
the canonical WCAG example) are too complex for that. Essentially,
WCAG wants the entirety of technical and scientific illustration
reduced to TV-news soundbites.

I see what you're saying (not everything need be turned into lengthy
prose to be "expressed in words"), but even that amount of metadata
simply *will not be done* by authors. They've got better things to
do, and some will realize the futility of equating illustration with
words.

WCAG WG and WAI need to accept that "express[ing] in words" isn't
merely hard some of the time, it's impossible.

*Some things can't be made accessible to everyone*. That's why, for
example, we have undue-hardship exemptions in human-rights
legislation.

There isn't a "linear reading order" inherent in everything. It's a
bit late in the day to suggest that the Web-- a non-linear medium-- 
must be reduced to a straight line. "Linear reading order" is another
of those WAI shibboleths that needs to be de-emphasized.
