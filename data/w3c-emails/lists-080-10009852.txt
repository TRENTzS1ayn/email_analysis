Hi Julian,

Yes, there is an automated tool that supports validation, not only for a page, 
but for a whole portal. You can find more information in (it will available in 
the market soon):

<http://access.fit.fraunhofer.de/imergo?lang=en>

We also support real X(HT)ML validation, which overcomes some of the limitations 
of the W3C validator when dealing with XHTML, which has some bugs and 
limitations, as it is based on OpenSP.

regards,
carlos
