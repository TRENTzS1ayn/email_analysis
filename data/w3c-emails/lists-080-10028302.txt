    Yes, there is an automated tool that supports validation, 
    not only for a page, but for a whole portal. You can find 
    more information in (it will available in the market soon):

So what do you do with (maybe even a majority of sites) which don't
have the document type declaration? Validate to loose 4 dtd?
  Or be strict SGML and fail it because it doesn't have the declaration.
