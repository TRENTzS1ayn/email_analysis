imergo reports the missing declaration, and still validates against the default. 
When managing a big Web portal, it might be the case that someone has simply 
"forgotten" to insert the DTD in the CMS template (or even worse, insert a 
non-existing DTD), which is a very frequent case in our experience.

We agree in the fact that web developers shall stick to standards. However, it 
is also good to provide additional information against some user-defined 
default. It is not very helpful to say "Sorry, pal. You forgot the DTD. Bye!".
