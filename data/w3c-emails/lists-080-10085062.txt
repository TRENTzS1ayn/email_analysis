Once again, may I recommend Valet?  It deals with this problem by
generating publishable/deliverable reports.  To generate such a report,
the user has to check all the warnings in the automatic report, and
it will only be marked as a "Pass" if every warning is marked as
"Guideline Satisfied" or "Not applicable" (from a menu of six statuses).

All versions support these reports, but the Enterprise Edition goes
further by keeping the reports in the Audit trail, which can then
be queried and reviewed at any time.  That's particularly relevant
when documents get updated and you need to keep track of whether
updates affect accessibility.
