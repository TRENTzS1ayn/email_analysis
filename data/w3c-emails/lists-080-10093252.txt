That seems entirely fair and reasonable (and of course Valet permits
defaulting too:-).

That's rather different, isn't it?  The various RFCs define default
charsets, so we have ISO-8859-1 for text/html served over HTTP,
ASCII for text/xml served over HTTP, and UTF-8 for XML in isolation.
IMO allowing users to override that is a slippery slope to
ignoring standards altogether.
