    Does that work the same as Valet by using separate parsers 
    for SGML/HTML and XML/XHTML, or have you developed/found a 
    parser that validates both?

sp does both Nick. Just needs the xml declaration prior to the instance,
then it uses XML syntax.
(Caution, I'm speaking about sp, rather than the opensp, but its probably
safe to assume that, unless someone knows differently?)

this is my batch file to run under windows, using sp.

SET SP_CHARSET_FIXED=YES
SET SP_ENCODING=XML


NSGMLS.EXE -wxml  -s -E10 -f .\errs -c /sgml/catalog  c:/sgml/bin/xml.dcl %1
type errs
SET SP_ENCODING=ISO-8859-1
SET SP_CHARSET_FIXED=NO
