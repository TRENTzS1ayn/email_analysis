Yes.  But, SP's XML support has a number of known limitations.  There's
some very brief documentation of them on the SP webpages.

SP is unmaintained.  OpenSP is merely SP updated and enhanced.

That'll give you exactly the same failures to validate XML as the
W3C validator (or WDG validator, arealvalidator, validator-lite),
plus a few more due to limitations which have been addressed in OpenSP.
I thought this subthread started when Carlos mentioned that
his product offered more accurate XML validation than that.
