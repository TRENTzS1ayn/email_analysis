    Yes.  But, SP's XML support has a number of known 
    limitations.  There's some very brief documentation of them 
    on the SP webpages.
Resolved by opensp?
    
    
    That'll give you exactly the same failures to validate XML 
    as the W3C validator (or WDG validator, arealvalidator, 
    validator-lite), plus a few more due to limitations which 
    have been addressed in OpenSP.
    I thought this subthread started when Carlos mentioned that 
    his product offered more accurate XML validation than that.

No, it answers the q at the top of this page.

Does opensp do sgml and xml. Clearly you don't need that info?
