MeddelelseGood Afternoon,
I work for an Organization that specializes in Section 508 services. We have
released a beta version of an add-in for Microsoft Excel to convert
spreadsheets into accessible Tables using customized styles to "tag" and
format cells within the spreadsheet according to table position and
identification of cells.  If anyone on the list is willing to try out the
add-in and offer any feedback, it would be appreciated.  My concern is that
through improper use of the customized styles, a user may believe that a
table is accessible when in fact, it may not have been styled correctly.

Please feel free to download the add-in at:
www.bartsite.com/batg/BartimaeusTableGenerator.zip .

We feel like this is a great tool for anyone to use and promote accessible
HTML throughout organizations.

If anyone on the lists feels that this is an inappropriate place to post
this. I apologize. This is being released at no charge and we genuinely want
the add-in to function well in any organization and be used as an
accessibility tool.

Thank you very much and, again, any feedback is welcome.
