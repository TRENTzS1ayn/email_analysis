Interesting.  I've just tried this with Mozilla 1.6 under Linux (my regular 
system) and the page displays fine.

Either:
1) Since Geoff looked, the compatibility, at least with Mozilla, has been fixed or
2) The browser sniffing is REALLY touchy.

Sounds like the F2 Network is in need of serious guidance.

Cheers
