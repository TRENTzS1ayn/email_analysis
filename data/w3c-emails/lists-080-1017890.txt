Dear Carl!

I guess your fonts choices are the best!

Though you should begin thinking about "Readability".

Here is an interesting link:

Kind regards,

John

P.S. If you have a minute, please visit the "Webnauts Net Accessibility and
Usability Initiative" forum at: http://www.webnauts.net/phpBB2/index.php A
lot of valuable links there....
