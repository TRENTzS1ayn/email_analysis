What is particularly galling is that f2 have made absolutely no effort to
provide a legible rendering for older browsers.  In Netscape 4.76  I get a
grey background with a lighter shade of grey text!  Totally illegible.
Fundamental solutions like basic CSS for the early browsers and @import for
the later browsers could have given me at minimum black text on a white
background.

I've never tested Opera's feature to Identify as Mozilla 4.7n - but at
least this renders it in black text on a white background.

We can only hope that a visually impaired reader of THE AGE in a seriously
influential position gives HREOC a call...  Like any of the Victorian State
Government Ministers or Departmental chiefs where the SOE is... Netscape
4.7n!

It reminds me of the flagrant disregard for standards Microsoft displayed
when they entered the browser market.  Does this mean f2's brazen breach of
accessibility standards will likewise crush the opposition ;-)
