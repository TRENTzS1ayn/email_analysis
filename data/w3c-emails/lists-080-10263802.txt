That's great (and no content extending off the page on the right hand
margin).

Lots of users aren't even aware of the print version page that comes with
most major CMS's.  They just print everything regardless from the UI they
are in.  A friend use to print their emails straight from the Yahoo screen,
until I showed her that there was a way to get a print version, but users
would be better served with proper use of print.css (as would Yahoo and all
the rest of them), which is better and more efficient design, easy to use
and enables the UI to be device independent.

Be great if you implement printing URLs in the print version too

 #content a:link:after, #content a:visited:after {
   content: " (" attr(href) ") ";
   font-size: 90%;
   }

designed print.css on news sites.

  After some initial teething probs on launch (and still some probs waiting
to be address with the index and sub index of theage.com.au site not calling
the print.css properly) all newly published articles on the age like this
one...

  http://theage.com.au/articles/2004/04/22/1082616268956.html

  ...do have a print stylesheet in place currently. we've hidden ads, main
navigation, and the right column from the print version... any thoughts on
the execution there appreciated
