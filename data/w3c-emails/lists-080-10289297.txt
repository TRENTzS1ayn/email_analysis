That's probably because its only accessed by a small icon that is
hidden out of the way.  Also, from my point of view, it means another
round of security warnings to cancel.

For any tolerably recent browser, the better solution is to use a print
media style sheet, as you suggest, so any special print version should
be a fallback.  Also, my main annoyance with printing pages without print
versions is that they often have fixed width layouts that are wider than
the printer (one can sometimes get around this by doing print-selected
on the real content, but that doesn't always work).  Anything that is
not directly printable because of its width is likely to not be usable
on older machines or unusual display configurations.

(Some people may do this for intellectual property protection, but I 
think that is mainly because designers don't think anyone might want
to print something to read away from the computer.)

I suspect one reason for hiding the print option is that the print
version is often easier to read than the display version (designer
doesn't get to show off and advertising is suppressed).
