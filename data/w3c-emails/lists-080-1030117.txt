I usually tend to have a single space as default value. It's unobtrusive
(as opposed to longwinded placeholders such as the ones you mention...sure,
you can use javascript to clear the input onfocus, but that won't prevent
Lynx users and co. from having to painstakingly delete the default value before
being able to enter their text), and the leading space character that may
be passed on as a result of this can easily be filtered out server-side
(for search boxes, it usually doesn't have any influence on the search results).

But yes, I'd like to hear other list members' opinions on the "single space"
solution (?)
