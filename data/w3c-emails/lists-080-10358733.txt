Universal Design of Technologies that Render Web Content

Browsers, Multimedia players and other technologies have an
important role in making web content accessible to people with
disabilities and providing all users with more options to
access and use web content.  But web rendering technologies do
not receive the same public attention as web content
accessibility techniques in making web resources more
accessible to people with disabilities.  The goal of this
special session is to explore how technologies that render web
content can be designed to make the web a more accessible and
usable place for people with disabilities.  This session
invites developers and researchers to submit papers on the
universal design, evaluation and usability of browsers,
plug-ins, multi-media players, voice browser, pervasive
computing technologies.
