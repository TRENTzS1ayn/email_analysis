While SVG doesn't have much facility for structuring text, and won't 
have word-wrap until version 1.2 is implemented (it is in the prototype 
tools, but not widely available since the specification is in working 
draft), there are simple ways of structuring text. One of the most 
obvious is to put anything beyond a label into HTML, using the 
foreignObject element.

Jonathan Chetwynd is collecting information on how to do accessibility 
in SVG on his Wiki: http://www.peepo.co.uk/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SVG
