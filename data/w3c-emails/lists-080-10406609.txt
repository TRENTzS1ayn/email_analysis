To take this thread back to its origin,
the author of http://www.pilot-link.org/ has
asked for accessible alternatives.

I've done a very straightforward one,
http://www.dpawson.co.uk/temp/pilot-link.html

1. Has anyone time to improve on that please, or suggest alternatives?

Since the guy asked, I felt obligued to try.
The easiest was removing all the workaround dross in the css file!
I guess mine is too simple for him.
  Looking for any improvements you might see.

For instance the nav table perhaps should be at the top.
Is there an approved navmap method?

TIA, regards DaveP
