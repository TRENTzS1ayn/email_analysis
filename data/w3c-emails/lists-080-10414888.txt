It's that time of year when you can vote for best sites on the web in
thirty categories at www.webbyawards.com  They don't have an
accessibility category, but they do have best practices and maybe it's
better not to separate out accessibility anyway.  I'd like to encourage
EASI folk to vote for sites that they find accessible.  Kathie
