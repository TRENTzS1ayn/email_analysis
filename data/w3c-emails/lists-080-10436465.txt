Hi,

Can anyone recommend or comment on the accessibility and usability of these
three web mail applications.

NeoMail
http://www.neocodesolutions.com/software/neomail/

SquirrelMail
http://www.squirrelmail.org/

Horde
http://www.horde.org/imp/

They are used in so many places.  I use Horde occassionally, which is used
by my current ISP.  I'm also interested in any type of feedback on these
products, it would be greatly appreciated.

Geoff
