Our organization uses SquirrelMail for web-based access, and Eudora or 
desktop access to email. The only accessibility that I've checked out is 
the ability to TAB between elements on the screen, which it does nicely. It 
is pretty straight-forward and user-friendly. Even our not-so-tech-savvy 
staff have had very little difficulty using it.
