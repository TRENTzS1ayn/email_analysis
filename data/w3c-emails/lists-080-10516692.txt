Choosing standardized icons was one of the issues we faced when building 
ATutor.  Though we found a few that seem relatively standard, such as a 
house for a home icon, and a magnifying glass for a search tool, many of 
the icons we used were picked because there was no better choice. One 
thing to keep in mind is that users learn to make the association 
between icons and the tools they represent relatively quick,despite the 
lack of standardization for these visual representations outside the 
application. While I think a small set of icons can be standardized, in 
a complex application like ATutor, there are many tools that will not be 
found on most sites, so representing them graphically in a standard way 
would be difficult. How to represent a course enrollment utility for 
example?

ATutor was built for the primary purpose of accomodating students with 
learning difficulties. It uses a variety of strategies for presenting 
the interface as well as structuring the content. It's also fully 
accessible, and free.

There's a demo and a download at:
