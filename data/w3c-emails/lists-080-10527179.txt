Hi David,

Here you have a very "good" example, maybe:
http://biblioteca.uc3m.es/PIB/formulario.htm

(The text is in spanish so... The question is that in the page they give
some instructions to filled the form. And the instructions say:  
The marked fields with [image] they must be filled.  
If the requested document is a magazine [image with another color], it
is obligatory the field year.) 

Regards,
Emmanuelle

Hi all!

I'm looking for a site that violates the convention of using text to
convey important information and instead uses color alone or at least
without text to convey important information.  In this case, I'm looking
for a form that does this or a form that when it validates results and
returns errors that does this.  Please point me to one if possible so
that I can test something.

Thanks!
