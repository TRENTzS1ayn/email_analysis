Hello All

Chris Ridpath of the evaluation and repair tool group  has been working 
hard at developing a web accessibility evaluation web service. We have 
implemented his Web service experimentally in the upcoming release of 
ATutor 1.4. The primary feature that set this accessibility checker 
apart from the others is its support for human descision making on 
potential barriers that automated checkers can not identify for certain.

We'd like comments on the utility from the experts, and the curious. 
There is a demo version of the upcoming ATutor release setup for review, 
and a download if you want to install your own copy on a local machine. 
Once logged into the preview release with the instructor account login 
"demo", and password "demo" find your way to the content editor by 
clicking "Add Content", or "Edit this Content", then open the 
Accessibility Tab to see how it works.

AChecker, as we call it, will eventually be available to all, so it will 
be possible to generate accessibility reports, and manage ongoing 
accessibility monitoring, from within a variety of Web applications to 
ensure that content stays accessible over time.

PS this demo will only be available for a couple weeks, after which the 
stable release of ATutor 1.4 will be available from our regular demo site.
