Thanks Mark,

Looking at the source and seeing all the js and styling, I figure something
is preventing rendering but just what is hard to diagnose for me.
Here's the output I get.
Untitled Document
images/index2_top1
images/index_ovl1
void(null)
void(null)
void(null)
And I noticed that it does say that there are errors on the page.

David

I don't have a screen reader to hand, but I'm guessing that it might be
something to do with the JavaScript. IE6 is generating errors, but still
rendering the page.

There does seem to be an awful lot of <script> included in the document - is
it all necessary? First impressions indicate that the page could be
streamlined significantly.

It might be an idea to post the output you are getting from your screen
reader. The chaps over at www.accessifyforum.com are excellent with screen
reader issues.
