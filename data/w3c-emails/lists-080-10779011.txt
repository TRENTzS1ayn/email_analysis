Well,  I see Macromedia (Dreamweaver?) Scripts and Behaviors.

Maybe I gave too much credit to the programming end.  If a graphic artist
was adventurous with dreamweaver.  That would explain where I was headed.
It looks like a great graphic artist's printed work with snazzy scripting
(easily inserted via dreamweaver?).
