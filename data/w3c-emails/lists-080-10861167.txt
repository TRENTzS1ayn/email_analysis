It gets better... Go to Google and search for "Mangosteen". Don't miss the 
"Sponsored Links" that Google comes up with:
         Sponsored Links
Mangosteen Sales Tools
The Original XanGo(tm)
I Have XanGo
XanGo Secret MLM System
Guaranteed $1275 a month

... this is a whole industry built around selling Mangosteen juice! <g> In 
fact, most of the industry seems to be geared towards selling sales tools: 
CDs, tapes, books, etc.

So maybe that special guide should be made available as one of the "Sales 
tools" on the "Mangosteen Sales Tools" site?

Sorry, I can't resist - the more I look, the better it gets!
