A couple of basics:

1. Add a DOCTYPE declaration on the first line of the code
2. Add ALT text to all images - either repeating the text within the 
graphic or expanding the wording
3. Div id="layer3" currently: height:461px; z-index:3; visibility: 
hidden;"> - make visible if that is the intention.  Note also that there 
are 2 instances of z-index:2
4. Is the scripting really necessary? Are layers 1 and 2 meant to be 
rendered and layer 3 not?
5. The form.  Add <label> tags

In a word - simplify.

this.

Thanks!
