1. Yes, look at accesskey but don't worry about tabindex unless you use 
some weird and complex positioning stuff.

2. Yes, you should group blocks of navigation links. Until browsers 
figure out how to do this better (IE is the standout on the very useful 
link element, and skipping navigation links without a nice structure 
and a "skip to main content" link are still not mainstream 
unfortunately).

3. Yes, let people know. Add "pop-up", or "new window" or something to 
the link text is my preference, but there is an argument to be made 
that putting this in the title is "informing the user".

cheers
