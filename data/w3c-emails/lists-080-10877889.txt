Hello all

when checking http://www.sheffield.gov.uk/plugins/education/ics/default.asp in JAWS 5 I noticed some strange behaviour using Firefox. On the first select box it JAWS reads out "minus <some enormous number> of zero". Using IE6 it reads out the correct "1 of 3" (or whatever it actually is).

Has anyone come across this before and if so any idea what's happening.

many tia
