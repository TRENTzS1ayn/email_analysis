Sure any screen reader should not crash, and most text should be available,
with any Windows application, but to "work with" is quite another story.
Someone referred to MSAA in this thread. In fact JAWS uses the IE DOM and
parses the HTML. More and more screen readers are accessing the private
information of the application. That wasn't true in my screen reader for
OS/2 days but it was essential to tailor the careen reader, to have made a
"profile," for any application you really wanted to use.

Hhmm... hadn't thought of that. Surely JAWS is *meant* to work with anything
that is text-based on a Win machine.

Is there a reader that is independent of MSSA that I could use as a test?
