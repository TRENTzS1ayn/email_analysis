Right. I believe that some other Windows screen readers are designed more
generally, to take maximum advantage of whatever accessibility stuff is in
Windows.

Talking to other screen reader developers, it seems that isn't as easy as
it should be :(

For many screen readers you can write a profile to get them working better
with whatever application you think of. But I would suggest that one of
the things to test is whether Firefox is putting information out to MSAA
properly, by checking with some MSAA-based system. (I don't know if there
is one, or if you'd need to look around for testing software. Aaron
Leventhal might have the answers you're looking for. He hangs out in
mozilla-accessibility).

cheers
