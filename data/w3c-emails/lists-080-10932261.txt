JAWS works best with IE (unfortunately) I have never had a problem with
Firefox on Windows or Linux but using JAWS with Firefox requires a
customised script for proper functioning. 

There may also be a bug in JAWS 5, my colleague prefers a previous JAWS
version because he has had some problems with the latest one, though I
can't remember them off the top of my head.
