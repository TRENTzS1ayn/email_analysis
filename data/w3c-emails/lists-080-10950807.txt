it's simply that freedom has not put support into jaws for anything but ie
on the browser front for quite some time I think the last netscape version
they actually supported was v 4.75.

If an application uses msaa, jaws or another msaa enabled screen reader
still has to hook into it with some work from the screen reader development
end.  If an application does not use msaa, this is still the case.  If an
application uses standard windows ui, it is highly possible that jaws will
work with it with maybe a tweek or two that a competent user can perform

JAWS works best with IE (unfortunately) I have never had a problem with
Firefox on Windows or Linux but using JAWS with Firefox requires a
customised script for proper functioning.

There may also be a bug in JAWS 5, my colleague prefers a previous JAWS
version because he has had some problems with the latest one, though I
can't remember them off the top of my head.
