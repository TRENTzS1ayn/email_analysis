I meant in HTML....currently they're all "together" in that they're 
positioned in the same section. Is there anything other than a <div> that I 
should be using to designate them as a group?

Well, if it was done in the title of a link, JAWS will read that title when 
it becomes active - right? That's the only user to whom notification of a 
new window would be quite important, in my opinion.
