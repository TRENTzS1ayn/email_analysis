Hi Matthew,

For this maybe can be usefull the Lynx Viewer
(http://www.delorie.com/web/lynxview.html) or the "Accessibility Tool
Bar"
(http://www.nils.org.au/ais/web/resources/toolbar/index.html#download).

Best regards,
Emmanuelle

Greetings All

I am trying to demonstrate to a client how various Web pages are
rendered with a 
linear, text-mode User Agent.  I feel that this would help him
appreciate why 
certain pages need changing and help him spot others that require
attention. 
(I'm not trying to get him to do any validation, just to get a feel for
the 
usefulness of a page of image links with no alt text and the like.)

I use Lynx for this myself (I work under Linux/XFree86), but don't want
to have 
to go setting up Cygwin on his Microsoft machine.  What I would really
like is a 
freely-distributable, text-mode, User Agent set up to run under Windows.
A 
single .EXE file would be preferable to a complex distribution that puts

libraries all over the place and interferes with the Windows Registry.

Anyone here have any experience with such a beast?

Cheers

M
