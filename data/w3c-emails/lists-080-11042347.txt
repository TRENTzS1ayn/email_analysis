True, but for me using a Windows machine, it has to be accessible on Windows and, to be honest Bob, that's all I'm worried about at the moment. Call me selfish but unless it works on my set up I can't put a lot of effort into thinking about it working on others. 

I don't understand this argument Bob. I'm talking about a client side application that is governend by the user's choice of operating system. The cross-platform aspect of web accessibility surely comes into play when ensuring that the server-generated content is not OS specific.

I obviously should have clarified things and asked for readers that are independent of MSAA but run on Windows. By your own criteria EMACspeak is not accessible either (unless someone has ported it to Win and Mac by now)
