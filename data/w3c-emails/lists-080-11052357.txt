Matthew,

The University of Illinois at Urbana/Champaign is developing
plug-ins for Internet Explorer and Mozilla to support improved
navigation and styling of content by people with disabilities.
 Another important use of these tools is to allow developers
to view and navigate content in ways that it may be by people
with disabilities.

>Greetings All

>I am trying to demonstrate to a client how various Web pages
are rendered with a 
>linear, text-mode User Agent.  I feel that this would help
him appreciate why 
>certain pages need changing and help him spot others that
require attention. 
>(I'm not trying to get him to do any validation, just to get
a feel for the 
>usefulness of a page of image links with no alt text and the
like.)
>
>I use Lynx for this myself (I work under Linux/XFree86), but
don't want to have 
>to go setting up Cygwin on his Microsoft machine.  What I
would really like is a 
>freely-distributable, text-mode, User Agent set up to run
under Windows.  A 
>single .EXE file would be preferable to a complex
distribution that puts 
>libraries all over the place and interferes with the Windows
Registry.

>Anyone here have any experience with such a beast?
