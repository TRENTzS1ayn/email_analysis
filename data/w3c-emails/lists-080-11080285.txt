Hi,

We had a discussion recently about the nature of datatables.

The question is, which html-elements and which contents are allowed inside a
data-table, too keep it as accessible and as flexible as possible.

And: Should text- structure elements be allowed (p, li, ul, ol)

i would say yes!

Images?

yes, why not? Imagine a Data-table containing the list of employees

Headlines?

hmmm...


Definitely forbidden:

Tables!


Please give me feedback and your opinion!
