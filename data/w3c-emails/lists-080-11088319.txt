Although I can't think of any instance off the top
of my had why I would want to have nested tables
(instead of, say, a complex data table), I'd be
interested to know why you consider them forbidden ?
If the whole thing linearises properly, and the nested
table is itself marked up properly, I'm not sure how it
would be problematic...

...although, thinking about it for a second, I'm not
sure what the behaviour of AT would then be with regards
to reading out relevant table headings, which may then
well be the answer to my initial question.
