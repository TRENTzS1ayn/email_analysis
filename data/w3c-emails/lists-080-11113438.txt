Of course the decision to go CSS-only or still keeping a tables for layout
is one that comes down to target audience. For instance, if you know from
server logs that a large chunk of your audience still uses version 4 browsers,
then it would be foolish to switch to a completely table-less layout. Sure, the
page would still be accessible - if less pretty - but depending on the audience
that may not be good enough. Consider for instance organisations - and believe
me they're still out there...I know a few -  that still use Netscape 4.x as the
default browser on their current default PC installations. It would obviously
never be acceptable if the web development team took an elitist approach
and made, say, the intranet completely table-less.
 
Know your audience, and don't design for one that might not exist for
your particular site.
