In accessibility, a table for fomatting a page is commonly referred to
as a layout table.  A table that marks up the structure of data in a
representative way (ie spreadsheets) is referred to as a data table.
Now, there are two types of data tables, simple and complex.  A simple
table consists of one set of headers for the entire table, these may be
column and row headers or just one of the two.  A complex data table
consists of multiple table headers where a data cell may be under one
set of headers but not another set.  (for an example see my complex
table at
http://mason.gmu.edu/~sdale1/PAF/ff/ )

It may be visually appealling to have a layout table inside a data table
cell, and I doubt this would cause a problem if the layout table was
linearized correctly.  CSS would perhaps be a better solution here.

I think if you were trying to put one data table inside another data
table, serious consideration ought to be done on what you are actually
trying to represent.  A properly marked up complex data table would be
easier to understand in a screen reader environment, where the table
headings pertaining to the cell would be read upon entering the cell.

Another point is that of consistancy.  One row of data might contain
different fields eg picture, name, link etc.  But each row should have
the same layout in a simple data table.
