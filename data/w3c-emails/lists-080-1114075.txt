Carl,

There are no standard Access Keys. Though I would not follow the accesskeys
of a certain country goverment, when I want my web site to have a global
access!
On the other hand, using letters for Access Keys could make your life
difficult, while letter Access Keys are limited.

Why? Have a look in my forum here:

Kind regards,

John
