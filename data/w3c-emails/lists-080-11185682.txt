Matthew:

1. With my _tech author_ hat on, I'd say each page's H1 should reflect its
specific subject rather than a collection ID. The collection is the web site
or sub-section of a site (and that or rather the home page should have the
appropriate H1 too.) If you are talking of programmatically making sense of
a web, then metadata is surely the way to go.

3. If by good practice, you mean usability, then yes. Going against commonly
used conventions (however stupid or inaccessible) confuses many people.
