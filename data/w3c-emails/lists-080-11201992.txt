In my view, that's also a reason why we shouldn't now try to set
artificial guidelines and requirements, mandating semantics for
HTML where there's none intended.

Again, HTML was never meant to have elements to identify collections
etc. Grafting any ad-hoc semantic convention on top of HTML is not
the way to go, in my opinion. Maybe it's time to look into XML proper
and a viable DTD/Schema that unequivocally stores that kind of information
and metadata consistently, and then using some transformation to make
it available in the limited vocabulary of HTML.

I'm with Lois on this one of course: if we're trying to expose
information to a piece of software, then certainly metadata is the
more appropriate way to go.

Perfectly fine. I tested this quite a while ago with JAWS, and
it correctly recognises that it's a heading and that it should
use the ALT of the image (e.g. when you get the screenreader to
show you the document structure / headings).

(see the comments at the end of 
http://www.mcu.org.uk/articles/alttext.html where I say pretty
much the same as above)

From a usability point of view, it makes sense and is recommended
practice (although purists will then argue that the logo should
be a link to the homepage *except* on the homepage itself, where
it should just be an image)
