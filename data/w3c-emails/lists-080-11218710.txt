The obvious answer is the list at http://www.w3.org/TR - which even 
classifies them according to whether they are Recommendations, Working 
Drafts, etc.

Here is some text I am writing for EuroAccessibility's evaluation 
methodology task for to consider - I'll send a pointer to the archive when 
I have finished the message and sent it. Note that it is a personal 
opinion written this morning, and the relevant group at EuroAccessibility 
hasn't seen it, much less agreed with it. And that is a step before I 
would suggest it to the WCAG group.

[[[
I think we need to provide (and maintain :-( a list of what we consider 
the relevant technologies. I would start with XHTML 1.0 Strict or XHTML 
1.1, CSS 1.0 (anticipating a move to 2.1 as soon as it is published as a 
Recommendation), MathML 2.0, PNG, SMIL 2.0, XML signature / encryption / 
decryption, XML Schema, XSLT, XSL, VoiceXML 2.0, P3P, ATAG 1.0 (where an 
application has an authoring component), UAAG 1.0 (where content provides 
an interface to reading other content, such as foafnaut does) PICS and 
RDF. In addition we should suggest SVG, EARL, SOAP 1.2, and keep an eye on 
the implementation status so we upgrade them as appropriate.
