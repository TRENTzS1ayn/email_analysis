That's an abuse of legend.  Legend is for grouping form controls.  It
is basically a platform native user interface component (which is one
reason why it has limited capability in IE).  In its original use, the
intention was to have just one or two words.

Same for your very long lines!  text/plain email is not intended to be
word wrapped, there are specific MIME formats for that.
