Joe,

It has nothing to do with verbosity settings. His recommendations are
absolutely right on; every one. He did mention putting main content near the
top because "the thing I hated the most was having to blast past five
hundred links in a sidebar in order to get to the actual content." I am
impressed with how well this guy understood the problems of listening to web
content. Very unusual.

Bloggeur tries out IBM Home Page Reader and shares tips. He should 
learn about verbosity settings, though.
