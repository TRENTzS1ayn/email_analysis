Jim,

    This guy seemed to actually use the screen reader instead of trying to
test something with it.  Indeed that is very unusual.  He suddenly was
keenly aware of the problems and not trying to just get his website by
with the minimum amount of work needed.

     True, he may be right on from a blind user's recommendations.  He
still misses the mark for most mobility impaired users who would like
the use of skip navigation that he so elequently stated as useful but
hidden.  Hmmmm not getting my point?  What was his complaint about
hidden in CSS...  If you can't see the skip navigation while using a
switch as input you cannot use it and therefore are stuck yet again. 
Accessibility, though very beneficial to blind users, should be
available to ALL users.

-Steve
