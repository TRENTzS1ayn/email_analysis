Hi,

Related to some comments here and screen readers response to visibility: 
none. With JAWS visibility:hidden works to hide text from the browser 
display while the screen reader picks up the text and voices it (not true 
of visibility:none). Can anyone tell me if this true for IBM HPR and Window 
Eyes?

thanks,
Steph
