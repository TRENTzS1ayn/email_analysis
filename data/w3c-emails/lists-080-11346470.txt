Hi Steph,

I am using JAWS 4.51 and for me visibility:hidden hides the text from JAWS.
Visibility:none is not valid style but display:none is. Display:none hides
the text from JAWS for me. Both Visibility:hidden and display:none hide the
text from both Window-Eyes (4.5) and HPR (3.02) as well. My test file is
http://jimthatcher.com/test/visibility.htm. Bottom line, both
visibility:hidden and display:none hide JAWS, Window-Eyes, and HPR on my
machine.

Jim

Hi,

Related to some comments here and screen readers response to visibility: 
none. With JAWS visibility:hidden works to hide text from the browser 
display while the screen reader picks up the text and voices it (not true 
of visibility:none). Can anyone tell me if this true for IBM HPR and Window 
Eyes?

thanks,
Steph
