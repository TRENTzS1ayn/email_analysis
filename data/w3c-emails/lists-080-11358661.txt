Hi Jim,

Thanks for testing this. So, as far you know, is there a safe way to hide 
something visually in CSS but have it visible to a screen reader? We have a 
number of web applications that are for financial folks here at MIT and the 
developers are   always looking for a clever way to give cues to screen 
reader users that may not be necessary for sighted users, mainly because 
the extra information creates additional "noise" in these apps -- many of 
which are already jam packed with information.

thanks,
steph
