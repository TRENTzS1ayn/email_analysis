One question.

He mentions the particular problem of punctuation marks being spoken if 
they are outside the links. If these commas are inside the link, they 
cause pauses. If they are outside the link, they are spoken as the word 
"comma."

apples, bananas, and tomatos.

I've come across this problem before but left it due to the 
recommendation for "non-link characters between adjacent links." My 
assumption would be that this is a behavioral error in the reader. It 
seems to me that, in both cases, the comma should cause a pause instead 
of being spoken. Am I wrong?

Can the verbosity settings be specified this accurately? Does anyone 
bother? What is the reason that it is not this way by default?

James
