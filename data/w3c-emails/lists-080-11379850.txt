Position it off screen. Where id="skipLink", you can use this CSS:

#skipLink {
   position: absolute;
   left: -999px;
   top: 0;
   width: 10px;
   }

Of course, Mr. Clark would disagree with this method, saying skip links 
should be visible to sighted keyboard users, too. This will also raise 
awareness for accessibility concerns... Did I capture your intention 
correctly, Joe?

Good luck Stephani,
James
