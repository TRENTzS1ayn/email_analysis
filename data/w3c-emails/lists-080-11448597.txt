Jim,
Your results are correct, but you're generalizing a little.
visibility:hidden and display:none do hide the content, but not when applied
in all possible ways.  You can apply these styles in the <style> element,
inline, or in an external stylesheet.  The external stylesheet can be
referenced via the link element or using @import.  The results are not the
same.

I have done a set of tests (am missing some data on HPR 3.02). My test file
is at:
