Unfortunately (?) a lot of designers will want the skip link to be
both present and unobtrosive (as the whole display:none
versus visibility:hidden debacle seems to indicate). An addition,
I would also implement at least two stylesheets: one with the "hidden
until tabbed to" skip link styles, and one with the skip link visible
all the time.

I'm not saying that this is the best solution, or the only one...
just trying to throw some ideas around.
