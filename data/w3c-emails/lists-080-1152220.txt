10.1 - Until user agents allow users to turn off spawned windows, do not
cause pop-ups or other windows to appear
and do not change the current window without informing the user.  Priority 2

Given that user agents now DO ALLOW users to turn off spawned windows (eg Opera 7) is this checkpoint met when a new window is spawned
provided that the user is informed (eg as a TITLE="This link opens in a new window" attr in the A tag and information placed  to the right of the link
 on screen)?

REASON we are aiming for AA compliance and together with PDF content with no text alternative (checkpoint 1.1), 10.1 is the only other barrier.
I've been through the w3.org accessibility mail list and the question of accessible PDFs is not answered with any clear authority.

The following site http://hnb.dhs.vic.gov.au/ds/disabilitysite.nsf/pages/aboutsite#awd
claims AAA conformance having PDFs with no text alternative - is the "qualification"
provided in the above link valid (written by a member of the WAI Accessibility Guidelines working group)?
If we were to ape their information provided and functionality could we likewise make the same claim to conformance to 1.1?
