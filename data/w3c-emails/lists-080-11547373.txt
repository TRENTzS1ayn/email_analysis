Interestingly enough, as soon as I sent you my last email, I
sort of came up with a similar possible scenario myself. Thanks
for the clear explanation.

In that case I would suggest (IMHO, of course) that this particular
user may be best served by selecting the "accessible" (as much as I
hate the word) stylesheet which makes everything visible (and, in
addition, could expand acronyms/abbreviations and write out all
accesskey definitions via CSS :before and :after). Sure, in an
ideal world the default style of a site should already do this, but
this more often than not clashes with aesthetic sensibilities of
designers and/or clients...
