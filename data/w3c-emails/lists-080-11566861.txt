Greetings

Does anyone have any experience or comments about the use of HTML frames in a 
"cloaking" application?

To explain:  Various DNS (Domain Name Service) providers and domain registrars 
offer a "Web Forward" service allowing the use of free Web hosting, such as 
Yahoo's Geocities, to have a "real" URI.

Examples: Someone visiting www.foo.bar may actually be going to 
www.geocities.foo/bar

One means of doing this is to use frames to "cloak" the real URI.  This uses a 
frameset, which provides the required title, with a single full-screen frame, 
which provides the content.

Lynx has no problems with frames, although I have yet to test this properly, but 
how would it affect screen readers?

Cheers

M
