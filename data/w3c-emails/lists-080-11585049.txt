Greetings

I am working on a Web front end for a database.  I create a page containing a 
list of record titles.  These titles are links to edit the corresponding record.

Each link lives in the <li></li> of a <ul>.

Some tools say that a separator character is still required between adjacent links.

My question is:  are there really any user agents out there which will try to 
run the contents of two <li></li>s together so that a separator character is 
really required?  I would have thought that having the links as separate list 
items should be enough and that also the best way to handle a list of links is 
in a list!

Cheers

M
