The typical Windows interface convention for this would be to use
a pulldown list (although there is no guaranteed way of achieving that
in HTML as radio buttons are a valid rendering of select).  As such,
having a fieldset for a single field doesn't make much sense.

The typical use of radio buttons is where there are other controls associated
with some of the radio buttons.

Fieldset legends are normally nouns or very short noun phrases.  If the
overall page is about favourites, here, then it would be simply "colour",
otherwise "favourite colour".

What's wrong with <p>?   If you only want one selection read out by 
default, you should definitely be using select, as the other reason for
using radio buttons is to stress the complete list of choices.
