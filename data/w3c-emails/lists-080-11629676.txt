  A list of links is indeed the best way to handle a menu - yes.
  Structurally there would be no need for a separator I'd think, but
  visually ... it is easy to imagine a situation in which such a list,
  whilst still structurally a list, is rendered differently - say with
  each list item adjacent to eachother on a line.

  If any assistive technology now makes use of the structure there is no
  problem. However, if it simply enlarges the visual screen ... then it
  might be difficult to tell these list items apart.

  I'd suggest using a list for menu items, and put a "," between each.
  As always, it is impossible to predict how ALL UAs and ATs would
  behave.
