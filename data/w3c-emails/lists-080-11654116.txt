Just a question :
If that links have to be hidden, why not put it on an invisible pixel like 
that :
<a href="#content"><img src="nul.gif" alt="skip to content" width="1" 
height="1"></a>

Do you think it's a good way ?

All Screenreaders will see it, lynx too.

In France we suggest this way to hidde links to developpers.
