ATutor 1.4 Release

ATutor 1.4 has been released. ATutor is a Open Source Web-based Learning Content Management System (LCMS) designed with accessibility and adaptability in mind.

*Roles & Privileges: Create teaching assistants or additional instructors, or assign instructor privileges to students  

*Test Module Updates: Automatically marked tests and random question tests now available

*Learning Objects Repository: Search the TILE learning objects repository, and import content packages directly into ATutor by entering a URL. Create content in ATutor, then export it to the TILE repository to share with others

*Accessibility Checker: Evaluate content with the content editor's accessibility checker to ensure it conforms with international accessibility standards

*Work Groups: Use the ACollab addon for conducting group activities within ATutor courses. Archive resources in the Library, collaborate on document authoring or collect assignments through the Drafting Room, schedule tasks and events with the Calendar, communicate with group members, and more (also available as a standalone application). ACollab will be available in the coming weeks.
