It is wonderful to see some real user-centred research going on in this 
area.  I'm sure many of us have are concerned about the lack of solid 
user research to help apply WCAG guidelines in the most usable way.

And I share Charles' surprise about the reaction to pronunciation issues 
mentioned in the summary of some of Ginny Redish's studies.  I'd have 
though most people reading this list would have some experience of 
screen readers, even if only the evaluation version of HPR or through 
observing other folks using them.

"Skip to content (happy)" has always been an annoyance, along with 
"hommaparj" (so I always avoid writing it as one word).  But I like the 
way JAWS pronounces my stupid university system username "dalexand" - 
humans at work refer to it as "dee alexand (emphasis on the second 
syllable)", whereas it sounds like the name of one of santa's reindeers 
when JAWS says it.  Or maybe I have a gin too many already today :)

Cheers,
Dey (pronounced Dee, not Day - humans AND JAWS usually get this one wrong)
