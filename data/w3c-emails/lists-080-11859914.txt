Can you explain to me why we NEED scripting?

Before you answer, eliminate all the scripts that can be handled in an
otherwise accessible manner.  I mean the two major reasons that I know of
for scripting are rollovers (can be done much nicer with CSS) and
showing/hiding text/images/links which are a major accessibility disaster.

So, what am I missing here?  why do we need scripts?
