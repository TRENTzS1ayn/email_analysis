Matthew Smith replies:

If we're talking of the original topic here (Accessible Road Maps, as opposed to 
Accessibility of Scripting in general), my experiences so far with the MapServer 
system suggest an Accessible system can be produced and without needing (client 
side) scripting.  I intend to do a proof-of-concept on this when I get the time.

In general terms, I would say that client side scripting can be convenient for 
in-form calculation and pre-submission form validation - but is non-essential 
unless, perhaps, one is delivering a networked application (to run client side) 
through the Worldwide Web.  I am thinking here of scripting in a page working 
with the Java LiveConnect class.

Cheers

M
