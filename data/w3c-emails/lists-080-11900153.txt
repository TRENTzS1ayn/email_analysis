The problem is that there are many people in the "accessibility value
chain", a term we use to describe the whole endeavor of accessibility, which
includes AT manufacturers, mainstream technology engineers, salespeople,
retail clerks, etc.: everyone involved in getting the product designed,
delivered, and supported.  

Most of the people in this chain have important roles, (procurement
officials, web design RFP writers, etc.), but do not have the spare cycles
to absorb the entire world of accessibility.  Instead of expecting them to
become experts, we should lower our expectations.  They should get only the
training they need to do their jobs.  But there is a trade-off: the
***organization as a whole*** must be made fully competent.  That means that
for each job category in the accessibility value chain, there must be
clearly interlocking "policies and procedures" on accessibility, and the
training that goes with them.

Not at all by coincidence, our training program is customized:

by industry or product category (web, telecom, computer hardware, etc.)
by organization type (company, state agency, consumer advocacy group)
by job responsibility (engineering, marketing, customer support, etc.)

We find that this works well, once you get the organizational commitment.
Basically, it creates a "bureaucratic model" (in the positive sense) instead
of a dysfunctional "clone the expert" model of information dissemination.
It's easier to get the commitment from the organization if you can show that
the training and implementation will be economical and proportionate to the
issue.
