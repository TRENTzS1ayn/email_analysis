Remember that HTML and thus the web were created in deliberate rejection
of more sophisticated tools...

Phill replies:
I view HTML's purpose a little differently and I believe it has evolved. 
For example, events such as onClick, onKeyPress, etc are actually part of 
the HTML spec [see note 1].  I had thought they were part of the 
JavaScript spec but they are not! 

David continued with:
Most web sites nowadays are computer programs, not documents, and attempt
to override the viewing tool's user interface.

Phill replies:
That is exactly Matt's point.  You seem to be supporting his argument. 
Many WAI individuals have focused on "banning" interactivity of web sites 
created from events and scripting that now we are late coming up with 
better techniques and specs to solve the problems.  Same thing happened 
over a decade ago when command line PC DOS applications were replaced with 
Window GUI's.
