>why do we NEED client side scripting?

One example why we need client side scripting is the same reason we need 
client side image maps - so the processing is done on the client and not 
on the server - saves processing time to not have to go to the server for 
everything each time.  What does this have to do with disabilities - 
nothing unless the configuration doesn't handle client side scripting. In 
other words it is a configuration issue - not a disability issue. 

We need to remember that there is also a W3C WAI User Agent Accessibility 
Guidelines (UAAG) - and that browser and assistive technology 
configuration needs to be compliant as well.

> Can someone give me an example that requires Client Side Scripting while 
remains accessible when the scripting
is used?

Some of this confusion may be in the term "accessible".  Jimthatcher.com 
[note 2] discusses some examples that are perfectly supported with 
properly configured assistive technology & browsers and create no 
disability barriers. The ibm.com/able guidance [note 1] for scripting is 
also useful.  For example, checking the required fields in a form on the 
client before sending the data to the server is common and creates no 
disability issues.  Scripts that add interactive visual highlighting 
(onMouse over's) improve usability and benefit the learning disabled. 
Notice I didn't use the term "accessible" in the sentences.

So, if the application or situation requires quicker throughput,  better 
ease of use, etc. then client side processing is the answer.  In other 
words, that is why it was invented, to reduce the burden on the server.
