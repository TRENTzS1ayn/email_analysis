I am not sure that this question is really relevant.  I think a more 
important question is "should we be restricting people's choices of 
different technologies in the name of accessibility when those 
technologies can be used to create accessible interfaces."  It's not our 
job to ask people to prove that they HAVE to do something one way over 
another.  It's our job to realistically look at all technologies out 
there that people WILL use, and come up with ways for them to use them 
accessibly.  Pandora's box is open, we are not going to be able to put 
scripting back and shut the lid - so we better help people understand 
the choices they have in HOW they implement scripting.

My three cents.
