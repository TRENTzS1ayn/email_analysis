And this is a mandatory requirement?  It is not NEEDED,  granted it could
be helpful, but the question was and still is why is it NEEDED?

The configuration may be valid on PC UAs, but what about Cell Phones and
PDAs?  There is not much memory available to bloat the UAs so that
frivoless features can be made accessible.

This is a good case of not NEEDED but useful.

This can be done via CSS giving the user the ability to easily modify the
highlighting color using their own stylesheets.

Another way to limit the burden of the servers is to limit access to
websites for those with disabilities.
