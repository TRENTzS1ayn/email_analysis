Hey, there.

OK, just a quick response.  We are not talking about amateurish uses of 
scripting here - these are exceptionally talented web applications 
developers who are using scripting in very creative ways.  It's not our 
place to tell them HOW to do their job - it's only our job to tell them 
HOW TO DO IT ACCESSIBLY.  These guys are using scripting to make the 
lives of people with and without disabilities easier.  One example is 
partial-page refresh, which is done with scripting and forms submittal.  
Blind users, at least, who have tested it agree that our partial-page 
refresh actually makes their lives easier - they don't lose focus, and 
their screen readers work well with it. Other customers, without 
disabilities, agree that partial page refresh rocks.

Again, I think your focus is way off here.  We should not be in the 
business of telling people what to use, but to tell them how to use /all 
/their choices accessibly.  From there, they will make the right choice 
according to the myriad of other requirements that come into play for 
their products/sites in addition to accessibility.

Cheers,
-Kerstin

p.s.   Using your analogy, I think you are the one trying to say, 
"because I told you so."  In other words, you are the one being the 
dominating parental figure by telling people simply "not to eat any 
candy at all!" instead of educating them about what over-indulgence in 
sugar can do to the body, appetite, energy, etc.. and giving them the 
choice of informed moderation (just to take the analogy a little further).
