Except it does in practice, as it is common for the form actually 
submitted not to be the form that is completed by the user or for the
control that triggers the submission not to be a control that would
naturally trigger the submission.  Basically this is complicated because
it tends to be associated with a desire to re-write the browser's user
interface behaviour.

Except when the home page is a browser sniffing page that comes up blank
without scripting.  Moreover, there are declaritive ways of doing 
reasonable mouseover effects on text, and if they are desirable feedback
cues, they ought to be built into the browser's standard behaviour.
(Image mouseovers tend to slow down load times on pages that are already
too slow to load.)

I'm not convinced that that is why Netscape invented it.  I'm pretty
certain that the IE extensions to the original Netscape scripting aren't
intended for that purpose.  Certainly only a small proportion of scripting
in the field is for validation.  Most of it is to create user interface
behaviours, i.e. to extend or replace the browser's user interface.

I'd believe the server loading issue more if sites didn't do things that
made static images and pages uncachable, as a matter of policy.
