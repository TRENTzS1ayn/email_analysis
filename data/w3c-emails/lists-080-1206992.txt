Hello,

I think it is great to give an accesibility course.

http://cita.rehab.uiuc.edu/courses/2003-09-REHAB711NC/index.html
mentioned by Jon Gunderson validates as html 4.01 transitional, but not
as 4.01 strict.  e.g. the map element  used for the navigationbar is a
problem.

See http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/conform.html: 4.1 Definitions under
authors:
We recommend that authors write documents that conform to the strict DTD
rather than the other DTDs defined by this specification. Please see the
section on version information for details about the DTDs defined in
HTML 4.

I also refer to the recent thread "Links from Yvette" on the WAI-GL
list. This concerns  e.g. an example  with the <map>-element  from
http://www.w3.org/WAI/wcag-curric/sam105-0.html  This example does not
validate as xhtml 1.0

With so many versions of xhtml and html I think all the
WAI/WCAG-examples should always be validated for every new dtd and new
valid examples added when needed.

Should n't all the accessibility coursess always teach at least html
4.01 strict as this is also used  as a base for xhtml and discourage the
use of html 4.01 transitional. (also seen the above conform.html text)?

With so many versions of xhtml and html I think all the
WAI/WCAG-examples should always validated for every new dtd.

greetings
Ineke van der Maat
