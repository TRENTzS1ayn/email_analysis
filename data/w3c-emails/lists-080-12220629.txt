Where is the guideline that requires supporting ALL possible configurations.  Do you also make the argument that all new MAC software must work on an Apple II?  And let's not limit this to the MAC platform.  Perhaps all new PC software should be required to work on a Commadore 64 or PC running an 8086 chip as well as it does on a PC using a P4 chip or the manufacturer should be hauled into court.  Wonder if this would have any impact on software development.

We are dealing with a WORLD WIDE WEB. and I emphisize the WORLD WIDE part.
in many parts of the world people especially people with disabilities have
very limited bandwidth and service and cannot afford to deal with the HUGE
resources required to use the more "modern" browsers.  in at least one
contact (an independent living center) I have in Nicaragua they are still
linked to the web with a Apple II, and an acoustic coupler.  can you even
support scripting at 1200 baud???  (offered em a newer modem but the
telephone lines wouldn't handle it)

THESE people need access to the web maybe even more than we do.

and we must continue to support thier access.
