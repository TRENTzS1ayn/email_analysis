Understood, and grateful they should be to have any access in San Juan de
LiMay, Nicaragua.  There are many areas on the planet where the WORLD wide
web is not available and people die everyday that may have been saved if
there was access.  Who should pay to run the phone lines to these people, or
pay for wireless access and hardware and training.  Then again, who paid to
upgrade my lines, my PC, the training I have, the added fees for slow
connections to poor sites I lived through in the early 1990's?  Why do you
think a VW Beetle should keep pace with a Ferrari?  Perhaps you need to
focus on the fact that the VW gets you on the highway, which is far more
than many others have.

yes, in the teaming metropolis of San Juan de LiMay Nicaragua the sole
doctor uses a very slow internet link (frequently the voice phones are
unusable) if the phone line is very clean I think he can get 2400 baud to
consult with the nearest hospital about 3 hours away via very lousy roads.

in the past, many of his patients died!   this is not an accessibility
issue but it is an important point to consider when this guy or thousands
like him around the world are trying to get information from modern
hospitals and libraries that are not even a dream.

recently a local bus slid off the road and down a steep embankment, about
a dozen were killed many seriously injured, this guy was the only link to
anything resembling real medicine.

no cell phones, no PDA's nothing but a laptop and a barely adequate phone
line was all that seperated several people from death.

no in the past, these people just died... there is more to the web than
what we here in the advanced countries like as convienences

.do you also enhance the telephone lines in the entire world?
.do you also buy and maintain thousands of obsolete computers in the 3rd
world
. who trains all these people in how to use this fancy stuff.
. and who pays for the web time when they are billed by the second for all
the extra fluff.

or maybe to enhance their ability to actually link to the web

but the Lynx developers are providing the browser that their particular
customers need or want. otherwise they would be using mozilla or IE or
whatever bloated browser they get stuck with, there are real valid reasons
for chosing a lean/robust browser.

now the above is not directly linked to accessibility except that it has
probably saved many many people from disability and/or death in areas of
the world where people with disabilities are considered less than human.

sorry for beating  this to death but it can be a matter of life or death
