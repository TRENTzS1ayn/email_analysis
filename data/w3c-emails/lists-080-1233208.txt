There is a standard here, which is the rel attribute, as applied to the 
link or a element - it means that a user can expect their browser to 
provide a consistent way of navigating important links that is part of 
the browser.

Accesskey provides a mechanism for extending that in a particular way - 
identifying the controls used on a particular page that are frequent 
navigation stops (login, current status, top of the page, find the 
nearest physical contact, cheapest option are all candidates in work I 
am currently doing, which is quite different to the ones I wanted to 
have a year ago).

In situations where people are using different keyboards, and making 
millions of websites, it seems hard to pick the 40 or so most common 
keys and functions. When I use the arabic keyboard I don't have the 
unicode characters "0123456789" readily available, nor any of the 
letters "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz", so anything that relies on those 
to make life easier doesn't work. (But I have control characters 
available, which means I can use system-standard shortcuts).

If there is a convention compatible with what you need then using it is 
better than creating something different. But there are limits to what 
can be achieved...

cheers
