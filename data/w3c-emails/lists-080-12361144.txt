Hmmmmm,  I hear much whining and emotional reasons for WANTING client side
scripting.  My original question was and still is: Do we NEED client side
scripting?  Is there just one example of using client side scripting to
solve a problem which cannot be solved in an alternative manner and does
the use of the script not cause any accessibility issues accross the board
of all Web Accessibility issues?

I am not saying that client side scripting should be banned, but, should
be treated as an optional enhancement to the webpage.  This should only be
used to enhance the end user's experience PROVIDED that the capability
exists on the end user's system and the end user's ability.  I think it is
obvious from the responses in this thread that even the accessibility
experts here want to code freely with scripts.  Now, if the accessibility
experts want this, imagine what web page hackers will do....  We need to
DISCOURAGE MANDATORY use of scripts by the end user viewing a webpage.

Again, I have yet to receive one example of client side scripts solving a
problem that cannot be solved alternatively and is fully accessible.
