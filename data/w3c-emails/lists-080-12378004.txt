Well then Joe, give the guy the answer he seeks - one example of a client
side script which solves a problem that cannot be done in a different, more
accessible manner.  If you cannot, then your position cannot be defended -
put up or ....

It's not that JavaScript itself is evil, only indiscriminate usage of it is.
Too often we see poor to horrid uses of JavaScript which cause
usability/accessibility issues - and this you cannot deny.  So Steven simply
asks - put forward a good reason to encourage and maintain client side
scripting.  Once this has been defended (if it can be) we need to ensure
that good, accessible examples exist so that the teaching mandate of WCAG
may be advanced.

<challenge>
But don't just sit there and say you know better 'cause you wrote a book.
Defend your response - these one-line toss offs do nothing for any of us.
