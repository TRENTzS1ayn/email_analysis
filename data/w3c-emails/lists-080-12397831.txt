CSS should NOT be MANDATORY either.  It is an enhancement to the viewing
of a webpage IF the end user's system supports it.  CSS is a very powerful
accessibility ENCHANCEMENT that, if used properly, would allow the end
user to customize the display.  Try changing the color scheme (without
losing information) on a non CSS webpage for someone who needs high
contrast yet still wants a color display.
