Sure Andrew,  When you deposit money into your bank account at the branch,
what do you do before seeing the teller?  You complete a deposit slip.  Is
the deposit slip a process?  No, the teller does the work.  Same with the
online bill payment.  The web is a form (document) to gather information
to hand to a program (on the back end) to work with.
