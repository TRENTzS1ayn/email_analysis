 I would disagree here.  A web page can be a document, it can just as
easily be an application.  If we consider that page == file then the
point is well made, but if page == URI then the browser, while being
capable of displaying simple files, can be seen as an output device for
whatever lives at that URI.

As a guideline we need to recommend practices for making accessible
experiences for both of these cases by not limiting our focus to a
single technology, e.g. html, but to any technology used for URI
addressable 'content'.

We are not talking about programs here, we are talking documents.  I
think this is the crux of the scripting problem.  A WEBPAGE IS A
DOCUMENT NOT A PROGRAM.  If you want networking applications, write a
program.  If you want to convey information, use the web.
