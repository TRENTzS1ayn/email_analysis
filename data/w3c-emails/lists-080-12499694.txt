It sounds like you are drawing a distinction of statefullness as the
criterion of a 'program'.  Yes?

Ok what exactly is a webapp?  What program would you write using
javascript+html?  All I hear from this list is that we need it to do 
javascript+fancy
rollovers and dynamic menuing,  Partial page updates, form validation. 
Are these webapps?  I dont think so.

Ok to firm up my point.  Have you used Instant Messaging?  That's a
networked program, not a web app.  Sure there are some web interfaces to
IM but they are interfaces not programs either.
