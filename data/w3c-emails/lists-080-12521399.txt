Well, sort of.  I am thinking more of independant processing on the client
side.  For example, Instant Messaging runs on the client system and sends
information to another client system.  The Instant Messaging software does
processing on the clients system.  Whereas, displaying a form on a browser
window and sending the data to the server is not *really* doing any
processing of the data.  The form is there for collection, what processing
that is being done is done solely to send the data, maybe correct data if
verified on client, to the server.
