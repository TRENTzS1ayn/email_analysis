Most commercial web authors don't want to convey information.  They want to
promote a brand and possibly take orders.  Trying to find information about
a product, beyond a small photograph, can be an awful lot of work.  If you
want to provide tools that meet commercial wants, you will need to
design them on this basis, not on the basis that they should be good at
conveying information.
