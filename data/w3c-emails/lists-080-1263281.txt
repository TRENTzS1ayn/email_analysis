Since this is off-topic from the list, I'll just post a quick question, 
and ask people to reply back to me personally (keeping the list clear).

I'm looking to speak with those who've been beta testing Office 2003, and 
may have some knowledge about how it fares in concert with JAWS, ZoomText, 
and other Assistive Tech. If you've noted any basic compatibility issues, 
those comments would be welcome as well.

We're trying to put together a set of recommendations, and we want to be 
ready should our campus make a move towards Office 2K3.

Thanks for all of the help, and happy Labor Day (for those of us in the 
US). For everybody else, happy end of August.
