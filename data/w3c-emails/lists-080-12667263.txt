This is essentially because designers start from the point of view that
they (their customer) want(s) a particular appearence and so:

- do whatever achieves that appearence without thinking of the document
  structure - they use HTML as a graphical toolkit, not a document 
  language;

- even if they could produce a reasonable document structure, insist that
  back version browsers produce the same (branded) appearence as current
  browsers, rather than producing a generic styling.
