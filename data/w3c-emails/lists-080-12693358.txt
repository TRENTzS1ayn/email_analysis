The HTML specification doesn't require scripting.  If it did require
scripting, it would have to specify both a scripting language and
a set of object models, otherwise the scripting still wouldn't work
as a Perl only browser would not work with a VBScript script and 
a Netscape JavaScript object model browser wouldn't work with a W3C
DOM Level 2 object model application.

(More generally, a lot of things that people think that HTML specifies
are just informative hints on how a visual browser might handle a 
construct - there is actually no requirement that all semantics be
represented to the user, and the most popular browser would be one of
the "one or two" broken ones if there were such a requirement.)
