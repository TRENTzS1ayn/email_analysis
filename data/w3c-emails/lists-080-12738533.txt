Dear WAI Interest Group Participants:

Registration is now open for the WAI-TIES Web Accessibility Best Practices 
Exchange Training on 6 July 2004 in Paris, France. The training precedes 
the ICCHP 2004 conference. The facility is provided by Universit? Pierre et 
Marie Curie and additional logistical help is provided by BrailleNet.

The hands-on Web accessibility evaluation training will be held in English 
and will cover the following topics:

- An overview of resources that are available to help carry out an 
evaluation review
- Detailed directions on evaluating links, tables, on-line forms, images, 
and scripts
- Evaluation and repair of sample Web pages using automated tools and 
manual reviews

There is no registration fee for the training; however, pre-registration is 
required. There are a limited number of spaces, which are available on a 
first-come, first-served basis. Registration will close when spaces are filled.

Detailed information and required pre-registration is available from:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/2004/07/training.html

This message may be circulated to other lists; however, please avoid 
cross-postings where possible.

Regards,

Shadi Abou-Zahra
