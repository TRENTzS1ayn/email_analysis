Conventional accessibility research has tended to be single disciplinary 
in nature. However, we are concerned that this focus on a single 
participant group prevents the crosspollination of ideas, needs, and 
technologies from other related but separate fields. This special issue 
will be decidedly cross-disciplinary and will bring together users, 
accessibility experts, graphic designers, and technologists from 
academia and industry to address how accessibility can be supported. 
Submissions should aim to bridge academia, commerce, and industry and we 
hope that arguments encompassing a range of beliefs across the 
design-accessibility spectrum will be forthcoming. This issue aims to 
address layout, structure, and presentation from the viewpoint of 
accessible hypermedia, multimedia, and good visual design. It is part 
inspired by the most recent workshop (http://w4a.man.ac.uk) on web 
accessibility that was held at the World Wide Web Conference (New York, 
USA, May 2004). To follow up on this workshop, this special issue 
attempts to focus on a number of critical issues listed below that were 
in the focus of the workshop. However, the spectrum of possible topics 
is not limited to these areas. The guest editors welcome any archival 
quality work related to accessible hypermedia and multimedia.

* Technological advances to support accessible hypermedia and multimedia.
* End user tools for accessibility.
* Design methodologies for accessible hypermedia and multimedia.
* Accessibility evaluation techniques and tools.
* Accessibility evaluation guidelines.
* Adaptive applications and graphics.
* Tools and techniques enabling authors to create accessible 
layout/content.
* Psychology of end user experiences and scenarios.
* Innovative scripting/markup languages that support accessible 
hypermedia and multimedia.
* Universally accessible graphical design approaches.
* Graphical transcoding techniques.
* Accessible graphic formats and tools for their creation.

Please contact the Guest Editors if you have any questions on the scope 
of the call or require further information.

NRHM is a refereed journal covering research on practical and 
theoretical developments in hypermedia, interactive multimedia and 
related technologies. Two issues a year review and explore a topical 
theme from diverse perspectives. The main theme for NRHM 2004 (part 2) 
is 'Accessible Hypermedia and Multimedia'. We are also continuing the 
open topic sub-theme for high quality papers meeting NRHM's scope in 
general.

NRHM has recently been acquired by Taylor & Francis 
<http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/13614568.asp> and will now 
appear in both print and digital formats. We are particularly interested 
in exploring possibilities for the digital medium, for example digital 
video clips illustrating environments, data or interfaces discussed in 
the paper. Authors are encouraged to contact the Editor regarding other 
proposals for related digital material.
