Well, yes.  Even the so called 3rd world individuals want access to the 
latest technology.  I thought that was your big issue?  You don't want to 
give them old technology do you?  They don't want yesterdays DOS machines 
any more than any one else.  I still see "technical accessibility" 
separate from "affordability".  And I recognize the various stake holder 
responsibilities, including that of industry to lower costs and that of 
government to provide funds to purchase technology to bridge the digital 
divide.

I guess we need to just agree to disagree with our approaches.  You're 
trying to say in the name of affordability that everyone else in the world 
must maintain backwards compatibility.  I would rather make the existing 
and emerging technologies accessible and at the same time have additional 
initiatives focus on improving the availability in 3rd world countries. 
The affordability issues is a lot more than about the technical 
accessibility.  As you point out, it includes the infrastructure - the 
phone lines in Nicaragua.  You always seem to be talking about access to 
the internet, while I am talking about the compatibility of the web based 
information and applications with assistive technology.

(my personal opinion)
