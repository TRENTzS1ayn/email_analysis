I see arguements for banning and not banning client side scripts.  But I
think the issue can can be solved.  I believe most web designers when told
to be wary about using scripts and given examples of how to use them
correctly and examples with factual based documentation on why some
scripts break the accessibility issues, would do the correct approach.

Do we want to ban scripting in the guidelines?  I think that artifically
closes the door.  I think the guidelines should say something such as
"Scripts should be USED WITH CAUTION and must degrade gracefully in
regards to the information presented/attained."  And leave it to that.

NOW I think the techniques should be the crux of the work for the WCAG WG
where they can document AS MUCH AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN on best practices, ok
practices, and problem practices.  I think if there was an example of how
to do an accessible rollover, and people knew where to look for
techniques, most would copy and implement the example.

I think the time spent debating whether or not to ban this or that is a
waste.  I think if you get enough examples of good and bad solutions to
problems, it will become obvious.
