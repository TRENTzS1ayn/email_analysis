Hello all,
HTML accessibility guidelines or specs say nothing about  use of heading taggs (h1, h2, etc) for marking up group / section headings within data tables. Consider, for instance first column groups grades 1 to 12 under elementary/mid and high schools and other columns have values against the grades. 
Running down the first column with screen reading  software  will speak out the heading markup and inform the user  that the items below belong to that group. They could be marked uup with h2 or h3 and styled to maintain visual l&f.
A simple technique but I  do not see it being mentioned for making certain data tables accessible. Comments?
