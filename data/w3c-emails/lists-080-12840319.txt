Take a look at the data table at
http://www.eramp.com/david/traffic_cop_prototype_staticc_no_rows.htm
The cells in the first column  are marked up as th and use h2 within.  Well this table uses rowspan. But the one I described in my mail does not and just    marking up elementary/mid/high school cells in first column  with say h2 and not the grades under them will be useful to a screen reader user.
Even while associating   data cells to header cells,  just th mark-up  is enough and one need not use headers-id for data cells in the grade-rows.
>Why not just style the <TH> the same as your <H>?
Styling alone will not  convey  the structural  relation.
