Matthew comments:
Yes, I have seen examples like Streetmap, so good yet so bad...

David has a good point - are those providing mapping facilities really ready to 
give away data?  Images of printed maps can be converted to geotiff format and 
others and be "spatially enabled".  But they are not.

A possible parallel to "provide a text only version if not accessible" can be 
applied to this situation: provide a map image but also provide query access to 
data in a tabular form.

I agree with Charles that SVG has potential here, but until I see native SVG 
support in Mozilla and Internet Explorer, I'll have to stick with the 
technologies that are out there, however old or flawed they may be <wink/>.

Cheers
