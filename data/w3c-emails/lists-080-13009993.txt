no the problem isn't "giving" anyone the technology, it is actually
getting it there.  so for the most part we have to deal with what is
obtainable locally.  and in third world countries they use it when they
can get it forever....their annual income in many places doesn't equal the
cost of a new computer in their own country, and if getting new ones there
were easy it would have been done.  many things get in the way, shipping
costs, import duties and restrictions, and lack of compatability are
amoung the problems.

getting one laptop in is fairly easy, getting in a couple hundred P-IVs is
a lot harder...but getting that one laptop in means a plane ticket to
wherever because it has to be handcarried....everytime I go to one of
these countries I look like an importer or something I carry so much, and
I usually am living out of my carry on bag, everything else is left
there, and I have pretty much found the limit a non citizen can bring in
without getting nailed for mucho big bucks at customs.

one way we get wheelchairs and stuff in is to use em, amazing how many
folks can be cured by the local water,,,.......<g>
