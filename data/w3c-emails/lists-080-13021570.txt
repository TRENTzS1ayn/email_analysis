One could create an image map (graphic) showing lines representing compass 
points (N,NE,E,SE,S,SW,W,NW) going through concentric circles representing the 
"jump" size (100m, 500m, 1km to use Jesper's example).  The intersections of the 
lines and the circles would be the links which would have the title attribute 
set as "re-centre map 500 metres northeast", etc.

To simplify, one could just have the compass points and the degree of "jump" 
being set as a function of the map scale.
