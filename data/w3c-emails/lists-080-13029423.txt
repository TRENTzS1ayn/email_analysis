Pannable maps are pretty well intrinsically visual so there is no need
to try to create textual buttons.  The issue is dexterity, rather than
vision.  Most GUIs have a mode in which the cursor keys move the cursor
in pixels, as part of their accessibility features.

(Actually, I could imagine a tactile map, but the technology to support that
would presumably also support tracking the finger, or at least providing
a cursor.)
