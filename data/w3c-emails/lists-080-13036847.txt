Further to the recent discussion on the differnce between documents and
applications, it seems that Mozilla and Opera teams of clubbed together
to develop extensions to HTML and CSS designed to implement things like
dialogue boxes natively, to enable those browsers to better support
web applications.  It also appears that Microsoft's Longhorn project
has its own HTML extensions for web applications, so it looks as though
they want something short of .NET thick client, but less kludgy than
ASP.NET.

For further details start at:

Slashdot  Mozilla, Opera Form Group to Develop Web App Specs

<http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/06/07/107259>

The discussion points fall basically into three categories:

- it will die because it isn't implemented by Microsoft;

- it's still a kludge on top of an inappropriate language;

- it adds yet more complexity to something that was intended to be simple.

I see no indication that either side has considered accessibility.  Although
some of the things could be considered abstract interfaces, some is
clearly aimed at visual operation (e.g. I see no sign of popups being
abstracted).
