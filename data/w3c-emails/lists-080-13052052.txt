Hi All

I am preparing a stylesheet (CSS) that will be used to format a report for 
printing.  To ensure good pagination, I am using absolute sizings, but only in 
print mode.

The report creates "town directories" from our online community information 
database, Community Connect <http://www.community-connect.net>.  These will be 
produced on demand by council offices, etc.  Although there is free, public Web 
access around here, not everyone will use it so, to improve accessiblity, we 
have paper versions.

For general use, the following will be used:

p, li  {font-size:12pt;}
h1 {font-size:16pt; font-weight:bold;}
h2 {font-size:14pt; font-weight:bold;}
h3 {font-size:12pt; bold;}

Would anyone care to nominate suitable sizes for a "large print" version?

Cheers

M
