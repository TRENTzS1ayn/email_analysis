Pannable maps are pretty well intrinsically visual so there is no need
to try to create textual buttons.

A blind person has the same right to pan maps as any other person.

Let us say a blind person would like from her website to link to a map
showing where she lives.

She goes to the map service and type the address, and the map is shown
with the address in the center. Now if she lives very close to the sea
let us say the East Coast, she would like to pan the map a little in
order to show more of the town and less of the blue water. 

She then copies the link from the address bar and pastes it into the web
page she is making for her website.

This is what any person would have done, and also a blind person, I
guess?
