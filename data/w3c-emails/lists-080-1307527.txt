In which case I think people are doing the right thing for the wrong 
reason. I believe the number of people who have difficulties using a 
mouse is predominantly people other than those who are visually 
impaired.

Accesskey is  an important functionality for people who have 
difficulties with providing input. Lots of them aren't people with 
visual disability.

It also provides a functionality to authors that the rel attribute 
doesn't give them.

Both of these things are useful - it's worth recognising them both, and 
what they do...

cheers
