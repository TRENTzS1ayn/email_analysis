is an attempt to persuade marketers to take accessibility into account.
While it is a good try, I feel that it won't really hit the target (perhaps
inevitable in a one-page overview). Bobby is the only testing tool mentioned
- without any qualifications on its use - and this para:

> Design, look, and feel will tend toward simplicity with clear navigation,
> straightforward page structures, and easily readable text. However, this
> doesn't necessarily impose limitations on visuals or brand identity, nor
> does it preclude use of rich media. Well-designed graphics and multimedia
> elements, judiciously applied and clearly signposted, can be a positive
> aid to using and understanding Web sites

will probably be skimmed and taken, by many, as saying accessible web sites
are boring to look at. (It doesn't, of course, but the first phrase will
cause some eyes to glaze over.)

> Seek out usability experts, and request guidance from national disability
> institutions, especially those representing the blind and partially
> sighted

 - why the latter qualification?
