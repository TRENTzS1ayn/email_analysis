I'd say that it can get VERY tedious and frustrating using mouse keys
when you have to move across a lot of screen space even for simple tasks.

I'd see them as a last resort, or rather a poor excuse for a proper
solution.

IMHO, anyway (and no, I'm not a regular mouse keys user either, so take
this as my outsider's opinion)
