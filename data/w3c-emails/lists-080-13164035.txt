The diagram seems to be lacking a lot (apart from a textual equivalent 
;-)). I think there need to be more immediate subsets of universal 
accessibility. (OK, I'm not sure what at the moment but intuitively it 
looks and feels too disjointed and sparse.)

What you need is some sort of web application where people can modify 
the diagram and others can discuss. Maybe like some sort of svg wiki?
