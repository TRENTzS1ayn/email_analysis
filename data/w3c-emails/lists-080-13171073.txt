right I have yet to see a deffinition of accessibility (especially
concerns the web) that I feel comfortable enough to hang my hat on.

text is so much more than folks who are visually impaired, and simplified
graphics is so much more than developmental disabilities.

example that I rarely hear used, people with ADHD (and it's variants) are
sometimes very distracted by graphics and popups and all the stuff on a
page that they can only effectively use the web in text mode.

and there are so many of these variants that finding something that works
for even the majority of people is pretty hard but we do need to at least
address the issues, and define the problem if at all possible.
