SVG format:
http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/hendry/work/thesis/pictures/accessibility.svg

Dia format:

My browser can't view SVG, and besides I have not seen a SVG wiki. So
the best I can suggest is for you all to grab what I have and play
around with it and stick it back up on the web somewhere (or just mail
it to me).

Kind regards,
