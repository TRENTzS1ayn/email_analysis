I believe universal web accessibility should be defined as:

Universal Web Accessibility is where the user, be it a human or a computer
program, can send commands, send information, and retrieve information
regardless of the mode of input or output of the accessing device.

I believe it boils down to allowing universal access via unlimited, yet
defined, modes of access.  I believe things such as bandwith, cost, il8n,
etc are parameters of input/output.
