For a map at about the whole country scale, that list is likely to be 
over 1000 items long, and may not include the expected description,
e.g. you may have to scan the list more than once, looking for less and
less specific locations.

The normal reason that you want to point at a map is that you want to look
at a general area, or you don't know specific names; most street map servers
will allow you to enter  postal addreses, or, in the UK at least, grid 
references, if you know exactly where you want to look.  There is still
the problem that you need visual or tactile access before you can make
any use of the map itself.

If you want to give a map to someone else, but are unable to view it yourself,
copyright issues mean that you will need to supply a URL rather than an
image of the map, so the recipient can fine tune the positioning (I know that
many people infringe map copyrights when providing directions to their 
homes).
