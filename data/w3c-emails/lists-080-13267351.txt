Maybe not its definition. Perhaps its scope.

Perhaps.

Text has to scale from a desktop to a mobile device for example.
Otherwise it isn't accessible.

Those are good points.

Eh? I don't understand. 

Usability + Accessibility = Universal Accessibility?

Well that is one of the problems I feel with "accessibility". 

It makes authors think they should target content. I would like authors
to write simple well XHTML web pages that can be mangled by the user
agent for the user's needs. I am probably going back to the "write once
for all" philosophy.

I hope you don't expect authors to cater for particular devices. Once
again a author should write "accessible" content, and rely on the
device's user agent to cater for alternative input and output.

Authors.

The Web.

Maybe I am trying to get at here that there should be clearer
distinction between authors and user agents responsibility.

I mean who has the disability? The user agent, the device, the
technology, the author or the user nowadays? :)
