There will be a workshop in Copenhagen (July 15 .16) about the Semantic 
Web, and multi-linguality. As part of the work being done for the CEN 
MMI-DC workshop, we are keen to report on multi-linguality and 
accessibility and how the Semantic Web can help with problems in this 
area.
If these topics interest you, please consider being a part of this 
workshop either by attending, or by contributing your ideas.
