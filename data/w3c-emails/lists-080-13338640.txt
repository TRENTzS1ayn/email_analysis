how do you define "Special needs" (I HATE THAT TERM) they may or may not
be related to defining accessibility depending on how used, very confusing
term to the general public

probably unrelated

part of the code.  the accessibility must be cross platform and software
independent

the code defines what is accessible.

this has probably caused the most grief,  the NFB in the USA has been the
driving force (at least vocally) on accessibility (in computer software),
since they represent  visually impaired users they tend to only really be
concerned with their members and others get lost in the din.

I think segmenting the groups would just pit one against the other and
software/programmers might just cherry pick those it is convienent for
them to accomodate and ignore the rest, and have an "out"

sometimes defining the questions leads to better answers
