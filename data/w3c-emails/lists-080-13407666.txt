OZeWAI 2004 will be held at La Trobe University, Melbourne, December 
1-3. This is a small but high-quality conference that caters for all 
with an interest in accessibility. This year, there will be a special 
focus on the accessibility of educational materials and how they are 
developed, identified, discovered, and repaired. Managers, techies, 
users, researchers, and more are invited to contribute in any of the 
many ways we provide for conference participants.

Please visit our call for proposals and send us your proposal! See
