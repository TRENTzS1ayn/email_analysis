Hi all

Sorry for such a late reply, but have been a bit busy lately and only now
catching up with some of the messages.

There is a tool I came across for Mozilla/Firefox which I think does
everything you need called "web developer"..

The URL is  http://extensionroom.mozdev.org/more-info/webdeveloper

Its one of the handiest tools for Firefox I have ever used.

Ralph

Matthew replies:

It is so refreshing to see a Mozilla version - I have installed this and
will 
test and provide feedback.  Unlike many other beta-version Mozilla plugins,
I am 
still able to use my browser after installation <wink/>.

Cheers
