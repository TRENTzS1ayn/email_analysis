For those who believe that web sites should be allowed to rely on scripting,
CERT, one of the most respected internet security organisations, is 
currently advising that scripting (and ActiveX) be disabled for the internet
security zone (i.e. any zone that is not fully trusted).  This is because
of a vulnerability that is being actively exploited, and which allows 
arbitrary code to be run on a machine accessing a rogue web site.  Remember
that access can be the result of typos in URLs and following misleading
hits from search engines, even if you wouldn't deliberately visit dodgy
sites (there are also more technical ways of misdirecting users).
