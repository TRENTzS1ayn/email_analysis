I won't have real player installed on my system. It is too invasive and the
interface is not particularly user friendly.

David, what do you mean by 
"it places a heavy requirement burden on the user." ? 

The user has to have real player installed, and he has to remember the
keyboard shortcuts - so far no issues.  But the biggest problem I see is in
an audio interface implemented this way as a bunch of audio files is that
when returning to a page, it starts playing at the top again.  While a
traditional screen reader interface will usually continue where you left off
on that page - a big difference in my opinion. Of course a screen reader
will also let you navigate around the page, not just listen in prerecorded
sequence.  And as with most prerecorded audio, there is little chance to
change the synthesizer voices.  I would characterize this site more as
limited "interactive radio" on the web. 

Regards,
Phill
