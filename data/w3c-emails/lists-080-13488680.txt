I'd argue that the users aren't denying themselves access, rather, it is the
site author who is denying the users access. Given that turning scripting
off is a valid choice for dealing with these vulnerabilities, we need to
ensure that things "work" when scripting is off as well. I'm all for
enhancing things when scripting is enabled, but at least basic functionality
should be available with it off.

Best regards,
Derek.
