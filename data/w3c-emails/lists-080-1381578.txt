This is a much better idea. I use linux for development which is why
this JAWS petition is not exactly inspirational to me.

A web service would be cross platform and much more useful to a wider
range of developers.

Another alternative which I have mentioned previously is for companies
like Macromedia to work with JAWS to provide some kind of plugin to
their development products.
