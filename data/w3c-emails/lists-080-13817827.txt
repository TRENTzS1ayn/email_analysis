Has this list/server been hacked? Why is the WAI server not weeding out the virus emails? I suggest everyone updates their protection, someone on this list may be infected. I got 3 in this inbox today and 10 in my main inbox. It is getting tedious, and sends my better half into panic mode when she downloads emails for me, a virus arrives and flags up a warning. She did not fall for the asprin in the A drive gag however.......... made my own coffee.........................
