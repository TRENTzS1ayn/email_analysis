Some reason the server cannot return a page with page not found information?

>>>Returning anything except an error response breaks link checking
software.
What does link checking software have to do with user accessibility?

*** handling or so-called marketing

Broken links should not be handled by client mediated redirects.
It is OK to redirect as a purely internal operation on the server,
but the server must return a 403 or 404 status for the broken URL,
not, as often happens, a 302 to a 200 for the link is broken page.

Returning anything except an error response breaks link checking
software.
