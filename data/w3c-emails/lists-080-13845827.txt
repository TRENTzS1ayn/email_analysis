A good 404 page has that information. A great 404 page helps you find a relevant
page to whatever you were looking for when you followed the dead link. 

A 200 page that says "page not found" is a lie.

410 is good too; indeed even better in those cases where it is applicable.

I always thought "gets the basic functionality half-way right" was a
prerequesite for accessibility.
Also, ideally a site should be accessible to users that include automated
processes.
