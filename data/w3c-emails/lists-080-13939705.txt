  Someone with more experience from speech browsers will need to answer
  most of your questions. However:

  Please don't. Firstly, the phrase "standard" in your statement
  must be interpreted as "de facto standard", as there is no written,
  official, standard way of indicating a mandatory field - sadly.

  Second, how is that "*" supposed to be read ? A screen reader cannot
  automatically interpret it and read "Mandatory field", even if it
  exist in a LABEL - nor are there any one way of reading the character.

  Splat ? Asterix ? Star ? How should the "*" be read in an English
  document ? Granted, the speech browser should read the text in
  English, but what about the splat ?

  Consider, also, the speed with which many speech systems operate. I
  have had the dubious pleasure of hearing the old Greytower site read
  by Jaws - I couldn't keep up, and I'd written the text it read.

  May I suggest writing, in the label, that this field is in fact
  mandatory ? A single character de facto method does not carry enough
  information. I'd recommend

   <label for="id">First name (mandatory information)</label>
    <input type="text" ...
