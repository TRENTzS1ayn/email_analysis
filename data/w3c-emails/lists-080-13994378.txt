I use this type of construct and it has worked really well in a number of
user tests for people both using and not using a variety of access
technologies including various screen readers. Its main benefits are:
* visual users get it because asterix is a commonly used marker
* screen reader users get it because the alt text gets read out and does not
rely on dubious implementation of "title" or user preference settings.

NB I also use a similar thing to mark where on a form there are errors that
need addressing (in addition to stating at the top).
