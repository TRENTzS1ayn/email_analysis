  Well, my question then becomes: "Why should they?"

  I can readily imagine, say, an older person with somewhat reduced
  eyesight - going to happen to most of us - who doesn't really feel the
  need for a specialized magnification tool, but feel quite comfortable
  with increasing the font size in his/her UA.

  Tiny symbols that may or may not carry meaning and implemented as
  graphical elements -is- a problem for that specific group; both as
  links and as information carrying elements.

  What's wrong with just adding "mandatory", or "required" in plain text
  to the label ?
