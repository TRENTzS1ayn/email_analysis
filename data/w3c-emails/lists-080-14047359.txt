Actually I should have clarified. From what I can tell JAWS exhibits this
behaviour when forms mode *is* on, and not otherwise, so it does actually
read the text found in the <legend>...</legend>, but only when the user has
activated forms mode explicitly.

Apologies in advance, but let me assure you that this isn't a tactic to get
more people to sign up for our newsletter... If you want to test it, our
newsletter sign up form at http://www.wats.ca/mailinglist/subscribe.php?s=1
uses the strategy I described with appropriate fieldsets and legends.

Best regards,
Derek.
