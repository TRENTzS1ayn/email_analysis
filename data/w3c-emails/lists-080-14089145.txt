Although it won't help in the short term, long term I think there is a
case for a new attribute on input elements to indicate they are mandatory
(this might be considered to be XFORMS rather than [X]XHTML, and might
already exist for them

There are ways of doing it for people using good CSS2 implementations and
speech mode browsers.  Most people use bad CSS2 implemenations and 
visual mode browsers with speech bolt-ons (which often depend on using
a specific, CSS2-weak, browser).  For good CSS2 implementations, the
"*" probably should be inserted as styling, and the mandatory property
coded as a sub-class, but such browsers are in the minority.
