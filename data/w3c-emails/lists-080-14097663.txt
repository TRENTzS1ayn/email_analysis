Just as a quick answer to solving *this* problem with IE, (there's
apparently a lot more problems :) if you set the size of the font as % within
body, and use ems elsewhere, then IE only shrinks text down to a
certain level under (view -> text size -> smallest). So, allowing that
you don't make the body size % too small, you can use ems and not have
this problem with IE.

As an example, and purely just for this!, our site:
http://www.signify.co.nz
uses "font-size: 76%;" within the body and ems for all other sizings.
Reducing text size in IE to "smallest" still allows me to read the
text - albeit that it is small. Whereas in Jim's example that you
referred to, I couldn't read anything.

Apparently this is just one of those features of IE!
