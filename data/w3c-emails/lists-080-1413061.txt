I don't know that Lynx will read the same things in the same order
(tables etc) as JAWS although in combination with EMACSpeak, it can work
as a talking browser in it's own right.

I think that you may even find that JAWS is more "forgiving" of poor
coding than Lynx; as a screen reader it is, after all, a patch to make
Windows do what it should have done natively and must therefore be able
to render some pretty dubious stuff.

Lynx is the first tool that I use to check my code once I've previewed
it in Mozilla - even before I run it past AccessValet.

As an aside, anyone know if Lynx has been ported for Palm Pilot?

Cheers
