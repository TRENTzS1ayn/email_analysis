Surely the problem here is the level of abuse of alt attributes.

If you ignore the sites that don't use them at all, you will find a large
number of sites that treat them as a Netscape 4 tooltip feature, and a lot
that apply token accessibility compliance by providing alt text that matches the
image file name, or which is a description rather than an alternative.  You
will also still find sites (I hit one recently) that use them for keyword
stuffing (for search engine manipulation).
