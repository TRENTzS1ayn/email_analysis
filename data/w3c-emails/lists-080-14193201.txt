Hi Andrew, Mike, Geoffrey,

Thanks for the feedback.

The discussion about problems with em units (and the % workaround) are
discussed in the chapter 'Problems with the use of CSS relative units' at
http://www.scotconnect.com/webtypography/problems.php

And you are right - the site that the book is published on did not conform
to the advice contained within the book. An oversight on my part which I
will get fixed.

 All the best,
Jim
