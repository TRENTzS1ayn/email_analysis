If you are going to have a jaws wiget, you need to keep it up to date,
provide documentation for developpers to read and make it as fully
configurable for the web as jaws is and provide a way to see where the
cursor lands when you use the navigation aids it provides.  I am in favor of
this, but it would be a lot of work for someone or a company and it would
probably turn out not to be free.  In fairness, you'd also need some of the
other tools emmulated as well such as zoom text, magic, window eyes, hal and
others.  I guess the point I am trying to make is that we seem to be putting
the cart before the horse here.  The assumption is that if you validate and
code to wai guidelines, that the assistives should fall in line.  This
includes using the techniques.  I'd be more in favor of providing a
techniques document or adding to the techniques document tips for maximizing
the environment you know your client will want to maximize.  I have begun to
see for instance on some sites a notice saying something like:
" if you are using jaws to fill out this form, turn off the virtual cursor.
If you are using window eyes, turn off msaa mode."

Hi All,

There has been a rather lively discussion on this petition, both at
Accessify:
http://www.accessifyforum.com/viewtopic.php?t=149

and Maccessibility:
http://www.maccessibility.com/

I proposed a non-speech version of JAWS: put in a page, get a
"transcript" of what JAWS would have spoken.  It could support all
settings, or only the most common settings that real users use.

This should have the advantage of reducing the learning requirements and
not eroding JAWS revenue.

Does Lynx already perform this function?  If so, shouldn't there be an
outreach effort to non-blind developers about how to use Lynx as an
evaluation tool?

Dear all!

Not every freelancer designer, developer, can afford buying JAWS, to
test the web sites they build.

Therefore, see how this problem may be solved!
