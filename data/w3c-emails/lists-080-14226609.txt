There was a discussion about the best way to indicate mandatory and optional
fields on a usability list some time ago. I don't have references but the
concensus was that indicating optional fields instead of required or
mandatory fields is significantly less usable than the other way round. Of
course it does depend on specific context so there are exceptions.
