Dear all

Is there a web discussion forum like this one for database designers. A
colleague of mine is tearing his hair out trying to make a complex access
database and its outputs accessible to disabled clients. The database,
stored at the Nottingham Council For Voluntary Service stores all the
details of voluntary and statutory sector orgs and services in the
Nottingham area, including numerous disability organisations. Outputs and
update requests are regularly sent to disabled recipients so it is essential
that we can generate forms in accessible formats.

Any advice or signposting would be appreciated
