You can use style sheets to allow the graphis to grow and shrink with the
text:
 img.asterisk { width: 0.5em; height: 0.5em;}

Is there a problem with that?

If there are ten mandatory fields in a form, those "mandatory" strings
begin to become annoying, IMO.  Of course, the first thing to ask is,
whether the ten pieces of information really are necessary for processing
the information submitted with the form.  In most cases, they are not.  In
some cases, they are.

Simplified, graphical presentation can make it easier for the user to
distinguish the mandatory elements quickly, reducing the time it would
take them to read the text of all the labels in the form.
