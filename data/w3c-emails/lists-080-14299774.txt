SVG in and of itself would be, but even if all sighted your users have an SVG
plug-in the most browsers will only allow it in <object> elements not in <img>
elements. Support for the <object> element in many browsers is poor and so
while theoretically it has better mechanisms for alternative content than <img>
in practice it does not.

If you want to do resizing of images then one option is to send a image that has
a very large "natural" size, so that it is scaling down rather than scaling up,
in general this *sometimes* works quite well, but at the expense of a download
time that would be quite nasty for low-bandwidth users.
