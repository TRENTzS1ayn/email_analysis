Hola Gabriel, James

Actually this is on topic, because as Gabriel pointed out this comes 
from the WCAG techniques. Some years ago, some tools recognised a map 
and would allow the user to just pass over it.

HTML 4 was designed so that map could contain a set of links that were 
available to be an imagemap, or could be presented as a simple block of 
text links. HTML 4.01 included very few changes to the DTD, but one of 
them was specifically designed to make this approach work better with 
existing tools - allowing groups of text links as well as map elements, 
whereas it had previously insisted on one or the other.

This is probably something that should be taken up again in the 
Techniques task force of the WCAG group. Development in browsers has 
not really gone in that direction, and we seem to be stuck for the 
moment with actually putting little links around the page instead of 
having tools that help pass over a block of them.

In other words, the map element isn't incorrect, but it is less helpful 
than the designers of HTML hoped, and I agree that you should have your 
list of elements inside it also in a list element. For two links it is 
not clear whether the extra link to skip them is worthwhile, but if you 
have five or six then it is a good idea to put it there, since so few 
people will be able to make use of your markup.

cheers
