I guess I should rephrase that. I said "shouldn't" because my reference 
says "Conventional content within the <map> tag /may/ be displayed by 
the browser, <area> tags will not." To me that means conventional 
content may not be displayed. But if you have a good reason for using 
them, my choice of the word "shouldn't" was probably too strong. Sorry.

On closer inspection of the HTML spec, <map> elements can ONLY contain 
<area> tags or block-level content. So it looks like you may want to use 
a <ul> inside your <map> anyway. Have you tried validating your source?

Because this is an technical HTML problem. Although many of the 
technologies overlap, I think this particular question would be better 
suited for an HTML list.
