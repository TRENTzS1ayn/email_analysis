Hi Jerome,

You should consider the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines Working 
Group - http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU

A content management system (a database plus methods of output) is one 
of the types of tools considered in that group, and the work looks at 
both the data that goes into the system (and how), and the methods of 
output.

Cheers

Chaals
