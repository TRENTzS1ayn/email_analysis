(First of all sorry for my english)

>... probably too strong. Sorry.
Not to strong, really. I apreciate your help.

I am reformulate my question because I am not satisfied with my work (I am
new about accessibility, sorry). 

I want to have a good menu (from accesibility perspective). I have 5 or 6
links and use this like menu page.

All my pages have this block of links and I want to give to user the
posibility that can skip this block. What can I do?

I am testing with IBM Home Page Reader 3.0 and Its really heavy to listen
all the times the menu!. 

If this is not question to this list, say me. 

TIA

I guess I should rephrase that. I said "shouldn't" because my reference 
says "Conventional content within the <map> tag /may/ be displayed by 
the browser, <area> tags will not." To me that means conventional 
content may not be displayed. But if you have a good reason for using 
them, my choice of the word "shouldn't" was probably too strong. Sorry.

On closer inspection of the HTML spec, <map> elements can ONLY contain 
<area> tags or block-level content. So it looks like you may want to use 
a <ul> inside your <map> anyway. Have you tried validating your source?

Because this is an technical HTML problem. Although many of the 
technologies overlap, I think this particular question would be better 
suited for an HTML list.
