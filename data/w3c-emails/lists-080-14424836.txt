The concept of site map is dated and should be deprecated. Most users
understand the concept of table of contents much better.

If a small web site should have a table of contents is only a question
of such a table being useful or not. If all pages are covered by the
main menu, a table of contents could still be useful if it is more
detailed, etc.

Since one of the most important virtues in web design is to keep it
simple, a very small web site could easily do without a table of
contents in many cases.

Greetings All

I would be interested to hear if list members consider a site map
necessary for 
a site that has only five pages (making it 20% bigger).

Cheers
