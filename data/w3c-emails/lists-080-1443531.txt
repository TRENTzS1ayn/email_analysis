MessageHello
I agree with this idea, it's more effective for development, and accessibility learning.
Best regards

  Hi All,

  There has been a rather lively discussion on this petition, both at Accessify:
  http://www.accessifyforum.com/viewtopic.php?t=149

  and Maccessibility:
  http://www.maccessibility.com/

  I proposed a non-speech version of JAWS: put in a page, get a "transcript" of what JAWS would have spoken.  It could support all settings, or only the most common settings that real users use.

  This should have the advantage of reducing the learning requirements and not eroding JAWS revenue.

  Does Lynx already perform this function?  If so, shouldn't there be an outreach effort to non-blind developers about how to use Lynx as an evaluation tool?

    Dear all!

    Not every freelancer designer, developer, can afford buying JAWS, to test the web sites they build. 

    Therefore, see how this problem may be solved!

    Thanks for your your time and help!

    Kind regards,

    John
