Hello Gabriel,

I think the best solution is to combine what you have been doing with 
what James suggests about including a list:

<map title="Menu de navegaci?n">
<ul>
???????<li><a href="#firstOption">Saltear barra de navegacion</a></li>
  ??????<li><a href="index.htm" class="Menu" title="P?gina de Inicio" 
accesskey="I">Inicio</a></li>
        <li><a href="Contacto.htm" class="Menu" title="Acceso a la 
P?gina de Contacto"accesskey="C">Contacto</a></li>
</ul>
</map>

<h1><a name="firstOption">Opciones en esta pagina</a></h1>

?Changes I made:
1. remove tabindex - because it is probably not necessary.

If you have other links before the menu you might like to put it back. 
Alternatively you can put the menu after the main content, but make it 
appear near the top of the page, using a column layout with CSS float. 
Have a look at http://www.w3.org/2002/02/css-float-test.html for an 
example that explains itself, and has a spanish version. There are lots 
of other explanations of this...

2. remove hreflang="es" - I assume the starting page is also in 
spanish. If you use content or language negotiation to have multiple 
options available for some pages, this could even be misleading.

As far as I know very old versions of Amaya are the only browser that 
won't show the content of the map. Some configurations of Lynx, new 
versions of Amaya, and probably some other browsers, allow you to skip 
over the entire block with a keystroke or two. Keeping the link there 
means you can skip past the menu with any browser...

cheers

No problem - but did you know that there are accessibility groups 
working in spanish (and other languages - finnish, french, italian, 
...), who have members in this list as well?

no need to be sorry - everybody is new when they begin :-)

I think this question is very appropriate to the list...
