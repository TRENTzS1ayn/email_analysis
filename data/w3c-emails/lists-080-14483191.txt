I'd appreciate hearing the origin of this statistic. I would think 
that many users with cognitive impairments would appreciate a "map"- 
a map being a visual layout of the layout of a site. It's very 
different from a table of contents; it manages to show relationships 
without text explanation. Kind of like a map.

A consideration for whether or not to use a site map could be who 
your audience is and what the content is. A science exploration site 
for grade schoolers may have it's ethos somewhat boosted by a graphic 
site map. A township's site showing office hours and contact 
information probably would not.
