I don't think it is deprecated in 2.1, I think it has just been made
non-normative because CSS 2.1 is supposed to represent the CSS that
you can reasonably expect to be supported in browsers, and to meet
the two compatible implementations requirement.

I expect it will go back in (to later versions of CSS) if and when there
are multiple real world implementations.
