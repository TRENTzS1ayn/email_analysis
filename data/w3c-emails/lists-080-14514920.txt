I haven't seen one to the extent that when I see the term site map I think
of a cleanly formatted list of (nearly) all the pages on the site.  This
differs from my concept of a table of contents in its level of completeness
and its like design obfuscation. 

What I understand by site map is desirable.  It is not needed for small sites
designed by people who respect accessibility, but I think it might be
undesirable to remove the requirement, as it is often the only way of
navigating typical commercial sites, and establishing a precedent for its
removal in some cases may well cause it to be dropped in cases where it
is valuable (even now it is typically a small print link at the bottom of
the page and is probably there because they want search engines to be able
to navigate the site, even if humans can't).
