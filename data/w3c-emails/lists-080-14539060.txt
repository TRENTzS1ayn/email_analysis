Kevin, in your note you say that you use a site map when you need to 
"show the layout in full to clients". That's an important time to 
make sure it's clear, and I can understand using a site map. I think 
there are many circumstances that are just as important and require 
the same sort of global clarity. I'm a designer; I think in pictures. 
Many people do. When I'm involved in my work, if someone interrupts 
and asks a question, it takes me a moment to respond because words 
aren't there. I like site maps when they're done well. I find the 
maps used by the National Gallery site when they have a special 
online show, for instance, to be invaluable for navigation as well as 
understanding how the site is inter-connected.

So far there were several opinions about site maps saying they're 
dated or otherwise un-useful. Please realize that not everyone uses 
the Web the way you do, and certainly not everyone thinks of it as a 
book with linear layout. A site map can be a good thing, and if coded 
adequately can read as a table of contents to a screen reader or to 
those who turn images off.
