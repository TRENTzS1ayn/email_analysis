  I'd make the claim that this concept not only exist today, but should
  exist, and be used. However, it might be that we are thinking of
  different things.

  A "site map", to me, is a representation - one way or another - of
  where to find what on a website. I like to compare it to the catalogue
  of a library.

  A "table of contents", on the other hand, is a document-specific
  representation listing what exists, and where, in this specific
  document.

  Both are -highly- useful, and well known to most people from other
  works of life.

  I see, daily, sitemaps implemented as nested lists describing
  hierarchial websites which I find very, VERY useful.

  The concept of a non-hiearchial website might need a different
  implementation, but I've not seen any of those.
