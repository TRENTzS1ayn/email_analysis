P W L D is pretty much ingrained into any sports fan.

You could use the abbr attribute on the th cells, and if the screen 
readers don't implement the full HTML 4 table model yet you could add 
headers attributes, which most of them do implement.

For that matter you could make them abbr elements inside the heading 
elements...
