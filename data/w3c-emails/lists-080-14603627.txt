Hi all,

I'm wondering the scope attribute will work on table headers with colspans?
Like this:

(I've taken out the closing tags for an easier read)

 

<table>

<tr>

<th colspan="2" scope="col">main header 1</th>

<th colspan="2" scope="col">main header 2</th>

</tr>

<tr>

<th scope="col">sub head a>

<th scope="col">sub head b>

<th scope="col">sub head c>

<th scope="col">sub head d>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>data</td>

<td>data</td>

<td>data</td>

<td>data</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>data</td>

<td>data</td>

<td>data</td>

<td>data</td>

</tr>

</table>

 

Is the scope element enough? Can I simplify it more by getting rid of the
scope element in the entire second row? I read in a prior post that Jaws had
problems with this and in essence you need to use ID and headers. Is that
fixed in newer versions?

 

I'm trying to find the easiest acceptable method of creating accessible data
tables for folks with almost no HTML background.

 

Thank you
