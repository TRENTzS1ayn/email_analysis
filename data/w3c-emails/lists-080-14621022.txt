This is sort of *swaying* the topic in another direction and then not...

I'm currently trying to linearize my sitemap
<http://www.is.visisoul.com/sitemap.html>, but I'm having a bit of trouble
at the moment.  I certainly will do some more investigation on my own (I
gave up to give my brain some time to think since a bazillion things are on
my mind) but wonder if anyone had some *immediate* ideas (that won't
inconvenience you) as to how to go about it.  One of my objectives with the
site map is to have a graphical looking effect without having too many
graphics.  Currently the way I have it set up, it seems to be a bit complex
for working out the headers, etc..

I have taken some time out over the last couple of months to study and bring
myself up to speed so my Web site is in serious need of an update to reflect
my current knowledge.  Do know, however, that accessibility or rather
universal accessibility is Very important to me or I wouldn't be on this
list!

I would appreciate feedback from *anyone*.  Bring it on... :)

Regards,


Isabelle

moment.  erg!
