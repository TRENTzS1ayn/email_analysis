I don't think you are taking a wrong approach at all!  I have used this
before myself (in a site that's not in my portfolio). :)  I'm really trying
to be a bit *creative* in approach with this site and yet I still want the
site map to be universally accessible.  It's a smaller site; therefore, I
was less concerned about the potential confusion.

So, for example, if a Lynx browser is used I want it to still make sense.
My objective here was to create a visual representation without too many
graphics while using text links.  Mind you, I was having trouble with the
FYI and top level links.  *grin*  I just *have* to be different, don't I?

P.S. My apologies if this gets duplicated, I'm fixing my outgoing and
incoming email addresses for this list!
