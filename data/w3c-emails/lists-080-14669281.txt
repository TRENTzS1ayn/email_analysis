Does Amaya allow you to skip over a list?  I'd like to be able to use:

<ol title="main navigation">...

Instead of:

<map title="main navigation">
<ol>...

And avoid the <map> altogether.

For screen reader users, newer versions of JAWS and Window-Eyes allow users
to skip from list to list, which is great, but it would be better if the
title could be voiced to identify the list.  There is no explicit screen
reader support that I know of for skipping <map>, but you can skip to the
next element of the same type as the currently focused element or to the
next different element type.  These are less useful to the average user than
they could be because title information about the element is not voiced.
