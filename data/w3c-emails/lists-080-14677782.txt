I am currently designing a site at the moment and using CSS for the layout
and presentation.

My question is if I use Div tags to separate the links will the site still
comply with the Guideline 10.5 or is 10.5 now generally seen as out of date
because of the improvements in assistive technologies.

Thanks

Daniel
