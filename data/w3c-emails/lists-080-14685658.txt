Yes, in Amaya you can navigate the document tree (up, next/previous, 
first child) directly. The current tree (actual element, parent, 
parent, parent...) is displayed in the status bar. In the structure 
view you can also move from element to element (the navigationn is 
synchronised, and you can hold the two views open at the same time to 
swap between them.

(For all that, you need to write a lot of scripts to use  it with 
screen readers, it is designed as a structured text editor that can 
browse, it doesn't do javascript or plugins, and  there are some odd 
bugs or missing features. But I would find my life much harder without 
it).

Being able to go to next element in other systems might be useful, but 
it would probably remain an advanced feature. Lynx can present the map 
as "map: whatever the title is" - you choose to enter it, and get a 
list of the links, or the next step is to pass over it". I don't think 
it is the default configuration though.
