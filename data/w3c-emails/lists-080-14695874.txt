So is there benefit in using <map> in the case where <ul title="main
navigation"> is used for a navigation bar?  Seems redundant.  I'm not
confident that the semantics of <map> are so clearly defined as to justify
the use of <ol>/<ul> instead (where the semantics don't scream "navigation
bar" either, but in both cases the title attribute could be used to fill in
the purpose).
