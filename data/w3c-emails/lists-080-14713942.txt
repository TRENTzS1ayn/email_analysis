>I have only began to reach this conclusion when ironically trying to
argue my former case but as I started to code an example taken from
poster "Isabelle's" site (hope you don't mind) and found that the true
semantically hierarchy quickly became convoluted and hard to follow with
the eye, so now I am starting to appreciate the future value of the site
map.

Not a problem.  *grin*

Though I'm confused still.  Are you saying that my site map is confusing? 
If that's the case, is it the *whole thing* or just the FYI column and the
bottom row of top level links?  In other words, if I just left the
"portfolio" map, would that map be still confusing?  I have used
hierarchal links (similar to the dl but actually ul) before (that's not a
new concept to me) for a site map but I wanted to be creative (shame on
me! hehe) this time around while ensuring that it's universally accesible.
 I also think the layout of my site map is a bit flawed both visually and
by way of code; I'm still working on bringing that up to a high level of
quality but I have put it away until my brain can freshen up a bit.  In
the interim I thought it might be wise to ask the group what they thought
since the topic of *site maps* arose.

I thought definitions were deprecated... hrm... I think I might be losing
it.  :=)
