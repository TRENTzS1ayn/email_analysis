I do think that as a whole area of the site most users would either 
ignore or be confused by a site map depending on previous browsing 
experience. A web site is such a large interactive collection of 
information that anyone can access from any point, I personally feel 
that by somehow organising a linear route through a site only limits 
accessibility and furthermore confuses users into thinking they might be 
"going the wrong way" for optimum viewing. A full table of contents 
ie.links presents all accessible areas anyway so I personally believe 
that site maps belong on the production side of things and probably will 
continue to do so until I see a contrary implementation.

Nope, defined lists are still alive and well, I don't know about how 
pretty the code looks for them though when they start to get three or 
more levels deep.Think I'll go and mull over the W3c specification to  
learn some more about  these specific site map tags.
