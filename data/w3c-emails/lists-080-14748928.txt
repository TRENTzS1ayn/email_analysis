Fairly typical of commercially developed software.  Company cash
flows are critically dependent on getting to market early, so
anything not perceived as essential for that will not get done.

I am not a lawyer and don't know Australian law.  But my understanding
of UK law is that it is the company that is buying the product that
is responsible for providing an accessible service to their employees,
not the suppliers.  Especially in a B to B environment, it is impracticable
to put an implied requirement on a supplier, as they don't, in general,
know the full context in which their product will be used.  If you wanted
an accessible product, this should have been in the invitation to tender
and the subsequent contract terms.
