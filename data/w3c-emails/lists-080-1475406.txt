Yep, it is an element of mutal trust between website creators and browser
creators. With both groups aiming for the same target there is a better
chance of wider range of accessibility.

Good idea, and I agree. We need to know what speech browsers can do, what
they get wrong, where they have difficulty. Phil Jenkins earlier mentioned
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/impl-pr2/> as a starting point. I guess we can add
more to this (especially with feedback from people actually using the
technologies in question) to resolve typical questions/situations - such as
table navigation (my current area of interest), form navigation, etc. I
imagine something like a test suite of accessible pages (like my "accessible
table" attempt page
<http://www.isolani.co.uk/articles/table/group9step6.html> ), and
documenting if assistive technologies can access the information easily.
Documenting how speech browsers can access and manipulate these pages will
probably give a better and more accurate insight into correct markup
techniques than a web designer trying to use a speech browser.
