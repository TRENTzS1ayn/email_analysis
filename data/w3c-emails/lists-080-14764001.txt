Alive and well and likely to stay that way for some time yet as they are in the
XHTML2.0 draft, which also conatins a <nl> element for navigation lists, so
that when that comes into our lives we will indeed have a tag that is specific
to site maps and similar.

In the mean time I agree that definitions are useful and reasonable for this
sort of job.
