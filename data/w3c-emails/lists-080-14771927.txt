Sorry don't think I explain the question very well in my original post.  

I know just using Div wouldn't count as spacing but I have stylise them
using CSS to separate them out.

See http://www.VisionWebisites.co.uk for an example.

DIV tags don't separate anything, they contain DIV elements.

This construct sounds like a list to me, so I would expect the links
to be contained by LI elements in a structural markup.

In any case, if AT cannot add delimiters in response to A element 
boundaries, I don't see why you would expect it to do so for any
other element.

However, I suspect the guideline is particularly thinking about
true hypertext links, which are in an inline context, so could not
legally be wrapped within DIV, anyway.

Delimiting links is necessary for visual use as well.
