The guideline concerns users who for one reason or another won't have visual
distance between links represented to them, and CSS won't help them (indeed
those users who will see those links as separated by the the CSS would also see
them as separate links if there were no CSS).

I agree with David, that they seem to be a list, why not use a list and use CSS
to remove the bullet if you would rather it wasn't there? The menu on my
homepage is such (p.s. the background image is mainly an experiment on the
basis of "I hate background images, I wonder if I can do one I don't personally
hate" feedback on whether it is too high-contrast would be appreciated).
