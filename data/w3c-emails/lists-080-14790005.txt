Hi all, again.

Is the common abbreviation of cutting out the first 2 digits of the year an
accessibility problem?

2003    = '03  or 2004 = '04.

 

Is the abbreviation tag useful for this purpose?  Or is the abbreviation so
common that if used in context it makes as much sense to a visual user as to
somebody accessing the website through a screen reader?

 

Just curious,

  Juan C. Ulloa
