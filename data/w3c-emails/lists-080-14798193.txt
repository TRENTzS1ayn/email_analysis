Actually, abbreviation of years doesn't make any sense to me at all. When 
it's just two digits it's highly confusing (I can't immediately recognize 
it as a year, it might be any number, or a month, or a day); when you use 
an apostrophe you gain just one character, but still lose clarity.

Why not use the full year?
