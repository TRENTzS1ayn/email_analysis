Not accessibility per se, but personally I find such abbreviated years pretty
unreadable for years prior to the '20s, and generally prefer full years even
for the '20s and later (I would have said 1920s or 2020s but I couldn't make my
mind up what '20s would mean these days without a context - that in itself can
make it something to avoid).

If I was marking up text that contained '03 in it and for some reason didn't
want to change the text as presented (say I was quoting and wanted to be
faithful to the quote) I would probably use <abbr>.
