Hey Bob (and others interested),

Check out Open Office (www.openoffice.org).  This *free* suite can open MS
Word docs, and is available for the following platforms:
Windows, Linux (x86)/ Linux (PPC), Solaris (SPARC)/ Solaris (x86), freeBSD,
and Macintosh, in 32 languages to boot.  Seems the Sec 508 violation ain't
what it used to be <grin>.

NOTE: This is in no way an endorsement of using non-W3C technologies
(Priority 2 - 11.1 Use W3C technologies when they are available and
appropriate for a task and use the latest versions when supported.)  It
would be oh-so-simple to provide the text transcript (which is already
"digitized") as HTML.  Why, oh why????

To the original question, Juan, you definitely should be looking at SMIL.
While still very young and poorly supported, it *is* the recommended way of
providing accessible streaming technology.  I have had success using SMIL
with the Real Player; I believe the QuickTime player now supports SMIL as
well, not 100% sure of the Windows Media Player (Windows was working on
their own version last I checked called SAMI).  I suggest as well a Google
for the MAGpie tool, which allows developers to provide the text transcript
for the streaming content.

Good Luck.

JF
