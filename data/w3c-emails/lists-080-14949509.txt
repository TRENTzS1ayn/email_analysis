The two main issues with video accessibility is providing text captions
for audio content and audio descriptions of visual information.  SMIL [1]
provides support for both these features and is supported by Real Player
and Quicktime, although Real Players implementation seems to be easier to
use and provides a means for the user to control the rendering of the
captions and audi descriptions.

MAGPIE [2] is a free utility that can be used to create text captions.

Some captioning tutorials can be found at:
