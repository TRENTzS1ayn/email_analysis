Terrie,
NCAM makes MAGpie which is a tool for creating captions and descriptions for
QT, Real, and WMP.  MAGpie is available at
http://ncam.wgbh.org/webaccess/magpie.

There are lots of great examples out there.  NCAM recently completed a
project studying accessible rich media, and part of the project focused on
the creation of a showcase of examples and some associated tutorials.

Rich media site: http://ncam.wgbh.org/richmedia
Search for examples: http://ncam.wgbh.org/richmedia/examples/index.php
Captioning tutorial:
http://ncam.wgbh.org/richmedia/tutorials/captioning.html

There are examples of other PSA's on the site that you can check out.

One specific example that you might want to check out is the galley of
videos at dignubia.org (http://dignubia.org/galleries/video.php).  These are
QuickTime videos (but could easily have been Real, or both), with captions,
descriptions, and collated text transcripts (in HTML).
