Hi Everyone,

I am working on a site that has a navigation bar on the left side, which is all Java.  There is an alternative hard coded alternative on the bottom of the screen.  I was told that a screen reader wouldn't read the Java, and would skip right to the alternative which is the hard coded menu.  Is this true or if the Java is coded using the Java Accessibility API, the navigation will be accessible?

Thanks
Scott
