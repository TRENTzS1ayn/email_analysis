OpenOffice (which I use) is not perfect and still has lots of trouble with
MS word documents.

BUT and this is personal peeve of mine, why is it always expected that
people with disabilities use all sorts of complex and many times rube
goldberg gyrations to read and use documents that could easily be
accessible if people posting em would make one or two key clicks,  I mean
how hard is it to save Word documents in text format ?????   

this seems to be the norm rather than the exception.  for example rather
than put in a ramp, it is expected that  wheelchair users will be able
to get complex wheelchairs like the ibot......
