John,
 
as somebody has already pointed out...there's only 10 available numbers, and you have 11 links.
So no, there's no way around using at least one non-numeric character.
 
But...but...but...
 
No. There isn't. Sure, you could try creating a convoluted javascript way of capturing key inputs
and looking for numeric combinations of something (e.g. if the user hits ALT+0 twice real fast), but
you probably don't need me to tell you that relying on javascript is not the solution, either.
 
The only advice I can give you: get used to the idea that you HAVE to use at least one non-numeric
character, and/or conglomerate your pages (e.g. why can't "accesskeys" be part of the "accessibility statement" page ? Same for the "disclaimer". Actually, 6,7,8 could all be made into a single page.)

Subject: Question to accesskeys


Hi everybody!

I have a question to accesskeys.

I want to use only numbers for my accesskeys, but on my in construction page I have 11 links. 

And I have planned using: 

S. Skip Navigation 
0. Home 
1. Services 
2. Our Team 
3. Memberships 
4. Site Map 
5. Contact 
6. Privacy & Accessibility Statement 
7. Disclaimer 
8. Accesskeys 
9. Print Version 

Though I still have a problem. I use the accesskey "S" for Skip Navigation, but this accesskey and keystroke is used by IBM HPR for "Settings" and JAWS Laptop Settings (Using IE 5.5/6) for "Changing screen echo". 
See more here:  <http://www.wats.ca/resources/accesskeysandkeystrokes/38> http://www.wats.ca/resources/accesskeysandkeystrokes/38 

Another problem is, I would need accesskeys for my "Contact" forms for: 

- Name 
- E-Mail 
- Comments, etc 

I do not want to use any letters for accesskeys, while see here: 

1. Use numbers for accesskeys  <http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/2003AprJun/0117.html> http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/2003AprJun/0117.html 

2. Accesskeys and Reserved Keystroke Combinations  <http://www.wats.ca/resources/accesskeysandkeystrokes/38> http://www.wats.ca/resources/accesskeysandkeystrokes/38 

Any idea how to get this managed?
 
Thanks in advance,
