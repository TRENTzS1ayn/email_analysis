Hi John,

it is true that there is little you can do to get around the fact that 
keys are reserved by multiple applications. A functionality such as 
skip navigation is likely to be used by screenreaders, and may be the 
only accesskey that screenreader users bother to learn, so ensuring it 
has something that isn't a conflict would seem useful.

One approach is that taken by UBAccess, who provide transformations of 
the page so you can add or remove the accesskeys as a user (similar to 
selecting a text-only page, but in my opinion more useful). I don't 
know if their software allows you to specify which accesskeys you would 
like (either as author or user) but this might be a helpful solution. 
You should, of course, use the link element to the extent possible - by 
adding a profile you can extend it to any navigational element you 
like.

Most people who use screenreaders seem not to use a lot of accesskeys. 
People with severe mobility restrictions often use them very heavily 
(at the WAI "best practices exchange" in Madrid, one of the presenters 
who took part in the Spanish follow-up discussions made this very 
clear).  So having a full set for people who expect most keys to be 
available, and providing a way of mapping a page to add particular 
functionalities for people who want one or two, but need to choose them 
carefully because of system constraints, seems an interesting path to 
follow.

Cheers

Chaals
