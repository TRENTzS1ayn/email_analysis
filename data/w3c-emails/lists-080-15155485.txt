Indeed, that's a strong argument against the use of accesskeys. you force a
behaviour on the user that differs from the one he expects. He will be
frustrated if he is not aware of an alternative way to invoke the requested
functionality.

In my point of view, accesskeys are useful for repetitive actions, but less
interesting for usage on one particular page. The first time the user visits
your contact page he will have to familiarise with your accesskeys(meaning
he will not use them). It is unlikely that he will remember these keys if he
ever returns to this particular page.

> I do not want to use any letters for accesskeys,

This means you can only use them sparingly and I think this is a good
approach with regard to accesskey features.

Kind regards
