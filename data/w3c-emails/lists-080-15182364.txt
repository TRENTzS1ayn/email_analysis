True, but no need for an accesskey once you get to the title attribute. 
Essentially they are useful in two ways

1. for people who are heavy users (people with serious mobility 
limitations) they're handy all over the place - especially if you can 
see them (which most browsers can provide with a style sheet).
2. for pages that people use very often, they become memorable. I guess 
this is the reasoning behind UK government "standard accesskeys" - if 
all sites in the UK government do the same thing people will learn it 
by and by. It's certainly the reson why Sidar is proposing an 
adaptation of them for Spanish-language sites that fit a certain 
pattern...
