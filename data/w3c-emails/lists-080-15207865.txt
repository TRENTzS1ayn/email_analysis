A discussion on the WebDesign-L list got me thinking about list policies 
on accessibility-related lists. On general lists "top posting" is 
generally discouraged, however I've heard that it's beneficial for 
people with vision impairments.

To clarify, top posting is responding to a post above or before the 
quoted post or question.

[Start example]

I think that XYZ is the best solution for FOO.

[End example]

What are the opinions on top posting from this list's vision-impaired 
subscribers?

Thanks,
