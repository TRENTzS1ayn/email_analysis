But angle brackets are a standard method of quote indention. Many GUI 
mail readers will display these sections differently: with a border or a 
different color. Visually impaired users can likewise use this construct 
to understand quoting levels.

Consistency is the key here. How is a screen reader supposed to 
understand what random XML tags are supposed to mean? Not all mailing 
list audiences are as technically proficient as this one. It seems to me 
that unlabeled XML in plain text email would confuse more people that it 
would help.

I don't thing you should indent at all. You are including tab characters 
in plain text email, which are rendered in different character widths on 
many systems and fonts. Especially when using proportional fonts, not 
even spaces are rendered the same width. I like to read my mail in a 
monospace font. You indentions showed up disorganized on my display.

All you other suggestions seem very useful. Thanks!

James
