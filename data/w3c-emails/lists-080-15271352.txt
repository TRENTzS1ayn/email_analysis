w3c-wai-ig readers should note that CSS2.1 deprecates media type aural.

It looks like the intention is to deprecate in favour of a new
media type speech, but media type speech doesn't exist yet to the
level where it can be referenced from a candidate reccommendation,
so CSS2.1 doesn't actually formally say what will replace it!
