Top posting is the most intelegent way to go but it must be done
intelegently.  I've studied a lot of different methods of communicating, and
I've seen a lot of them and when email was yong, all we saw was top posting.
Anything else is scrambled eggs no matter how good you are at searching or
scrolling.

The advantages to top posting are that you will usually already know what is
in the previous message and if not, you can read the response first or skip
down to the original post.  Imagine if we did this backwards and the newest
bits were burried won below several previous osts.  Interleaving stuff is
sort of ok, but jumping through the hoops that must be jumpped through in
order to pick out the new bits after you have already read the old bits can
be tricky and often, there is a lot of message with no comment that you have
to wade through and often, that is at the end of the message so a lot of
time gets waisted that way.

Subject: [WAI-IG] list policies (top posting for vision impairments)



A discussion on the WebDesign-L list got me thinking about list policies
on accessibility-related lists. On general lists "top posting" is
generally discouraged, however I've heard that it's beneficial for
people with vision impairments.

To clarify, top posting is responding to a post above or before the
quoted post or question.

[Start example]

I think that XYZ is the best solution for FOO.

[End example]

What are the opinions on top posting from this list's vision-impaired
subscribers?

Thanks,
James Craig
