actually, I use a screen reader but it makes no difference.  I know many
people who do not use screen readers who find top posting to be of great
benefit.

Hi!

I suspect you'll get different answers from people who use screen
enlargers than from people who use screen readers.  People who use
screen readers are going to have a harder time figuring out the context
of top-posts.  People with low vision (*raises hand*), however, are
going to have more difficulty telling the original message from the
reply if the reply is embedded in the original message.

Hopefully that made some sense.  :)  Top-posting makes my life easier,
but I can certainly understand why someone using a screen reader or a
refreshable Braille display would find top-posting to be Evil And Bad
(tm).

Subject: [WAI-IG] list policies (top posting for vision impairments)


A discussion on the WebDesign-L list got me thinking about list policies

on accessibility-related lists. On general lists "top posting" is
generally discouraged, however I've heard that it's beneficial for
people with vision impairments.

To clarify, top posting is responding to a post above or before the
quoted post or question.

[Start example]

I think that XYZ is the best solution for FOO.

John Doe wrote:
 > ABC is the best solution for FOO.

[End example]

What are the opinions on top posting from this list's vision-impaired
subscribers?

Thanks,
James Craig
