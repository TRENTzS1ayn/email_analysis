  I have, previously, made my views on this topic very well know.
  However, I must take issue with this comment of yours.

  When e-mail was young, in its teens, and in its early adult years
  there were no top posting. This trend is recent even in Internet time.

  As for the advantage ... well. I see none. With your method I first
  read a reply, and THEN need to scroll down to try to figure out what
  exactly it was you replied to.

  With my method, as used here, each respons follows the issue it is
  responding to. It is simple, elegant, a de facto standard ever since
  e-mail was first used, and a logical way for people to work.

  However, I am not vision impaired. I find it hard to believe that any
  person with such difficulties would not use a mail client capable of
  understanding what *is* in effect a standard way of quoting.

  For a person with low or no vision to be forced to scroll up and down,
  up and down, up and down, to keep the current reply and what it
  relates to in focus must be sheer hell. I can't even begin to imagine
  being blind, reading a top-posted reply, and then have to remember
  that entire reply whilst I desperately wade through possibly several
  levels of content ...

  It makes my skin crawl, and would certainly lead me to very quickly
  dismiss e-mail as a viable means of communication. But that's just me.
