Right. But *you* wrote it. It was time killer for one person on this list,
but possibly not for everyone else that might read the message tomorrow, or
see in the web-based archive, or view the message out of context.

Can you define "clear enough"? For whom? In what context? When? Right now as
we read these posts, two Mondays from now when Susan gets back from
vacation? Three months from now when someone searches for "benefits of
top-posting" via Google and ends up in this discussion on the web based
archive?

OK -- now we are getting somewhere. I'm genuinely trying to understand your
point of view here David, because we obviously disagree on the issue. What
is it about it that makes it difficult to deal with?

I've been working with email just as long, and from the beginning, its
always been the other way around. How or why did you first start with top
posting? Was it something that just happened? Based on research? Conventions
of the communities you were communicating with? Again, I'm very curious, and
serious about the question. My habits of not top-posting comes from Usenet,
and Usenet convention is quote and respond. Doing the same for email only
seemed natural to me.

Best regards,
Derek.
