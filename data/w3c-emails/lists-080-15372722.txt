It seems that this thread has headed down another path and isn't really
addressing your original question, as quoted above (old habits die hard!)
<grin>

I currently have no vision problems, other than the fact that sometimes I
fall asleep when I'm working and then have trouble reading the text on web
pages and using email. Really, that is a temporary impairment though, as one
of my two daughters usually yells "wake up Daddy" and my vision comes back
to normal fairly quickly!!! <grin>

Seriously, if we are all to understand this better, then we do need to hear
from people on the list that have some form of visual impairment to better
understand how this issue impacts their using the web/email/whatever.

Best regards,
Derek.
