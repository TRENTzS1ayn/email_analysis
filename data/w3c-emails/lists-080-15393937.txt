Alright I'll speak to the issue which I have already been doing in a way,
but the truth is that it is no different for a visually impaired person than
for anyone else for the same rasons.  Lots of it has to do with how visually
impaired are you, how skilled are you, what do you use to email with, how
long have you been at it, how well do you know the conventions and how much
do you care about them.

Being visually impaired has little to do with my preference for top posting
since I can do any kind of text posting.  My preference has more to do with
what seems simplest and least complex which we have already covered.
