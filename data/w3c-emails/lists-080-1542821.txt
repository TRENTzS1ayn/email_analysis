Hi all,

We are in the process of developing a non-US government web site that facilitates the exchange of large amounts of information, most of which exists as either Word or PDF files. While the word documents contain mostly textual information, a significant proportion of the PDF files contain detailed geographic maps and plans. Understanding the information contained in these maps and plans is central to effective use of the system. 

We have no control over the authoring of these Word and PDF files (the web site simply facilitates the movement of them), and it is critical to the success of the system that users are able to provide information in both Word and PDF format. 

Our question is this: what steps should we take in order to ensure that the site is Level-AA compliant?

We are proposing that a short summary be provided of all textual Word & PDF documents, along with clear directions to users on how to get in touch with someone to request the information in another format or to have it read to them (an email link or telephone number).

For maps and plans, we are proposing that a short two sentence summary be provided, along with clear directions to users on how to get in touch with someone to either request the information in another format or to have the maps and plans described to them (an email link or telephone number). From a practical standpoint, it is going to be extremely onerous to provide detailed descriptions of the visual information contained in the system. 

Given the above considerations about the system itself, would the suggested steps above be considered Level-AA compliant? If the proposed approach is not Level-AA compliant, what steps should we take to ensure that the system does conform with the relevant Level-AA checkpoints?

Thanks, 

Rachel
