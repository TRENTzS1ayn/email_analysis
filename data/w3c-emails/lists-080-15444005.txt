More context would have been better - clear separation of each partial 
quote, and clear information about who made it.

I don't see systems that make this thing work yet (although I hope they 
will at some point). So I am happy when I get what I prefer, less so 
when I don't, and one way or other I try to read what comes down the 
line.

(Clear and simple language is also important to being able to read 
stuff. Sigh)

cheers
