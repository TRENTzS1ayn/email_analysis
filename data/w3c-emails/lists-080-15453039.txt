I tried to clearly separate each part but guess I failed.  Where
interleaving gets really sticky is at the point where you are the third and
beyond discusser in a thread.  Trying to follow that conversation becomes a
study in muddle.  I have never worked with an email client where it did not
take brute force to do anything but top posting, bottom posting or eiterh
stripping the quoted portion.  Even paring it down takes a bit of force.

More context would have been better - clear separation of each partial
quote, and clear information about who made it.

I don't see systems that make this thing work yet (although I hope they
will at some point). So I am happy when I get what I prefer, less so
when I don't, and one way or other I try to read what comes down the
line.

(Clear and simple language is also important to being able to read
stuff. Sigh)

cheers
