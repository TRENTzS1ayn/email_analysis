For me, that makes it much worse.  I can, visually, very easily locate
the new material with the standard quoting style, and for someone who is
blind, the user agent can also do that very easily if it has even the most
basic awareness of email conventions.  The main reason that their authors
might now consider this a low priority is the dominance of Outlook and
the resulting almost universal use of pure top posting.

As I pointed out in another thread, some news reading programs have
had an option to suppress conventionally quoted material for a very
long time, primarily to defend against over quoting (which is, itself,
almost guaranteed by top posting).  (One major USENET server program
has an option to reject articles with more than 50% quote marked, on
the assumption that the user agent uses the old convention.  This is
to prevent over-quoting.)

I do have to adapt your style when using email from the office, as 
Outlook 97 has no regard for established email standards;  it also fails
to respect many other aspects of email standards and conventions.
