I've just come across a piece of mark-up with duplicate alt attributes for img elements. I realise that this isn't valid mark-up but was wondering if AT users could give me an idea of what sort of behaviour this might produce for them. Would the first alt be shown? The second? Neither?

My findings are:
IE6 just shows first alt
Mozilla Firebird just shows first alt
Lynx appears to show second alt.

cheers
