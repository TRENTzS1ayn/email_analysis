dp said:    6. Tool restrictions. If your email tool is line based, top 
    posting is easy
    for you,
    interleaving isn't.
    <poehlman> I'm not sure what a line based email client is, but my
    orientation is line gased so even though I may not have a 
    line based email
    client per se, It works out to be about the same in that I 
    have to search
    for insertion points in order to interleave and that takes time.

daveP. OK, my jargon. Any tool that restricts a user in whatever way,
to getting content one line at a time. 
  Others might be a soft braille display, AT that presents one line at a
time,
A *nix tool that is command line driven etc.
