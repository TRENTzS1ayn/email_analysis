Dave P,

In regard to your question of relevance for how old messages are in a
message, that is why it is usefull to have the deviders as below.  They
provide a clear break between the posters that I can jump through far more
effectively and which is what makes interleaving much more difficult to work
with because these devisions are not apparent.  It is also why trimming can
be difficult unless those lines are left in tact.  It is also what makes
bottom posting difficult since I have to read from bottom to top instead of
reading newer information before older information.  on many threads, I am
more interested in the answers than the questions especially if the answers
embody the question in some form or another.

Just picking up one point from David P.

    even more since in the first instance, I will hear three at
    most and in the
    latter I will hear each one because they are spaced.

daveP.
I think I recall you use Access technology?
So conclusion is that an alternative method of grabbing the who said what
is a desirable improvement?

Or does it matter? Is it enough to comprehend that someone on this thread
said this piece?
What about the semantics of this piece is 3 replies ago, this other one
two replies ago. Is that useful information?

regards DaveP.
