An invitation to participate in the: Metadata for Accessibility Workshop

Date: 9:30-4:30 Friday 30th April 2004

Location: CEN Rue de Stassart 36, B-1050 Brussels

Organized by: CEN/ISSS WS/MMI-DC
In conjunction with:
    CEN/ISSS WS/LT APLR (Accessibility Properties for Learning 
Resources) Project
    DC Accessibility Working Group

You are invited to participate in a special one day open workshop 
session of
the next meeting of the CEN/ISSS MMI-DC Workshop. This open workshop 
will be
held in the CEN/CENELEC Meeting Centre, Rue de Stassart, B-1050 
Brussels on 30
April 2004. The aim of the workshop is to identify and investigate the 
way
that metadata can help achieve efficient and future-proof solutions to
accessibility. It is assumed that this encompasses the provision of 
adequate
access to information for people with disabilities and for everyone in a
multilingual and multicultural environment. The environments include:
1. e-government,
2. e-business,
3. e-education and more.

A wide range of participants is expected to find this workshop of 
interest,
including those who wish to present their case for:
1. what is needed,
2. what is available and should be respected,
3. what is not available but is necessary, and
4. what they want people to know about.

All participants will be expected to submit a short summary of their
particular interests in this context (maximum of 2 pages). As a group, 
the
workshop will consider a number of perspectives and scenarios and 
develop a
report that WS-MMI-DC will make publicly available online after the 
workshop.
Those who cannot attend but would like to contribute papers are welcome 
to do
so.
The number of participants will be limited so you are urged to register 
(at no
charge) as soon as possible (or to submit short papers).

Please register your provisional acceptance to this invite by 14 March 
2004 .
Papers should be submitted by 14 April 2004.
