Any accessibility problem using a title attribute in the anchor tag?  
For example:
<a href="http://www.somedest.com" title="opens a new browser window">link text"</a>

Cool, thanks. The example I'm working on has to have an icon with alt
text by these links , so something like this HTML example?

<a href="test.html" target="_blank">Some link <img src="winicon.gif"
alt="Link will open in new window"></a>

Hi all,

Where some sort of warning is used with links which open in a new window
or popup (like an icon with alt text or text "link will open in new
window", is it best to have this before or after the link itself? I'm
mainly thinking of how this affects screen reader or braille reader
users.

Cheers,
Rebecca Cox
