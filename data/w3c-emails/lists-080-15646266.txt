Rebecca, if you think this through logically, then anyone getting a serial
flow of information wants to know, *before* they follow the link, if there
is any unusual/unexpected behaviour to ensue. A hint after they have done so
and nothing has apparently happened is less helpful, to my way of thinking
at least.
