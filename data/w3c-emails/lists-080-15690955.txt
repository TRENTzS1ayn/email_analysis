David, I agree that many of us want to be informed before a new window is 
launched - but the author has already coded a target="_blank" informing 
both the browser and the screen reader what will happen when the link is 
selected.  Why tell the author to yet add more notification - why not just 
have the browser and or screen reader have the option of informing the 
user?  Such as Opera browser does today by allowing the user to turn off 
spawning new windows.  My point is not to disagree with the requirement - 
my point is to disagree with the author doing the extra work of adding the 
before icon that all users will not be able to turn off if they need to.
