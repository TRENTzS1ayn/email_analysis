This is *one* possibility to open a new window.
Furthermore, if we would rely on target attributes only, what about those
sites using frames? The screenreader would announce that every link will
open a new window.
I have no idea whether it will be that easy to provide a screenreader with
the feature to announce spawned windows. It sounds like building in a pop-up
killer in a screenreader. I agree with you that the browser should provide
this possibility to the user, but it is not a screenreader's task.

P.s. at this moment JAWS announces that a new window has been opened, but
not that it will be opened if you click the link.

Sincerely,
