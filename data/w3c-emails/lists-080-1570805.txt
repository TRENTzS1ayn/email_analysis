How about using the title attribute of the form fields?

Example:

<label for='foo'>Foo!</label>
<input type='text' id='foo' name='foo' size='32' maxlength='64'
title='Enter your value for foo here; this field is mandatory'
tabindex='99' />

For testing, Mozilla displays these titles as a 'tooltip'.

Cheers
