I agree that there is code to inform the user if implemented by the
environment but many environments still do not inform.  The reason the
author has to do it is because it is an authoring decision to code in this
way and therefore, the responsibility of the author till corrected in the
user world to do it.

David, I agree that many of us want to be informed before a new window is
launched - but the author has already coded a target="_blank" informing
both the browser and the screen reader what will happen when the link is
selected.  Why tell the author to yet add more notification - why not just
have the browser and or screen reader have the option of informing the
user?  Such as Opera browser does today by allowing the user to turn off
spawning new windows.  My point is not to disagree with the requirement -
my point is to disagree with the author doing the extra work of adding the
before icon that all users will not be able to turn off if they need to.
