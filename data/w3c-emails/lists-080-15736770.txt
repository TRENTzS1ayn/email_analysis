It shouldn't imply that. All that should be implied is that software 
which fails to provide a warning is (in that respect) inferior to 
software which does.

It might not cause harm from a point of view which strictly considers 
accessibility, however it does:

* Increase work required from the developer
* Increase (very slightly) bandwidth and data storage requirements
* Provide false information to some users
* Provide duplicate information to some users

I would consider all of the above 'harm', although perhaps not to 
accessibility.

As Phil Jenkins said - the information that a new window will open is 
already available to the user agent. It has been that way since it was 
possible for an author to prompt the browser to open a new window, and 
user agents which take advantage of this information already exist.
