Hi folks,

this is to let you know that Jonathan Chetwynd has launched an IRC 
channel [1] for discussion of accessibility. It's on the server 
irc.freenode.net and is called #accessibility

Thanks to Jim Ley it is logged, and there is a chumpbot [2] running. If 
you don't know what a chumpbot is, it listens to the channel, and if 
you put a URI on a line by itself it records it. You can add a title, 
or other comments, and there is a summary page that shows the things 
that it "chumped". This might be easier to read than the log - not so 
much extraneous information. At the moment it is just XML - we are in 
the process of putting an HTML version in place.

The idea of this channel is to provide an instantaneous place to 
discuss accessibility - it should be an interesting complement to this 
list, where you can see if you can get a quick answer to a question, or 
talk about something that's been bugging you.

It's not endorsed by anyone - it's a personal initiative of Jonathan's 
that hopefully will be helpful, useful and friendly.

cheers

Chaals
