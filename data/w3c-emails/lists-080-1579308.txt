Are you using the table just so you can have a column to indicate whether
the field is optional or not?

You could hide the table headers best by not using them to begin with.  Use
CSS to line up the <input> fields if needed.  Enclosing a form in a table
can be problematic if you need users to navigate the table in table mode and
enter information in forms mode.  Switching back and forth is possible, but
a pain.    

Regarding the indication that the field is mandatory, I assume that you tell
sighted users what the asterisk means.  Keep doing that and make sure that
the asterisk is in the label.  On top of that, using the title attribute is
a good idea.
