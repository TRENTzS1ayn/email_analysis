The problem with this is that title already has a pretty well defined
meaning for this element; it should be the same as the title element
content on target resource.  For an external link like this, it should
either match the title element, or be what the title element would have
been if the author had been competent, or the media type had supported
one.

Your usage is based on the misinterpretation that title = tool tip.
