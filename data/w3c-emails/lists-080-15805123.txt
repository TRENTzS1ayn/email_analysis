The full definition is as follows:

<http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/struct/global.html#adef-title>
<quoth>
          This attribute offers advisory information about the element
          for which it is set.

   Unlike the [96]TITLE element, which provides information about an
   entire document and may only appear once, the [97]title attribute may
   annotate any number of elements.
</quoth>

The title attribute is *unlike* the <title> element.

You the author may make your title attribute equal to the <title> element
of some other document, for whatever strange reason you may have, but it
is in no way required. It doesn't even make sense.

I know that in the last two weeks, WCAG has suddenly decided that the
title attribute exists and must contain part of the <title> element, but
this is nonsense. There isn't a single standards-compliant Web developer
who uses title attributes who uses them only that way. It's a terrible
idea.

Oh, I *see*.

A title functionally *is* a tooltip for most users, including a large
number of people with disabilities.
