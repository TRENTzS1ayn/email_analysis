Neither of those apply on the WWW as a whole, which is a heterogenous
browsing environment.  Accessibility warnings serve to help document
authors ensure they cater for all readers - including minorities to
whom none of a set of specific situations (such as you enumerated) apply.

OTOH that particular warning may(?) have outlived its usefulness now
that browsers in real life give their users more control.
