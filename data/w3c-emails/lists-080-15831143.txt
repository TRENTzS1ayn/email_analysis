Not sure if this has been raised before but I have just been looking at the latest working draft for WCAG 2.0 and noticed a significant change between the 24 June 2003 and 27 October 2003 versions. In the former there are explicit references to a system of prioritisation for checkpoints that make it possible to 'rate' the accessibility of a site in a way that is currently possible with WCAG 1.0. However, in the October version these appear to have been removed. 

Working in local government I have a legal obligation to provide priority 2 pages as a minimum but I see no way that the latest WCAG 2 draft provides a grading system that can be see as an equivalent. I guess that those having to develop to 508 standards will have similar questions.
