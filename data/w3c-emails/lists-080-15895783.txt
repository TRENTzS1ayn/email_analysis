Can anyone tell me whether any screen reader supports the <optgroup> tag 
at all? I have tested with Window Eyes, JAWS, and Home Page Reader, and 
none of them seem to read the optgroup correctly, though for some reason 
JAWS does read the first optgroup heading--and only the first optgroup 
heading--in my test file:

I would appreciate it if people with screen readers could either tell me 
how to access the optgroup, or else tell me authoritatively that they 
don't support it.
