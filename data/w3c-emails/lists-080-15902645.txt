Hi again,

Ok, from what I have been able to gather by consulting the WAI policy links page, comments received and from other research, the following countries have a procurement policy or guidelines that take disabilities issues into account (whether these policies or guidelines are respected or not) :

Australia
Ireland
The UK
The US (and some of its states)
Canada (and the province of Ontario)
Maybe Sweden ???

To be honest, the material is not easy to consult so any further comments would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks,

Catherine

Subject: accessible procurement policies


Greetings all,

I am researching the aformentionned subject and would like to get information about which countries have adopted accessible government procurement policies for information technologies.  I know the States have section 508, Canada has its own policy as well as the province of Ontario.  Which other countries, if any, have adopted similar strategies ?

Thanks for your input,

Catherine
