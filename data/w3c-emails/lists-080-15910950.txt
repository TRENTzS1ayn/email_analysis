Hello,

This might be a bit off topic but since this issue has been raised, I
would like to make a comment or two.  *smile* 

So what are the benefits of having regulations on IT accessibility,
especially if they are not followed? Well written guidelines and
regulations would be worth following.  If people are aware and willing
to learn web accessibility, someone will need to guide them to the right
direction. And that's where regulations come in. 

Then if you do have regulations on IT accessibility to be respected,
should they be "punished" for not following the regulations? Please
correct me if I am wrong but I heard they have to pay fine in Australia
if they do not follow.  It is sad for me to know  that they have to
"force" people to understand importance of accessibility and follow this
kind of regulations.  

Well, just my point of view.  



Keiko
