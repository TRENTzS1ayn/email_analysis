Hi,

although I may have gotten this wrong, but with "accessible procurement
policies" u mean: laws to make the public (in this case the internet)
accessible for handicapped people...?

there is a "disabled-equalization-law" (if u translate it litteraly) in
germany. It's called BGG (Bundes-Behinderten-Gleichstellungs-Gesetz). I
found mainly information in german:

http://wob11.de/gesetze/index.html (in german)
http://www.webforall.info/html/englisch/_index.php (parts in english)

I figuerd u have already been here: http://www.w3.org/WAI/Policy/. There is
a link to the BITV (barrier-free-information-technology-decree) which is
also mentioned in the BGG as a guideline. This guideline also is in german
and i have not found a translation of it in english yet. It states a
"priotity 1" and a "priority 2" which are similar to the WAI-Priotities
(http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/full-checklist.html#wc-priority-1), but for
some reasons they reduced the number of priorities from 3 to 2 which does
not mean that priority2 (BITV) is equal priority2 (WAI). The whole thing
looks a lot like being put together from all 3 of the WAI priorities.

cheers

Martin

p.s.:

@keiko: yes it is poor human kind did not evolve into the peacful tolerant
and wise people of tomorrow :o( here in germany we have like austria a law,
so that websites of public interest (not private or commercial sites) have
to be accessible for handicaped people. so, what good is a law if people who
are not obeying it don't get punished (...like in paying a fine...)? i think
that is a good thing - and the right direction for human kind ;)

...just my 2 cent...

Hello,
This might be a bit off topic but since this issue has been raised, I
would like to make a comment or two. *smile*
So what are the benefits of having regulations on IT accessibility,
especially if they are not followed? Well written guidelines and
regulations would be worth following. If people are aware and willing
to learn web accessibility, someone will need to guide them to the right
direction. And that's where regulations come in.
Then if you do have regulations on IT accessibility to be respected,
should they be "punished" for not following the regulations? Please
correct me if I am wrong but I heard they have to pay fine in Australia
if they do not follow. It is sad for me to know that they have to
"force" people to understand importance of accessibility and follow this
kind of regulations.
Well, just my point of view.


Keiko
