  How about avoiding that - what, after all, does an asterisk have to do
  with something being mandatory ? I'd suggest something like:

   <label for="field">Foo (mandatory information)</label>
    <input type="text"
            id="field"
             name="foo"
              value="">

  styled to fit with CSS, naturally. You might want to fill in a
  suitable value, but I'm not going to re-open that debate.

  The above should work just as well for sighted and non-sighted users,
  as well as anything inbetween.
