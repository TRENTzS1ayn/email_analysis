The best response I have got is "old screen readers and Netscape" - 
from the times so long ago (6 years) when forms were new, non-standard, 
and the little boxes were not clear to systems that tried to explain 
the text on the screen.

In which case a space would probably not be the thing that triggered a 
useful response.

I can't vouch for the accuracy of this already vague information, nor 
am I equipped to test it, but maybe somebody can do better having this 
much extra... Reading the archives of the WCAG group through 1998 might 
also be enlightening.

cheers
