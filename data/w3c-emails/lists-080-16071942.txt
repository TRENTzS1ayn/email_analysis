Hi Claire, all

The basics are that there isn't a fixed fine, but people can pay 
damages, and that the Human Rights Commission decide what "reasonable 
progress" means - and have shown they are prepared to make serious 
investigations and determinations on the topic.

There has been one case in Australia in which damages were assessed at 
AUD $20,000 because Bruce Maguire was deprived of his right to equal 
enjoyment of information about the Sydney Olympic Games. There are not 
specific timelines, but the legislation is designed to solve people's 
problems, and if the commission feels that a respondent is not actually 
following out their responsibilities in part or full they can assess 
damages. In the SOCOG case one of the things I thought was interesting 
about the judgement was that despite rejecting the respondent's 
arguments about how difficult the job was, they stated that even had 
they accepted the argument, the orders made would still stand, and 
consequently the damages claim would be awarded if they failed carry 
out the repairs ordered in the relevant time specified for that case.

cheers
