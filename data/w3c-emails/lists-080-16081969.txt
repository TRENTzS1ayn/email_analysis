I know but that's not what I meant, David. My point was, who are the
experts here? It sure is good to have a standard you can refer to when
you need help, but should it be ruled by the government? I'm afraid,
some things, especially good things, tend to be ignored when government
comes to rule. I'm not talking only about any possible punishment or
budgets to be involved here. What are the reasons it should be
government ruled? Don't get me wrong though I am not talking about
wheather or not it should be. I just want to know why you think it
should be, if you think it should. If anyone thinks it shouldn't, I want
to hear his/her opinions too.  *smile*

No contractor and particularly no government contractor will
code for accessibility without them.

They meet your international obligations, e.g. for the UK to
meet EEC legislation, and therefore you can claim that 
everyone is on a "level playing field".

If you didn't have prescriptive rules, but relied on the customer's
judgement of accessibility, most big government contractors would not
want to bid; they do not want contract completion, and therefore
payment, to be at the whim of the customer.
