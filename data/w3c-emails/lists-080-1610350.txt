I can at least attest that a space would probably not help.  In fact, what
worked was explicit text that said, "Type your information here.", or
something to that effect.  I believe old lynx had a similar issue but that
was around 1998 too.  There may be simple at in use today that have this
issue still and there may also be cognative issues as well but I am not
certain.

The best response I have got is "old screen readers and Netscape" -
from the times so long ago (6 years) when forms were new, non-standard,
and the little boxes were not clear to systems that tried to explain
the text on the screen.

In which case a space would probably not be the thing that triggered a
useful response.

I can't vouch for the accuracy of this already vague information, nor
am I equipped to test it, but maybe somebody can do better having this
much extra... Reading the archives of the WCAG group through 1998 might
also be enlightening.
