Martin,

Thanks for your comment. : ) We don't have a regulation on accessibility
here yet but I think it is good at this stage of IT development. Too few
people here understand what web accessibility is and why you ever need
to pay attention to it. I wish people could see what underlies here.
Accessibility was not only about web. We need to care about other people
more... : ) 
...anyway, off topic... 

Keiko

p.s.:

@keiko: yes it is poor human kind did not evolve into the peacful
tolerant
and wise people of tomorrow :o( here in germany we have like austria a
law,
so that websites of public interest (not private or commercial sites)
have
to be accessible for handicaped people. so, what good is a law if people
who
are not obeying it don't get punished (...like in paying a fine...)? i
think
that is a good thing - and the right direction for human kind ;)

...just my 2 cent...
