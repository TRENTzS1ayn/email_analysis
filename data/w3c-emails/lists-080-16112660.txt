one table or many?  I envision a header element followed by a table 
containing a column of dates and a column of jobs/schools/other.  This 
would be repeated some number of times in the document.  You could even 
use a table caption instead of a header element in some cases, but right 
now there is better support for viewing and navigating document 
structure by headers than by table captions.
