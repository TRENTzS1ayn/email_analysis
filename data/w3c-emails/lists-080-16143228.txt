The use of definition lists for general name/value pairs is a bit of a stretch
of the semantics, but a common one (em, I thought, maybe I'm completely wrong
on this). I've seen it similarly used for heirarchical data and it's only just
occurring to me that perhaps this is HTML abuse.

?
You mean my old-fashioned spelling of vit?? Well using the ligature in a Latin
word seems correct to me from my very limited knowledge of Latin orthography.
Using it in English words such as arch?ology is something I did once in what I
realise now was a pretentious affectation, but still do because I'm used to it.
So whether I'm being correct or pretentious depends on whether you consider
"curriculum vit?/vitae" to be Latin or English derived from Latin.
If the Americans can defend reducing ligatured ae and oe to a mere ugly e then I
can much more easily defend retaining the ligature. I did worry about how it
might appear given that I was looking for a job at the time I first wrote it
and at the time google could find no English-language use of "curriculum vit?"
rather than "curriculum vitae" though of course it could find plenty of uses of
vit? (in particular with regards to Vatican documents). Now "curriculum vit?"
appears to be a lot more common, I wonder if I've started a trend.
