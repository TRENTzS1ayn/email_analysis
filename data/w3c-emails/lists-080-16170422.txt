From <http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/lists.html>:
"Another application of DL, for example, is for marking up dialogues, with each
DT naming a speaker, and each DD containing his or her words."

That clearly isn't a matter of terms and descriptions, so I think it justifies
the use of <dl> for general name/value pairs. I'm now happy again that this
isn't HTML abuse, and indeed is quite appropriate.
