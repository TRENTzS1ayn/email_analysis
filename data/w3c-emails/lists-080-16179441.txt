On the Access Board web site, they provide the following guidance: 

"In general, the "safest" and most useful form of style sheets are
"external" style sheets, in which the style rules are set up in a
separate file."

My question is if a web page includes html font tags and an external
style sheet will this override user-defined style sheets?  The html font
tags are hard coded throughout the page.  

For Example:
<font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Text</font>

Thanks in advance,
Kim
