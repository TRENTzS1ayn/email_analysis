Hello Lisa Marie,

Thanks for your input.

As you are an Accessibility Coordinator at a school,
do you know what link text would be preferred by people
who uses a braille- or screen reader?

Also, would you use other link text than my three
suggestions?

Clarification SUGGESTION 2
< a href="uri" title="Blackbird">Audio file, MP3, 100 KB</a >
(I omitted the 'type' attribute.)

Regards
Thomas Jedenfelt
