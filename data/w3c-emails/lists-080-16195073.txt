<QUOTE>
Many sites give (their estimate of) download time,
rather than play time.  Since your largest files
are not the longest, I assume you gave playing
time.

I would use:

1. Blackbird__[1 minute MP3, 100 KB]

but keeping the redundant "Audio File" or "Blackbird Song"
might still make sense for some audiences.
