It depends on the context, but you wouldn't want the size and format
as part of the text unless you were offering different formats and
different bit rates for the same recording (or for different recordings
but you expected them to be chosen on those attributes, rather than
the contents.  The most important part of the link text is the
name of the bird, although you seem not to consider it part of 
the link text at all!

If these were used in a true hypertext context, I would expect
something like [] marks the link:

The [sound of a blackbird] is....

However it looks like you are presenting a menu, not using hypertext, so
one would expect shorter link text as most should be implied by the
context.

You can put more information in a title attribute, but note that some
browsers will use the title attribute in preference to the link text,
in lists of links, at least until they have seen the referenced
resource, so it should make sense on its own.
