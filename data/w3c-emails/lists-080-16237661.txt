Dear Kim,

Without wishing to seem rude, it isn't hard to make a simple web page with
attached style sheet and embedded fonts, and see for yourself what happens,
surely? It should only take you a few minutes to test, not much more than
composing and sending your original message <smile />

(You can always borrow one of the many publicly available style sheets if
you are not confident enough in CSS to make your own yet. I have a couple on
my web site for example, at http://lois.co.uk/services/access.shtml#styles.
They are not beautiful, but more than adequate for testing. You can use the
sample pages too, and add some font tags. Don't forget to test in a few
browsers, as the results may not be identical.)
