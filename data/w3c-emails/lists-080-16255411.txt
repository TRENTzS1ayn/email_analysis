Hi Kim, Lois, ...

Well, it doesn't take masses of time, if you have a lot of browsers 
already installed and know where to look in the specification.

According to CSS specification font elements in HTML are supposed to be 
over-ridden by almost everything. The specific approach is that they 
are given a particular place in the CSS cascade which is very low on 
the priority order. You could look at the "Cascade" section of the CSS 
specifications. (And yes, testing this stuff in lots of browsers would 
be cool. Looking in the CSS test suite to find out what they already 
know would be a sensible way to reduce your workload).

Cheers

Chaals
