Browsers are not the right tool to deal with 'raw' RSS: they may show you 
the XML elements but are not made to interpret the data - so I use an RSS 
reader. While there are browser-based systems (like Amphetadesk), these 
systems actually *interpret* the RSS feeds to make sense of the data in 
presentation, and these can be useful away from home. Generally a 
speciallized RSS client is much to be preferred: they are made to make 
sense of the data itself and present that data by interpreting it (much 
more than "node tree", the actual data in the tree), rather than just 
displaying the XML which IMO is pretty useless except for debugging purposes.

What can be done about it? Tell people to use an RSS reader - there are 
plenty about, including very good free ones.
