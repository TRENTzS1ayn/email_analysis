From: Jesper Tverskov 


I have started experimenting making RSS feeds to serve my articles
about universal web design that way too, but I am not ready yet. I see many
accessibility problems I would like to know the answer to.

 
My experiments show that it is easy if you know XSLT to make a node
tree from scratch serving it as XHTML to any browser without JavaScript. But
I don't expect most  web page authors will ever get but a simple knowledge
of XML and never to get near XSLT.

How are other members of the list dealing with RSS Feeds or rather
with the presentation of the XML node tree,  and what can be done about it?

There is another way that XML on the web can be transformed into readable
XHTML.

Add <?xml-stylesheet type="text/xsl" href="../style3.xsl" ?> before the
first tag,
where the href attribute points to a conversion stylesheet that works with
your
version of rss.

It won't work in lynx. It will only work in ie if the user has an up to date
msxsl
'plug-in' and Moz works AFAIK.
