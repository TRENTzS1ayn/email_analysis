Matthew's Reply:

I don't see RSS as something that needs to be viewed through a Web browser, 
unless one is working in a development environment.  If I wanted to present RSS 
feeds on a Web page, I would use server-side scripting to pull in the RSS from 
various sources, then combine (aggregate) it and present it to the viewer as 
(X)HTML.

 From my own experience, this can be achieved fairly easily using Perl.

The aggregation tool needs to produce accessible content (and should probably 
comply with the Authoring Tool guidelines - I do not feel that we need to worry 
about the accessibility of RSS or displaying the node tree since it is primarily 
for machines, not humans.

Cheers
