But again, that works on a technical level, but from a usability point
of view it's dreadful, as users have to delete the lengthy placeholder
text. Imagine a long form with 10-20 input fields, all with this
type of placeholder text.

Maybe this will make me sound discriminatory, but...is it worth
accommodating for what is obviously a bug in very old (>6 years ?)
technology at the detriment of usability for the majority of users ?

Or maybe I'm just being polemic...
