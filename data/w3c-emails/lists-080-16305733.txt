Also put focus on RSS.

We should look at the node tree, RSS is just an example of it's use.
Many people wanting to use a RSS feed first time will look into the
XML-file to see if it looks right. Also the node tree is a very handy
way to present data quick and dirty especially if data is stored as XML
files. You just link to the xml-file and the user can see the
information stored. That is one of the great advantages of XML. I
predict that this use of the node tree will become very common on the
web.

So the problem is that some browsers are showing us node trees very
nicely, but not the way an ordinary XHTML file is rendered, the source
file send by the server is XML not XHTML, the browser is doing the
transformation. Other browsers show us nothing useful, and nobody will
probably bother making node trees as XHTML to be used in any browser. Or
what?
