Patrick suggested,

    How about offering two options: one the pure RSS feed, one 
    the feed transformed into XHTML. Users that don't have a 
    specific RSS reader or browser capable of sensibly 
    displaying XML can use the alternate XHTML'ised feed...i.e. 
    "if you can't make it accessible, provide an accessible 
    alternative"...


This is done quite regularly for feeds that don't change minute by minute.
For diary class of blogs it provides the readable html and the machine
processable xml of the rss.


http://tbray.org/ongoing/ provides an idea, each year, month and date
has its own webpage when the author adds something. The rss feed is at
a separate url.

An XSLT transformation from XML to accessible HTML provides the people
version.
