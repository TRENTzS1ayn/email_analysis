Hi Kim

If I have read your question correctly you are talking about the cascade
of style sheets.

In-line formatting such as:
<font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Text</font>

Will override anything you have declared in the external style sheet.

There are 3 places to declare the style of a HTML tag:
1. in-line
2. in the head of the HTML page
3. in an external file  

If you think about it in the simplest of ways: The browser will 'look'
for instructions on how to display a tag firstly in-line, then in the
header, then externally, the 'closest' instruction will take priority.

Hope that's clear
Angela

Subject: Stylesheet question


On the Access Board web site, they provide the following guidance: 

"In general, the "safest" and most useful form of style sheets are
"external" style sheets, in which the style rules are set up in a
separate file."

My question is if a web page includes html font tags and an external
style sheet will this override user-defined style sheets?  The html font
tags are hard coded throughout the page.  

For Example:
<font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Text</font>

Thanks in advance,
Kim
