I'd almost go as far as saying that, perhaps, the pure XML feed should
not be directly "clickable" for a human user at all...but that would require
a standard auto-discovery mechanism for RSS readers (then again, there may
already be something along those lines...I have to admit this is an area I
only lightly dabbled in).

An interesting approach I saw a while back was the use of (client-side) XSL
to present RSS feeds in a nicer way...but again, this does not solve the
issue of browsers that don't know what to do with the XML in the first place...
