Microsoft has made major efforts to address the special needs that WAI 
emphasizes.

1. The Wide Range of Abilities and Its Impact On Computer Technology

RESEARCH STUDY SHOWS 57 PERCENT OF ADULT COMPUTER USERS CAN BENEFIT FROM 
ACCESSIBLE TECHNOLOGY

Accessible computer technology, often associated only with people with 
disabilities, can benefit a much larger segment of the population, 
according to a study conducted by Forrester Data and commissioned by 
Microsoft Corp. While accessibility options were originally designed for 
people with disabilities, the Forrester study shows that 57 percent of 
current working-age computer users may benefit from accessible technology 
because of mild to severe vision, hearing, dexterity, speech and cognitive 
difficulties and impairments. As the U.S. population continues to age, the 
number of people who experience these impairments will increase, and more 
people will likely turn to accessible technology to mitigate the effects of 
their changing physical abilities.
