Hi Lois, thanks for the help.  I already know how to create a style
sheet.  I am testing someone else's site right now and am unsure of the
508 guidelines when it comes to inline styles vs css.  This site uses
both a css and in some pages includes inline styles.  What I would like
to know is if this makes it non-compliant bc inline styles overwrite a
user-defined style sheets?  I was unsure if inline styles actually
overwrite what a user would set for their style sheet.  Any comments
would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!
Kim
