current working-age computer users may benefit from accessible technology
because of mild to severe vision, hearing, dexterity, speech and cognitive
difficulties and impairments."


Oh no!! is there any hope for us???? Doomed, we are all doomed. The number
of disabled people is higher than most people think at an average of 10
percent of population according to figures I have seen, I am now totaly
suicidal at 57 percent. Lets face it at that rate of deterioration we could
leave this mortal coil faster than the dinosaurs.

"As the U.S. population continues to age, the
number of people who experience these impairments will increase, and more
people will likely turn to accessible technology to mitigate the effects of
their changing physical abilities."

What about the rest of us living in Acidrainia (formerly know as the world)
or is the Mr Gates collective not concerned? or do I sniff a marketing ploy
here?

I recently slammed an organization (social fund funded) whose project was to
get disabled people of benefits and into paid employment. Whilst candidates
were making excellent baskets by the end of one of their courses, they were
failing miserably at actually getting people into jobs. The answer was to
redefine the word disabled to include people that wore glasses or had bad
backs. Suddenly the stats sheet improved, which had the added benefit of
securing the next round of funding. I suspect we have the same principle
here, designed to panic with a potential solution being offered to a
relieved population.

I wait for the sale pitch...... ah here it is

"Accessible technology has the potential to powerfully extend, expand, and
enhance user experience and productivity."
