I suggest you look at the CSS 2.1 draft.  The exact precedence of
different sources, including presentational attributes is, I think,
one of the key things they wanted to clarify.

Of the top of my head, a user !important style ought to be able to
override everything; in the sense that IE accessibilty options for
fonts and colours are an interface onto the user style sheet, it is
certainly the case that real implemenations override authors completely.

If by inline styles, you mean ....style="property: value; ..."..., the
real objection to them is that they encourage slopply coding practices
in which there is no consistent style, and are, essentially, no better
than using font elements.
