Hi,

To continue making my homepage as accessible as possible I checked it
using the checklist of checkpoints [1], but I still have some
questions about checkpoints of priority 3 that i do not understand
very well:
- - 9.4 Says "Create a logical tab order through links, form controls,
and objects", but do I have to do this explicit using the attribute
tabindex? Currently I have not used this attribute and I have a
logical tab order (checked it with mozilla, opera, MSIE and Lynx) so
can I just leave it as it is now?
- - 13.6 says "Group related links, identify the group (for user
agents), and, until user agents do so, provide a way to bypass the
group." Currently my navigationbar is surrounded by a div: <div
id="navigationMenu">...</div>. Should I change the div into a <map>,
like in the example of this checkpoint [2]?

Thank you! Kind regards,
Jeroen Budts
