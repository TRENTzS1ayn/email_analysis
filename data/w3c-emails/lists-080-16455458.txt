No need to use tabindex, if the order is already logical in the flow of
the document itself (actually, I found that because of buggy implementation,
Mozilla - can't remember which version - has had problems with tabindex: if
present anywhere in the document, it will only tab/cycle through the ones
with a tabindex, and completely ignore the ones without; not sure if this
has been fixed in the current version of Mozilla - may be worth testing).

Some people will say that you must use <map>, others will say that <div> is
fine...I may hazard to say that it comes down to personal preference *ducks*
Consider adding a "skip to the content" or "skip navigation" link or set of such
links to bypass such groups.
