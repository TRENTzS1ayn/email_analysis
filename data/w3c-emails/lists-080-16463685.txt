Hi Lois,

this argument is pretty well understood I think, but having an actual 
reference from outside that explains it is always useful. (At the very 
least as a way to start a discussion <grin/>).

I would suggest offering stuff like this to the WAI education and 
outreach group, or at least checking in a few days to see if they have 
picked up on it. (There's no guarantee that anyone in that group reads 
this list, nor that nobody does, and cross-posting tends to be a pain 
in my life already. Besides, I don't know what their approach is to 
people who are not working group members providing information that is 
clearly related to what the working group is doing.)

cheers (and thanks for the pointer - I found it interesting :-)
