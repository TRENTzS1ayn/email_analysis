Hello,

Using JAWS 5.0, I have noticed on various websites the use of drop down
lists that have no go button.  Instead, the non-disabled user would click on
the list, hold down a mouse button, and pull down the list until the desired
item is reached, and then letting go of the button with the desired page
popping up.  With JAWS, I noticed that when in forms mode, each item that is
highlighted activates the auto redirect feature.  An example of this is on
the web page of Washington Mutual at:

http://www.wamu.com

The first item that would be recognized as a form field by JAWS is one of
these kinds of pull down boxes.

What is the remedy for this kind of problem?  Does the end user with a
screen reader need to adjust his computer or should the element be designed
differently to avoid auto activation of list elements when they are pulled
down?  If both are possible, how could each be accomplished?

Kelly
