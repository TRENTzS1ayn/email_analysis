Hello,

Using JAWS 5.0, I have noticed on various websites the use of drop down
lists that have no go button.  Instead, the non-disabled user would click on
the list, hold down a mouse button, and pull down the list until the desired
item is reached, and then letting go of the button with the desired page
popping up.  With JAWS, I noticed that when in forms mode, each item that is
highlighted activates the auto redirect feature.  An example of this is on
the web page of Washington Mutual at:
