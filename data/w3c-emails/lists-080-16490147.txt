Hello Kelly,

to avoid triggering the behaviour, with Internet Explorer you have to 
use a different method for going through the items (I think alt-arrow 
instead of plain arrows). The best solution would be fixing Internet 
Explorer so its behaviour was more intuitive. In the meantime users 
just have to learn how the interface works as is.

To stop the behaviour, you can put the go button back (implemented 
properly to work with or without javascript), instead of triggering 
from an onChange event in the menu itself. (There are other solutions, 
but they are more complicated and don't work very intuitively).

I'm not blind, but I navigate by keyboard a lot. It's an annoying 
behaviour (but I haven't used IE for a long time, which is another 
solution).

cheers
