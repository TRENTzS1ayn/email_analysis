We have also linked a style sheet to our feed: http://www.wats.ca/wats.xml.  Note, while this provides a formatted presentation, none of the "permalinks" or active hyperlinks are "clickable" or active, as the <a> anchor element is not present in the original feed.  One other method is to provide a partially formatted, but un-styled feed using a server side (PHP) script: http://www.zaphodbeeblebrox.com/RSS/zaphod.php (Note: this is a "code snip" intended for server-side includes)
