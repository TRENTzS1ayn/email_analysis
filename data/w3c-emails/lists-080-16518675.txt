Dear Lois,
 
Thank you for sharing this reference.
 
The WAI Education and Outreach Working Group (
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/> http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/ ) is currently
working on a "resource suite" for developing a Web accessibility
business case for a specific organization. (An incomplete, internal
draft of the "business case resource suite" is available publicly online
at: http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/Overview.html . We are
actively working on this document and hope to complete a draft for
review in the upcoming month. When the draft is in a state that wider
review will be effective, we will announce it (I think on WAI-IG list as
well as other places).)
 
We appreciate input into this and other documents in development, such
as the reference you provide to the Digital Web Magazine article.
Several of us will read the article, and we might reference it directly
if appropriate.
 
Regards,
 
~ Shawn

Subject: A justification for accessibility to present to clients?



Digital Web Magazine has published an article summarising a selection of
WAI and 508 guidelines that help a web site achieve better rankings in
search engines. While the content of the article is quite superficial
and will not be startling to most list members, it may be a useful
independent resource to persuade reluctant clients to adopt
accessibility good practice, perhaps?

Kind regards,
