David Poehlman noted that this does not even work on this particular page. 

I see they have some additional scripting that does modify this keyboard behavior.  

The script seems to detect many other keyboard changes in focus and active a link on TAB or Escape keys.

>>Hello,
>>
>>Using JAWS 5.0, I have noticed on various websites the use of drop down
>>lists that have no go button.  Instead, the non-disabled user would click on
>>the list, hold down a mouse button, and pull down the list until the desired
>>item is reached, and then letting go of the button with the desired page
>>popping up.  With JAWS, I noticed that when in forms mode, each item that is
>>highlighted activates the auto redirect feature.  An example of this is on
>>the web page of Washington Mutual at:
>>
>>http://www.wamu.com
>>
>>The first item that would be recognized as a form field by JAWS is one of
>>these kinds of pull down boxes.
>>
>>What is the remedy for this kind of problem?  Does the end user with a
>>screen reader need to adjust his computer or should the element be designed
>>differently to avoid auto activation of list elements when they are pulled
>>down?  If both are possible, how could each be accomplished?
>>
>>Kelly
