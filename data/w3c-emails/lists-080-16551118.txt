Yes, of course.  To do otherwise would be to cripple mouse-free browsing.

The deal is merely that the word "click" triggers a Pavlovian response
in some zealots, blinding them to the observation in your first
paragraph.  So it gets labelled as device-dependent.  In an environment
where consensus is an issue, that leads inevitably to muddle and
confusion.

Exactly.

Though calling it a misnomer is perhaps unduly pedantic.  Click is
after all the "expected" event, and the others are just obvious
substitutes.

There are genuine device-dependence issues in scripting events.
But the naming of onclick() isn't one of them.
