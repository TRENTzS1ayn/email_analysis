Jon,

Thanks so much for this information!  It has already helped me out a lot.  I
tried this on the drop down lists on the Washington Mutual and a few other
sites with this functionality and I could reach the information without
difficulty.

This seems to be an undocumented feature.  I am using Internet Explorer 6,
service pack one and the online help in the program makes no mention of this
in its discussion of keyboard commands or accessibility from my reading of
the help files.  If I missed it please correct me.

If my assessment of a lack of documentation in the IE help system is indeed
accurate, then how would an end user without access to an outstanding
resource such as yourself or this list have the capacity to accomplish the
task?

How does everyone feel about undocumented access solutions?  Should they be
viewed differently from fully documented ones in the online help system?

Kelly
