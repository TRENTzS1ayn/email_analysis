I went to the reference cited and found this describing the "keystroke."

. ALT+DOWN ARROW: Opens a drop-down list box

Microsoft's explanation in this reference does not seem to be sufficient
enough for a blind person to know how to choose an item from a drop down
list on a web page without activating random items in the list.  One needs
to do more than simply hold down the alt and down arrow keys simultaneously.
Contrast Microsoft's explanation to Jon's thorough and highly useful
explanation.
