How do you step to the second item beginning M without triggering
this the auto-submit and without stepping through all 500 items in
the list (people who specify such behaviour also tend to overload
pull down lists)?  As marketing people see this auto-submit as
a usabiliity feature, the inability to step using the first letter
may well be a good counter-argument, because it may be seen as
usability, not accessibility.

You can't require a de-focus when using the mouse, as I believe is 
the preferred definition for onChange, as it would then be no
more effort to click a button and the marketing people would complain.

NB you must provide a button when there is no scripting as a form
consisting of just a pull down list cannot be submitted on any normal
browser without scripting.
