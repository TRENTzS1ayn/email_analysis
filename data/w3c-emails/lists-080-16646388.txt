I'm considering of creating an english version of my website
(currently there's only a dutch version), but I have never done
something like this before.
~ My idea about it was to create a page like 'index.php' (i'll call
this the languageselector) which uses the http-request to decide
wether to serve the dutch or the english version, using a redirect,
for the english version to index.en.php and for the dutch to
index.nl.php. I would create a languageselector for every page, so
that i would have three files for every page: 'page.php',
'page.en.php', 'page.nl.php'.
Is this a good idea or are there better/other ways for doing this?
Are there maybe some 'ready made' solutions for this? (I use PHP on an
Apache server)

Kind regards and thanks,
Jeroen Budts
