I don't think we can make any claims that IE is definitively wrong here, it
follows the Windows UI conventions in this regard (indeed in most), and
isn't incompatible with the spec as read it, the problem is the author
performing a navigation onchange.   It's an authoring problem not an IE
problem!

The biggest thing that makes Mozilla inaccessible to me, is its failure to
follow the conventions of the underlying UI, consistency is surely
important?

Jim.
