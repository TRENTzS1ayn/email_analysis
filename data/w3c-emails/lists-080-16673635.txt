Hi Kelly,

However, if the dropdown list happens to be "open" (size>1) and the onChange
event is triggering the submission, there is no way out. This happens on a
list of words at http://m-w.com. For example: 
http://m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&va=focus&x=12&y=13. See 
http://jimthatcher.com/webcoursea.htm#Webcourse10.1.5.

Jon,

Using your very clear and explicit directions, I was able to access
different items in each of the drop down lists on the Washington Mutual
page.  Using the techniques you described, I had no problem.
