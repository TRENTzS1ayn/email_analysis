I wonder that if I have a work around for ie, I might not have a work around
for say netscape or lynx?  Just because there is a work around for something
and there is a choice of coding methods as to whether or not to force people
to use the work around that the method forcing the work around should be
used.  It seems to me that the answer is that this is not acceptable since
there are alternatives that fit all.

It is simply accomplished by not taking the explicit steps (probably copied,
rather than designed) that the developer took to make it work in that
unnatural way.

This behaviour happens because interface specifiers think it is good
behaviour!
