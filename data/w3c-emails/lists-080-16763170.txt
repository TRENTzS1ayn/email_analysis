I'am not sure that language detection is a good thing. When I use an
English browser (I do) I want a French web site, a Russian website, etc.
to be in the original language when arriving. Then I can change language
if I need to. If I am in Spain and start looking at Danish web sites in
some local browser, I would hate if they were suddenly not in Danish.

I have a two language website in Danish and English, and I use almost
your setup for the files, but I normally only have one file if generated
dynamically and two language files if they are already generated. I use
both systems for different parts of the site just to test pro et cons.

I have two domain names, one for the Danish version (klapmusen.dk) and
one for the English version (SmackTheMouse.com), and I detect which one
is used and serve the appropriate page. On the surface a translation of
an article has the same name as the original like 20040108, but
depending on the domain name detected I transfer to files with names
like 20040108_en.html and 20040108_en.html but 20040108 is still in the
browser's address line.

Instead of your third file just do detect (you need a lot), I use a
special setup file in asp.net called global.asax, and I am sure that php
has something similar, to detect domain name, and then I do a so-called
server transfer to the right page.

I'm considering of creating an english version of my website (currently
there's only a dutch version), but I have never done something like this
before. ~ My idea about it was to create a page like 'index.php' (i'll
call this the languageselector) which uses the http-request to decide
wether to serve the dutch or the english version, using a redirect, for
the english version to index.en.php and for the dutch to index.nl.php. I
would create a languageselector for every page, so that i would have
three files for every page: 'page.php', 'page.en.php', 'page.nl.php'. Is
this a good idea or are there better/other ways for doing this? Are
there maybe some 'ready made' solutions for this? (I use PHP on an
Apache server)

Kind regards and thanks,
Jeroen Budts
