  You redirect to different language versions based on the *domain
  name*? That isn't a recommended procedure at all, and - in my view -
  harms accessibility.

  Instead, look at the HTTP Accept-Language header and determine which
  version of content to serve up. I suggest keeping two content trees.
  Remember to include a link to allow users to change language
  regardless of the HTTP header.
