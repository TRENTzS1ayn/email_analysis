Has anyone mentioned the Jaws "HTML Challenge" pages in this discussion on 
any of the forums?:

http://www.freedomscientific.com/HTML_challenge/files/links_challenge.html

It's a little tricky due to some self-referential content (such as a table 
of table navigation commands being used to demonstrate table navigation 
behavior!), but these pages should give a developer a pretty good idea of 
what Jaws can do. Not quite the full-scale interactive online demo, but a 
very thorough description of the available features.

On the whole, though, I will echo the idea that designers should design to 
the Guidelines, not to the behavior of one adaptive tech product.
