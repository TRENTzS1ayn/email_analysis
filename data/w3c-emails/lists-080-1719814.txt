All I was asking for was the actual text, formatted in HTML, for 
debugging purposes. Effectively, a screen shot for speech. That would 
help most of the problems authors would encounter, understand, and be 
inclined to fix: alt text and other equivalents, table linearization, 
forms rendering, frame interaction, and scripting faults (if 
applicable).

Over and above that, authors should be going out and testing with 
actual users of AT, not going it alone. If they don't know how people 
use an AT, JAWS et al. will be useless to them, whether they bought it 
or got it for free.

Clearly it's not that simple. I can't design the system; I can only 
frame the problem.

And yes, configurations are different from system to system and install 
to install. But only the most dedicated of designers is going to test 
more than one AT, much less various configurations. They won't know 
enough about how the ATs are configured to do meaningful testing work 
anyway.

When it happens that a given design doesn't work with a given AT, the 
failure is not necessarily on the part of the designer, particularly 
when the designer followed WCAG in good faith.

That's not the same thing. It's good that you all do it, but it's not 
what the petition is asking for, which is to write off the whole 
package as goodwill, rather than provide a time-limited demo.

I'm not concerned with the business model for producing a test suite. 
If the AT vendors will agree to implement to it, I'd be inclined to 
write it myself.

For the time being, they have the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 
test suite[1] (which covers assistive technologies) to check their 
performance against HTML 4.01. There are hundreds of tests to run 
through already.
