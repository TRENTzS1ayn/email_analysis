Unless I'm mistaken, I believe that there is currently no forum
that is accessible "out of the box". Ages ago I deployed an old
version of Phorum http://phorum.org/ and had to spend quite some
time hacking away at the templates and code to ensure at least
minimal requirements such as alt attributes, labels, etc
(which is now coming back to haunt me, as I may need to upgrade
to a newer version, and any hacks I've made need to be re-applied
once the new version is installed...a waste of time I could do
without).
