Some time ago I registered online for the Web Accessibility Evaluation
Exchange  being held in Dublin this week, organised by WAI, Microsoft and
the CRC.  The event is tomorrow at Dublin University and I've heard nothing
back.  I'm loathe to go to Dublin to find that I'm not registered or there
is some other difficulty.  There is no contact on the event section of the
site to confirm or discuss.  Does anyone have a contact ?
