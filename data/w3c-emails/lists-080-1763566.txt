There's a phone number on the page at
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/2003/0904-eval.html>. The number is for people who
need help getting accessible transport, but they might be able to point you
in the right direction.

On the subject of transport don't call it "Dublin University" when you get
into a taxi, we have three. A taxi driver would be more likely to bring you
to TCD (the one the tourists always want to see) than to UCD (the one you
want to go to).
