To make the thing accessible you are going to have to take onerous 
steps it seems.

Currently maps are an interesting, but difficult part of accessibility. 
The problem is, as Phill said, knowing what the critical information in 
the map is. Likely it is more than a couple of sentences. However, I 
would strongly suggest that you look at how to collect geographic 
information in a re-useable way, and not just a description of the map.

Looking at Semantic Web technology, the work of groups like OpenGIS, or 
similar, is likely to help in the medium term to reduce the workload, 
since you will begin to re-use existing information.

If you don't have a functional alternative form for the map you can't 
claim level A conformance to WCAG...
