The Techniques task force of the WCAG working group is working on how the
various techniques documents we will have relate to each other. Techniques
are part of the requirements for WCAG 2.0 [1] and have their own set of
requirements [2]. 

There are a number of approaches we could adopt. To make a good decision, we
need a better idea of the potential ways people would use the techniques
documents. Techniques provide technology-specific information about how to
implement the guidelines. There is also a document called Gateway Techniques
that provides interpretive information about the guidelines but is not
technology-specific. The Gateway Techniques (so named because they are a
good portal into the remainder of the techniques, at least in some use
cases) will provide a lot of information that is important to proper
implementation of technology specific techniques, so it is important that
the relationships be clear.

I don't want to provide more background, for fear of skewing responses, so I
hope this is sufficient. We'd like to know how you anticipate using
techniques, whether yourself or people you know or can imagine. It's ok if a
lot of the responses are similar, as that lets us know that a use case is
important, and we'd also like to see examples that we haven't thought of
yet.

A couple example use cases (feel free to be more verbose if you want):

1. An HTML coder who needs to know what to do with the HTML code but doesn't
want to be confused by anything else right now.
2. A developer who is learning about accessibility, and needs to know
generally how the guidelines can be applied to a site using HTML, CSS,
EcmaScript, images, and a few videos.
3. Someone who isn't really interested in accessibility and is looking for
the minimum they have to do to meet a set of requirements.

Thanks for you help -

Michael
