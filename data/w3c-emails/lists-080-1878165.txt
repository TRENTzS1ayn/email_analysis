>Hi Everyone!
>This semester I'm taking an Economics class, and part of that class is
>playing a game in which we use play money to invest in stocks, and see who
>has the most money at the end of the game.  Consequently, I needed to find
a
>site to monitor stocks.  I started using
>www.quote.com
>about a week ago, and found it fairly easy to navigate.  Then today I
logged
>on to the site and found a link saying something about "Click here if you
>use a screen reader for some information about accessibility."  I did, and
>found a nice description of changes on the site.  Most were done to promote
>accessibility.  I've just used the site again, and it is wonderful.
>Hopefully this will help someone who wants to track their stocks.
