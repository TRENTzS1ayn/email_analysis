Hi,

thank you for your message - this is an automated response from our mail-server, because I am currently in San Francisco as a speaker at this year's OracleWorld conference. 

I will return to the office on Friday, September 12th, and while I have access to e-mail at all times, I will typically only be able to respond to you in the week following my return to the office.

If this concerns any Altova product-related issue, you have the following options:

  - if you are writing about a technical support, please resend your message to mailto:support@altova.com
  - if you require consulting or development services, please resend your message to mailto:professional-services@altova.com
  - if you are writing about a sales question, please resend your message to mailto:us-sales@altova.com
  - if you are writing about a marketing opportunity, please resend your message to mailto:marketing@altova.com
  - if you are inquiring about a partnership with Altova, please visit our new Altova Partner Portal at http://partners.altova.com

  - for all other issues, please visit our main web site at http://www.altova.com or contact our general office address at mailto:office@altova.com

If this matter requires more immediate attention, or if you have a personal urgent request, you can also call me on my cell phone, which I have with me at all times - the number is: 1-978-375-1340.

If I am temporarily unable to answer that phone, please leave a message on the mobile voice mail system there.

Best regards,

Alexander
