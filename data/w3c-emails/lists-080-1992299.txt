All (especially Chaals and Tina):

Thanks for your messages about the problems that Watchfire's spam blocker is 
giving you as you post. I have forwarded your messages to our IT department, 
and they have changed the settings on our spam blocker so that our server 
should no longer give you problems.

Note that I feel your pain. I am no fan of Watchfire's spam blocking system, 
because I disagree with any system that offloads my problem (spam) on people 
who send me legitimate mail. (That's why you'll notice this message 
originates from Hotmail - the reaction that my Watchfire address gets when I 
use it for public communication embarrasses me.)

Michael Cooper has earlier made a more extensive apology to the list; I echo 
his sentiments.

Best regards,
-Gerard
