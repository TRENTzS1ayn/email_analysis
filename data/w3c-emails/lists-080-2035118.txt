  Naturally. The background information is simply there to illustrate a
  situation in where different consultants and government offices apply
  the WCAG different to the same situation, and the questions and
  politics arising from it.

  Personally I believe the WCAG to be a useful tool. A number of
  websites can be tested against the *same* standard, and some
  conclusions on the overall situation drawn.

  That will be difficult if "WCAG 1.0 3rd Swedish Edition 5.1" and "WCAG
  1.0 version 0.45alpha (UK)" exist. If a local government re-interpret
  the WCAG, I maintain hope that the set of guidelines arrived at are no
  longer the WCAG.
