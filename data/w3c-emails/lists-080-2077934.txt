This is not currently true, as conditions are not supposed to be satisfied by
the presence of one minority browser with the feature.  However, if Internet
Explorer were to have had this feature for a few years, this might be
sufficient without any warnings.

There is no requirement in HTML that TITLE should be presented in a way that
is useful in this context, and this would be a misuse of title, even if it
were.  TITLE is not "present as tooltip".

Note that the implication of browsers that allow spawned windows to be
disabled is that you must design on the basis that the feature will be
disabled.

I'm not quite sure how Mozilla handles this with scripted popups, but my
guess is, even allowing for the issues to do with scripting, that any 
popup blocked this way will be a dead link, as one use of this feature is
to tame Geocities hosted sites.

Incidentally, as I read the clause, warnings are only a let out if the
target window already exists, not if you create a new window for one.
