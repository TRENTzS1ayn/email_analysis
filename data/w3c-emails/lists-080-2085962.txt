That would probably meet the legal requirments in the UK (IANAL), as long
as the phone service was available on all days and at all times that 
the web page was available, but it doesn't, in my view, allow you to
claim compliance with the checkpoint.

It would probably also meet the accessibility requirements.

However, publishing the map topology in some agreed standard format,
whilst possibly raising intellectual property protection issues,
would get closer to providing accessibility with the online version.
(There is always a conflict between intellectual property protection
and accessibility.)  Wide definition accessibility (the "Access Systems",
not the Joe Clark one) might not fit well with the use of such a format,
though, and there is probably no solution that is ideal for everyone.
