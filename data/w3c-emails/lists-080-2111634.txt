am I the only person on this planet interested to see SVG running on a 
PDA?

having now purchased a Sharp Zaurus 750 with its excellent 640x480 
screen running linux.

I'd still like to browse SVGs on the web using a pda.

a quick search for opera svg zaurus turned up this gem from 2 years ago:

a request from yours truly to IG on this topic.

can anyone else do better?

thanks
