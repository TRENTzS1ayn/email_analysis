Please compare the above two links, may not work for everyone :-(

On a 1.6ghz 1400x1024 screen animation nearly fills screen,
this is the first animation I've seen that is likely to cause epileptic 
fits.
red on green was perhaps incautious.

However in the second link where the scale is small, the animation 
seems fine.
