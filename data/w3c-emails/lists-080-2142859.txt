Hello, on my experience the two menus you developped are not perfect but the
first is not so accessible for partially sighted.
If you turn of CSS, menu become unreadable as you can see on the picture
join at this mail.
The second problem, for me, is that you can't navigate with only the
keyboard and tab touch.the menus open and close always.

The second one is better because this CSS problem is not exist.
To make it better i think you should use more focus to help people who read
the page with a braille display an jaws for example.

I'll try to explain it

When you only use keyboard to navigate you can open all sub menus, but the
focus is always on the top of main menu. You can do ( i dont know how
exactly but a society we work with do it on his project), an action to put
focus on the first link of the sub menu you open. A blind expert test it and
find it very accessible to use.

I don't test it with Lynx so my tests are not complete but ...
