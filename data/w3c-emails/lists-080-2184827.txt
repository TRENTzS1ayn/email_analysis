That's not turning off CSS, that's Internet Explorer's way to turn off 
/some/ CSS (fonts and colors, not positioning). Use the "Toggle CSS" 
link in the page to turn off all CSS and you'll see that it's fine 
without CSS.

Does anyone have a good solution for overcoming that setting in IE? The 
problem is that since it turns off background color CSS, but not CSS 
positioning, the text can overlap and be hard to read.

With this IE setting, I don't know that /any/ DHTML menus could overcome 
the noted problem. However, one of the things we may provide is a basic 
user style sheet for download. This is a much better solution than IE's 
weak CSS control.

Yeah, I was trying to provide a way around that with the skip links. I 
don't want to make them open onclick because the top level contains 
links of it's own.

I'd love to see an example if you can find the site. I'm definately open 
to rethinking the problem, but I'm not sure I'll ever be able to please 
everyone... especially myself. ;)

Thanks for your response.
