I'm not OK with that, we work with a lot of partialy sight people and they
use this option to put there own CSS like i did (on my first mail join

W3C say that accessibility is to provide accessible content whith any
browsers, options ... IE is the use bowser and lot of people use it.
And we know a lot of partialy sight people for example that use IE with
accessibility options on.
With opera 6 the menu does not appear dynamically.
Same with phoenix.

I'm OK with that, on our training when people ask : do you have a accessible
DHTML menu we unfortunately always say no. There is good one but never
perfect.
