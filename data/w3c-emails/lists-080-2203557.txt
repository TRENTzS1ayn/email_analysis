If you know of any dynamic menus that can overcome that specific 
problem, please send me a link. I'm fairly convinced that a user style

That browser bug has been corrected in Opera 7.

Not sure what version of Phoenix you are running, but it's worked in 
every Gecko build I've tested, including NS6, NS7, Camino, Moz 0.x, Moz 
1.x, Phoenix, and Firebird. It also works in Safari and apparently 
Konqueror. Could you send me your browser version number offlist?

Thanks again,
James
