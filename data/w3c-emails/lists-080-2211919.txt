Jerome,
You'll find information and pointers to other resources in the "IMS Guidelines for Developing Accessible Learning Applications" which are available at:
http://imsglobal.org/accessibility/accessiblevers/index.html

See especially the sections on sychronous and asynchronous communication and collaboration tools.
