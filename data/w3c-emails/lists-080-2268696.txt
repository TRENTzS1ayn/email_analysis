Hello everyone,

Would you like to override the web designers choice of colour, text
size, background images etc in the simplest way possible, making it a
lot easier to see those websites with tiny text, pale colours or
annoying backgrounds.

A new website allows users to create and download their own style
sheets for free. The style sheets can then linked to the browser for
use on other websites.

Currently there is a choice 10 colour schemes, 7 of which were created
for kind individuals with eyesight problems. Text can be selected up
to 18 points and made bold.

The user style sheet option is possible only due to the efforts of the
W3C. For many style sheets could mean another welcome accessibility
tool.

I sincerely hope that you will find the style sheet approach of
benefit. Why not give it a go.  you may be pleasantly surprised.

The website address is:

www.oneformat.com/

Kind regards,

Dalj.

Regards Steve
