The W3C's draft techniques document for Accessibility Evaluation and 
Repair Tools at http://www.w3.org/TR/AERT#color-contrast provides an 
algorithm for testing to see if text and background colours provide 
sufficient contrast.

The document indicates, however, that the algorithm is a "suggested" one 
that is "still open to change".  Can anyone shed any light on whether 
this should be considered as a reliable indicator of colour contrast, or 
whether some more authoritative/reliable algorithm exists?

Reason for my question: sponsors/clients of a project I am currently 
working on believe that the requirements are too stringent. This view 
was expressed after I used the algorithm to generate a report on a range 
of colour options that were being considered--very few of them passed 
muster, as I expected.

I would be extremely grateful for any advice or references to other 
resources/expert opinions.

Cheers,
Dey
