Subject: Re: Math symbols in pdf files will tagging help


Pranav.  there are two mainstream ways to present math that can be
accessible.  Well actually one method and one that is almost ready for
use.  Word math documents can be embossed on a Tiger embosser  if one
reformats the document into the Tiger environment.  Second way is to
present the math in mathML and display in Internet Explorer with the free
MathPlayer plug-in.  The next version of MathPlayer, to be released later
this year, will permit audio access to the mathML with some screen
readers.  And the document can also be embossed on Tiger.  MathML is the
right way to write math in the future.  Accessibility developments are in
their infancy, and access should get better in the next few years.  Sorry
but there aren't any other mainstream ways that are likely to be
accessible, so you're facing the need to have some sighted human do magic
to make these other methods "accessible".
