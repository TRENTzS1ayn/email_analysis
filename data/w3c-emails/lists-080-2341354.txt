That issue cannot be programmatically determined, full stop. Every
visually-impaired person is different. It's *not* like colour deficiency,
which has well-understood patterns and easy-to-follow accommodations.

Cf.:

No and no.

The correct accommodation method is for an author to provide a means of
altering colours, as with a stylesheet-switcher.

The visitor can also adjust browser controls or employ a user stylesheet
including !important declarations.
