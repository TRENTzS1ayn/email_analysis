Certainly for text and backgrounds.  However, for inside images (i.e.,
logos, diagrams, photos, etc.) it's another matter.  To be able to reduce
the need for certain users to have to purchase special hardware or
software, I believe it is good guidance to give image designer and creators
"contrast" as a criteria  to always consider.  Of course that is not always
possible, for example when the image is actually a photograph (i.e.,
individual or scene), except for better lighting, there not much else one
can do about reality.
