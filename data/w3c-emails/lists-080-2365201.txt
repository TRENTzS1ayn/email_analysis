The problem with this is WCAG1 Checkpoint 6.3 P1.  There is enough data out
there to indicate that a good percentage of your audience do browse with
scripts turned off, and there is also those out there with scripts turned
on, but with ad blockers installed to control or disable various sections of
the DOM, or using a modern browser that allows custom control over the DOM
and other media.  If your site is "Dependant" on DHTML to operate, then I
don't see how it can comply with this checkpoint.

I developed these menus back in the Spring and have recently updated
them (see September 4th update info). I'd love your comments on their
accessibility rating.
