Hi Jonathan,

I'm so sorry but the automatic translation in to spanish makes absolutely
incomprehensible de content of the site.

I believe that the best option would be to find translators, volunteers. The
final result won't possibly be perfect, it will possibly not even be good,
but at least it will be better than what offers that automatic translation.

cheers,
Emmanuelle
