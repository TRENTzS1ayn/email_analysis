Hi Jonathan,

I had the same opinion of Emmanuelle about the Portuguese translation. In
portuguese there are different articles and pronoumns for male and female
words, in automatic translation is kind of impossible do it. So I believe
that would be better try to find a volunteers or translator.

You can count on me if you need for portuguese translation.

Cheers

Tarcila

Hi Jonathan,

I'm so sorry but the automatic translation in to spanish makes absolutely
incomprehensible de content of the site.

I believe that the best option would be to find translators, volunteers. The
final result won't possibly be perfect, it will possibly not even be good,
but at least it will be better than what offers that automatic translation.

cheers,
Emmanuelle
