Hello Jonathan

I asked one of our University's Italian Studies lecturers to look at the
Italian translation and here is her feedback:

"I've had a look at that Italian translation and not surprisingly it is poor,
very literal, word for word...a bit like some of our beginners' first
compositions".

Hope this info is of some help.

Sincerely

Denise

Subject: Howto provide and link to foreign language translations?


http://www.learningdifferently.com/index-t.html

Is there a good reason not to provide links to translations?
Does anyone have an outstanding example of how this should be done?

Flags are not that helpful, is their a resource similar to ascii with 
standardised (gif) flags?
what do people feel about this approach?

is it possible (and desirable) to use client-side javascript and HTTP 
Accept-Language header to direct the user?

how great is the translation?
please could anyone with knowledge of French, German, Italian, 
Portuguese or Spanish comment on the quality of the translations?

also: does anyone know what is the status of SVG and translation tools 
such as babelfish?

thanks
