Hello All,

In a couple weeks we will be announcing and releasing Hi-Caption LE for
Windows Media as part of the MS Office 2003 Launch. We are looking for some
people to test this new No Charge Solution.
http://www.hisoftware.com/hmcc/le/index.html It is being released for the
new Microsoft office System and is designed to be used along with Microsoft
Producer for Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2003 Presentations. In order to run
this through a complete test you would need the full Office System
beta/preview that has powerpoint 2003.


This is part of our line of solutions for Microsoft Windows Media and is a
subset of Hi-Caption. This is a freely open test and additionally as no
charge software you will of course be licensed. This is a strong part of our
education and outreach efforts and on day one we assume close to one million
copies will be distributed.
