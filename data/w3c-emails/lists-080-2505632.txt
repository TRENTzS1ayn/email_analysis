"Dynamic HTML" is a term used by some vendors to describe the combination of
HTML, style sheets and scripts that allows documents to be animated.

The title of your subject is "Call for feedback on accessible DHTML menus".

If you turn scripts off in the user agent it disables this type of menuing
system because it depend on scripts being turned on to be operatable.  Have
you tried using it with scripts turned off?  This is what I mean by the site
being dependant on DHTML.  If it is built on such a menuing system it is
dependant on DHTML and for anyone with scripts turn off it is unusable.

Of course, the site isn't dependent on DHTML. How do you figure it is?

Thanks,
