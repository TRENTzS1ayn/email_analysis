I've removed the flags, for 2 reasons, one they attract too much 
attention in this situation, two it was becoming a lot of trouble to 
code.

if anyone would like to offer further translations, Danish would be 
great, also Arabic and third world languages would be very helpful.
I expect to be able to get some of these within London.

http://www.learningdifferently.com  just the home page at present.

further comments on the content, meta-tagging, or current translations 
would be great.

thanks again
