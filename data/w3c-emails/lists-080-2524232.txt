Hello All,

We have had request to deliver software for other platforms. What we have
done is come up with a Developers Object that Works with AccMonitor this
will allow for organizations to impliment a web based AccVerify. This object
uses configuration and tests from AccMonitor to test for All QA Factors
including Accessibility. We will be Releasing a Complete C#  ASP.NET
Developers Kit and a VS.Net Solution Sample Later this week. 

We are currently running tests on how it works from different platforms, We
have put a sample Application up on our site and have configured it for
Accessibility and Alt Text Quality tests. 

We would appreciate any feedback on the beta tester and how people found the
default (Basic) interface to use. While users of this solution will develop
their own interfaces for their organization this will most likely be the
starting point.

* This will also be the basis for the New Spanish Language Tester that we
are Jointly Developing with SIDAR www.sidar.org

* In the Near Future, Working with our Partners of the cynthiasays.com web
site, this will become the new interface and application for
www.cynthiasays.com
