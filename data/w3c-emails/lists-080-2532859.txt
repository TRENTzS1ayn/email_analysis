[Beta Testers] Request for testers AccVerify ASP.NET InterfaceHi Robert!

I just tested a page with http://www.hisoftware.com/aspnetdemo/default.aspx 
and I do not understand, where do you have this guideline from:

"2.1 Validate that Alternative Text is >7 and <81 characters in length
Short alternative text may not be valid, warn the report user if alternative text was found that is less than seven characters in length or greater then 80 characters in length."

Thanks in advance for your kind response.

John

  Hello All, 

  We have had request to deliver software for other platforms. What we have done is come up with a Developers Object that Works with AccMonitor this will allow for organizations to impliment a web based AccVerify. This object uses configuration and tests from AccMonitor to test for All QA Factors including Accessibility. We will be Releasing a Complete C#  ASP.NET Developers Kit and a VS.Net Solution Sample Later this week. 

  We are currently running tests on how it works from different platforms, We have put a sample Application up on our site and have configured it for Accessibility and Alt Text Quality tests. 

  We would appreciate any feedback on the beta tester and how people found the default (Basic) interface to use. While users of this solution will develop their own interfaces for their organization this will most likely be the starting point.

  * This will also be the basis for the New Spanish Language Tester that we are Jointly Developing with SIDAR www.sidar.org

  * In the Near Future, Working with our Partners of the cynthiasays.com web site, this will become the new interface and application for www.cynthiasays.com

  Thanks In Advance,
