  Indeed there is. However, in this matter I have "spoken" to two groups
  of people: those who need to find translations in their own language,
  and those who philosophise about it - such as me.

  The former group is rarely if ever insulted by the flags. They don't
  think they are perfect, but find them in common use outside the
  'net, and functional. They are used to the method.

  The latter group gets vocal about the "Right Way".

  I do not dismiss the arguments. I dismiss the article. You do not
  convince people to adopt your position by using language leading them
  to believe you nuts.

  Present the arguments, as Jesper did, but leave out the "someone might
  get insulted!" and "Colonial crimes!" bits.

  I can only describe this as I've seen it: people I show this article
  to who tend to respond as this quote illustrates: " He has good
  arguments but he seems to have lost touch with reality ... "

  's no way to convince people. We had a discussion a while ago about
  the right way of saying "accessible". There are all kinds of debates
  about how to say "disabled". This is more of the same: not politically
  correctness, but packaging.
