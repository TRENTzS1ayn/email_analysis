Accessibility and functionality are not the same.

A site can be accessible with dhtml menus if one can still use the site.
You should think of drop down menus as more link options. If the main
links (at the top of the menu) are still usable it doesn't matter. Most
of this is completely a mute point for screen readers which often see
the entire menu anyway since the dhtml menus usually just visually hide
the extra options they don't want on screen at any point.

To quote directly from

http://www.w3.org/DOM/

<q>
"Dynamic HTML" is a term used by some vendors to describe the
combination of
HTML, style sheets and scripts that allows documents to be animated.
</q>

The title of your subject is "Call for feedback on accessible DHTML
menus".

If you turn scripts off in the user agent it disables this type of
menuing
system because it depend on scripts being turned on to be operatable.
Have
you tried using it with scripts turned off?  This is what I mean by the
site
being dependant on DHTML.  If it is built on such a menuing system it is
dependant on DHTML and for anyone with scripts turn off it is unusable.

Of course, the site isn't dependent on DHTML. How do you figure it is?

Thanks,
