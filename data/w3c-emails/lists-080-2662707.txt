Right the menus themselves don't function with scripting off. However...

Exactly. "Ensure that pages are usable when scripts are turned off or not
supported."

So when scripts off, are the menus (or better yet, what is left of the
menus) usable? Yes, they are... In most of these menu systems, the top level
link is created to point to a page that contains links for all  of the items
that *would have shown* in the menu if scripts were on.
 
As an example -- http://www.crossborder-management.com

View it with scripting on. View it with scripting off.

Either way, you can still get to all of the information. The links that are
provided in the DHTML menus, are redundantly provided on the main content
pages.

Lets leave the obvious usability debate out of it...

Actually, I'd say it is working exactly within WCAG checkpoint 6.3

Best regards,
