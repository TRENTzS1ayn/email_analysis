Okay, I see your point now.  I am just in so much of a habit of seeing this
type of implementation without being functional at all with scripts turned
off.  In this case, this looks promising.

Geoff,

I think you missed the point of what I was saying. Turning scripts off
does not necessarily disable all functionality. Menus should be
constructed with a top level which is not reliant on scripting. This
then serves as an anchor for a drop down (or drop out) menu to drop
from. If scripts are off the extra menu will not appear but the top link
should still be available. While it is possible to craft dhtml menus
that are not accessible it is also perfectly possible to make menus
which are. They simply add functionality for people who use scripts.
This does not constitute inaccessibility.

Tom
