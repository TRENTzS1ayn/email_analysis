A more versatile and robust idea may be the use of some standard phonetic spellings, rather than an
english language equivalent.

Subject: Helping Jaws (et al) pronounce our company name





I had an ear-opening experience listening to Jaws sputter out the contents of our website. It gave a rather bad rendition of our company name "Unum" which is said "ah-nim", severly clipping the "ah" so that it was more along the lines of "ugh-nm". In Jaws, you can tell it how to pronounce words by going to Utilities | Dictionary manager then clicking on "Add" (the relevant entry for us would be "Unum" for actual word and "you num" for pronounce as).

Of course, I am going to propose that we write a page suggesting our users with screen readers to do this for certain company and industry specific words, however, are there any meta tags that Jaws can recognise for this? Ideally, I'd like something like:

<meta tag="ScreenReader" ActualWord="unum" ReplacementWord="you num">

Are there any screen readers/ spoken browsers for online content which support something close to this idea? 

If not, perhaps it's an idea that this list could develop and then promote.

Thanks,
John
