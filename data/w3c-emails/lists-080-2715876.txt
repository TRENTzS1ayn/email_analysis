Well that isn't even close to HTML. To get somewhere near that with meta elements would need something along the lines of <meta name="screenreader" contents="actual='unum'; replace='ju: n^m'" />.

This seems quite the wrong place to put that sort of information, which is essentially style information.

Potentially there could be a large number of these items, the are also likely to be heavily re-used on a given site, and of course they are of no value to many user-agents - all of which would suggest that a reference to another file would be the solution with something like <link rel="pronounce" type="some/newtype+xml" href="somewhere" />

Generally though, I think I'd prefer the idea of pushing this onto the CSS level.
