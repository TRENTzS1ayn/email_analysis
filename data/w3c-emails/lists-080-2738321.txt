 I'm OK with all that but i say it again :
Don't forget partially sighted who use there own stylesheet on opera,
mozilla, IE or others.
If you use DHTML menus who appears verticaly, every time when you switch off
CSS on IE for example the menu text and the main text appear both and
unreadable.

Okay, I see your point now.  I am just in so much of a habit of seeing this
type of implementation without being functional at all with scripts turned
off.  In this case, this looks promising.

Geoff,

I think you missed the point of what I was saying. Turning scripts off does
not necessarily disable all functionality. Menus should be constructed with
a top level which is not reliant on scripting. This then serves as an anchor
for a drop down (or drop out) menu to drop from. If scripts are off the
extra menu will not appear but the top link should still be available. While
it is possible to craft dhtml menus that are not accessible it is also
perfectly possible to make menus which are. They simply add functionality
for people who use scripts.
This does not constitute inaccessibility.

Tom
