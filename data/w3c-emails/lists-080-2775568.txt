Looks like this worked itself out, but I wanted a chance to respond to 
the original since I was out yesterday. The issue had been addressed 
previously and was noted in the page.

The third paragraph in the page says:

"Note: The sub-menus are not available without JavaScript, but these are 
supplemental navigation. The TexasOnline site has redundant links 
available from each main section to every sub-section and is therefore 
completely accessible. Please do not note this as an error in your 
comments."

However, due to some other feedback received offlist and on, I've 
decided to scrap the keyboard access to the menus... While I believe it 
greatly improved the experience sighted keyboard users have, it's become 
obvious that accessing the menus with a screen reader has become much 
more difficult.

This is dissappointing, because after all, that was the point of 
rebuilding those menus.

Cheers,
James Craig
