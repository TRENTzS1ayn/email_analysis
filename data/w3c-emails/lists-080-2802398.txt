As a linguist who has just been introduced to accessibility, this is 
an extremely interesting issue.

1) I definitely agree that users of screen reader be able to add 
their own pronunciations, but that wouldn't help with unfamiliar 
words.

2) I don't think of pronunciation as a formatting issue myself, but 
defintely content. I would prefer meta tag with standard transription 
symbols. Something like

<meta pron key
"Unum": jun@m (IPA) where @ = schwa and j= English y
"Unum": yun@m (American transcription)

NaCl: sodi@m klorayd ("sodium chloride")
I understand this is usuallly pronounced "nackle"?
Does the <abbr> tag play a role here?

</meta>

This would also help with the really unusual words I have to deal 
with from Old Irish and other exotic languages/words. Jaws really 
stumbles on these.

Obviously this would require extensive retraining in the Webmaster 
community on language transcription issues, but for people who deal 
with a lot of unusual words, language, it could be worth it.

BTW - I say it's their company, so they can pronounce it anyway they want :)

My two cents

P.S. Do any of the screen readers support the <lang> tag?
