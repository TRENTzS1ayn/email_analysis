Actually I would say that pronunciation is more like spelling. There 
may be more than one way to spell a word (e.g. "color" vs. "colour"), 
but that difference would be embedded in the text, not in a style 
sheet.  In this case, you may have a <lang> tag like <lang = 
en-us/en-uk> to specify which variety is used.

There is a sense in which pronunciation is independent of content, 
much like the content of a document like the Declaration of Human 
Rights is independent of which language it is translated into. 
However, I wouldn't want to say that changes in language content are 
equivalent to changes in "style", even if the implementation is 
similar.

In some cases, changes in pronunciation are critical for words which 
are spelled the same but have different pronunciations depending on 
meaning. I'm thinking of cases like "bass" which would mean a musical 
clef or a type of fish depending on how it's pronounced,

I liked idea of linking to the XML file which stored the special 
pronunciations. In theory speech readers could download these files 
and incoporate them into their pronunciation routines.

For instance, here are some proposed markups from SABLE Speech 
Synthesis Markup Languiage
http://www.research.att.com/~rws/Sable.v1_0.htm

<PRON SUB="tomahto">tomato</PRON>
<PRON ORIGIN=fr>passe</PRON> (similar tp <span lang="fr">passe</span>)

Of course this was from 1999...
