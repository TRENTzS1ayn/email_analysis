I think that is a poor argument for not using features like that. Users
can still quite happily refer to a piece of information or section of a
site, they just may not be able to refer to a specific widget. However
the sort of inexperienced user likely to refer to part of a widget is
likely to be confused by varying screen resolutions, different browsers,
a whole assortment of things.

The problem with not getting the same functionality is that it becomes 
very difficult to work together - if I describe following a link on a 
page that someone else doesn't have on that page, then there is a lot 
of confusion.
