In a general way, there maybe a consensus that UITs conform to a 
standardised usability and accessibility format. In implementing a 
website using SVG, the issue has arisen of the current necessity of 
duplicating much of the standardisation from HTML.
PFWG & http://www.w3.org/TR/xag.html would seem to attempt to meet this 
need. (it suggests however that this was due for revision 9 months 
ago). Of various circumstances, the example of 
http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/linking.html#Links (17.1 Links out of SVG 
content: the 'a' element) perhaps stands out, for the moment:

Is there standardised support (2.9 Reuse existing accessible modules?) 
within SVG or XML for

   A:link        {  }
   A:visited     {  }
   A:active      {  }

for if not, then it is almost necessitated that a whole variety of 
instances will be generated, or none.
Which in either case would seem to change the UI significantly.

The CSS sample given: http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/sample.html is perhaps 
inadequate as it mentions this, but only in so far as to provide 
support for @media speech

   A:link        { voice-family: harry, male }
   A:visited     { voice-family: betty, female }
   A:active      { voice-family: betty, female; pitch-range: 80; pitch: 
x-high }

my apologies once again if this has arisen out of my failure to 
understand or implement the appropriate process.
if not, can we agree an appropriate or standardised way, possibly using 
CSS2 (not familiar enough with http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG12/ or 
elementDef to comment) to implement an apparent standardised support for

   A:link        {  }
   A:visited     {  }
   A:active      {  }

and generalise this slightly more clearly within: PFWG & 
http://www.w3.org/TR/xag.html

apologies for the language, went to see "As you like it" Peter Hall 
last night, and it seems not to have worn off yet.
