Why not just use a Unicode version of the country name surrounded by
<span lang=""> or possible use url encoding for the characters. It's
ugly source but it is very effective in 90% of browsers. Images are all
very well but afaik alt text does not work particularly well with
non-ascii which is obviously a consideration for international PwDs. 

Some thoughts,

Instead of using flags and thus raising questions on which flag to use,
how
about having images of the language written in their own script such as
French as "Francais" (with alt tags on the image to label the image i.e.
alt="Arabic" .. etc) that the native speakers themselves will easily
recognise?

This should remove the need for deciding which flag to use.

It raises another question I have.

For example, when you are in arabic website, what do you need on your
server/development process to display the content in that script?
The website I am currently working on will take you to the list of
documents for download (in that language) when you click on the language
you selected.
It's ironic to have the documents listed in their english title that
when
you download, it opens the arabic version of it.

What's the solution to such a situation?
Images are good for the first instance, but will be ineffective for the
latter.
How will the screen reader turn to read the other language pages too?
