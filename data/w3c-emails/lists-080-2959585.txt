Due to the inherent lack of language support in alt text. In plain text
you can define language and encoding something which you can't do for
alt text.

Why not just do the text as an image, therefore language packs would not
be needed.

As far as I know most modern browsers have Unicode support which means
that language packs are not needed to do this.

If I understand the issue correctly, the advantage of using
graphics in this context would be that you could have a visual
representation of the language name using the language's
respective font...otherwise people would need to have all
possible language packs installed to view it correctly.
