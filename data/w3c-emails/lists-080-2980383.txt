If you're only going to provide the language name in the specific
language's representation, then I would say the theory has a flaw:
how about users browsing from machines that are not theirs (e.g.
library, internet cafe, etc) and which do not have the necessary
font installed ? They'd get the garbled representation, but WOULD actually
be the wiser if they could see the correct font...
