True, but why (as loose example) would someone say in an Iranian 
internet cafe/library/what have you, be browsing a Russian web site? One 
would expect that a computer/browser being used would have the fonts 
needed by the people from that region (ie. a US cafe might have support 
for Enlgish and Spanish while a Canadian library might have support for 
English and French).
