I just did a little experiment. I googled for "computer" in all web
sites in X language. I tried Japanese, Korean, Swedish, Serbian, Turkish
and Arabic. In all of these languages the font (although I speak none of
those languages so I can't be 100%) seemed to render perfectly
correctly. I am using windows XP but I only have English, French, and
Arabic language installed on this machine. I think it is actually opera
which provides the support for other languages, I believe if it doesn't
have support for another language in the current font it uses a default
Unicode font to display the characters properly anyway. I haven't tested
mozilla or IE but I would not be surprised if it is the same. Let the
user agents deal with encoding and different languages. Putting text in
images is merely holding back the progression of technologies that would
fix this issue properly. I might be a progressive zealot but someone has
to ;)

Well, that's my point exactly. As it's unlikely that these places
will have all necessary fonts installed, simply unicode-encoding
something and relying on the user's browser to display it correctly
may not be the correct approach...and possibly a dual solution
involving both unicode and image (with english ALT) may have to
be considered...
