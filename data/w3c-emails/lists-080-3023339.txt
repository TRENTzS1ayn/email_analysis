I agree with that sentiment, there is a difference between pragmatism
and bullheadedness however I don't think this is one of them. Certainly
opera does not have a problem with Unicode encoding without me having
done anything special. I would not be surprised if Mozilla, Safari and
IE have that facility either, so I don't see this as forsaking anyone. I
merely thinking that on the grounds of accessibility as a justification
the notion of putting text in an image is ridiculous.

Maybe extreme, but I would liken this to the debacle about sending
XHTML1.1 as true application/xhtml+xml, regardless of possible issues
with
browsers such as IE6...nice in principle, but maybe not the best
course of action in a real-world scenario...
imho, anyway ;)
