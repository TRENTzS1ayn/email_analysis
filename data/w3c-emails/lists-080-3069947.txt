All HTML attribute values have access to the full HTML character set, which
is most of ISO 10646, loosely Unicode.  The encoding information in the
HTTP content-type header is irrelevant to the treatment of HTML 
entities in a conforming browser.  You can specify the language on
the img element start tag, as lang is a core attribute.
