Which means that the alt attribute can use normal text, just like 
normal text can. If you are going to use an image, then, why not put 
normal text there, and for those who for some reason can't read that 
provide a picture (whatever you think is useful), and a label in the 
default language of the page.

For example in a Russian page linking to an english variant, you would 
have the following markup:

<head>
...
<link rel="alternate" hreflang="en" href="englishversion" />
...
</head><body>
...<a href="englishversion" hreflang="en" rel="alternate">English 
version of this page <img src="engelski" alt="XXX" /></a>
...

where XXX is the word english, written in Russian using cyrillic.
