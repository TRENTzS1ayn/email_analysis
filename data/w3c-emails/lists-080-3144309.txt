You're right, this is exactly what the presenter said about links. And your 
comment below about caution and lack of experience with Windows, and 
computers in general, is important to note. Both these factors increase the 
need for consistency with older user groups. Otherwise it seems like a web 
site is a lot like navigating a minefield for them, they hunt for what they 
want and when they find a word (or something) that looks like it may take 
them to their goal, they think about it carefully (lacking confidence in 
the outcome) and decide to take the risk of clicking. I actually saw video 
footage from these studies and the amount hesitation was remarkable. Again, 
the stakes were high as they were supposed to be managing online 
investments. I'm curious to know if they were as hesitant surfing other 
more casual types of websites.
