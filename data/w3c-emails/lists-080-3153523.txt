I don't know how wide spread this practice is becoming, but feel we may 
need to make it more clear that this practice is questionable.
It reminds me of those ?99  500x telescopes that fail to mention that 
the image will be a vague faint blob with no features, or contrast.
20-50x is probably more realistic at this price point....

WAI may need to make it more plain that an automated service cannot 
provide AAA approval at this time.
The following example is one I came across, that would appear to be 
from a reputable source with serious intentions and laudable aims.

validator.w3.org has a list of 42 errors, some are not that 
serious.......

How do people feel about this? in particular? in general?

thanks
