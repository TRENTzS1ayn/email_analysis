In that application, even I, as an experienced web user, would be 
nervous unless told right at the beginning exactly where the commit
point was in the dialogue.  (I find this a problem in e-shopping as
a whole, as one often has to take the dialogue a long way to find
out things like pricing a shipping options.)

Investment and airline booking are very high risk applications for
users, because they cannot cancel without incurring significant 
costs, once they pass the commit point.
