From a usability point of view I actually agree with JN on this.  I have put
search boxes in the upper right hand corner of sites wrapping the field and
button in FIELDSET + LEGEND and no matter what I do it always appears
cluttered and a cognitive overload.  If it is moved into a column of such
sub sections it tend to take its place much better, if fits in with the rest
of the layout.  So it's not always easy finding the balance between
usability and accessibility.

Thanks for the interesting reply Tina.

Although Nielsen uses the word 'heading' I don't think he is saying an <h1>
style heading. He is saying don't write any text there at all, just rely on
the text of the button.  I can see this point of view, but I thought
accessibility guidelines were different - particularly for screen reading
devices.
