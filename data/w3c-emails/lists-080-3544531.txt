That is a really important point.  This is standard in the software
development world of OSs and their SDK (software development kits).  It is
like so many of the features in SDKs that enhances basic accessibility,
which is neglected in the web development world.

The way graphical browsers on Windows treat <label> is analgous to the way
most "static controls" (Windows parlance for plain text on a window) react
in
that if you click on them they affect the related input control. This
isn't "extreme", it's basic usability in mirroring what users are used to
from
their OS (hopefully similar claims can be made about <label> and other
platforms).
