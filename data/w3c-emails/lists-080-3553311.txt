I believe, in this example, that the HTML specification is expecting, at
the very most, that they label should be "Keywords:", and in other typical
forms, things like:

Family Name
Given Name
Date of Birth

(Family and given name might be last name and first name if you are
assuming an English or US of northern European extraction background, as
people from those background tends to be confused by the more precise terms).

Date of Birth might well be DOB with an abbr attribute.
