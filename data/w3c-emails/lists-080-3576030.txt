David,

AFAIK, the only control is indirect, by choosing OS parameters. The Windows
desktop setting "Tooltip" controls appearance for example. However, the font
size also seems to be affected by the app: I just looked at the same page in
IE and Mozilla, and an abbr tooltip looked much larger in one than the
other. (Unless Moz hasn't picked up the new size for some reason - it did
pick up the colour.)

I did suggest that more control by the page author would be good (here?) a
long time ago, and was told not to be a silly girl ;-)

However, given how few people know how to change even simple things like
browser font size, how many fewer dig about in the desktop settings, I
wonder?

>I'd also like to open this to issues beyond screen readers for instance, if
title is a tool tip, how much controll is there over rendered size of the
text in it?<
