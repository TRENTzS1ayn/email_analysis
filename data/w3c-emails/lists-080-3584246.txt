I prefer the use of the accept headers. However it can be useful to have a URI 
that returns a given representation of a resource (after all representations 
are themselves resources and can be identified by a URI). Hence 
<http://www.example.domain/doc/1234> could return HTML, RDF and/or something 
else depending on the headers, and the HTML could contain <link rel="meta" 
type="application/rdf+xml" 
href="http://www.example.domain/doc/1234/meta.xml" />. This latter URI would 
return RDF/XML no matter what the headers (or at least as long as the headers 
allowed for RDF/XML even if they would seem to prefer HTML).
