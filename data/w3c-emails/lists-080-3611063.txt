Tried the same thing, Mozilla doesn't seem to be behaving correctly. I didn't 
do a thorough test to see if it will ever pick up the differences (if only 
after a reboot), I shall later.

On the one hand don't be a silly girl :p~

On the other hand there is a problem here in that while user control, 
preferably through OS settings, but failing that through browser settings, is 
the way to go for a lot of these things, for reasons that have been detailed 
numerous times here and elsewhere, there is a failure in helping users to 
understand how to do this and in making this process accessible and usable in 
itself (for example a user might reasonably expect that anything that is going 
to help the accessibility of their Windows system will be available from the 
control panel applet - if they get that far - called "accessibility options", 
though the display section of that only offers high contrast settings, and 
doesn't allow the user to launch the general display applet that would enable 
them to further improve how their system worked for them).

While we should assume that users have set up their systems in a reasonable 
way, more work is needed by OS and Browser producers to ensure that this is 
actually the case.
