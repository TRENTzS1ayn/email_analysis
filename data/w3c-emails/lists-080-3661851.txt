It's a MUST NOT in RFC 2616 as far as caching ? URIs without explicit
expiry information:

   We note one exception to this rule: since some applications have
   traditionally used GETs and HEADs with query URLs (those containing a
   "?" in the rel_path part) to perform operations with significant side
   effects, caches MUST NOT treat responses to such URIs as fresh unless
   the server provides an explicit expiration time. This specifically
   means that responses from HTTP/1.0 servers for such URIs SHOULD NOT be
   taken from a cache. See section [41]9.1.1 for related information.
