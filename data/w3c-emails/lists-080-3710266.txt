James, I usually like the double angle quote, however I think the 
single right angle quote looks great.  My one gripe though with 
breadcrumbs, make sure the final "crumb" is the actual page the user is 
at, and make it so that its not a clickable link.  So many designers 
make everything a link, and that's just confusing :)
