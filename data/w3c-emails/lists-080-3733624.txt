And how does that constitute "limiting"?

Where is your evidence that the great 
preponderance of people with relevant 
disabilities are *not* using "recent desktop 
graphical browsers"?

Where, furthermore, is your evidence that people 
with relevant disabilities who are not using 
"recent desktop graphical browsers" will be in 
any way inconvenienced or have their 
accessibility impaired by the use of a correct pi 
character as a separator in a breadcrumb trail?

Or do you just not like Web sites that take care 
to craft correct, aesthetically-pleasing 
typography?

>Other browsers won't have fonts that cover these.

Prove it.

>  Lynx may approximate with characters it has.

And it does a beautiful job, as ever.

Typically for this esteemed List, whenever 
somebody comes along with a standards-compliant 
method of making a site look nice, *even at the 
level of pi characters*, immediately some 
backward ninny gets on his hobby horse and warns 
that one person in Mongolia might not have the 
same experience.
