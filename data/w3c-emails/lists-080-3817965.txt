"I believe it's important to keep the visitor aware of the
site after exit to other links that have been provided by the site owner."

I have a question, am I reading between the lines correctly here, of covert
approval of opening another window which could effectivley disable the back
button?

or am I just jumping at shadows?

"What will make things better, in
my not-so-humble opinion, is someone who has a strong curiosity and interest
in trying to make "everyone happy" - which is one of those possibly
impossible things to do."

Please, a gentle suggestion to remove possibly from that statement.
