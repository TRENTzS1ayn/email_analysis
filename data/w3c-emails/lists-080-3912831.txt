...Regarding frames, it is my understanding that all you need to do to make
the frameset accessible is to use the title attribute on the frameset for
each frame.  But I have no idea how screen readers interpret this.


<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Frameset//EN">

<HTML>
<HEAD>
<TITLE>Title of Your Page</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<FRAMESET cols="10%, 90%"
TITLE="Our library of electronic documents"> 
<FRAME SRC="nav.html" title="Navigation bar"> 
<FRAME SRC="doc.html" title="Documents">

</FRAMESET>
