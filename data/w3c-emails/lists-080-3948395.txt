(03nov13. Special message to website creators: enough
with the 
"outside link opens new window" junk. I can handle it,
I'm a big boy 
now.)
Apologies to the list and Joe if I have the wrong end
of the stick here but............Joe if the comment is
one of your own........your lucky enough to understand
web sites, access and find your way round them but
there are many people without disabilities out there
who cant so it must be a nightmare for people using
alternative technology trying to use a site, these are
the people the guidlines and we as part of the web
community are trying to help, but you know that
already, I think your just trying to stimulate good
conversation :-).

I personaly prefer to not to create links opening into
new windows and I know this can also raise other
issues
