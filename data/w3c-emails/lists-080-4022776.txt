Initially they will be slow to load, but if well implemented once they are  
loaded they are a lot quicker to use because you are only loading elements of 
a page as opposed to the whole page, which is particularly attractive when 
dealing with a very 'feature rich' environment like an on line application.

Fortunately we know that the disabled people who would be using the system 
would be using screen reader software and hardware that is never likely to be 
more than two years old.
