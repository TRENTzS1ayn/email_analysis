Is this to say that a site is not accessible and/or does not comply with W3C/508 if it cannot be read by EMACSPEAK running on a LYNX system?
 
Why wouldn't a site that provides the same user interaction as a Netscape or IE browser and is readable by Jaws and W-E be considered accessible?

but the real question is "does the frame and feature rich
environment" actually add real usefulness to the site??? or are they just
"eye candy"

how do you know this??
my computer is just updated with the latest P-IV and super fast etc etc
etc, but won't work worth beans on frames,  why because I still like and
use LYNX for surfing the web.   not to mention it runs the latest version
of Linux and the screen reader software is EMACSPEAK

REMEMBER NOT EVERYONE USES THE GARBAGE FROM REDMOND, and basing your site
on M$ software is NOT accessible or usable and does not comply with W3C or
508.
