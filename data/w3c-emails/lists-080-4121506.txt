Hi all - right, first-post-from-me salutations done. =)

Firstly, the discussions in this group have really helped to further 
open my eyes to Web Accessibility issues. Thanks.

I've been thinking about the "open link in new window" debate, and I 
agree with the idea of maintaining browsing continuity - am in the 
process of reviewing some of the sites I have designed!

I don't know if this has been said before, but doesn't Windows default 
to opening each folder in new windows? Apologies if I'm wrong, but I 
just find that interesting... I think that has changed for XP though, 
and folders open in the same window by default.
