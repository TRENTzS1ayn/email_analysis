Hi Bob,

It's or a complex on line database application, using frames makes it a lot 
easier for splitting up the data enabling us to display/modify subsets of 
the data without having to refresh everything on the screen.

> how do you know this??

The application is being deployed to a closed group of users in a corporate 
environment so we know what they are using and can to a degree dictate a 
minimum software/hardware specification

We are just looking now at altering the application to make it accessible 
in case we have a user in the future with disabilities.
