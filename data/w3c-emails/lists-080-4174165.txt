The opening in a new window debate keeps happening because people haven't
made up their minds about the issue (this happens where I work at least).
The concern is not just about accessibility but also about usability.   The
problem, I think, is that some people think that setting up outside links to
open in a new window makes their site more usable.  

In my opinion, opening links onto new windows poses usability problems with
the non-techie crowd. The folks who don't notice that a new window opened
and that they can't hit the back button.  If this confuses non-techie people
who are sighted, I assume it would confuse non-techie individuals who are
not sighted.   

So even though the answer to the open-in-new-window debate is simple for
some of us, others are tempted to always add that target attribute to their
links.
