you are having a go!!

"Should we abandon accessible features of
HTML because WYSIWYG tools do not fully support them yet ?"

no,no,no,no never ever. The point was if a bit lengthy in reply to Lynn's
post

"I would of thought a person would have to know how to
code or at least know enough to be able to go in and
add accesskeys, tabindex ect or am I missing out on a
piece of software that can do this for me, at the
moment the only software I have for this is me and Im
getting a bit ragged round the edges :-)"

No coding skills required to build web sites.
