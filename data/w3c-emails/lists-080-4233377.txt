Hi Bob,
 
Unfortunately the place where I work uses several systems that impact my email behavior.  I have no idea why it decided to make my response an attachment - sorry about that.  And if it does it again to this email, I apologize again.
 
Kurt

I recieved a blank message from you and a notice that attachements were
removed!

this means that you fail to read the instructions, and it doesn't have
anything to do with accessibility.

at the bottom of every message is the "NO ATTACHEMENTS" instruction...the
place where I work and am accessing the internet has a firewall that
strips ALL attachemnts from ALL messages....there is no way around this
feature without violating company rules

because of security ONLY text messages are permitted, and ONLY included in
the body of the message...
