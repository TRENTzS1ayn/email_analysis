Apologies. I think the comment I made earlier was a little off-topic 
really... I was referring to Windows as an OS (or Explorer more 
specifically) rather than commenting from a web development point of view.

With respect to forcing open new windows, I think the debate seems 
pretty much an 'each to their own' at the moment... but I can appreciate 
the problems associated with it and I've a little more wiser to it.

Personally, at the moment I am interested in approaching accessibility 
problems from the browser application level rather than the markup level.
