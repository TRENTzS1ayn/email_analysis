 > What about opening a help window?

Is it possible for a browser to detect the use of a screen reader? Or 
other assistive technology?

If it could, wouldn't it make life easier for designers? An alternative 
text description of such things as help windows (or complex images like 
maps) could be sent to the screen reader in place of the object. Could 
Javascript be used to open a help window, or, alternatively, send some 
text to the screen reader if one is detected?

PS :: Coincidence? Have been looking at Atutor today and forwarded 
information to a friend.
