That is what longdesc and table summaries are for (for example), I do not
know how many people actually include these now adays (not many from the
pages I have been on lately). Screen readers will read out the table
summaries to the user, though someone not using a screen reader will have no
clue it is there. Using help pages is rarely needed imho unless you want to
provide a list of hot keys you have set up for use by the sighted user, on
that note please please do not put the hotkey in a title/alt tag it just
irritates screen reader users since they then hear it all twice.

BTW greetings to all, quite new to the list

David
