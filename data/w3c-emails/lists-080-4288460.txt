Opening any new window can be distructive.  It seems to me that it is much
simpler and cleaner to keep us in the same window.  If a new window is
opened, I have to remember that it is there and I have to go back and forth
between two windows if I want to read them.  It's much eaiser and cleaner to
use the back and forward buttons of the browser to achieve the same result
among other ui features.  I have real problems with anything that breaks ua
functionality such as opening a new window and in the process, disabling the
back button.  it usually also disables print and save and a whole bunch of
other things.

A point to consider from a usability perspective:

What about opening a help window?

It is certainly much easier, assistive tech user or not,  to have a help
window open alongside a Web site tool, for instance, that describes how
to use that tool, than it is to navigate between tool and help in the
same window.

New windows in some cases are a good thing, for accessibility and
usability.
