Greg it should not be necessary, the whole point is that AT users get the
same information as a sighted/'normal' user, which can be accomplished using
the existing guidelines.

Out of curiosity I have noticed netscape mentioned a few times, does anyone

(bleh) and Mozilla Firebird (yay) - ok I am a little biased :-P
