no an AT detector would not be nice, it would stigmatize a person with a
disability and open the web site up to a host of legal problems if there
was percieved discrimination based on the belief that the visitor was
treated differently because of disability, true or not..

I think the concept of AT detector is really a bad road to go down for any
reason.   make the site browser neutral and you have no problems.
