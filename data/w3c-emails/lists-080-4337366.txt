I totally agree that both AT user and others should receive the same 
information.  But that does not mean I can't present that information in 
two different interfaces. An AT detector would be great for this 
purpose. There is no reason why I can not present my information to you 
in an all text format, with text navigation etc, if you are using a 
screen reader, and present it in a graphic rich format if you are a 
person who prefers a visual display.

I'm not talking browser detector BTW. We never browser detect, but AT 
detecting could be very useful, for applying preference settings for 
example. See the IMS ACCLIP specifications, or the preset accessibility 
settings in ATutor, for example .  Same information, different interface 
element depending on how the reader prefers information to be presented.
