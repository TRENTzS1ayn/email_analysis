Bob since i have to use AT I do not see the need to use a text based browser
(and among the many others I know who use AT on a daily basis I have yet to
meet one who uses a text based browser). I know many people use a text based
browser to test for screen reader/braille compatability, but personally I
have found this to be a poor substitue for the real thing.
