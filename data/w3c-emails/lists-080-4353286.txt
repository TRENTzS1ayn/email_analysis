well I for one use almost exclusively a text based browser and it is
mostly done for speed, considering I get several hundred e-mails a day and
have to use the web for much research, and really do want to get some
"real" work done.  I'm an engineer not a IT person.

and I know quite a few others using varios types of AT that use text based
e-mail/browsers for the same reasons....they are fast and reliable,
especially over slow or dirty connections (I was in Nicaragua and was
barely able to get a 2400 baud modem to work reliably)  remember above all
else it is a "WORLD WIDE web" we are not just producing documents and
information to the USA/UK/Western Europe/Japan/Aus/NZ   there is also the
"Rest of the world"
