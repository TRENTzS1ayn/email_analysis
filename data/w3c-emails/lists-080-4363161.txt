For you maybe.

But what about others who can benefit from being able to have two 
windows open.

Imagine a skilled developer who knows about accessibility and usability 
issues:  you'll never convince that person that new windows should never 
be used.  She might listen if you were to say "minimize the use of popup 
windows because I get lost when there are too many of them", or,  "let 
me decide if I want popups or not". Hardcore denial only causes 
developers to put up their defenses and as a result they will likely 
ignore your pleas to get rid of popups. I would expect you and the 
developer to adapt a little. 

As that skilled developer I can not deny those who can benefit from 
being able to see help in a new window while they work in another 
window. Many, if not most sighted users would prefer this over having to 
switch back and forth with the back button.

If I have a short term memory disability, I won't be able to remember 
the instructions unless they are open in another window alongside. It 
works both ways.

You don't need a back button in a help popup. Only a "close window" link 
at the top so  you know you're in a  popup. It's when you don't know 
you're in a popup window that disabling the UI features becomes a problem.

Opening external URLs in a new window is a different story, but again a 
developer wants to keep you on his site. Denying them  new windows  will 
on raise their  defences.  Ask them to open all external URLs in the 
same window as a happy medium everyone can live with.
