Stigmatize? Knowone has to know there's a AT detector running. Besides, 
it really has nothing to do with disability. It has to do with 
adaptability and transformation of content. 

We go to great lengths to make our software usable by anyone. Making 
preferences available to users is a big part of that. If I know you are 
using a screen reader for example, I can strip away all the redudant 
navigation links, remove the images, or present columns of text in a 
single column. I'll transform the content so it works better for you. 
Feeling stigmatized by that, should be taken up with a psychologist.

Adaptability, or transformability are the key terms here.
