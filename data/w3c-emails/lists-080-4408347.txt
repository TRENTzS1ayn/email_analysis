Uhmm... how about this thing called CSS?  Separate function/information from
display...

Re: AT detecting.  Most "generalized" AT applications operate at the OS
level.  JAWS (and I believe Window Eyes) use Internet Explorer for web
access, even Homepage Reader uses the IE rendering agent.  How would you
detect somebody using a braille output device?  Then there is the whole
mobility impairment side... how exactly do you propose "testing" for
somebody using "sip and puff" tools, or voice recognition software? (I know
of a quadriplegic who exclusively uses Dragon Dictate/Dragon Naturally
Speaking).

Nope, Universal Accessibility should not depend on alternate streams...
you're heading into a mess of tangled pages when you go down that road...
