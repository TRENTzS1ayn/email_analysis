When I had to re-engineer a Web-based application for the purposes of 
accessibility, the help was in JavaScript popups.  (We actually had a 
controlled audience at the time - this is something that would have 
worked for all users.)

The approach I took could be applied equally to a site/application that 
spawns new browser windows - re-draw the current page with the help text 
displayed in context.  No to-ing and fro-ing with back/forward buttons 
or having to ALT/TAB between windows (or whatever system you use for this).

Granted, this is easiest to achieve when you are generating pages 
dynamically but for static sites, a version with help and version 
without help could be produced.

My personal view on spawning new windows is that it is only acceptable 
if the user agent can manage them in one window, such as with Mozilla's 
tabbed browsing.  Even then, it should only be done with the user's 
consent. (Follow this link to open in new window || follow this link to 
open in same window)
