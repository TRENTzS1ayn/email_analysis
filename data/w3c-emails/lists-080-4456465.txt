As an alternative to opening a help pop-up, you could consider adding 
any potentially helpful information to the page it relates to, thus 
avoiding the need to use an extra window at all. If you don't want the 
help there on the page all the time, you could provide newbie site 
visitors with an option to include additional help with each page, or 
have a link to a duplicate page with the help added to it. After all, 
dynamic Web development is there to be abused. ;)
