True screen readers are scripting agnostic as they simply work in terms
of what is rendered visually.  The dominant corporate use Assistive 
Technology is an IE bolt on using MSAA; it's not a screen reader.  It
will inherit the IE scripting of the page.

(Whilst agnostic, a true screen reader may well be a text mode program
and be used with a text mode browser; it is difficult to reconstruct
the text output by an uncooperative GUI application.  Current text mode
browsers have no scripting capability or only recognize particular idioms
in scripts, rather than interpreting the script from first principle.
Dead links as a result of poping up new windows with scripting is one
of the commonest idioms causing problems, so several variations are
probably emulated by text browsers that work by idioms.)
