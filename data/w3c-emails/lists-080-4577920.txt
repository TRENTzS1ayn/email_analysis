nice one, Tomas....agreed.

Somewhere in this thread I have read things like

"It's up to the author"
"personal choice"
"this is where accessibility is going"
and worse
"it has yet to be decided"

This debate was just as vociferous last time in '99 or whenever and opening
a new window was found guilty.

What new evidence is there to re-open the hearing? apart from the fact many
of the jurors have changed??!!

Now then did I hear in some vague way the whisper CSS?????!!!!
