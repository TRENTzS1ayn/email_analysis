 On my experience working on BrailleNet(France) with blind people, new
window is not a real problem if somewhere on code developper take time to
say that the link open in a new window.
Pop-up windows have more problems because they use scripts and a lot of
people don't accept scripts (there is some solutions about that i think).

For us, two solutions can be made :
1. Write directly on link that the link will open in a new window.
2. On link title attribute specify for example: title="Visit W3c Website
(New window)"

Users i know, say to us that with this warning they don't have problems with
new windows.

And on my own opinion new windows on HTML "_blank" is HTML valid so can't be
forbiden just adapt to make it more accessible

 > What about opening a help window?

Is it possible for a browser to detect the use of a screen reader? Or other
assistive technology?

If it could, wouldn't it make life easier for designers? An alternative text
description of such things as help windows (or complex images like
maps) could be sent to the screen reader in place of the object. Could
Javascript be used to open a help window, or, alternatively, send some text
to the screen reader if one is detected?
