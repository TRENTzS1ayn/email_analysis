Hi,

I have noticed there are now a few Java and Javascript textarea editors that
allow users to add content to a web page without having to know HTML.
However,  the tools I have found so far do not help users to create
standards based, structured markup (they tend to insert lots of font tags,
no paragraph tags, lots of line breaks etc).

Does anyone know of a tool that I could incorporate within my existing web
browser based, PHP Content Management System, that would help non-technical
users add content to a site in a standards based, accessible way?

Thanks,
Jim
