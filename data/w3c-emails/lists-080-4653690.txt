I think it's not realy a problem if you respect WAI recommendation that say
that links have to be short.
On BrailleNet short = max 80 caracters. So no problems with mozilla or
Netscape ;o)

I aggree with that but i learn to code with html transitional. ;o)

What type ?

All pages I develop are HTML 4 transitional Valid.

I just have a question what is the difference, for an audience, to code on
strict more than on Transitional ?

That depends on what model (DTD) of HTML you're using (or aiming at). With
the "transitional" models in HTML 4.x and XHTML 1.0 the target attribute is
indeed allowed and valid. But if you're aiming for (X)HTML strict (or XHTML
1.1) it isn't: frames of any sort (which includes the target attribute) are
not allowed in any of the strict models.

Some applications do indeed target XHTML strict (including on I'm working
on).

Alternatives/solutions are:
- tell your users whether what _type_ of links they're seeing and whether it
might be useful for *them* to use their UA facilities to open a new window
(maybe even tell them how - but somewhere separate)
- for "help" type information do what's been suggested in this thread
before: allow the user to display the page with, or without, help
information embedded in the page *)
- use 'object' tags instead of 'iframe' tags (embedding or displaying
"external" content may be a requirement; and "external" may mean being on
the same server, just not presented by the same application).

Problem:
This may exclude some older browsers (specifically, using object instead of
iframe).
This may be possible only with server-side scripting (not all developers
have access to that).
If that is a problem, given your audience, use the transitional model
instead of HTML 4.x strict/XHTML 1.0 strict/XHTML 1.1.

And it's not as simple as it sounds :)

*) I've seen some admirable efforts to include "help" information in title
attributes. Unfortunately, whether this actually is helpful depends on the
browser. IE (win) will show the whole text (or at least a lot of characters)
while Mozilla (and its Netscape derivatives) will show only a fixed-length
(maximized-length) string which may cut off the relevant part of the help
text. I've come to the conclusion that a title attribute may be useful for
some purposes, but not really for "help" information.
