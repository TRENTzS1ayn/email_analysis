Hello Tomas
Mine was a hypothetical comment. If we could detect what assistive 
technology a person was using, then ...

There is a bigger picture here; the transformable content approach to 
Web accessibility. The ACCLIP (accessibility learner information 
profile), as outlined in the IMS Project Web site, addresses the issue 
of preferences for learners.

All this fuss over new windows is a non-issue when you approach 
accessibility as a transformation of content.
