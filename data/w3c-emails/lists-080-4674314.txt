First, for some of you this response will wind up being an attachment.  I'll apologize for that even though I have no control over it.  

Can someone please explain the difference between a link that announces it will open in a new browser window and notepad opening when I select View > Source.  If there is a difference, is it anything other than a user preference?  As for browser history...if a new window opens and the user wants to capture the URL in their history list, copy the url from the new window [available even if the developer prevents the address bar from appearing], and paste it into the parent window address bar.

I believe what causes most of this frustration is unexpected new windows.  Don't know anyone that enjoys windows opening simply because I entered or left a site.  This experience is not comparable to clicking on a link that informs a user ahead of time that a new window will open.
