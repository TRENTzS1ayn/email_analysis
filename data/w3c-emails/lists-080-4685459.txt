Thank you Yoan.

Here's some evidence.  Are popup windows really innaccessible if they 
are opened with a warning? I think not. Even WCAG 1.0 realizes this.

I don''t know if I agree with the _blank opening of new windows though. 
This can result in mutliple windows being opened, and they can create 
confusion, which is what I think others are really trying to argue in 
their "dislike" of popups. Opening all new windows in the same popup 
reduces the chance a blind user will become lost in a desktop full of 
windows.
