User choice. Expected behaviours. Consistent deployment.

only insofar as there is a difference between "choice" and "preference", and
"need"

Exactly the point.  However the debate rages over the need of certain users
(those with cognitive disability requirements) to have access to information
such as JS popup help files.  Sites which *require* opening new windows so
as to not lose visitors are pretty much antiquated now, even if there are
way too many of them still out there... along with site owners who don't
"get it" and still cling to the quaint notion that they shouldn't be
"inviting visitors to leave their site".  By my observation, most serious
developers have gone a long way past this dated point of view.  But
dinosaurs continue to roam our world...
