I suggest the prevalence of pop-up-stopper programs
alone should stop developers from opening links into a
new window. 

The end user doesn't usually know the use of the
stopper stops links they choose to click on from
working, they think the stopper is just for stopping
pop-up advertising boxes. This could make your site
look like its full of dead links and not inspire
confidence in your product or service.
