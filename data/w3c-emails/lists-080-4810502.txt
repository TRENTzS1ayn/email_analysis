  What on *Earth* makes you think a mailto: link will open a new window?
  I can tell you in no uncertain terms that it won't in MY setup, and
  I'm not even disabled.

  A "new window" will only open IFF

    - There is a window-based GUI,
    - The UA knows the mailto: protocol,
    - The mail client can be started with an address as an argument,
    - The UA knows HOW to start the client with the address,
    - Everything is correctly configured.

  The difficulties with mailto: links have been debated back and forth
  before - they are not ideal. I don't accept your example.
