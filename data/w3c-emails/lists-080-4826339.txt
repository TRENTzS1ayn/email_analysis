In a more ideal world, you would use something like:

<a rel="help" href="help.html">How to fill in this form</a>

and a user could tell their browser to automatically open such pages in the
help window, if they so wished.  That would also, in my view, be the
ideal way of doing navigation bars.

The problem here is that if you don't include the warning in the page, 
non-conforming browsers won't warn you, and if you don't have the warning
generated by the browser, the vast majority of web sites won't warn you.
