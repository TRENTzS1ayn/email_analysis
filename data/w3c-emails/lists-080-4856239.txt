Hi All

I am in the process of re-engineering a site which I designed in the 
days before I heard the word 'accessibility'.

The front page used to have a pair of images which would change, under 
JavaScript control, when the cursor was moved over them.  These were 
purely "eye-candy" and contained no important information.  The client 
has asked that the new front page image do a similar thing.  Once again, 
no information will be missed if pictures can't be viewed or scripting 
doesn't work.

I have put a comment in the image's alt text, saying what the initial 
picture is of and what happens for those who can't see the effect (in 
case they think they're missing out on something).  Would this be 
something better handled using longdesc?  Should I just put in alt text 
for the default picture and ignore the rest?

The offending page is at: <http://www.neaglesrock.com>

Cheers

M
