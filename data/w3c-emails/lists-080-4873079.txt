Matthew,

Guideline 7.  Ensure user control of time-sensitive content changes.

mousing over, or changing focus to the various links could change the 
photo, that is you'd need a 'news & events' photo.
(The three images clearly have content related to the links)
a brief changing text description of the photos would help everyone 
enjoy the site, what are the names of the children?
alternatively you could provide slide show buttons, forward and reverse.

thanks
