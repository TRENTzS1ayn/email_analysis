Hi guys,

Is there any way possible to make Javascript calculators accessible? 

The main problem here is obviously, that they will not function with JScript
turned off. 

Are there any clever ways around this problem or will they have to not be
included on my site as it is impossible to portray the information in
another way?! 

Look forward to hearing all your thoughts and comments on this one!

-Jake.
