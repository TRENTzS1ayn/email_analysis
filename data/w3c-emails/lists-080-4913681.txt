Jake,

what kind of calculator are we talking about ? An all-purpouse one
(i.e. one that emulates a real-life calculator), or a specific one
(e.g. a mortgage rate calculator) which only has a few fields and a
big "calculate" button ? If it's the latter, you can make it accessible
by providing a dual mechanism: if javascript is present, do the
calculation on the same page, otherwise submit the form, do the
calculation server-side, then display the result on a new page.
If it's the former, I'm afraid that it will be a lot trickier to
make that one accessible. You may have to provide to separate calculators
altogether: one with all the various buttons, using javascript, and the
other one consisting of a simple text field where the users would write
their calculations (operators, parentheses and everything) and
the server would then evaluate the formula and spit out the result.
