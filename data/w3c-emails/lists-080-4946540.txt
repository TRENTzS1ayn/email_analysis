Hello,

You've accomplished an adequate job in the alt statement of describing the
process of presenting the 3 photographs on neaglesrock.com. Still, I have
some difficulty anytime one indicates, as you have, that no important
information is conveyed in the image(s). If this is the case, why is the
photo there in the first place?

In fact, doesn't it seem a discriminatory practice to have the image
"viewable" to those who can actually see it on-screen but to indicate to
others that no important information is presented therein?

I understand that "timeliness" of information is an important accessibility
concern; yet, it seems to me that a workable solution for this presentation
is to simply link to a "web page" that contains the 3 separate photos and
meaningful alts or descriptions in context. I've done exactly that for a
similar presentation; i.e., a randam photos Javascript:
