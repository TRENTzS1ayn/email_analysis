Is it discrimination if a developer makes a website nicer to look at?  If
the image is considered simple eye candy, can't the developer simple alt tag
or even an empty alt tag?  

<devils advocate with a tad bit of sarcasm>
When you view a website that has photographs using lynx or Jaws and you run
over an image that has an alt attribute that reads "photo of Jim" or "corner
graphic"  Do you ponder about the way Jim looks like or how if the corner
graphic has a nice beveled curve.  Or does the developer have the
responsibility to be more specific with the alt descriptions.  Should the
alt attributes read: "Full body photograph of Jim: buck teeth, brown hair,
blue eyes, about 5 feet tall and dressed in denim " and "blue corner graphic
with a smooth edge connecting the left navigation color and the top
navigation bar." But maybe that's not enough, maybe I should use the
original alt attributes and apply long descriptions for each, this way I can
explain that Jim is smiling at the camera, that his denim pants have a rip
on them slightly above his left knee and that his socks don't match because
he is British.  I mean, his socks don't match, AND he is British.  Can I
include humor in my longdesc page, or do I have to stick to the facts?
