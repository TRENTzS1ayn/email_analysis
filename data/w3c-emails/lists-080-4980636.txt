Subject: Update: HiSoftware Online tester and Cynthia Says


Hello All,

We have just released a new Version of our No Charge Online Resource the
HiSoftware Online tester:

Updated:
- Updated formatting for better viewing in FireBird
- Updated Accessibility Checks for Section 508
- Added Link Validation Scanning for page tested (Will assist with finding
missing bookmarks, etc)
- Updated Privacy/Section 208 testing

Also: The CynthiaSays Site is based on this technology: After a Week of
Testing we will add this tester to the group solution of CynthiaSays.Com as
an additional testing option for that site so as not to change the Links
people have created.

CynthiaSays was updated (Current Version) to address NS7 and Firebird
viewing last week.

Best Regards,

Rob Yonaitis
