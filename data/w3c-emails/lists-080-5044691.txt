I'm doing a presentation to the company I work for about the impact of
accessiblity issues on design. As there are often isssues with design that
impact the acesssibliy of a build.

Wondering if any one has any further ideas or surgestions...

So far the issues I've pulled from the WAI check list are.

1) Don't rely on colour to convey information.

2) Ensure that foreground and background have sufficient contrasts

3) Use mark up rather then images to convey information (what are opinions
on the use of images for naviagation?)

4) Use of relative rather then absolute units. Fluid Vs. fix design? This is
possibly the biggest point of contention and I currious what is the list
opions on this... People here interprite it in a number of ways.

5) Use navigation mechanisms in a constantant manner.
