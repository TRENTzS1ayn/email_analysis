Hi Ben

I don't know exactly what you're trying to present or to whom; most of 
the audiences to whom I've had to present accessibility concepts have 
been pretty non-technical <humour>This is a computer.  See computer go! 
  Go, go computer!</humour>.  What I have normally done is to quote - 
verbatim - the introduction to the WCAG 1.0 which looks at potential 
issues rather than methods:

<http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/#Introduction>

I've used this in presentation for everything from Rotary meetings to 
the State Education Department.  The content is simple enough that a 
broad range of people can understand it and though-provoking enough to 
make the audience realise that there ARE issues.

If you want to get more technical, you could always list the Priority 1 
points.

As regards "impact of accessibility issues on design", it's a simple 
case of getting it right at the start can avoid endless heartache later 
on.  I found out the hard way - I 'discovered' accessibilty through a 
Wired News article about fourteen months ago; I've been re-engineering 
all prior work ever since...

Hope this helps.

Cheers
