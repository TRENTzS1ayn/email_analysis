Images are great for navigation if they are clear, easily distinguished 
from each other, and especially if there is accompanying text. A bit 
like most browsers have a choice of icons, icons with text, or text 
only for controls. (You can do this in a site easily enough with 
stylesheet switching...)

I believe this is meant to encourage fluid design, in particular which 
will adapt to users changing the default font size. At least that is 
what I had in mind when it was first proposed for the guidelines.

Another thing I find is important is to consider valid markup and clean 
separation of the presentation into style sheets.

If you are using a content management system of some kind you will also 
find it helpful to be able to store assorted metadata about the pieces 
of content - alternatives that have been used with images (this may 
vary with context, so being able to store more than one is helpful), 
language information, a searchable set of information about the images 
you have available, etc. (The Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines 
are relevant to this case).

just a couple of thoughts

cheers
