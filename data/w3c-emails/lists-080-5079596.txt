All

last year I asked:

"Is it necessary to make a radio button in a fieldset checked? I know that it
is a requirement for WCAG 10.4 but how useful is it? I'm a bit worried by
setting one as checked for say, indicating a user's gender in a form, and
then that user hitting return accidentally and sending information that they
haven't actually entered. I guess the same applies to checkboxes. For text
inputs the problem is less because the form will just submit something like
"enter your name" instead of a name but with buttons the data sent could be valid but incorrect"

I never actually received a response from anyone (not that I'm bitter ;-)) but the problem has just reared it's head again. 

I know that some people think that it's not actually necessary now to include default place-holders for text areas but does the same still hold for grouped controls such as radio buttons and checkboxes?

thanks

--J.
