That would be my stance too but... (... but it doesn't get the logo which some people seem to think is important)

Could anyone provide combinations of user agents/AT which won't recognise that the form control is there if a place holder is not present (or present other problems).

I notice that in my copy of the draft WCAG2 (probably not the most recent) checkpoint 10.4 is to be replaced with Checkpoint 5.2 "Design for backward compatibility". How far back should we be looking?
