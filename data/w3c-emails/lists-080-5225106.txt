Depends on the audience.  For a mathematically inclined audience, MathML
might just be appropriate.  For an audience with good high school physics,
m<sup>2</sup>  (note that it is lower case m).  For a general audience,
square metres or, possibly, <abbr title="square metres">sq. m.</abbr>.

(I've got a square meter, but nowadays people use LCD digital displays.)

There is such an element: you surround it with the two tags <sup> and
</sup>.  However, there is actually a superscript 2 (&#178;) character
that probably has sufficiently universal support to be safe to use (but
not for a non-mathematical, general, audience).  It even seems to be in
code page 437, so available to European/North American PC text mode users.
Lynx cannot upshift the sup element, but can use the superscript 2 glyph.

I think I prefer the character.
