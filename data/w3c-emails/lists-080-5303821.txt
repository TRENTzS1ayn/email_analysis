touchscreens offer the opportunity for a different user experience when 
navigating.
Does anyone know of a clear and simple example?

The one I am grappling with is 
http://www.peepo.co.uk/test/use-split2.svg
this currently only works with asv6, though this is being addressed at 
present....
and the touchscreen functionality is currently missing :-( but should 
be evident to sighted visitors.

I may have to buy one now...

thanks
