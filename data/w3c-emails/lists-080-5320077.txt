Well - if you don't have the Adobe plug-in installed it tells you that its 
best viewed with one and there's a link to the Adobe SVG Viewer site.

The .com site has sounds as you rollover the images, maybe the .co.uk is under 
development?

Is the point that it's a site actually developed by people with learning 
difficulties?  An on-going project perhaps?

More info would have been nice.....
