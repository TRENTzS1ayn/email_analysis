Unfortunately, my Mozilla behaves similarly: it says it can't handle the file and suggests Adobe as the default. When I accept that, IE loads, and then gives me a JScript runtime error ("Object expected line: 1, column: 0").

When I press OK, I get: Please either download the new adobe plug-in or use peepo.com

(New? What version do I have and what version should I have? "plug-in" is a link but I can't right-click on it to capture the URL; the page just loads in IE, and tells me: "It is a pre-alpha version that includes experimental features which are subject to change." I don't want to download that. A reasonably stable beta would be fine with me, pre-alpha, no.)

BTW, the page at http://www.peepo.co.uk/ seems to consist entirely of scripts, including VBscript which I'm sure Mozilla does not support.  There's no DOCTYPE declaration but assuming it's intended as either HTML 4.01 or XHTML the code is not valid: the script tags don't have a type attribute.

When I try in Amaya I see nothing but a blank page. Possibly because it doesn't handle those scripts, or the invalid code.


Mozilla 1.4
IE 5.01
Amaya 8.1
