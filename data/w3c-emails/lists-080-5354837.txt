Strangely the winner in the games category http://www.orisinal.com has 
an interface rather similar to peepo.co.uk, even to the extent that the 
page is 'greyed' out and the links gain saturation onmouseover, however 
they chose flash rather than SVG.

any plans for an accessibility or usability webby?

thanks
