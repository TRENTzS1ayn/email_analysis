Hi,

I?d like to know what?s your opinion about using 'cursor: hand'. The 'hand' value is not a css standard but is the one understood by IE 5.x browsers. 

I find it usefull, specially with submit buttons which don?t show the hand icon by default over them in those browsers. Using cursor: hand you can make the submits look much more like the image buttons, which are less accessible but more frecuently used.

However, it?s a handicap to validate the stylesheet.

Cheers.

Pablo Enr?quez.
