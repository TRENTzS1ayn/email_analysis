Form validation would check for the instance of the 'not answered' button and prompt the user to fill in that question. The form could not be submitted unless the user had chosen something other than the initial state. If the user has taken the selection away from the initial state (i.e. made a choice) then the form can be submitted. It's just a hack to get round the potential problem of UA behaviour not being predictable when no button is initially selected and I don't see any major usability problems *if* the question is a mandatory one. Even if the response is optional I think the solution works since the response ('not answered') is still valid. The form validation need only be made on mandatory fields.
