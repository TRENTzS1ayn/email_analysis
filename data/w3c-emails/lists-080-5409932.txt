>I?d like to know what?s your opinion about using 'cursor: hand'. The 'hand' value is not a css standard but is the one understood by IE 5.x browsers. 

While cursor: hand is not valid, it is valid (in CSS2) to use a URI to point to a cursor resource, so you can use cursor : url("hand.cur"), and even provide a list so the user agent can pick the one it can handle (just as with font families). Why use invalid code when valid code can accomplish the same thing?
