I think I have a similar viewpoint to Matt.

There is a difference between conforming to the guidelines, and 
accessibility. (There is a huge difference between conforming to the 
bare minimal level-A and accessibility. Triple-A conformance is more 
useful, I think).

As far as the checkpoint goes, it seems pretty clear that if there is 
no metadata then the page fails. I don't actually see what the 
relevance of it being in a protected area is - I work a lot in 
post-login parts of the Web, as many people do, and the same things 
apply inside and out. I work with semantic web agents that get into 
protected areas all the time too.

AGLS data is useful for a variety of purposes, but it is worth looking 
over the discussion that took place recently about what kind of 
metadata is useful for accessibility in particular - 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/2003AprJun/1162

There are a couple of other discussions that take place - the 
SWAD-Europe project does some work on this, Dublin Core has an 
accessibility group (and you can meet lots of the relevant people at 
the OzEWAI conference in melbourne next week where this will be a 
discussion topic ;-) and there are discussions in the WCAG working 
group from time to time, where there are a few implementors at work.

The w3c-wai-er-ig@w3.org mailing list is for a group that is apparently 
getting a new charter and new life - that is another place where people 
with some expertise can be found.

cheers
