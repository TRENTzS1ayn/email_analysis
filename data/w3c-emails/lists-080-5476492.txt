Not really, although at the time the site began Flash had an obvious advantage 
over SVG in that it existed, and SVG didn't!

Whether SVG would be just as good could only be determined by porting the games 
and seeing. Given that the games were designed to take advantage of Flash's 
strong points I would be surprised if they would all be as playable - 
especially since the viewers are relatively recent and still at a stage where 
each new version has considerably better performance than the previous.

I'm not sure that porting to SVG would automatically bring an improvement in 
accessibility. In particular given that the point of most of the games is to be 
visually attractive tests of hand-eye co-ordination it's hard to imagine them 
being used by anyone other than users of graphical browsers with good eyesight 
and good motor skills.
