For authoring I tend to use Amaya - it has basic functionality only,  
but that generally meets my needs.

I have also played with SodiPodi and enjoyed it (running on OS X, but  
it is available primarily for Linux and perhaps even for Windows). I  
know other people have recommended Corel Draw, and Illustrator and the  
newest version of Visio can also produce it, although I have heard  
(unreliable sources) that the code they produce isn't too impressive.

Cheers
