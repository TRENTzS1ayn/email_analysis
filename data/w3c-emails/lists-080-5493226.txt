Outside of textedit which is my preferred tool, the only other one I've 
really loved is jsquiggle, which is undoubtedly superior, for what it 
does :-)  vi is great when working in a pda, and debugging, its very 
quick, so you have to decide for yourself, or describe what your 
expectations are...
Amaya 8.2 GL is almost a possibility, the rendering is just so much 
cruder than others, with additional, bonus artefacts !!!
it is improving over time.  I'm awaiting a copy of illustrator CS for 
mac but 10 seemed to really destroy any sense the code had, you load 
clean stuff and get *?$@* really depends what you're requirements are, 
mine is something with at least a little transparency or clarity.

thanks
