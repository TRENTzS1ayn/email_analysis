I had a look.  Hand is the link icon, i.e. it represents a noun type
function.  Really it is a finger pointing.  IE uses arrow for its own
buttons (verb like function), and so do other Windows applications,
so image map input elements used as buttons really use arrow, rather
than the other way round.

Actually, I suspect you are not talking about image map input elements,
but about images in anchors, and, because they are being treated as
links, not commands, that is why they get a link feedback.

Unfortunately there is no backwards compatiblity soluton for button
elements.
