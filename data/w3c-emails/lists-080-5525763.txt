Hi Kieran,

in HTML you can't do this in the general case. The closest approach is 
to use the fieldseet and legend elements which are designed to do 
something like this. See 
http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/interact/forms.html#h-17.9 for where it says 
"Each LABEL element is associated with exactly one form control." and 
see http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/interact/forms.html#h-17.10 for fieldset 
and legend, which do what you are looking for.

There is a little hack that is often used of putting things in a table, 
where you can associate one cell with a number of others. A handful of 
screen readers present this information as if it were achieving your 
goal here. But you don't have a formal way of saying that the label 
applies to the form controls in particular, which is the checkpoint 
requirement as I understand it. In particular, unlie with 
fieldset/legend you have to do some nasty hacking to get an accesskey...

just my 2cents (Australian official value)
