Hi all

I am giving a talk to the British Computer Society's web publishing
group on publishing on the web for people with learning disabilities.

I have found a lot of good resources on the web, but was wondering if
anyone had any other recommendations for good reading, or examples of
good websites which are designed specifically for people with learning
disabilities which I could demonstrate.

I am also particularly interested in the use of sound.
We have developed our sound pages using flash sound files. 
We are mid development with a new section - which is not really working
http://www.mencap.org.uk/Test/mnis_with_sound/health.html using dhtml
and flash, but it is too jerky!

Anyway, if anyone has any suggestions for any of the above, I would be
very grateful

thanks 

Caroline
