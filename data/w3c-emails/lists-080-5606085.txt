Hi Caroline,
Take a look at this tool -
http://69.10.136.193:8080/applications/testing/simulations
This is a simulation for different user scenarios.  Put in any URL.  Choose
the last simulation which is readability for people with some reading
disabilities.  It was created by a W3C member who is dyslexic.  The idea
here is for people to test their sites and check the usability of their site
with these different scenarios.

For the full review tool - www.ubaccess.com/art.html

I hope this helps.
Good luck with your talk.
Jael
