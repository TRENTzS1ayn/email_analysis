Subject: label tag and multiple associations 


Greetings,

How do I associate more than one input field with one label ?? For example,
let's say I have a Telephone number field but have two boxes, i.e. one for
the area code and one for the actual number. Ignoring the fact that I could
have an area code label, is there a way of associating these two input
boxes with the one label ?? Please don't question why I have done it this
way, or that I should redo it this way. I'm not interested in workarounds.
Just wondering if it is possible. Then I can go back to them to tell them
that they have to change it. Thanks in advance.

Regards,
Kieran
