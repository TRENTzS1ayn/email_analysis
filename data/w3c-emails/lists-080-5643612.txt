Caroline,

looks to be a great site, well done and thanks, we now link to it from 
the letter 'h'.

I'm not sure if you've taken the time to look at the peepo site, but 
you will find plenty of resources there.

We've always felt it is critical to involve users in creating 
resources, this sends a powerful message, empowers and motivates.
teaching staff report that students fail to engage well with icon based 
resources and prefer photographs of individuals.
I recognise this may not always be appropriate.

SVG produces graphics that scale well, this can be a huge advantage.

sound does take a while to load, it means caching the site before users 
visit, or as mencap has done in the past provide a speaker button.
we don't do this only because of the confusion of icons present 
already....

one real problem we've had is creating web pages that look great and 
print well....

thanks
