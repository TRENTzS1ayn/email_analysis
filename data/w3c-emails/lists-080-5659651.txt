Whilst cursor:hand isn't supported by other browsers, cursor:pointer is supported by IE 5.x, Mozilla, Opera and Safari, and is amongst the W3C's own standardised attribute values: http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/ui.html#propdef-cursor. This should present the same cursor that the browser uses for standard links; in most cases a hand.
