There was a hearing on November 6. I understand it could be a long time -
like even a year - before there is a decision.

Does anyone know what happened/is happening regarding the appeal in the
Southwest Airlines casE? As I recall, this was due to be heard on 6
November, but I haven't come across anything saying what happened. Is the
hearing still going on or are we still awaiting the judgment?

Cheers 

martin.
