BlankAny one want to guess whose site this coding was lifted from?
            <td colspan="2"><IMG height=8 alt="" src="../Templates/5615/IMG4.gif" width=1></td>
          </tr>
          <tr> 
            <td colspan="2"><IMG height=8 alt="" src="../Templates/5615/IMG4.gif" width=2>

Am I unique in my feeling of deja vu?

I know, a bit like asking how long is a piece of string, however The paralympic version of the site (oops!! given the game away) has alt tags or to all you purists alternative attributes, that are of a cryptic one word nature. They cover the mandate, but are they informative enough? There is an argument they could also be misleading. For example closing my eyes and reading the alt tag on one image says football, picture in mind of spherical object made of leather. nothing is further from the truth.
