The Guild of Accessible Web Designers 'went public' today. Although the 
Guild is not ready for an official launch, they are looking for new 
members who are interesting in helping to develop the organization. The 
intention is to launch officially some time in early 2004.

The Guild of Accessible Web Designers (GAWDS.org) is  a membership 
organisation set up to promote the practice of acccessible web design, 
and the interests of accessible web designers.

The website is at http://www.gawds.org.  New members can sign up at 
http://www.gawds.org/admin/members/agreement.php

There is a lot of information about what the Guild is about, and what 
it intends to do, on their website and on the Accessify Discussion 
Forum at http://www.accessifyforum.com/forum15/

Pat
