When I saw this invitation I felt pleased that at last Accessible Web
Design may find a new forum and voice however my joy turned to
disappointment very quickly.

To me Accessible Web Design must focus on the users and this group
apears to be be relegating them to a very minor place.  Accessibility is
not a technical issue it is a people issue and it appears that the focus
on people has been lost.

An indication to this is the reference to "the disabled."

Whilst when I am referred to as the disabled by most people I do not
object as this is just ignorance however when an organisation purporting
to be professional refers to people with disabilities in this manner I
do as professionals should know that such references are offensive to
many.

I have great respect for the technical abilities of those who appear to
be connected with this organisation however this site has led me to
question the focus, making websites useable to people or performing an
set of rituals in design regardless of the result.

I hope I read this page wrong.  I fear I did not.

Subject: Guild of Accessible Web Designers starts membership drive


The Guild of Accessible Web Designers 'went public' today. Although the 
Guild is not ready for an official launch, they are looking for new 
members who are interesting in helping to develop the organization. The 
intention is to launch officially some time in early 2004.

The Guild of Accessible Web Designers (GAWDS.org) is  a membership 
organisation set up to promote the practice of acccessible web design, 
and the interests of accessible web designers.

The website is at http://www.gawds.org.  New members can sign up at 
http://www.gawds.org/admin/members/agreement.php

There is a lot of information about what the Guild is about, and what 
it intends to do, on their website and on the Accessify Discussion 
Forum at http://www.accessifyforum.com/forum15/

Regards,
Pat
