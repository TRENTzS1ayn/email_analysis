Southwest Airlines caseHello Martin-
We are awaiting the appellate ruling and it can take a while.  Oral
arguments were interesting but we must wait and see.

Best regards,
Cynthia Waddell

  Does anyone know what happened/is happening regarding the appeal in the
Southwest Airlines casE? As I recall, this was due to be heard on 6
November, but I haven't come across anything saying what happened. Is the
hearing still going on or are we still awaiting the judgment?

  Cheers

  martin.
