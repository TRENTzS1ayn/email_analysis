> I must agree with Harry. On Thursday last I gave a talk to the BCS in Preston on the  rteasons for and ways of making accessible. The after talk discussion (continued in the pub) tried to find a better word for 'accessible'. We tries 'usable' but that needs qualification. My premise is that if you design to standards, no layout tables, no frames, no proprietary code, validate both your code and CSS in other words follow the specs you get accessible sites - and these sites work on devices for the 'disabled' and for mobile computing, pervasive computing, webTV and all that sort of thing.

Maybe not, think about how you could verbally ask for road traffic reports from acomputer and not have to wait for the radio - for me I'm usually alerted just when I've passed the last turn off I could have taken to escape the problem. This type of page is also accessible.

We have to concentrate on the user's requirements, no matter what they are, which browsing device they are using, where they are - I really do think that 'accessible' has become a convenient watchword for a certain way of testing (not working) and has lost the emphasis on 'design for all' (don;t like the phrase, but it's the best i can come up with at the time)

After 10 weeks I'm getting a web page assignment set that's valid, accessible, attractive, cross-browsing device - everything you need. I don't tell them it's accessible or any other artificial title - just that this is the way that they have to design web pages. They have stylesheet switching to change colours and type size, they have stylesheets that cascade via @import staements, they have done very well indeed. And thihs is first years!
