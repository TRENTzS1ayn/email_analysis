Hello all,

thanks to the Rainbow group at ESSI there is now a french language 
mailing list for discussion of web accessibility. It is meant for 
technical discussion in french - allowing both beginners to ask simple 
questions, and detailed technical discussion of new work or particular 
issues.

Anyone can subscribe to the list by sending the message "subscribe" to 
handitech-request@essi.fr - subscription is moderated to stop spam, but 
messages from subscribers are not moderated.

The archives of the list are available at 
http://email.essi.fr/pipermail/handitech/ and more information about it 
is at http://email.essi.fr/mailman/listinfo/handitech.

Je vous attends l?...

cheers

Charles
