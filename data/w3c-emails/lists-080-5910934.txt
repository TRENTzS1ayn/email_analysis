Google for Cynthia Says and for Bobby.   There are probably others.

No.  These tools are not alternatives to manual checking.  They cannot check
for appropriate use of constructs (and for that matter, appropriate non-use).
One common concern is that Bobby's report confuses users into thinking they
are compliant because they ignore the list of manual checks that it produces
and go by the success of the automatic checks.
