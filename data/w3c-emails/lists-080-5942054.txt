oops! and sorry all, I should explain.

I had my property development hat on yesterday
so was very strapped for time.

The site is http://www.paralympic.org/

The images on the site must have been changed yesterday. 
My original posting referred to an index page that had an 
image of two guys playing soccer, the alt tag said "football" 
the particular image I used as an example is no longer 
displayed on the page.

My cryptic comments were perhaps too vague, 
if so, mia culpa. 
But not lost on everyone I note!

If you were on this list 4 years ago you may have 
remembered the hiatus over the sydney olympics site?

It appeared history was repeating itself, I still question 
the tag on the guys diving into the swimming pool
as "swimming" but two guys playing 
soccer with a tag of "football" did not cut the mustard
with me. 

Thats all, now where's that paint brush...?
