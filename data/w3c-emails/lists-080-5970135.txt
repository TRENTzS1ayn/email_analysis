BlankIt a appears another interesting case goes to court today
where a wheel chair user is seeking compensation
from London Stanstead Airport and Ryan Air for charging ?18.00 for the use of a wheelchair and lift to get onto the plane.

I realise it is the Airlines that take the flak for this, but
I believe it is the Airport authority that makes the charge??

I think he has an open and shut case, but the outcome will be interesting, and I believe the airline and airport are
only contesting the case as this sets a precedent to supply a reasonable service for all disabled travellers, world wide. 

Shame on them
