When I worked for a tourism dot-com some years ago we weren't shy about 
suggesting that customers sue over this (it wasn't our company policy to do so, 
but individually we were outraged and didn't hide it).

IIRC the airlines are customers of the airport, not the passengers. They charge 
the airlines for the use of the wheelchair lifts, I don't think any other 
airline passes the charge on the customer, whereas Ryan Air pass *everything* 
onto the customer.
