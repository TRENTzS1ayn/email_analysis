Hi Ralph,

there are lots of tools. They are all going to  require some thinking 
from the users, but the best of them are very helpful in guiding the 
users to understand (and repair) the problems, assuming they are not 
accessibility experts.

WAI has a list of tools at http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/existingtools - it 
isn't exhaustive (there are new tools developed pretty frequently, or 
new versions of existing tools) but it does list a lot of them.

cheers

Chaals
