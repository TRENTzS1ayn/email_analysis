oops! and sorry all, I should explain.

I had my property development hat on yesterday so was very strapped for
time.

The site is http://www.paralympic.org/

The images on the site must have been changed yesterday.
My original posting referred to an index page that had an image of two guys
playing soccer, the alt tag said "football"
the particular image I used as an example is no longer displayed on the
page.

Thats all, now where's that paint brush...?

[John]
So is there a list/site of 'good practice' with ALT? Just how much/little
should one put into an ALT tag, how much in TITLE, and when should LONGDESC
be used?
 
ALT is used (incorrectly) as a tooltip in IE6, unless there's a TITLE as
well. Other browsers get it right by using the TITLE as a tooltip alone.
 
Reason for the question is that none of the searches I've done say anything
about the content of the various tags (O.K. Attributes) but concentrate on
what they do. Seems that everyone has says that you have to but no-one has
said what to do.
