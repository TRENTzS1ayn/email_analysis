Any knowledge that went with Sydney or previous Olympics will have gone down the pan, as I don't suspect there's anyone who worked on the Sydney site that will be working on the Athens site. IBM aren't doing or sponsoring the sites this time round - and I don't know who is. The current athens2004.com site is a smalltime Athenian concern.

Do the Greek Governemant have any Accessibility laws in place? Because it is the country's regulations that seem to be the guiding force - the Sydney Olympic case was brought by an Australian under Australian LAw.
