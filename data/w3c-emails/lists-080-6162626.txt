Hi Jules,

I'm not sure I follow your argument. Validators don't set standards. They
just perform basic tests where they can. Both Cynthia Says and Bobby will
pass an XHTML Strict document with an xml:lang attribute.

<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en">

Best regards.

Gez

you must use the latest technology. I'm only really raising it because the
gizmos like Cynthia Says and Bobby fail a site if you don't have the lang
attributes. I suggest the code is modified to search for just
'lang="<lang>"', whether it is 'lang="en"' or 'xml:lang="en"'.
