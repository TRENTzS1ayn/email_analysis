As is recommended by the appendix on backwards compatibility with XHTML1.0.

You could personally delete every user-agent in the world that recognises lang 
but not xml:lang, and we'll all be grateful. Otherwise we're going to need 
transitional techniques.

Why use a make-up-as-you-go along meta element when there is a standard 
attribute? Why would you expect the meta element to work?

I can see the point of using <meta name="DC.Language" content="en-gb" /> or 
Dublin Core in RDF/XML, only for user-agents that care about metadata and not 
the content.

Why have a global version of anything that can be scoped - just use the scoped 
method in the widest scope.

So it you have this there, then what do you gain by inventing a new technique?

Given that this is in addition to the HTTP content-language headers and in 
addition to Dublin Core I really can't see the point of any of this.
