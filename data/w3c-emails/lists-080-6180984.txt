Knowing only in part (I'm half Greek) about Greek law, I can only speculate that if it is written in European law, it is almost certainly written in Greek law. Whether it is acted upon is *entirely* another matter! I was there in October and mentions of banning smoking in public were aired. Now 45% of Greeks *officially* smoke - it's about double in reality. And when McDonald's came to Greece and opened with non-smoking restaurants they were boycotted and still don't have a leading market share... So you can see that even written in law, with Greece, it's a lost cause, unless public favour takes the moral high ground :(

Secondly, because of the rush with the late works, I doubt considerations like WAI will be taken up seriously. Greeks tend to be ruthlessly pragmatic (at least that's what they think), and to them they will think it a waste of time and money to support the disabled minority - though they will never admit it! And if the disabled should take action, then:
a) good luck with the Greek courts (Test cases are famous for going belly up) and
b) it's law, so what's the problem?

At the end of the day, I wouldn't expect anything in terms of accessibility from Athens 2004!
