'NetEmpire', a German concern at www.netempire.de. Judging from the fact
they use flash & JS on their site with no apparent possibility for any kind
of accessible content, I assume they have absolutely no idea or concept of
WAI.

formal, but nonagressive letters to both the IPC and NetEmpire stating that
the site is redone with proper regard for WAI - or else bad press will
arise.

down the pan, as I don't suspect there's anyone who worked on the Sydney
site that will be working on the Athens site. IBM aren't doing or sponsoring
the sites this time round - and I don't know who is. The current
athens2004.com site is a smalltime Athenian concern.
