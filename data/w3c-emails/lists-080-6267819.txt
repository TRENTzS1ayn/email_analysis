RE: To be or not to be...an alt tag, that is the questionThere are laws,
european human rights laws, similar to the
australian one that one won the case, sorry "hearing" last
time.

There was a seminar about accessibility in general
4 years ago in Brussels not long after, so the internet
was on the agenda.

In the welcome speech to the delegates it was noted
with a certain amount of disapointment the total lack
of any person in a wheelchair attending, inspite of many
invitations sent out.

Red faces on the stage when it was
pointed out by the then CEO of Dish the small revolving
doors to the building excluded wheelchairs.

ooops!
