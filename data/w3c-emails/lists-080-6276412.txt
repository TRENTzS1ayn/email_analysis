Yassoo Jules,

If the attitude is "you stand no chance so don't bother" 
then 98% of the athletes may as well not go, never mind
getting the website accessible.

By the way, is smacking your head against a brick wall
an olympic sport? Should be. I'll willingly compete.

Put 3 Americans in a room and within an hour they'll 
form a corporation, put 3 Brits in a room they (sadly) 
will form a queue, but put 3 Greeks in a room and you
have a political debate in seconds.

I think we should sling some mud, some may stick.

If one Greek takes notice and thinks for a minute
we may have started a ripple in a pond. who knows?

smiles
Paul
