What standard refers to 79 characters.
I have searched for this and can find only preferences of individuals.
There is a big difference to what someone likes and a standard.  
If there is a standard can you please advise me where to find it and the
standard of what standard setting body it is.

  If by using the right name for something, be it an ALT attribute or a
  car wheel, makes me a purist, then I will happily admit to being a
  purist.

  Please consider that communication can be inaccessible too, in
  particular if you refer to a spade as a "implement for producing
  holes".

  May I take this opportunity to, again, remind us all that the standard
  for e-mail messages are 77-79 characters per line ? Thankyou.
