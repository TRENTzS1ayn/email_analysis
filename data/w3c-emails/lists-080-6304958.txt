My impression is that a lot of meta element properties were added into
HTML to allow one to dump the meta information from MS Word into
an HTMLised version of a Word document, without having to thing about
whether the particular property was covered by HTML.

In this particular case, the HTML specification says that the default
language is take from the HTTP Content-Language header (with 
an equivalent provided by meta http-equiv taking precedence), provided
that there is only one language.  Documents can have more than one
language from this point of view; the languages in this context represent
the set union of the languages spoken by the intended audience of the page.
