There isn't any contradiction. There are, as you point out, bugs in 
some tools which don't properly recognise language tagging as specified 
(but they are testing tools - no worries with users' tools...).

On the other hand it is wrong to rely on meta name="language". The 
correct method for all XML (including XHTML) is to include the xml:lang 
attribute as appropriate. The correct method for HTML (up until 
bugwards-compatible XHTML 1) is the lang attribute. You should also 
have your server sending out HTTP information identifying the 
Content-language correctly.

No it doesn't. It says that in XHTML 1.0 Strict, or XHTML 1.1, you 
should use xml:lang not lang, since that has been deprecated. It also 
states that you should be using XHTML 1 or 1.1, as you noted.

Good suggestion. There is a mailing list for the WAI Evaluation and 
Repair Tools group - http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER for more information - 
which is where you might get the attention of the developers. Most of 
them also have a feedback mechanism as part of their tool sites. Few of 
them read this list.

The tests you are ''passing' are clearly flawed...

That is not correct. The specifications are pretty clear about that.

For changing language mid-stream this is indeed the way to do it.
