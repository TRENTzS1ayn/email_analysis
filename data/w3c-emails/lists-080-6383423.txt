  My apologies, I'm sure. RFC 2822 section 2.1.1, "Line Length Limits":
  
   "There are two limits that this standard places on the number of
    characters in a line. Each line of characters MUST be no more than
    998 characters, and SHOULD be no more than 78 characters, excluding
    the CRLF."

  The meaning of "SHOULD" in this context can be found in RFC
  2119, and means that unless a very good reason exist, and the possible
  implications of violating the standard has been fully understood, you
  should stick to it.

  Since we are all here to discuss how to make information accessible to
  a number of people using a number of devices, it would seem a very
  small thing to ask that said discussions observe the standards which,
  in the first place, was created to make sure communication went well
  on different devices.

  Note that RFC 2822 obsoletes RFC 822, which has been in place since
  August of 1982.
  
  See also http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2822.txt. I expect I do not
  need to explain the standardization body of RFCs.
