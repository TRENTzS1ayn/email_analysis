Hello All,

Just a quick note to the list members to note a new resource on the Web that
has been developed that handles the GOC CLF Standards:
http://www.hisoftware.com/press/cliff.html
Covering Accessibility, Usability and Privacy, etc...

The initial site is up and we are seeking feedback on this new resource:
http://www.hisoftware.com/cliffsays/


The CLF Standard deals with many items related to Accessibility and Privacy,
for those that work with CLF a new utility may also be helpful that can be
downloaded free of charges and free of registration <g> that allows the
building of P3P Policy Files
http://www.hisoftware.com/downloads/p3pbuilder.exe (3.54 MB)

We look forward to any comments on this first tester designed to
cover WCAG Priority 1&2 and CLF Standards specifically.

You can learn more about this resource and CLF at a January 5th WebCast:
Assuring Compliance with the Government of Canada Common Look and Feel
Standards across your enterprise Web sites
http://www.hisoftware.com/events/CLF.html

Thanks in advance for your feedback!

Best Regards,
Dana Louise Simberkoff
