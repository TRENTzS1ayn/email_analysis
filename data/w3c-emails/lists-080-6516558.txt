Since conventions for writing dates & phone numbers are so variable, I 
would say arrange it whichever way you want. But no matter how you set it 
up, give clear instructions to the users.

Phone numbers, for example, sound like really giant numbers with some 
screen reader setups if there's no punctuation. & some people use spaces to 
separate country & area codes, etc, from the main number. Some people use 
dashes, some use dots. So be specific about what you want (&/or have some 
good processing of the form data after it comes in).
