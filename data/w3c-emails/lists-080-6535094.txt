My understanding is that terms like "Universal Design," "Universal 
Access," "Access for All," and "Barrier Free" can all be used 
synonomously with "Accessibility for people's with Disabilities."  
Unfortunately, they can also be used to mean different things.  In Hong 
Kong, for example, "Barrier Free" and "Access for All" refer NOT to 
Accessibility for People with Disabilities - they refer to an effort to 
get all economic classes of people, and differently-educated people into 
the world of Technology - in other words, these phrases are being used 
for "The Technological Divide."  "Universal Design," from a Usability 
worldview, is probably more of a superset that includes usability for 
people's with disabilities, but is not restricted to those users. 

George - anything you can add?
