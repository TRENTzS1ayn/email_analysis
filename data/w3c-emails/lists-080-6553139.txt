I use this from time to time and I have normal colour vision.  I do it for 
the following reasons:

- pages which have been "designed" with very poor colour contrasts;
- pages that use white on white text and rely on scripting to make bits
  of the text visible (the particular, mobile phone company, web site for
  this one has now become completely unusable except, possibly for a
  completely fresh out of the box IE configuration);
- I sometimes like to see which links I've visited but designers don't seem
  to like having specific link colours and this form of feedback.

(It is also helpful in making pages generally readable, as predicable link
colours make it easy to find links, but I don't actually disable colours
for that reason.)

My own feeling on image replacement is that people who want to do it 
should not be using HTML as it is the wrong language when form is dominant.
It may be controversial here, but I think tagged PDF is a better fit to
that "want".

Incidentally, I also run with font sizes almost permanently disabled,
because of the current level of abuse of absolute, small (and occassionally
relative small) font sizes.  I would probably lose all images if I invoked
the replacement text provided by these means, and the chances are that
the text as images is based on the same, over-shrunk, sizes as the real
text.
