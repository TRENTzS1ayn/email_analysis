There is a lot of code around that will cope with dates in almost any format,
including "yesterday", "3 days ago", etc.   The only real problem with dates
is handling the dd mm yy/mm dd yy/yy mm dd/ trichotomy - that is normally
handled by knowing the locale of the user in non-web cases, but a web
application doesn't have access to that and might need to query ambiguous
cases.

The most user friendly way with dates is to use a free text field and
let the user choose their format.
