Most databases store dates as the number of days (or seconds) since some
particular epoch, so the data entry format is irrelevant.  (SQL Server,
does allow flexible entry of dates in the human interface, although it
is not as flexible as some other software in that respect.)

A sensible database design will also use UTC, rather than wall clock
time, to define the dates.  It is actually the existence of multiple
time zones throughout the world that is the real problem for World Wide
Web date entry, unless dealing with dates of birth, which are 
conventionally given in wall clock time at the place of birth.
