Yes. I made an accessible Image replacement technique, which  
unfortunately contains some semantic chaff. However it works and it, or  
something based on it is the only way to make accessible image  
replacement with CSS2. This is due to the fact that all image  
replacement currently uses background: for including the images. I have  
explored the possibility of removing some of the <span> tags from the  
markup using before: and after: but concluded that since IE doesn't  
support and Opera, Mozilla, and Safari badly support them it is not  
workable at the moment. However I would love someone to use them to  
find something which would work in the future.

This works on the idea of having a container element which has two  
spans in it, one for the text and an empty one for the image. Within  
the container these are then overlayed the image over the text. The  
container can be put anywhere happily with the image replacement still  
working. In this example a <h1> is used but a <span> could be used  
equally well.

<html>
<head>

<style>
#logoimage {
  /* Must use position to cause the overlap */
          position: absolute;
background: url('helloworld.gif') top left no-repeat;
height: 31px;
width: 214px;
padding: 0;
margin: 0;
z-index: 1;
}

#logo {
/* Must use position to cause the overlap */
          position: absolute;
overflow: auto;
height: 31px;
width: 214px;
padding: 0;
margin: 0;
z-index: -1;
}

#logocontainer {
         /* Must have same height and width as the replacement image */
         height: 31px;
         width: 214px;
}

</style>

</head>

<body>
<br />
<br />
<h1 id="logocontainer"><a href="#" id="logo">Hello World!</a><span  
id="logoimage"></span></h1>

</body>

</html>

The image used in this code example is available at  
<http://www.netalleynetworks.com/Members/tcroucher/accessibility/ 
helloworld.gif>

There is a "test" page for this at  
<http://www.netalleynetworks.com/Members/tcroucher/accessibility/nnir>  
mostly because I haven't had the time to write it up properly.


I hope this is a decent solution that people are happy with.
