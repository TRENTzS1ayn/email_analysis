Yes, I did say that I would *only* use 8601 in such a (human-targetted, as 
opposed to human-readable but machine-targetted) context if I was forced to use 
a short form, and I didn't have reliable locale data on the user.

How can you say it's unintuitive. Arguably it's more intuitive to dd-mm-yyyy, 
since yyyy-mm-dd works the same way as decimal numbers (bigger denominations to 
the left).

The Japanese find it perfectly intuitive because they were used to yyyy/mm/dd 
for Gregorian dates and they've now largely adopted 8601 for day-to-day use. 

The Americans even find mm/dd/yyyy intuitive!
