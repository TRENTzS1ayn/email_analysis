Yes, I mustn't have been making myself clear when I said that you should use 
the full month name if you can.
It's only when a client is stupid enough to insist on a short date (for reasons 
I never understand but figure must have something to do with the physical size 
on the screen) but not so stupid as to insist on having a date like 03/04/1984 
that I'd use 8601 in a human-targetted context.

Despite knowing a few Europeans who use 8601 in real life (mostly people like 
myself who got used to it from particular contexts) I'll agree with that. The 
problem is though that the formats 03/04/1984, 04/03/1984, 03-04-1984 and 04-03-
1984 simply don't work unless:

a. You have good locale information about the user (language isn't enough for 
anything better than a good guess).
b. The user knows you have good locale information about them, and hence that 
you chose the format they'd use, rather than your own preference.
