Here is an easy to understand reason for designs that use short dates that has nothing to do 
with the intellect level of the client - data base limitations.  Many sites use data base driven 
content.  I believe achieving a and b below is impossible on the world wide web.  Clearly 
stating the date format used on a site [or page of a site] and consistently following that format 
should minimize date confusion for ALL users.  This applies to both rendered dates as well as 
input formats on forms.

Yes, I mustn't have been making myself clear when I said that you should use
the full month name if you can.
It's only when a client is stupid enough to insist on a short date (for reasons
I never understand but figure must have something to do with the physical size
on the screen) but not so stupid as to insist on having a date like 03/04/1984
that I'd use 8601 in a human-targetted context.

Despite knowing a few Europeans who use 8601 in real life (mostly people like
myself who got used to it from particular contexts) I'll agree with that. The
problem is though that the formats 03/04/1984, 04/03/1984, 03-04-1984 and 04-03-
1984 simply don't work unless:

a. You have good locale information about the user (language isn't enough for
anything better than a good guess).
b. The user knows you have good locale information about them, and hence that
you chose the format they'd use, rather than your own preference.
