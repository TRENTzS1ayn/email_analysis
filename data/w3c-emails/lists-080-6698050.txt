  That, I would hope, is when you point out to said client that the
  system isn't going to be very userfriendly, that the size of the
  screen is an unknown factor, and that accessibility actually matters.

  After all, a demand for frames would not mean you used that without
  pointing out the accessibility implications ?

  Not, but the format

    "xx monthname year-with-four-digits"

  work in all contexts; written - of course - fully and in the same
  natural language as the document itself.

  If you then want to use the ISO format internally, fine. However, if
  you MUST use an abbreviated, locale-dependent, format towards the end
  user, then I still suggest dd-mm-yyyy - and, of course, always include
  that, as the OP had done.

    <label for="date">Date (in dd-mm-yyyy format)</label>
    <input type="text"
            name="date"
             id="date"
              size="16">

  would be my suggestion.
