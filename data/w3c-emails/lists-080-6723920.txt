Sometimes with success, sometimes without.

Yes, that's why that was the suggestion I made to begin with, although I 
wouldn't scream at the thought of month dd yyyy.

And of course the only time HTML uses dates internally they must be in ISO 
format. If designing a human-readable but machine targetted system I'd strongly 
recommend ISO, but that's even more off-topic than we already are.

 However, if

If I MUST use and abbreviated locale-dependent format, I'll use which locale I 
MUST use.
If I MUST use an abbreviated format I'd use the only locale-independent format 
that's available.

Funnily I've been asked by Irish clients (dd/mm/yyyy is the convention here) to 
use mm/dd/yyyy. They'd rather think mm/dd/yyyy will bring in more dollars than 
dd/mm/yyyy will euros and pounds.
