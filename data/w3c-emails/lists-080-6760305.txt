and even though I am in the USA I work internationally and long ago
adopted the DD-MM-YYYY format but it confused so many people I almost
universally now DD-MMM-YYYY spelling out the abreviation of the month.
ie  5 Dec 2003  or 05-Dec-2003

which is why I preefer to put in the DD-MM-YYYY which replaces as the date
is typed in.

and in some areas of the USA we now have to dial all 10 numbers even for a
local call.  so rather than using (***) ***-****  tele numbers are being
written 123-456-7890

yes if I even suspect I will get someone from someplace else I put an
extra address line in and require a country to be entered

ie:
name
address1
address2
city
state/province/ken
postal code
country
