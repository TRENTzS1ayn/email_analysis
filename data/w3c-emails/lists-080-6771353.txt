Many of the Web applications that we build are conversions of
Client/Server apps to Web apps. The biggest issue that we have to deal
with lies in people not understanding that you cannot do client-side
processing on the Web.

However, it is possible to do it when Remote Scripting is used. But
Remote Scripting relies on Javascript. In my mind, this violates 508,
Guideline L and WCAG 6.3.

But what if the client said it was OK, and required all users to keep
Javascript turned on? Keep in mind that all users of the application are
employees of the State, Bureau, etc.

Would it be possible to use Remote Scripting and still retain
compliance? Can assistive technologies handle it?
