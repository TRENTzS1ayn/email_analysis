Guideline L is, "(l) When pages utilize scripting languages to display
content, or to create interface elements, the information provided by
the script shall be identified with functional text that can be read by
assistive technology."

In my mind, there is no way to identify the new information with
functional text.

This may not hold true in all instances, but in our case, most of the
things we would be doing is populating drop-down lists, based on a
user-selected parameter or redisplaying data in a table. In some cases,
we have had clients request that checking a checkbox or radio button
automatically commit data, rather than clicking a button and submitting
data.
