I agree. I see it as more of an access issue, rather than a disability
issue.

Makes sense to me.

Right. I wish the guidelines dealt with scripting in a more real-world
manner. Namely, a lot more people allow Javascript than don't. It should
be simple enough just to say that if you use JS, make sure the same
functionality can be performed if JS is turned off. I know it does say
that, in a roundabout way, in WCAG, but it does get contradictory.

Thanks for the extra links. I have all of those bookmarked, but it
remined me that I have them and need to revisit them.
