in which case, you may want to create an alternative form which is spread
over multiple pages, to ensure that even users w/out client-side scripting
can use it (i'm thinking WCAG, not 508 here)

and again, you may want a fall-back that if scripting is disabled, the form has
a proper submit button (via <noscript> perhaps ?)
