Unfortunately, although ITU advises giving two numbers, the within country
code, including the actual trunk access code, and the international format
with "+" replacing the international access code, and GSM phones accept
the latter format directly, most business people in the UK insist on writing
numbers as +44(0)nng..., where 0 is the trunk access code within the
UK and must never be dialled in incoming international calls  (nng is
national number group code, e.g. 20 for London).

Consequently, if you accept typical UK phone numbers, you will get
a bogus zero in the number.
