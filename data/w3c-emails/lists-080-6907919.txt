Being in conformance does not necessarily mean that you are in fact 
more accessible.
In law it would be hard to imagine but not unlikely that conformance 
had a higher authority :-(

It is realistic to imagine situations where certain user groups can be 
defined, who need scripting.
and in this case it is realistic to determine that there may not 
currently be an accessible alternative.

A rather fundamental example is drop down lists, there is still no 
generally agreed example that has been standardised as accessible.
In fact it is possible that able sighted users with touchscreens, may 
require a significantly different navigational structure to others.
One example we have pursued is here: 
http://www.peepo.co.uk/links/index2.svg  <Title> is used with 
scripting, so that touchscreen users have access to links that mouse 
and screen reader users would hear or read as descriptions of links.

This considerably reduces the mean number of tabs or mouse movements 
required per link desired.
Gosh can I define that as a measure or 'peepo', or did someone else?

another example would be most online games necessitate the use of more 
interactivity than vanilla html provides.
To insist that a no-script version of such a page, makes the page 
conform may be true, but has little value.
what one wants are games that are accessible, which is very different.

In truth it has to be said that much scripting is redundant, and in 
many cases it is realistic, easy and good practice to provide no-script 
default values.

The updating of the current rather old de-facto authority on accessible 
scripting is long overdue:
http://www.learningdifficulty.org/develop/script-techs.html
and merely quoting the current WCAG guideline does this a gross 
disservice.

thanks
