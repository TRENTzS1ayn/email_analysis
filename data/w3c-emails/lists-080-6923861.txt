This really should be the job of the user agent, at least in the long
term.  The user agent is in the best position to know the platform and
user's capabilities.  (There may be issues with the world moving to .NET
rather than XFORMS.)

Online games don't necessarily have any information content that needs to
be provided by alternative means (to the extent that they have a message,
many computer games have a rather dubious message about the benefits
of violence).  Legislating for game designers to act as educators to a
wider audience would be rather more radical than requiring information
providers to provide accessible web sites.  If animation is the essence
of the game, I don't see why there should be any objection to scripting,
on the other hand, the original Adventure was text entry, so there is
no fundamental need for a graphics interface to that game.

(Even non-computer games raise accessibility issues because they
are generally based on trying to improve physical or mental skills,
but no-one says that people with no literacy skills should be able to
compete on level terms in Scrabble, or that someone in a wheel chair
should be able to play for a premier division football team.)
