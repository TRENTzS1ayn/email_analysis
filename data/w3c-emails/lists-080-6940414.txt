Hi everyone,

I am new to the list serve so I'm sorry if this question has already
been asked.  I have a data table with 7 columns and 4 rows.  We are
using scope to make the table accessible.  Using JAWS, all of the data
cells are read correctly except for the first left cell in each row. 
When I do ctrl + alt + NumPad 5 the column header is not read.  Are
these the expected results or should the first data cell be assocaited
to the column header.

Thanks in advance for your help,

Kim
