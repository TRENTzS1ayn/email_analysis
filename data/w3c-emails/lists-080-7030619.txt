I suppose most are aware of the Section 508 standards for accessible
Electronic Information and Technology in the U.S., but I came across an
accessibility checker, "STEP508" at the GSA website:

http://www.section508.gov/index.cfm?fuseaction=content&id=155

The program is described as:

   "STEP508 is an excellent tool to assist in the repair of Web sites with
   large numbers of pages (sites with legacy content, sites with many
   authors/owners who may not be familiar with accessibility issues)

   STEP508 is not designed for new projects. Instead, Web developers should
   be trained well in accessibility practices, accessible coding, and
   testing/validating the site for accessibility."

I downloaded the file and will install it; yet, I am wondering if others
will, as well, and have some opinions to share about the program. Do we
really need another checker? Is this any better, or worse, than others?
