STEP508 is not "another checker" - it's a tool for prioritizing the errors
that other checkers tell you about.

It was clearly explained on the web site:
                                                                            
 What specifically does STEP508 do?                                         
                                                                            
                                                                            
       STEP508 uses the output of accessibility evaluation tools (such as   
       Bobby, LIFT, etc.) and                                               
             Compares the results of these evaluations (how your site       
             performed on Bobby vs. LIFT, etc.)                             
             Prioritizes the errors/accessibility problems that were        
             identified (identifies the errors that are most critical to    
             fix to make your site accessible)                              
             Tracks the progress of your accessibility repair efforts over  
             time (gives you a baseline "score" and provides metrics to     
             quantitatively monitor/report your improvements)               
                                                                            


It was built by WGBH/NCAM and others
