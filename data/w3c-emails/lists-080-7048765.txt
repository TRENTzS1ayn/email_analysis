Hello All,

I just downloaded, installed and ran "Step"... Does anyone know anything
more about it on the list? I looked in the help and there was no location to
contact the developers.

I just downloaded 0.0.14 and had a few questions in case anyone knows the
product:

1. On Several Occasions I get an error: Not Implemented Yet 
So I assume there is a newer version (Does anyone know the Link?)

2. It appears to have been developed to work with XML, does anyone know if
it will be supporting W3C EARL ( http://www.w3.org/2001/03/earl/ ) so that
it won't be vendor specific. And will support all QA Systems

3. And Perhaps a more important question. When Looking at Section 508, is
there a less important Accessibility Failure. I notice they have an option
to treat all checkpoints equally which seems most logical, so if this is the
case and without a business related process how can one perform Error
Prioritization? 

**** And Most Important: In the help it says:
Severity: How seriously does the error impede the accessibility of
information? While all errors will degrade the accessibility of a web site,
some will have a more severe impact on the web site visitor than others.
STEP allows for all errors to be considered equally or for the built-in
severity index to be applied to errors. 
Repairability: How much time does it take to fix the error? Can the error be
fixed by an automated tool, or will it require a manual (human) fix? 
Location: How "easy" is it to get to the error? 
Importance: Some pages (index pages, gateway pages, high-traffic pages) are
more important than others, and consequently the errors on those pages are
more important to fix. STEP automatically detects index pages, but STEP
users can input to the tool which pages on their site they consider to be
most important.

Since the Government was involved in development (Listed as a co developer)
of this GSA Specifically, if someone from there or maybe from the Access
Board can Chime in on what error is more or less important in the eyes of
the access board or the fed it would be great! 

Being a tool developed by the US Federal Government I am curious as to what
of the 508 Standard is more or less important.

Best Regards,
