Not according to the HTML specification, which provides an algorithm 
for dealing with this case "when there are no scope attributes" 
(although the algorithm, somewhat confusingly, includes the case where 
there are scope attributes).

see http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/tables.html#h-11.4.3 in 
particular. Although it says user agents may implement the algorithm, I 
believe that it is actually reasonably well implemented (as far as 
anything is for tables). For example the tablin proxy that transforms 
tables in various ways to make them easier to use with a screen reader 
understands the algorithm...

cheers
