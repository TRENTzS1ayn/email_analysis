No, because WWW is not a word, as it is not pronounceable in English.

As you may be gathering, there are variations across Europe in the
way these terms are defined and also, in England, the general public and
popular press tend to treat acronym and abbreviation as interchangeable,
in the same way as they treat virus and bacteria as interchangeable.

This is a fairly common repeat topic on these lists.
