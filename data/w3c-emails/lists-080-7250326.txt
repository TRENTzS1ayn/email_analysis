There was a great deal of debate on this topic when ACRONYM and ABBR
where developed.

These terms have differeing meanings in different countries (including
US and UK; in addition I understand there are some other differences in
, for example, the Dutch language).

Also whether the terms themselves are spoken as words or the individual
letters are spoken varies not only across different countires, but also
within countries e.g. FAQ (fack or EFF-AY-QUEUE), VRML (vermel or
VEE-R-EM-EL), URL is sometimes pronounced as earl (although this usage
may have died out), etc.

I seems to be that it is difficult for author to marup this up correctly
as the usage will be dependent on the user's cultural environment (in a
more difficult way than, say, US versus UK diffre4ences in spelling,
which is consistent).
