Despite all the semantics it really does make a difference to this
argument that IE does not recognise and treat correctly <abbr> but does
recognise and treat correctly <acronym>. The mouseover will display a
tooltip. It also makes a difference that <acronym> has been dropped from
the proposals for XHTML 2.0. Other browsers treat each correctly.

So the pragmatic approach would be to use <acronym> for both acronyms
and abbreviations for all documents, although it is not semantically
correct, and then when it is practicable to change the !DOCTYPE
declaration for XHTML 2.0 do a global search and replace for <acronym>
to <abbr>.
