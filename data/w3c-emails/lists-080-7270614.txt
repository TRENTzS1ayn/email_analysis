It doesn't really make a difference. IE is barely capable of treating 
XHTML 1 properly - you need to do all sorts of nasty compatibility 
stuff (it's legal XML but it isn't particularly nice) to get around its 
non-standard ways of handling Web content. XHTML 2 is not 
backwards-compatible with old browsers anyway, so IE will presumably 
treat it as it does "real" XML (i.e. non-HTML), in which case there is 
no particular value in the parts of the HTML spec that they did 
implement.
