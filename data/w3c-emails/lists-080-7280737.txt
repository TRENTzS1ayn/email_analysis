Hi all

I hope this doesn't spark many comments like the Ryan Air message some time
ago, but apparently, E-Training in Australia is said to undergo many changes
as shown by

http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/12/08/1070732143470.html

I love this quote from the above URL:

"A lot of e-learning includes audio, but often people don't provide a
transcript or captions."

More than just an accessibility issue, it also makes good sense to provide
transcripts/captions as I don't know how people can locate audio/visual
content via Google (or any other search engine) without a text version that
can easily be indexed.
