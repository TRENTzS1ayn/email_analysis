One thing I can think of is having an (X)HTML page with photos as
mailto: links. That's OK for sending but for receiving if you could
involve a server with some sort of scripting? Maybe if the sender
included a photograph as part of the signature then this may be able to
be extracted? Or a database of photographs?

Hi all

In Mencap we have been discussing how sending emails could be easy and
accessible to people with disabilities.
The idea is instead of having a traditional email address there is a
photo of the person you need to email and when you click on that the
email address is embedded so it opens up as a traditional email ready to
write and send. It would be be reciprocal so that it also shows the
senders photo when received.

Does anyone know if this is possible, or if this software already
exists?

thanks

Caroline
