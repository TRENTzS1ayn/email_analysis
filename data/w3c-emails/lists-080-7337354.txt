Its certainly possible and there were some Open Source
email systems around that did this a few years ago - they even
presented your inbox as a series of picture-icons.
Can't rememember the name of any.

For many systems internal to an organisation where
pictures of people are available it would be easy to do
- perhaps there are some you can do like that with
configuration.

Its an interesting question what they might do with
the kind of spam emails that are around these days :)).
