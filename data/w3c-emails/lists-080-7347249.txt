This really depends on the capabilities of the user agent (Web browser) and 
whether it is suitably linked to a mail programme.  Assuming that you are in a 
controlled environment (classroom, or whatever), where you are running linked 
mail and browsing software, something simple like this would work:

<a href='mailto:caroline.lambie@mencap.org.uk' title='Send mail to Caroline'
 ><img src='/path-to-image/caroline.jpg' alt='photo of Caroline'><br />
caroline.lambie@mencap.org.uk</a>

This provides an image with the address written under it, for those that it 
would benefit.  If your audience is ONLY <abbr title='people with learning 
disabilities'>PWLD</abbr>, you could leave out the text, as this could be confusing.

If, what you are asking, is regarding some form of address book based on 
pictures, just set up a Web page using code as above.  This could be on the 
Internet, an intranet or even just a file on a local computer.  The Internet 
solution would, of course, be the most flexible.

Hope this helps.

Cheers
