Yes

No. 
But, on the WAI IG web page there is a list of how to act on the list. 
One of the points asks new members to check the mail archives http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/
to see whether a topic has been discussed before.
I think you'll find that just about everyone who posts to this list is more than willing to help out where possible 
but when topics are raised again and again because people don't search the archives it can get a bit tiring to keep 
repeating (and reading) the same thing. We've all been new to web accessibility at some point but you'll find you get
a better response from the more experienced people if you abide by the rules of the mailing list 
(and that holds true for all public lists, not just this one).
