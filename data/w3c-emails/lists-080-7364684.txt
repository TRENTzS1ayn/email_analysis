Unfortunately you are likely to run into problems.

Firstly, you cannot rely on people's systems being configured correctly so 
that clicking a mailto: link automatically launches their email software - 
I am continually surprised at how many systems cannot do this.

Also, using mailto: links also opens you up to problems with Spammers 
harvesting the email addresses.

The safest alternative is to use a contact form that uses scripting on the 
server to send out the emails - the form could be launched from a person's 
picture acting as a link to the form.

I think it is possible to get email software to display photos of 
recipients, however they will have to have a copy of the photo on their 
system already.

An alternative is to send the photo to the user either as a straight 
attachment or to send the email as a html formatted email either with the 
photo embedded in it or with a link to the photo, however with the 
security being tightened up with most email programs many of them will not 
automatically display the photos, displaying placeholders instead.

I hope that helps.
