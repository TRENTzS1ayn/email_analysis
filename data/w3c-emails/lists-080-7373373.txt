I have certainly seen this demonstrated - I believe that 
inclusion-Europe (where mencap is involved) had at least one member in 
Belgium working on this kind of software for a European project in 2001.

I have efffectively the same thing on my telephone (it sends phone 
calls instead of email, but I can configure it for email as well).

As others have pointed out, the underlying technology is trivially 
simple, and you can make a simple web-based system to do this, although 
you would want to be clear about what software people use it with.

Cheers
