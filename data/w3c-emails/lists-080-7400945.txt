any thing is possible and in certain situations, this might be appropriate
but how am I supposed to recognize a photo of someone I have never seen?

Hi all

In Mencap we have been discussing how sending emails could be easy and
accessible to people with disabilities.
The idea is instead of having a traditional email address there is a
photo of the person you need to email and when you click on that the
email address is embedded so it opens up as a traditional email ready to
write and send. It would be be reciprocal so that it also shows the
senders photo when received.

Does anyone know if this is possible, or if this software already
exists?

thanks

Caroline
