Hi,

Sidar's WCAG2-espa group has discussed this a bit, and the emerging 
consensus basically agrees with what Christian says below (which saves 
me a lot of typing ;-).

The point about expanding all instances, not just the first, is 
important to work with current technology - a paper presented by Sofia 
Celic looked into this. It's the kind of thing tools should do anyway - 
it's a pretty simple search/replace type script.

cheers

Chaals
