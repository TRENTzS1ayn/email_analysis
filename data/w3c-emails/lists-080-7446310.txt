David,

I'm not sure what kit you are using, but for instance:
http://www.kevlindev.com/tutorials/basics/events/mouse/js_dom/index.htm
ie5.2 on mac with ASV3.0 build76 and javascript disabled
event handling continues, no dialogue or security alert is raised.

can you define more specifically the process you've witnessed?

thanks
