Yes, I'd buy that. I'd also accept the possibility of the inverse case, where 
many of the different (whether subtly or strikingly so) definitions, nuances, 
etymological references and so on could be identified (say for an in-depth 
analysis of a poem or another piece of literature).

I'd see both of these as being specialist applications though, providing the 
framework (perhaps through RDF or similar) may be a suitable task for an 
application not tasked with providing for that specific speciality, but 
providing the full capability in a language like HTML seems a bit much.
