That's a perfectly reasonable suggestion.

I guess the options are:

Abbreviations (and maybe alt tags for images) are metadata.  There will
be added layers of complexity from what appears on the surface.
Therefore a simple document markup language should leave such issues to
a richer and more appropriate language, such as RDF  (and to take on
board Ernest Cline's message sent a few second's ago, if abbreviations
aren't regarded as metadata they can be regarded as presentational and
should therefore not be including in XHTML 2.0 - but for a different
reason).

Abbreviations (and certainly alt tags for images) may be metadata but
they are also capable of being easily understood and deployed.  It would
be desirable to include a lightweight way of provides support for such
features in a new document markup language, as has been done with HTML.
