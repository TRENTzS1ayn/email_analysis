The fact that an all-encomassing global solution is not
feasible does not imply that there aren't very useful contexts
where a solution *is* possible.  It might be interesting to look at the
history of the solutions that did adopt this approach a few
years ago and see how many people took them up, in
what contexts, why they failed etc. (except I can't remember
what they were called).

Maybe one could do something with one of the many standards
there are for personal information attached to emails.
