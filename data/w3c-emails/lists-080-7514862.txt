Interesting thread all... We've been wondering about a few things, and one
of them is trying to enhance and further extend the use of the <link>
element by changing it... One of the ways we thought it might be useful was
in preparing inline glossary functionality. This thread has me thinking that
we could combine it with some other format as Brian suggested, but then be
able to pull that functionality into HTML via the <link> element...

I've posted a (mostly theoretical) article about this type of functionality
at: http://www.wats.ca/articles/extendinglinkrelationships/53

I'm curious to know what others think of that type of functionality...

Cheers,
Derek.
