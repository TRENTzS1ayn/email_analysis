Hi Derek
   Funnily enough, I was thinking the same thing.
   It's not a great leap to go from <abbr> contains metadata (and we
need to be able to make use of richer structures for the metadata) to
say that rather than embedding the metadata we should be able to link to
it ... And link to it in various richer ways.  So let's farm it out to
the XLink group!
   It did occur to me that rather than the author having to embed the
definitions, it would be nice to have them supplied, possibly by an
abbreviation bureau service (along the lines of PICS bureau services).

   I guess my suggestion is along the lines of your suggestion for:

<link rel="glossary" for="wai" href="/glossary.php?wai" />

but allowing an additional level of redirection.

Anyway, thanks for the posting - but it's now time to go home.
