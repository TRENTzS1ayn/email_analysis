Dear WAI Interest Group Participants:

Registration is now open for the W3C WAI Web Accessibility Best
Practices Exchange Training on 9-10 February 2004 in Madrid, Spain. The
training is hosted by Fundosa Teleservicios, and precedes the Mundo
Internet 2004 conference.

The two-day training covers:
* An introduction to Web accessibility and evaluating accessibility,
including demonstrations and case study examples
* An overview of resources that are available to help managers,
developers, policy makers, and others working on Web accessibility
* Panels and multimedia presentations covering Web accessibility issues,
including legal and policy issues
* Detailed directions on developing accessible tables, on-line forms,
images, applications, scripts
* A showcase of accessible Web pages and a discussion of using style
sheets (CSS) to create accessible, visually-appealing Web Sites

There is no registration fee for the training; however, pre-registration
is required. There are a limited number of spaces, which are available
on a first-come, first- served basis. Registration will close when
spaces are filled.

Detailed information and required pre-registration is available from: 
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/2004/02/exchange.html

This message may be circulated to other lists; however, please avoid
cross-postings as possible.

Regards,

~ Shawn Henry
