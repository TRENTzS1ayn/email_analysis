As I understand the recent posts:

(1)  <abbr> and <acronym> are currently misused, and cannot fully meet the
WAI requirements on their own.

(2)  Ruby can already do this in a technically correct way (or does it
violate one of the Ruby assumptions?)

(3)  Any three-part distinction (perhaps using Ruby, perhaps using read or
class attributes) would be closer, but probably won't be used in practice.
It would take too much space for hand-coders and too much thought for tools.

(4)  If this is more than presentational, then there may be more than three
possibilities -- perhaps we really need leave a link option.

Suggestion:  

We already have a glossary link type.

Use <term>word</term> to indicate that more information is available in that
glossary.  

Would it also be reasonable to define a glossary module?  (Which might
overlap with definition lists...)

<entry read="init">Term
<def1 class=?>asflkj</def1>
<def2 class=?>asdlkj</def2>
</entry>
