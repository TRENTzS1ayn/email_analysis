Hello,

I am doing a white paper on the application Citrix and its web accessibility
and 508 compliance.  Does anyone have any information regarding the extent
of Citrix's web interface and its compliance to 508 (sites that discuss this
in detail?  I went to there web-site but found nothing really insightful.
Any information would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.

Regards,

Mike
