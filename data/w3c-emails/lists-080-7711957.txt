 I think 25 words (~180 characters) on a braille display is a bit too much
for a link or an image.

The rule of thumb I heard years ago was no more than 25 words.

That why i think 60 is the MAX, if the image is a link (link as to be short
... ;o)
For us, a short link is max 80 characters. We try to put numbers of this
kind of recommendations.

This is indeed an interesting question.  I am inclined to say that it is too
long.  60 characters is a lot to listen to under some circumstances but i
can see where it might be necessary none the less.  If I take alt as
replacement and not description, I can usually shorten it.  If it is
standing in for a link, it might need to be 60 characters, but then, that is
what link text is for.

... but what means short ?
We think short means 60 caracters.
Do you think it's OK ?
Does WAI made clearly a recommendation about that ?

Thanks for your help.
