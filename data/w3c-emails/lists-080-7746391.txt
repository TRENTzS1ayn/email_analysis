Michael,

please copy me, and possibly the list in on any findings.

I've had 2 years experience of using citrix with people with a learning 
disability.
I have to say almost nothing is favourable. Some issues may be 
particular to this set up...
The rather minimal configuration for individuals would appear to be a 
significant limitation.

thanks
