I'd suggest a median of 12, and 90 percentile at 25.  This excludes those
with zero length alt text - most images on commercial pages should be 
zero length, because it would often be legally unsafe, or against advertising
codes of practice, to make the intended message of the imaage explicit.

If you are regularly reaching 60 characters, on a typical web page, you
are probably trying to use alt as a description, rather than a replacement.
