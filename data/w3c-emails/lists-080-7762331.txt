You might want to ask on a french-language list :-) I am pretty sure 
that only a small minority of people here are sufficiently expert in 
french to answer the question for that language. On the other hand 
there is a principle that doesn't depend on language - should there be 
a limit?

Actually, I think that more than a few words is one reason to check the 
text, but I don't think there is a strict rule. In some cases a picture 
really does convey a thousand words, or at least 40 - 50, and a long 
alt text will make sense. I know that old versions of Amaya had a bug 
that limited alt attributes to about 32 characters, but I think it is 
the only browser that had that problem, and there is no limitation 
according to any specification I know of.

So I don't think it makes sense to suggest that any alt text fails 
because it is more than some arbitrary length. But it is a useful hint 
that maybe the text isn't conveying the right information.
