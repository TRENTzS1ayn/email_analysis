Is anyone else concerned by the blatant promotion of Google on the W3C 
homepage?
please note in the past there was merely a text label rather than a 
multi-coloured graphic.

if the graphic is part of the 'google package' then the WAI homepage 
alternative should actively be promoted to the w3 webmaster.
Google should also be informed, difficult for W3 as they actively 
promote text in graphics :-(

It seems appalling to me that W3C is promoting what is in effect a 
fairly poor service, and an effective monopoly at that.
It is not simple to find switch accessible sites for instance.

Google offer a 'pay' service that avoids the need to provide a Google 
logo or link.

thanks
