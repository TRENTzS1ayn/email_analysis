Jonathan,

Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that there are weekdays 
and weekends? Most sites have a weekly period because there is a weekly 
period that most of us adhere to.

Apple and Sony don't show the trend so strongly, probably because they 
are more consumer focussed. Dell, HP and IBM sell to the corporate 
market too, and they're only around for five days per week.

That's just my opinion though.
