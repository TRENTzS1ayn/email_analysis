Indeed, but that would imply a shorter, sharper dip for the weekend
and a broader (5-day) peak.

My thought is that it could be an artifact of cacheing strategies
and expiry times amongst large providers (AOL alone should have an
appreciable effect if there's a periodicity to their cacheing.
That would also explain Apple _not_ showing periodicity, if their
use of Akamai is masking it.

Of course this is pure pint-in-a-pub speculation (though - coincidentally
- I am qualified to call myself a statistician:-)
