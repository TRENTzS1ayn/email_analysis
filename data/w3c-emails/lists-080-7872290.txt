It's fairly standard practice at this point to include the small google 
graphic on any site that uses a google driven search.  It lets you know at 
a glance which search engine you are dealing with.  When used consistently 
across many sites, that adds to the usability of searching.

My personal site has a google search with a google logo for exactly that 
reason.
