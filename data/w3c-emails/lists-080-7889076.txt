Hello all, 


As we become more aware of importance of web accessibilty, we also
realize that people with disabilities have also found some solutions to
improve their web surfing experience by using special I/O devises and by
other means. In other words, while we struggle to make web sites more
accessible from developers point of view, those with disablities are
also struggling from users viewpoints. 

Are the developers and the disabled users going to meet somewhere
reaching a confortable level, where both parties will be satisfied and
happy? What will be "enough" in terms of web accessibility? Could we
ever say, "enough is enough"? Enough for who? The users, right? But we
know we cannnot make everyone happy. We must compromize somewhere. But
where should we draw the line? 

I also would like to note that the visually and hearing impared are not
only those  who will benefit from accessible web sites. There are also
people with slow internet conenctions, physical disabilities, learning
disablities, and so on. So whom are we referring to when we say
"Disabled"? Accessible web sites do improve everyone's (including those
who are not disabled) web surfing experience in some degree. But again,
we cannot make everyone happy. 


Kind regards,
Keiko
