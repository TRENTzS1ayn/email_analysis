Actually, there is no real two sides of this fence but a continuum along
which we all travel toward everyone being served.  While devices are
becoming more sofisticated, there are many who do not posess them nor the
means to obtain them and even the higher end devices benefit from greater
efforts toward accessibility/useability.  AS you rightly point out, a
positive side to growing accessibility/useability is the fact that the
benefits extend to other realms.
