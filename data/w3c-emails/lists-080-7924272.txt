How do you feel about using grey text for copy?  I love grey for its neutral
presence and ability to downplay something and give a clear and crisp look
to the overall design of a site but at the same time, it's hard to read or
take notice of.  One to some words seem to be OK but blocks of grey text
seem to be difficult to read and I have 20/20 eyesight.

I have seen a few upscale home designer sites using this technique.  i.e.
martha stewart or the pottery barn.

Cheers,
