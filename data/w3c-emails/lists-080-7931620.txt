Personally, as someone with substantially less than 20/20 eyesight, grey
text has always been a problem, and worse still i have never been able to
understand some peoples use of black text on a grey background or worse grey
on a lighter grey, it is just not readable, at least to people like myself.
I know a light grey background is often used to reduce the glare given by a
white background, but there are better colour combinations than black on
grey.
