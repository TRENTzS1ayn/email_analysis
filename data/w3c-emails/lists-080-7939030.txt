Hello, Isabelle, 

I assume you are talking about grey text in white background. I
personally never appreciate grey text, making me wonder who designed the
site. If it is hard to read the text for someone with 20/20 eyesight,
like yourself, can you imagine what it is like for those who have lower
vision or color blind to read? In my opinion, there is no one single web
site that exists only for those who designed the site, unless it is
created only for personal pleasure. In other words, no web sites should
be created from the designers perspectives only. If you wish people to
visit the site you designed and make good use of it, you want to make
sure that the visitors are happy. But if you dare to ask your visitors
to squint their eyes to read grey text, it will be thoughtful to provide
alternative options with better readability. 

Also, I'm afraid "upscale home designer sites" are not necessarily
always the best sites you can learn from. 


Kind regards,
Keiko
