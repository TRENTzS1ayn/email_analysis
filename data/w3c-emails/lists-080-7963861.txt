The lack of understanding of this medium is not the only factor, or an
excuse. I agree with you that we don't have enough skilled designers,
developers, and engineers in this needed field. But they can get help
from outside if they really are in need. Sadly though, there are still
so many people who do not take this issue seriously. It is too sad to
know that it is often the budget and dicision makers attitude that are
making it so difficult to say yes to the question. First we need to
understand the needs, then the skills (or skilled people). 

Kind regards,
Keiko
