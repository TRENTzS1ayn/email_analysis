Grey text is a signal component of the International Compliant Style, and
can be attributed to differences in LCD vs. CRT rendering of very
contrasty text in designers' studios. These are visually-attuned people
who are not necessarily hostile to accessibility in the slightest.

To provide real accommodation for the full range of low-vision people in
these and similar cases, stylesheet-switchers and user stylesheets are
required. WCAG WG would love to ban anything that looks nice, like
grey-on-white text, but that isn't the correct solution.
