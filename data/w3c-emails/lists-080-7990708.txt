I feel this is the type of path to follow and promote... using 
stylesheet-switchers and user stylesheets, although I'd like someone to 
show me where user stylesheets are very successful globally.  I wish it 
was a better option, but rather than render a user oriented design, I 
feel it just tends to make a real mess between what the users wants and 
want the designer intended (even good design).

As a web developer one needs to be able to accommodate the design 
appropriate for a client, whilst addressing accessibility.  This is not 
difficult if stylesheet-switchers are used.  The amount of time it takes 
to make, say, another two sets of CSSs from a completed design is very 
small given the overall time for design phase.  This allows real 
flexibility of design and user interface.  But the stylesheet switcher 
needs to be somewhat obvious, because on some sites you have no idea it 
is there, how it is represented does not hint at what it is or its function.

I feel this is one of the best ways to promote innovative design 
accommodation accessibility.

One thing we have to try and destroy is this myth that making a text 
only page addresses the accessibility concern.  That just shows the 
level of ignorance, that when you take markup our of a document, it 
renders it even more meaningless and inaccessible.  It's really dumbing 
things down.  Whereas, well marked up documents, with intelligent style 
are what needs to be encouraged.

In my own involvement with WAI/WCAG/WCAG-GL I have never felt this is 
the spirit or attitude of the people, guidelines or group.  I have 
always felt that the people involved are not trying to be exclusive, but 
rather the whole approach is focused on trying to be inclusive.  That to 
me is what underlines this whole accessibility movement; it aims more 
than anything to be inclusive.
