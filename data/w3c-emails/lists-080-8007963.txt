Hi Joe,

Great suggestion.

I'm currently reading the great book you authored: Building Accessible
Websites!  Great to see you are from T.O., like myself.  As soon as I saw
your reply, I knew I had to get back to reading your book - I had not
reached the *extra* good parts yet (although the whole book was chockfull of
delicious info)!  I'm also enjoying some new information and I'm currently
having a brain orgasm, which is much better than having a brain fart! *grin*
Hopefully I will implement the knowledge acquired (from this book, others
and my own professional development over the past year), into my own web
site, within the month. *busy busy*

...et al,

Thanks for the feedback - problem has been solved!

Cheers,

Isabelle
