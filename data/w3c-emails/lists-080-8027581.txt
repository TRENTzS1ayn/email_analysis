Hi everyone,

I am new to the list serve so I'm sorry if this question has already
been asked.  I have a textarea that the user can fill in.  As they add
characters to the textarea, the number of characters the user can add is
counted down in another textbox.  The form looks like below:

Number of Characters Left: <input type="textbox">   Question: <textarea>

My first question is does the textbox that counts down "number of
characters left" need to have a label associated with it since the text
cannot be modified by the user?  My second question is how do I make
this compliant?  I understand that when a blind person enters text in
the textarea they will not know that the textbox is changing.  Any
feedback is greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance for your help,

Kim
