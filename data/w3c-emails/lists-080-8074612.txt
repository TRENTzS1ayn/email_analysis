Dave/Kim,
  Screen readers have a function called screen echo.  Users can set this
function to speak all newly written text to the screen, so as the user
types they could hear that number decreasing.  They might hear other data
such as the clock changing or the letters that they type but they will be
able to hear the numbers decrement.  This does not appear to be a section
508 issue.  However, as Don mentioned you do need to label that form
field.
