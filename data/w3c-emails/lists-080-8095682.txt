At least, the one that predates screader, speakup, yasr, gnopernicus, 
and blindux, some other open source screen readers... Or fonix 
speakthis. or OutSpoken. Or HAL.

For that matter, does anyone know what proportion of people with 
disabilities use a screenreader? my wild guess always comes in at 
single figure percentage - i.e. less than 10% - but that's in part 
because so few dyslexic people get offerend one.
