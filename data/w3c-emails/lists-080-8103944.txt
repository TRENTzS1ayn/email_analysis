  Alternatively, it could be pointed out that the knowledge itself (ie.
  how many people use X for Y) has no real value in terms of
  accessibility.

  Unless, of course, one want to write an accessible version of the
  website for Jaws, one less accessible for Netscape, one worse than
  that for Lynx, and finally one pretty one for IE - which, of course,
  Jaws typically run on top of ...

  No, save for the value of the knowledge itself, it doesn't really
  matter in terms of accessibility. Think "graceful transformation" and
  relay this to the client - IMHO.
