Excuse me for making comment.

Being only an IT & T person.

The challenge is to make as many information services, software
applications and hardware platforms available to as many people as
possible, regardless of the level of skill and\or programming code used.

Although standard operating environments (SOE) are common place, there are
and always will be exceptions to the rules.  The access rights for an
individual person\staff member extend beyond the standard workplace.  Each
service deliverer is charged with the responsibility to provide access
public and private IT networks.

The challenge is to expand the knowledge of how to use the IT & T options
available to suit an individual.   This may mean people who have never been
exposed to ie technology, accessibility, managers, IT deliverers, IT
programmers and also those that steer the IT standards, need to be lateral
in the way they discuss and deliver IT.

Access to information in any form (particularly paper based text
information) has become multi layered.   Voice, data, audio, multimedia,
digital, voice activated, etc, etc.  There is no single method of delivery
to an individual or entity.

The development of IT delivery has expanded beyond the world of green
screens and text readers in a DOS environment.   w3c also needs to take a
step beyond the standards and grow to access information with the needs of
an individual and provide multiple optiions, in multiple languages and
across multiple platforms.

It also needs to highlight the requirement for substantial IT and
communications infrastructure to deliver and manage  the information in
multiple formats.

  Alternatively, it could be pointed out that the knowledge itself (ie.
  how many people use X for Y) has no real value in terms of
  accessibility.

  Unless, of course, one want to write an accessible version of the
  website for Jaws, one less accessible for Netscape, one worse than
  that for Lynx, and finally one pretty one for IE - which, of course,
  Jaws typically run on top of ...

  No, save for the value of the knowledge itself, it doesn't really
  matter in terms of accessibility. Think "graceful transformation" and
  relay this to the client - IMHO.
