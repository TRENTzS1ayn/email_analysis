I have more or less given up trying, everytime I think I have a number I
can prove myself wrong in a few minutes....not worth the effort, but I
suspect (with no evidence) that the total is quite low, but what
percentage of visually impaired, dyslexic etc is hard to say,

> because so few dyslexic people get offerend one.

and I have been suggesting and folks have been trying with mixed result
folks with ADHD.....

the key is to make the software useable and not to worry about how many
are using it,  I know some folks who would love to use it but don't for
other reasons.   cost, lack of computer skills, etc

good luck
