It is the experts who have learned to use a good deal of the at so they 
produce the guidelines or at least have a good deal of imput into them.  My 
statement about it being necessary to learn the at and not just use it and 
that most people cannot nor should they learn to and use it all because it 
has to be learned and used in ways that most likely cannot be done by 
someone who doesn't need it.

I have made my point on this elsewhere.

Probably,  and I believe text size is just a drop in a bucket for low
vision.  You have to consider tracking and line spacing, contrast of
colors, "whitespace" and breaking up long paragraghs etc.

My point is I was told Skip links were NOT the way to go by one list
member,  so I asked how do you get around using a switch,  and was told by
another that you should use Heading navigation upon which I asked where do
I get Heading navigation to work on eak IE.  This prompted yet another
message from another user to USE SKIP LINKS..... HMMMMMMM
My point is that neither are bad, dont poo poo one particular way because
a brand new UA has header navigation.

Who can you be an expert if you havent learned how to use the device that
you are supposedly an expert on.  Are you just an overpaid jack of all
trades master of none?  How is your client satisfaction record?  I mean
the clients who USE your solution, not the company who you helped with the
website.  [forced disclaimer based on hurt feelings of others on here] You
meaning the general AT Accessibility expert and noone in particular.
