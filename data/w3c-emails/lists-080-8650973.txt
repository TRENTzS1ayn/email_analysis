What on earth does that mean?

By 'it' and 'at,' are you sometimes meaning Assistive Technology (AT) 
and Information Technology (IT)? It really /looks/ like you mean the 
pronoun (it) and the preposition (at). I'm sure it /sounds/ that way to 
screen readers, too. This may be the least accessible message posted to 
the WAI-IG list. (wink)

It (your use of the words) is especially confusing because you are using 
both meanings several times back and forth throughout the paragraph. Can 
you rephrase your email and send it again?
