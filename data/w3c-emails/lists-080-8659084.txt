The word it means at in this case.  I'm using it in the sense that it is 
warm.

What on earth does that mean?

By 'it' and 'at,' are you sometimes meaning Assistive Technology (AT)
and Information Technology (IT)? It really /looks/ like you mean the
pronoun (it) and the preposition (at). I'm sure it /sounds/ that way to
screen readers, too. This may be the least accessible message posted to
the WAI-IG list. (wink)

It (your use of the words) is especially confusing because you are using
both meanings several times back and forth throughout the paragraph. Can
you rephrase your email and send it again?
