Please stop this thread now, or get it much closer to the topic of Web 
accessibility. I point everyone to the list rules:

http://www.w3.org/WAI/IG/Overview.html#Uselist

First on that list: "Treat other list members with respect." That means 
everybody.

Personal attacks are not allowable by anyone, on anyone, at any time, 
ever. They are certainly not appreciated by other members of the list. 
If you feel you absolutely must go after someone, give the other list 
members the courtesy of doing it offline.

This is a list for discussion of Web accessibility issues. It is not 
for meta-discussion, such as complaints about posting style, or 
critiques of a given user's level of expertise in accessibility. None 
of us needs to be told what to think of any specific list member. We 
can do that thinking on our own.

Thanks,
m
