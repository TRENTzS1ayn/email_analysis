I don't understand why they would want client side scripting, unless
it is to do pop-up and pop-under, which are discredited in the main 
stream.  Any client side scripting, especially associated with third
party content, is increasingly being rejected by the more sophisticated
users.

Depends on whether or not the user is looking at the pages for the adverts;
more likely it simply represents a failure of the advertiser to reach a
potential part of their market.  Many people are paying for anti-popup
tools anyway.

Do it the way that Google does, and only accept text adverts!
