    When you search for the advertising services, include the 
    phrase "web services." There may be some that offer a 
    server-side alternative.
    
    You could also try Google Adsense. <https://www.google.com/adsense/>

I've tried it. You judge whether its accessible.

Includes the google adverts.

I'm unsure. Its javascript. I haven't adorned it with anything.
I'm (almost) sure that google would take reasonable advice, just so long
as we don't ask Joe to phrase it? They seem more than willing to listen.
