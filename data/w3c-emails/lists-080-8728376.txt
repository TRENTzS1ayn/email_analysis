Perhaps the site author was listening?
http://www.pilot-link.org/ is now a usable site for me font-size wise!

Fyi, this is the first time a comment from me has been
taken up, I'm feeling quite good about that :-)

http://www.expansys.com/ is probably a harder case!

Thanks for all the comments peeps. Should I post the collated list,
just for the archive?
