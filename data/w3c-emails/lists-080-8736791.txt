Hi Folks,

I am pleased to pre-announce Hera, Sidar's web-based evaluation tool. I 
am pre-announcing it because we think that you can use it, but it is  a 
beta and we know there are some things we haven't done yet. Try it at 
http://www.sidar.org/hera/

Among them is translating the entire documentation. It was written in 
Spanish (naturally enough) and although the basic procedure stuff is 
translated the very detailed help stuff isn't yet. There are also some 
pieces missing. But comments on these are welcome either in english to 
the WAI ERT list w3c-wai-er-ig@w3.org which is probably more 
appropriate or here (which I watch). Comments in spanish are welcomed 
by Sidar's G1 group (tools).

Hera is mostly based on CSS style sheets that allow the user to 
identify various aspects of a page - a little like the Wave, but more 
step by step. For that reason it requires a good implementation of CSS 
to function properly. It is designed to work with Opera, but most of 
the important features work with Safari or Mozilla (we are working on a 
testing tool that will allow us to record which features exactly work 
where).

It generates reports either as HTML or as EARL - W3C's RDF language for 
recording test results, using the latest working draft. It  is 
available in both english and spanish, and is content-negotiated so you 
should get whichever version your browser asks for by preference (if 
neither, the default is spanish).

enjoy...

Chaals
