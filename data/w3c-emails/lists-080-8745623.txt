Hello everybody,

please refer to the address http://www.sidar.org/hera/index.php.es for full
information about Hera, because the http://www.sidar.org/hera/ does not work
at the moment.

Hi Folks,

I am pleased to pre-announce Hera, Sidar's web-based evaluation tool. I
am pre-announcing it because we think that you can use it, but it is  a
beta and we know there are some things we haven't done yet. Try it at
http://www.sidar.org/hera/

Among them is translating the entire documentation. It was written in
Spanish (naturally enough) and although the basic procedure stuff is
translated the very detailed help stuff isn't yet. There are also some
pieces missing. But comments on these are welcome either in english to
the WAI ERT list w3c-wai-er-ig@w3.org which is probably more
appropriate or here (which I watch). Comments in spanish are welcomed
by Sidar's G1 group (tools).

Hera is mostly based on CSS style sheets that allow the user to
identify various aspects of a page - a little like the Wave, but more
step by step. For that reason it requires a good implementation of CSS
to function properly. It is designed to work with Opera, but most of
the important features work with Safari or Mozilla (we are working on a
testing tool that will allow us to record which features exactly work
where).

It generates reports either as HTML or as EARL - W3C's RDF language for
recording test results, using the latest working draft. It  is
available in both english and spanish, and is content-negotiated so you
should get whichever version your browser asks for by preference (if
neither, the default is spanish).

enjoy...

Chaals
