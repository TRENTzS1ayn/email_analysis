Thanks,

I am afraid my programmatic knowledge does not spread that far.
If anyone with the know how was willing to code it - I am sure we would all
be grateful.

The reasoning behind my question is that in some colleges User Style Sheets
are used to help students with disabilities render the web in a friendlier
way. However, the main issue they have, is the pain and time that having to
go through the menu to Toggle the function On/Off is.

I think you'd have to write a Browser Helper Object. There was someone on
this
list that had Browser Helper Object with quite an extensive collection of
accessibility features, maybe this is in theirs, or is something they might
like to add.
