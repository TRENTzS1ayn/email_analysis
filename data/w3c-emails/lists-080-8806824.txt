I quote

"I am NOT saying IE for Windows = WEB"

Ok, so I will then.

It is a fact according to site stats that I look at that 97% of browsers
that visit sites I monitor are I.E. in various stages of evolution. (sic.
congrats to Microsoft)

It is also a fact that people hate to change the Mutt they are used to
playing with, be it pedigree or mongrel. Learning how to use new software is
low on the general public's priority list. Truth is it is not on their
priority list at all, which brings us back to user's responsibilities in an
earlier thread.
