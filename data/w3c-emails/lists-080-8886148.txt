eClasses.org, International Webmasters Association/HTML Writers Guild,
and Idyll Mountain Internet announce two online courses in Web
accessibility beginning the week of April 26, 2004.

D201: Accessible Web Design is the introductory class, designed to give
an overview of Web accessibility, an introduction to the W3C's Web
accessibility guidelines and the Section 508 requirements, and
insight into access by users with disabilities.  Basic familiarity
with HTML is required; knowledge of accessible Web design is not.  This
course runs for 7 weeks and has an enrollment fee of $180, $80 for
IWA/HWG members.

D202: Web Accessibility Techniques is an intermediate class for Web
developers who know the concepts behind accessible Web design.  In this
hands-on workshop-style class, students will work through problem
exercises covering the full range of accessibility techniques, from
alt text on images to SMIL for multimedia.  Students should know HTML,
and CSS is helpful, as well as accessibility knowledge equivalent to
D201.  The course is 6 weeks, and the cost is $220, or $120 for IWA/HWG
members.

Please note:  Joining IWA/HWG costs $49 a year and will save you $100
if you take one course, or $200 if you take both -- a $151 savings.
You save even more if you take more courses, such as the CSS class.

Both D201 and D202 will be repeated later in the year, so please choose
the course which fits your skill level and experience best.  We do not
recommend taking both courses at the same time!

Your instructor for both courses is Kynn Bartlett, Web developer and
author.  Kynn has been involved with the W3C's Web Accessibility
Initiative since 1998, served as president of the HTML Writers Guild
(now IWA/HWG) for many years, and has authored and contributed to
several books on Web design.
