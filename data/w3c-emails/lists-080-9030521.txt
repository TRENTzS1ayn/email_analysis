Hi Paul,

OK, I'm not at my best first thing in the morning <g>, but in whose interest is it 
to point out the inaccuracies?

I think it is more confusing for Judy to contradict the findings.  I think that 
she would be better off congratulating the DRC on the study and raising awareness 
and then point out where people can go to find out more about the WAI.

I think yes.  From what I understand of it, the report is intended to highlight 
the lack of awareness and to promote awareness.  To a certain degree the details 
are irrelevant at that level.

I suppose it comes down to who received Judy's release.  If it was just targeted 
at people who are already aware of the various issues and might have noticed the 
inaccuracies of the report, then fine.  However if it was targeted at the national 
press, who aren't really interested in the details, just the story, it does come 
over as being negative at detracts from the report.
