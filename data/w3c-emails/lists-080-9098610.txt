I understand your arguments, but in the context of the report, the 
chairman of the Disability Rights Commission was making the point that 
you cannot just run your site through Bobby and assume that if it 
passes all the tests it is Accessible.

Bobby, and other testing tools cannot test every aspect of a site to 
ensure that it conforms to the guidelines so some human testing is 
required and it is best to use people with disabilities because they 
are better equipped to do the testing.

OK, with your average test group you will never be able to test for 
every user scenario, but you will be able to do a far better job than 
just relying on the automated testing tools.
