It is unsupported by data to state that "the WAI guidelines" don't address 
those problems. It is entirely accurate to state that the Web Content 
Accessibility Guidelines, the *only* "WAI guidelines" considered by the 
DRC, do not address them.

The DRC did not claim to evaluate anything other than WCAG.
