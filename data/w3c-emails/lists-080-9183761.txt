Is this not a failure of EO WG?

The response from Judy was a defensive one.  Maybe if EO WG had written
the response, and in a way that would be a bit more educational of the
WAI's complete set of reccomendations, it would be seen as less of a
political nature and more of a clarification of WAI's work on
accessibility.
