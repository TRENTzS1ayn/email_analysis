Tagged PDF files are hard to edit with accessibility in mind and I would
suggest further research into using Tagged PDF as it stands right now.

I think there needs to be some type of survey on ALL types of assistive
technology being used, and how the AT is being used, for web access.  This
should be a good indication of what WCAG 2.0 needs to focus on.  And
making the survey results public would go far in promoting the
accessibility issue in the public eye.
