and one area that I keep harping on and is so often overlooked because the
people are not very vocal, THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES, these folks are barely
accessing the web, example, the Main independent living center in
Nicaragua is accessing the web via a dial up modem at 2400baud on an
AppleII computer.  this is the prime access point for disabled folks in an
entire country.  the WWW MUST be able to be accessed in a very basic way
by these folks, one form of disabled access is $$$$ the vast majority of
people with disabilities live in poverty and cannot afford the latest and
greatest.   bandwidth is a real factor in many people with disabilities
access to the internet.... there needs to always be a basic form of
access.  if you are paying 5cents a minute to access the web a site is
useless if it takes two hours to load.....

PINE and/or LYNX are the durable, robust and common e-mail and web
browsers in the third world.......
