    I don't disagree with your assertion, Charles, but I am 
    interested in how you measure "good" and "right" if the end 
    user experience as reported by selected testers is not the 
    yardstick.
    
    How do you define "good" as you have used the word here?

I'd question the use of 'selected' wrt testers.
In todays climate its possible to have one blind person 
on a decision making body overrule the survey results from 100 blind users.

We all have bias. Expert or end user? I guess it comes down
to personal preferences.
