Matthew Smith replies:
No personal experience here but my initial thoughts would be to use command-line
tools that can interact with a screenreader and/or other assitive technologies.

I would suggest that you investigate EMACS because I know that there are tools
for both XML and accessibility - including a built-in screenreader (EMACSpeak)
of which I have heard good reports.

The Emacs Wiki is at <http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki>

Cheers
