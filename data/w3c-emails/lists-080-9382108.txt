Jesper,

Thanks for that summary. To the point, I think.

Personally, I do not see how WAI can be expected to take on IA (or usability
in general) as part of its remit: it is a huge subject with its own
specialisms and as you say, often ignored in the crassest way by vast
numbers of sites (as are many other aspects of usability). 

And bad IA is bad for everyone, not just those targeted by WAI. I consider
myself a savvy user with only minimal barriers to using the web (poor sight
and slight arthritis in the hands), but I often fail to find what I need
because the IA of a site is crap. (This week, I have resorted to phoning for
info twice for that very reason.)

I am glad the DRC is trying to raise awareness, but some aspects of this
report do not reflect the best way to approach it.
