Why not? With CSS and XSL it is possible to write different display
versions of the same content and have the client or server (if appropriate
info on the device is available) choose which display format is best for
viewing.  This is nothing new, it has been used quite a bit lately for
printer versions of pages and for filtering content into additional
smaller pages for limited displays on wireless devices.

I think debating, which screen reader to support or which browser is best
or even how to write one page which is presentable in all browsers, is an
argument that does not serve a constructive direction.  I believe we need
to work more on separating content and presentation in the area of
accessibility and embrace the CSS and XSL technologies.  For what happens
when the next device comes to market?  Simple a new CSS stylesheet for
that device.
