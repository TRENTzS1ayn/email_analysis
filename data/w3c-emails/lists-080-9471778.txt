how do you handle screen readers such as EMACSpeak...???   or those that
just read the plain text from the screen (many older systems) these
require that the output be ONLY plain text.

yes you are talking of excluding anyone not using the two expensive,
propietary screen readers that are most marketed

> 2. whatever you do in these cases, someone will lose out a little

but should some lose all????

try using what I'm using at the moment, I'm running Red Hat Linux 9, with
Minicom connection to the internet and using PINE as my e-mail reader.
  how about visting your sites using LYNX...which is my most common access

for what it's worth I have broken the M$ habit and have been windoze free
for almost 5 years in EVERY way....and don't plan on changing just to use
the accessibility features that some are trying to force on us.

and believe me I am far far from unique.
