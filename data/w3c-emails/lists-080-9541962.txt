One reasonable way to estimate this (US figures only; sorry) would be to use
the market share for Unix/Linux *on the desktop* (no fair counting servers!;
this article http://www.infoworld.com/article/03/10/22/HNlinuxdesktop_1.html
says 1%) and apply that to the number of screen reader users (NCHS 50K in
1994, revised by me to 150K).  By this rough estimate, there are about 1500
Emacspeak users in the US. 

BTW, is there an emacspeak listserv?  Is it international?
