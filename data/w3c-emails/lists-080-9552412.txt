Sorry if this sounds abrupt, but what on earth are you talking about?
Web pages are HTML. I am talking about HTML. These ATs take HTML and
produce output - what is the problem you are identifying? Unless you
are claiming there are cases of ATs that require plain text in order
to function; in that case the web is broken to them.

I must be misunderstanding you rather severely, because I don't see
the relevance of what you have said here to the discussion.


> but should some lose all????

See above. Who loses all? it's just HTML fer crying out loud. These
obscure ATs will deal with it in their own way. I can't know all the
behaviours; all I can do is code to standards, test in the most common
configurations, and hope the other cases can handle standard stuff. I
am not going to tweak for obscure cases; and other people seem to be
saying not to tweak for anything.

I test in Lynx too. The sites work well. What is your point?

I don't give a monkey what you use. It's the web. Use what you want. I
build sites with HTML and any device can access them to the best of
its ability.

Did we slip in to some Zen koan mode here? Shall I spout random nouns
at you in an effort to spontaneously induce enlightenment? But
seriously, what has CSS got to do with issues arising from standard
HTML structure. e.g. text inside link or outside link tag?

Try again - you're obviously excited about something but I am not
getting your point.
