I agree completely. I look to WCAG for that solid ground. My own
experience helps me to apply it, and testing helps to validate common
use cases.

True. I think the UK AT market is different from the US one in many
ways.

I try to do both. I can't test in everything, there isn't time. Coding
to valid HTML, and following WCAG should give a good chance for every
AT out there. If it doesn't, then there is arguably something wrong
with the AT, not my site.

My central dilemmas are about conflicts in the quality of user
experience that arise from testing even in a few cases. You can
imagine the geometric multiplication of conflicts that would arise in
testing twenty ATs.

I do not believe in lowest common denominator as a design principle. I
believe in graceful degradation, and in following generic design
principles to ensure access for all.

There's a sliding scale of user experience, though, and this is where
the optimisation comes in. The contentious issue seems to be who to
optimise for and why.
