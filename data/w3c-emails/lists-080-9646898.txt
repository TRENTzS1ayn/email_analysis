I get the feeling you are not a web designer with a lot of experience of how things were in the mid 90's. What you are suggesting is a move towards balkanised sites, code forking and multiple site versions for specific use cases, the way it was in 1998. This is not what WCAG was about, and it is entirely contrary to the last five years development in web design, as we have slowly, torturously moved the entire industry towards accepting and using web standards.

Why? So we can build one page.

The above statement is certainly what we should work for today:

Forget about designing for more than one screen reader
Forget about designing for even one screen reader
Forget about designing for a text browser
Forget about designing for any particular browser

We design for web standards, we try to be as Best Practice as possible, and we make some compromises to get Internet Explorer on board because it is the browser most people use. No browser sniffing, no CSS hacks but one page for all is the direction the industry is moving and how things should be.
