No, I am sorry I havent had the pleasure designing websites in the mid
90s, I was too busy working on the wireless network software and standards
for 2.5g and 3g networks that are being used present day.  If you are
attempting to put me in the class of hackers who have no clue about good
coding practices, you are sadly mistaken.

Where exactly did I say that?  I did however say something to the effect
of different rendering of sites for specific use cases.

Web standards??  Standards???  or Guidelines???  Standards are enforcable
and the W3C is not able to enforce their work which makes them guidelines.
However, I digress. Please keep your above statement in mind when reading
the rest of this reply.

I believe the CSS WG, the XML WG, the Device Independent WG, the WS WG all
might be interested in hearing that they are bucking the trend of a single
site for every use case.  I guess in the interest of WAI, we should
declare these WGs as something of the mid 90s and put them to pasture.  Oh
wait, what is this WG I see here in WAI?  Could it be PFWG?  Hmmm who are
they?

Why not? Did you research this out or just give it a "techie" label and
dismiss it?

Ummm, the web was a techie gimmick in 1990.  Anyone remember Gopher?

Now you finally said something I can agree with.
