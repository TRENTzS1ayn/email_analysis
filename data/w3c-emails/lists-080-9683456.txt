Most web pages are not HTML.  Most are not even syntactically HTML
and the vast majority of business run sites are not semantically HTML.
"Screen Reader" A-T's job is to make not-really-HTML sites almost as
accessible audibly as they are visually, even though they are only
designed to produce the intended visual result.

It can also make real HTML much easier to use, but that is not 
a priority given there is so little real HTML out there.
