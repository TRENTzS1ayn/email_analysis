The web centers on one thing: standalone resources with unique URIs.
That URI may point to an XML content management system, or one
document. It doesn't matter. The industry, and WCAG,  is centered on
the assumption that at the point of delivery, the *typical* case is
that you are serving a single HTML document as the primary content
element. I think most people are aware that other cases exist, but to
relate all these other activities automatically to versioning is
illogical. Versioning may have its place (may, I say...) in a certain
few niche applications, but so what? Pointing out a cow with three
legs does not refute the essential truth of the assertion "cows have
four legs".

You're going to have to take my word for it.

Yes. What's your point?
