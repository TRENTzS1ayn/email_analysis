You mean URL,  URI is the actual document ID, URL points to the document.

And how this document is rendered should have no impact on the content
that this document is carrying.  The rendering could be changed at the
server in the case of XML publishing systems, or on the client with CSS
and even XSL with javascript onload, or both.  What I am getting at is the
seperation of content and how it is displayed (rendered)

I take your word for the whining about inadquacies of the CSS and XML
about as much as you say you did research.  Now, given concrete problems,
maybe someone can help.  Whining about the technology in general will get
no help.

My point is technology advances from an idea, to a gimmick, to a standard
accepted use.
