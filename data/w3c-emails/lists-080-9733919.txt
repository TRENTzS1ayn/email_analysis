I agree with your observation further down on this post. And that is why I
said the quote.  Please dont take it out of context.  It referred to the
response I got about surveys.  Which by the way I have yet to see from WAI
in the new millenium dealing with accessibility issues.  Further, any such
survey that doesnt show how great WAI is gets trashed.  Now how can that
possibly be working torwards accessibility?  I strongly feel that the WAI
has lost site (pun intended) of it's intended clients, those who are
having trouble accessing TODAYS websites.  There is more self promoting on
here and competition then cooperation into finding solutions that work in
ALL cases, not just the squeaky wheel.  It is ashame that WAI is so
political.

Now, if anyone is "insulted" by my direct and to the point emails, I am
sorry.  But I, putting on the white hat right now, am fighting for those
who cant access this list for any number of reasons of accessiblity.  And
am tired of seeing, in such a short amount of time, blatant disregard for
the folks we are supposed to be fighting for.  Bring your 2X4, I will have
an army of people with disabilities backing me up.
