I suspect there is more to it than that. Of course if you asked him you 
might find out <wink>

I have to admit that I'm starting to find this list a bit tiresome now. 
When I was learning accessibility (of course, I still am, before anyone 
pipes up) this list was ideal for asking people who knew stuff. By and 
large I always got a really helpful and polite response (usually more 
than one) Now I find that increasingly it's become quite stressful 
opening my inbox. I'm mindful that occasionally there are still decent 
discussions and some very knowledgable people on this list so I'm not 
going to unsubscribe like Jonathan but hell, it ain't fun anymore...

J.
