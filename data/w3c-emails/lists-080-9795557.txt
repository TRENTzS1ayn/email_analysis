    > In what sense is SVG not text? Conversely, in what sense 
    is HTML/CSS
    
    SVG's origins are in graphics arts 
And in terms of viewing, it meets those needs well.



    The money associated with both of them is now more 
    associated with branding and advertising, which comes from 
    the graphic (and to some extent, musical) arts worlds,

And the effort seems to be following, even challenging, Flash
in terms of animation. The SVG mailing list I used to follow
made me realise that most SVG is script driven to obtain
either interactivity or animation, on top of SVG's animation.


    
    Whilst SVG does give special prominence to text, it doesn't 
    allow for structuring that text at any level beyond a 
    consecutive run of text,

Or specifically, tiny runs of text, since it has no word-wrap,
and just as with PCL and other page layout stuff, there is neither
structure nor sequence to its XML based format. This makes it extremely
hard to reliably abstract the text from the source document in a reasonable
sequence.

For a reader not admiring the beauty of the visuals, perhaps just wanting
to abstract the textual information, its of little utility. Its strength
lies
in the quality of the image when zoomed, making it good for a group of low
vision users. Unlike bitmapped images it doesn't lose quality when zoomed.
