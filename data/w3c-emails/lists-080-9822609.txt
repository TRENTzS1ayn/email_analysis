Should we actively promote the use of search engines like Google as local seach engine at any major website, if the pages are already indexed by Google?

Matthew Smith replies:

Whilst I think that Google has a great product, I do not think it in the best 
interests of accessibility, or indeed of a stable infrastructure, to standardise 
on a single, proprietary solution.

If Google should fail as a company (or start charging excessively for the Site 
Search service), if everyone were using it, the entire concept of Site Search 
would drop into a vacuum.

Were Google an Open Source project, with a distributed infrastructure (ie: not 
all owned by Google), I might feel otherwise.

Having said this, widespread use of the Google "look and feel" may be helpful by 
providing a consistent, familiar, interface IF Google has truly the paragon of 
accessible search interfaces.

Cheers
