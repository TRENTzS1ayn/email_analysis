Reuse is always good.  But, I dont think the actual search engine has any
bearing on accessibility.  For the same reason JSP or ASP wouldnt.  They
are back end server processes without user interaction other than through
HTTP requests.

You are confusing the interface with the search engine I believe.  If
Google's user interface is accessible, then maybe that should be a best
practice format for user interface design.  But the actual engine wouldnt
matter.

Now that lends to accessible interfaces <smile>
