I should add though, the search engine should be accessible to cognitive
disabilities.  The search words may not have to be spelled correctly to
generate some appropriate results.  For example, the spell checkers that
use phonetic spelling to suggest the correct spelling of a word is a
highly effective assistive technology for people with learning
disabilities.
