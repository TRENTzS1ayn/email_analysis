In theory it can do better, and when I've challenged the likely total
lack of sensible reading order in the past, the SVG lobby have pointed
to their accessibility paper.

However even PDF can also do a lot better than the typical PDF you see. 
Typical PDF has nearly every character individually placed and no 
space characters, but the design of PDF doesn't require that, it is
the PostScript print drivers and word processors that cause the problem.
It is actually an explicit design aim of PDF that it be possible
to extract the underlying plain text.

I'd question this, at least for large magnifications, as people with good
sight will be seeing pixellated image at their normal viewing scales.
Non-integer magnifications might be a problem.
