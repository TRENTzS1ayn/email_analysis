If Google's user interface is accessible, then maybe that should be a best practice format for user interface design.  But the actual engine wouldnt matter.

It is not an issue that Google is not 100 pct. accessible. Google is much more accessible than most of the millions different local search engines in use today, and the chances of Google becoming even more accessible is much higher than for millions of different local search engines becoming more accessible.

And it is still a strong argument to have just a few search engine interfaces, Google and a handful more, compared to a million different ones, especially when we are talking about accessibility.

For some types of websites a local search engine would do a better job than a general global search engine used locally but my few tests have shown that Google is often doing a better job both when it comes to usability/accessibility and when it comes to actually finding what is search for than the local search engines in use today. If the pages of the website is indexed by Google.

W3C's own website, www.w3c.org, is showing the way, a new trend is emerging?
