There is another point to consider here, one of choice and variety. If we
advocate the use of a single format provided by a single entity, there is a
danger of creating a monster with a controlling influence. A monopoly could
empower the provider to name their own price as it were and sponsored
results would become the only results on offer. Google powers many search
facilities as a back end provider anyway. Why provide more power to their
elbow?

Besides we have to think of all users and if everything looked the same we
are heading into a very grim borg like world of collective uniformity.

ugh....viva la difference!
