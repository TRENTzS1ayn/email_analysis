I agree. But that's not the only problem.
Google is one of the best search engines indeed, but there are webpages that
he cannot find.
Try to make a webpage just with text, no links. Or, don??t link any site to
that webpage.
Google never finds it, because it's based on ranking links philosophy. If
there's a link anywhere on the web pointing to the page, google finds it. If
not, he doesn??t.
What's my point? If you use ONLY google you'll miss a few percentage of
webpages in the results.
