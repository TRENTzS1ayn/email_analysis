  Now I'm atleast lost - how can the Postscript print driver be the
  cause of a problem like this ?

  There is nothing that says a PDF document ("tagged", I believe they
  call it) can't use non-absolutely positioned letters and then
  translate that to absolutely positioned letters in Postscript prior to
  printing.

  This is what happens to HTML with a printer stylesheet, after all
  (given that the printer handles Postscript).

  PDF have flaws, but a properly "marked up" PDF file isn't all that
  much different in principle than a properly marked up HTML document.
