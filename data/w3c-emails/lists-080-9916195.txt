Does anyone know why Bobby includes WCAG1 checkpoint 3.2 in user checks rather than in the automated tests? 
Also, why A-Prompt and CynthiaSays don't seem to pick up invalid mark-up? 

Surely validating mark-up is in the realm of automated tests. Is there a testing tool that has a validator built in?
