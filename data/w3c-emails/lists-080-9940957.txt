Hello - Bobby does not include validation simply because, while it is
automatable, it is complex to deal with the multiple versions of HTML,
character sets, HTML errors that might appear, etc. There are tools out
there, including the free HTML validator from the W3C, that do a better job
than we could do unless we put considerable effort and money into it. For
now we have felt it would be better to focus our development efforts on
other issues and encourage people to use other resources to complement the
Bobby evaluation. Integrated HTML validation is certainly something we would
like to do someday, and I am seeing a greater demand for that from our
accessibility customers, so we may decide to offer this in the future.
