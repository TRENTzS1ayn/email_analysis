the latter of course ;o)

My worry is that those developers (who should know better but apparently don't) that run Bobby to assess the accessibility of their developments are ignoring the user checks, one of which refers to the need to validate to a published formal grammar. To be fair, this isn't Bobby's fault, it's the developers, but it would help if all assessment tools contained a validation tool.

I also, wonder why the need for valid mark-up isn't a priority 1 checkpoint (but that feels like an old, old argument)
