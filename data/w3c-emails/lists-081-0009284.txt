This capability is intrinsic to any good web server; you should not
need explicit server side scripting.  Even IIS has language negotiation
support, although I don't know if it can be made to do a redirect.

The main disadvantages (assuming a client mediated redirect, so that
at least the bulk of the page is cachable) are:

- it is difficult to make an offline copy of a site;
- it is difficult to look at the text in a different language than 
  your own (and remember that many more browsers think that US English
  is the user's only language than there are users with that as their
  first language);
- a user bookmarking a page in preparation to link to it will end up with
  the language specific page, not the language negotiating version.

I'm not convinced that there is one perfect solution, and very few sites
language negotiate at all.
