Although it is worth noting that refusal to follow underlying UI behaviour
seems to be very much in demand amongst designers if you look at the way
that people object to browsers that only offer standard form controls or
standard scroll bars when they raise features requests on www-style, etc.
Whilst I think that not following OS UI conventions is a bad thing,
you can't just blame Mozilla.

One particular problem is that the user interface questions are more and
more seen as part of the branding of products and designers of browsers
and of web sites, don't want to re-inforce the Windows branding, but to
create their own, personal, branding.
