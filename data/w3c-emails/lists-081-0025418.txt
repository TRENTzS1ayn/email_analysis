Well, the W3C servers were moved over the weekend, so there were some 
interruptions to service. And I understand some people have found the 
meeting registration process complex. (But a lot of 
non-english-speaking spaniards managed it for the Madrid event, so it 
isn't impossible). I'm pretty sure there is a feedback address for the 
meeting registration system - and if you don't tell them what is 
difficult you can be almost certain it won't get fixed <grin/>.

With respect to the meeting itself Sidar believes that this notice is 
too late to be helpful - California isn't close to most of the US, and 
is a long way from most of the world. We understand that this group is 
not a formal working group, and that it should not therefore be so high 
on WAI priorities, but we feel that participation here is important to 
accessibility, and so the opportunity to plan for the occasional event 
is important to the people here. We hope that in future more timely 
notice (even if it has to warn that plans may change) will be provided, 
and that meetings will occur with a more even global distribution.

cheers

Chaals

Thank you to the folks who sent me the note about the meeting.

What I find interesting is others did not receive it either and I find 
it
quite difficult to register...

Odd.
