An URL to a web page should be a uniform resource locator serving the
same content to all people, what is served should not depend on the
browser or user agent people use.

It is bad practice to use the HTTP Accept-Language header as a code fork
for what an URL should mean.

The main disadvantages (assuming a client mediated redirect, so that at
least the bulk of the page is cachable) are:

- it is difficult to make an offline copy of a site;
- it is difficult to look at the text in a different language than 
  your own (and remember that many more browsers think that US English
  is the user's only language than there are users with that as their
  first language);
- a user bookmarking a page in preparation to link to it will end up
with
  the language specific page, not the language negotiating version.

I am not sure that language detection is a good thing. When I use an
English browser (I do) I want a French web site, a Russian website, etc.
to be in the original language when arriving. Then I can change language
if I need to. If I am in Spain and start looking at Danish web sites in
some local browser, I would hate if they were suddenly not in Danish.
