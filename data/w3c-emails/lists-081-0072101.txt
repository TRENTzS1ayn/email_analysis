Where is the accessibility community when it comes to RSS?
 
A RSS feed is 100% accessible viewed in the right viewer. Then at least we have an accessible interface for all people to the core value of many web sites. The documents served are the same, but at least we have a good beginning, or what?
 
Could RSS revolutionize accessibility?
