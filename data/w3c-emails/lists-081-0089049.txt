As you assuming a valid RSS feed?
Which is the 11 standards were you referring to?
How does RSS handle cognitive disabilities / handicaps?
What about RSS with content encoded XHTML (or HTML)? Is this just as 
accessible?
What about RSS that includes HTML that includes an image?

While the various RSS formats do provide standard means to identify 
different articles, I would not for a moment consider them 100% 
accessible.
