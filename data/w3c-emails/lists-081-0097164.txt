Well, the accessibility community has a number of people working on RDF 
in general. An RSS feed is also very limited in what kind of content it 
really handles - like HTML it doesn't address problems like how to deal 
with multimedia directly.

Thre is a very rough draft of RDF-based techniques for Accessibility at 
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/WD-WCAG20-RDF-TECHS/ - I am in the 
middle of checking through the schema and writing up comments. There is 
some work that Jonathan Chetwynd has begun at 
http://www.peepo.co.uk/rdf/-1/my2ndRDF.rdf that I haven't looked at 
yet.

There is a grab-bag of ideas that might be interesting at 
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/reports/w3c_note_sw_accessibility/ and 
there is a Dublin Core Accessibility special interest group looking at 
similar issues.

There is work in the IMS consortium on using RDF (their own work, plus 
the W3C specifications CC/PP and EARL) to support accessibility in 
Education.

And a whole lot more besides.

So I think that RDF in general can revolutionise accessibility (if the 
work is done right - there are still no magic work-free solutions, but 
there are lots of ways to reduce the workload), and RSS has a role to 
play in that...
