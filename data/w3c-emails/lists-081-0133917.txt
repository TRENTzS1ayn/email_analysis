What is served should depend on the user.

It is *extremely* good practice to use the HTTP Accept-Language header to choose
amongst different representations of the same resource identified by the URI.
The only times you shouldn't do this are:

1. You don't have a translation available (which unfortunately is most of the
time for most resources).

2. A user has explicitly picked a language (e.g. You might want the original enm
version of a piece by Chaucer rather an en translation, or you might want the
en version of a W3C document since it is the normative in the case of a
difference between it and a translation).

Of course it's important to set the Vary header as well.
