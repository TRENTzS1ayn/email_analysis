RSS is not made for "human consumption". It's what you make
of it that counts. You can transform it via XSLT or similar
into whatever format your user finds most appropriate...but 
then again, properly coded, semantic, structural XHTML can be 
manipulated in exactly the same way.

And yes, RSS - being purely text based (?) - does not cater
for cognitive disabilities, for instance...it's like the old
myth that "text only" versions of a site are all that's needed
to be perfectly accessible...

My 0.02 GBP anyway,
