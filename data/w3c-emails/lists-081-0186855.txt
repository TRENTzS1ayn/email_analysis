Very powerful post, Jesper.
I am not an accessibility professional-- just a person who been on this
list for nearly two years and has a great interest in these topics. I
have learned a lot, but I am often amazed at how much brainpower can be
so whiny and close-minded.
RSS, ATOM, and other emerging standards are changing things for the
better, right now-- get a mitt and get in the game.
