Yesterday at CSUN, Apple announced (where? in a meeting, a press 
release, a paper presentation?) the upcoming Spoken Interface for OS 
X:

<http://www.apple.com/accessibility/spokeninterface/>

This will in fact be the long-rumoured Apple screen reader *and 
more*, we are told.

Press coverage from yesterday:

Now, Apple is actively looking for beta-testers for this "technology 
preview." If you know someone who's blind or visually-impaired (or 
isn't) and is a Mac user (or isn't), pass the following URL along:

<http://www.apple.com/accessibility/spokeninterface/questionnaire.html>

If you fill out the questionnaire and answer yes to the last 
question, you may be considered for beta-testing.

I have friends at Apple, but beyond that I don't have any formal 
involvement with the project.
