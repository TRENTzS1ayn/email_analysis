Users would find no dialogue at all most accessible.  You need to ask
your lawyer, as such pages are based on a fiction that people actually
give informed consent.  In my view, anything short of asking a 
random selection of questions to examine them on the contents of
the agreement will not prove that they have read and agreed, but 
your lawyers will probably accept something less.

(For example, one Microsoft font is commonly reccommended for non-European
languages on any platform on which it will install, but if you actually
read the click through agreement, you would realised that it is restricted
to people with a licence for Microsoft Office or MS Publisher.)
