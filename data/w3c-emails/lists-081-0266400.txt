Jesper,

Who cares?
There is no anonymous factor on the internet anyway, your ISP knows exactly
who you are and where you go but who checks??!!

People have better things to do with time than playing the voyeur.

There is a danger of getting lost in the technicalities and forgetting the
original objective. Just how far does one go before the line is drawn?

The real challenge is to design a website for the quadriplegic who is also
deaf, blind and computer illiterate. This may not be a politically correct
statement but it does highlight the problem of how far do you go!!??!! so I
make no apologies for making it

There is a pain/gain factor in a trade off for accessibility. Well sometimes
anyway. Besides how many visually challenged Hebrew/Russian/French speakers
do you know? The odds are if they have that combination of languages they
may have a smattering of English as well.
