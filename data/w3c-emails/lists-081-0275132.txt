You have a point here, however it tells people little more than clicking on a
language choice link does and it tells people considerably less than they can
generally find elsewhere.

Besides this is a reason why you might not send language information and rely on
a servers fallback, not a reason why a server shouldn't respond to a request
that clearly states it prefers French with an English page with a "Version
Fran?ais" link - the web's equivalent to IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND ENGLISH I'LL
TRY SPEAKING LOUDER.
