The discussion was about the selection between versions of a site
available in multiple languages. While other issues are important, they
are best discussed separately as they do not (in my opinion) have any
special significance when looked at in this context.

Who was bemoaning? I was simply observing that the argument "But foo
doesn't do it that way" doesn't hold much water given the evidence that
foo is not an expert in the subject matter.

I could spend my life doing free accessibility analysis of websites and
still only cover a small proportion of the web, however you seem to have
missed my point entirely, which was that we shouldn't take our lead from
people less well versed in the technology then ourselves.
