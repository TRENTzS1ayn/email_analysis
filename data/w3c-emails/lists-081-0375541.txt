  That's interesting. I have set the Accept-Language to English, and I
  *always* without fail get google.se - without any link to select
  anything else.

  Google *is* a good example of a bad implementation, yes.

  The use of the Accept-Language header to choose the initial content
  tree as well as cross-tree links solves both this problem and the one
  shown so clearly by Google, as well as making it emminently clear to
  the user that there are multiple language.

  It even makes cookies unnecessary. This discussion has, however, made
  it quite clear to me that more information on this topic is sorely
  needed. Perhaps time for an article.

  Thankyou, Jesper.
