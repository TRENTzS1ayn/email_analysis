Why would you? The sites aren't claiming to set trends, it was Jesper
Tverskov in
<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/2004JanMar/0569.html>
who suggested we follow their lead.

While I suspect I could do it better, I don't currently have the
privilege(?) of working on a multilingual site (although it is possible
I will be in the not to distant future). 

I also see no point in repeating earlier discussion in the thread which
Mr. Tverskov was arguing against, as those points have already been made
and are available in the public archive of this mailing list.

So I don't use my expertise do I? That's a pretty big assumption. (Its a
wrong assumption BTW).
