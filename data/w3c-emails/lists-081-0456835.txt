  Perhaps this is a good time for us all to rethink our positions.

  Might it not be so that organisations - like the UN - who do not use
  language negotiation do so because they are clearly less knowledgeable
  than those who chose to spend their time following this list - and
  our esteemed colleague Kevin here illustrate that not even here
  everyone knows these techniques.

  What we need to do is what David and I do daily: teach. This is one
  case where "Those who can, teach; those who can't should listen"
  applies.

  There is a growing awareness of the fact that access to information is
  difficult - impossible even - to some groups among us. Let us try to
  teach people to use the technology we have today for the best result,
  instead of bickering over what might be.

  To quote mom: "Spit in one hand and wish in the other, and see where
  you get the most". "Dissing" the Accept-Language header and inventing
  a number of more or less esoteric methods to deal with the same
  problem is wishing, and not for anything nice.


  And to Kevin - bravo. It takes a strong man to admit to having learnt
  something.
