:)The assumption for everyone to know everything
intinctivley because it is assumed knowledge, is a
misgiving. For accessabilities sake us developers
should live by:

 "Never make assumtions, it makes and ASS out of yoU
and ME".

My girlfriend's mother was unaware of such an option
for language selection and it was not immediently
apparent so she never benefitted. This just adds
another view of the language barrier on the Web to the
discussion from someone who would never verture forth
to participate in such a conversation.
