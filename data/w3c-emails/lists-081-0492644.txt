Browsers do need to get better at presenting this choice to people, and better
at allowing people to create user stylesheets and a whole bunch of features
that are user-configurable.

I would imagine that she would use es-MX, es-*, nl and her daughter would use
nl, es-MX, es-*. Once this had been set up it should just be a matter of which
log-in the are using. It's setting it up in the first place that needs
improvement from the browser manufacturers.
