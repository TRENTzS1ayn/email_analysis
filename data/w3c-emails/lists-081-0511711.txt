People who know how to use *their* software may not be using *their* 
software but someone else's - and be polite enough to leave its settings 
alone. In fact, in some settings, configuration of the software may be 
impossible because it was set up that way precisely to *prevent* people 
changing the settings. Think of libraries, schools, Internet cafes.

I have already addressed that in the post you are replying to: many people 
do *not* get a sensible default.

Negative - but whether it is "slight" depends on the number of people involved.

Don't agree - your "almost certainly" assumes an amount of fluency in the 
default language that is very often not present.
Where I live, that is not a small minority.

Maybe where *you* live, but not where *I* live.

Sounds like a good idea - because that way at least people *will* find out 
(you did not address my question which you quoted: Just how do those people 
even find out there is such a thing as a language preference?).

I don't agree with your "great majority". A majority, true, but it may not 
be all that great.

See above - I don't agree with "small minority".

I'd also like to see how many people don't know about this setting. I'll 
make a prediction though: a very large majority.
