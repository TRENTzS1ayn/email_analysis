I have difficulty believing that there is a significant proportion of 
users working on computers where the system language is set to one they 
have significant difficulties understanding.

I'm open to being convinced otherwise, does anybody have any 
non-anecdotal evidence?

No it doesn't. It depends on how much difficulty they have in 
identifying the option to change language amongst the primary content 
of the page. I would hope that the specifics of this implementation 
would make it very slight indeed.

It is enough that they manage to use the system at all. If they can't 
understand the text, then I would expect them to work by recognizing 
icons which suggests that perhaps it might be worth developing a 
standardized icon to represent alternative language versions of a page.

Do you have any figures? Some discussion of the form the option to 
change language took in those cases which they failed to spot it would 
be useful.

Come to think of it, if there are so many people who failed to spot 
said option, why did you advocate that technique in the first piece of 
material I quoted in this email?

Perhaps, but then we get such cases as one of the sites which was 
mentioned earlier in the thread (which I don't have to hand right now), 
in which the list of languages required rather careful examination 
before I spotted the language that I wanted.

No, I was addressing the implication that we should ignore language 
preferences because the user probably doesn't know about them and might 
be using a system configured to work in a language they didn't 
understand.

However...

It has been rather a long time since I had the pleasure^Wtask of 
installing Windows, or of setting up an computer with an OEM copy of 
Windows installed - but I seem to recall being presented with a Wizard 
that, among other things, asked me about my language preferences.

Given that the default browser on Windows (the one with the big market 
share) uses the system language to get its accept-language header, 
doesn't this mean that the primary language preference is correctly set 
for the majority of users?

Does anybody have any reliable numbers for this?
