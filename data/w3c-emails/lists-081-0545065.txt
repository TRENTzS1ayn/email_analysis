There is a legacy problem.  I have run into sites that
assume "English" is there from the browser default, so
the presense of any other language (even not in the first
position) forces me into that language.  This might even
be a sensible guess, though it wasn't correct for me.

In a few cases, I even got 404s, because they didn't support 
"my" language yet, though they did support English.  

My solution was to remove the extra language from the Accept
header.

This might be because you're in the UK.  In the US, many
installs do not present this option.  It is fairly common
for pre-installed software to not even include the option
of switching, because the international version takes up
more disk space.
