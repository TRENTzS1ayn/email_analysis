That isn't a legacy problem; it was never correct behaviour.
That said, it is reasonable to return a language other than the first one listed
in some cases, if a user prefers English, but will also accept French
(Accept-Language: en, fr) and the server has a French original and an English
translation that the people behind the server don't think is a very good
translation, then it may be appropriate to serve the French version (the
quality numbers in the Accept-Language headers are intended to help with this,
unfortunately most browsers don't allow the user to get at them).
