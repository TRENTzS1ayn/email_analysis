I'd just like to add a final note before this discussion ends. I think 
what we have discussed is an issue of world wide accessibility that is 
reasonably poorly addressed. If  anyone is developing for Mozilla or 
otherwise developing browser software how about testing out a default 
language selection bar?

When a user first starts Windows XP there is a language selection bar 
integrated into the bottom of the screen in clear sight. This can be 
easily turned off when the user is aware of its presence and feels it is 
unwarranted. Maybe such an easily removable default option could be a 
feature in future User Agents?

Nice heated discussion guys, but we're starting to repeat ourself now.
