Matthew Smith replies:

I think that we may be drifting a little off-topic as regards Web Accessbility
but I think that this thread demonstrates that Web Accessibility has a major
dependency in the usability/accessibilty of the underlying operating system,
from which application language settings may be inherited.

Unfortunately, things like accessibility are very much afterthoughts for the
most commonly used operating system (and others).  It is assumed that everyone
in the world is literate, sighted, has full mobility, speaks and writes US
English - and many more (false) assumptions.  Marjolein's example gives a good
real-life example of this.

In some PDAs [personal digital assistants, eg: Palm Pilot], whereby, when first
started, one is asked for language, time zone, etc.  This concept has appeal to
me and could be used in many other instances.

I will conclude by saying that I believe that accessibility of everything with
which the user interacts needs to be under consideration; in this case, the User
Agent should present a start-up screen allowing language (and other) preferences
to be set.  I would refer those interested in the larger picture to ISO/TS16071
[Ergonomics of human-system interaction -- Guidance on accessibility for
human-computer interfaces]
