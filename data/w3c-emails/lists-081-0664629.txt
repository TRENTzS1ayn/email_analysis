This is something I've been brewing up for a while - drafted on paper in
January - but was motivated to complete it when I saw James' presentation
(online, not live). Indeed it is a very important question to be asking.
Chaals, I think what I've written might open up some discussion about your
question: "Any ideas how to get users to understand their
responsibilities..."

The basic premise is that in order to get users to understand, we need to
help them along in the right direction to becoming better users. Yes, the
responsibility is theirs, but it has to "substantially overlap" with our
responsibillities...

I'm working on some follow up ideas, but they'll have to wait for another
night!!

Best regards,
Derek.
