Hi all,

just a thought but how useful are reset buttons in forms? It strikes me that to give the user an opportunity to accidentally wipe out all the info they have just typed in may not be the best idea in the world. Is the type attribute of "reset" considered to be enough warning for users not to accidentally choose it? 

Also, I have seen several instances of the reset button being located before the submit button (both in layout and mark-up flow) which causes momentary uncertainty in my mind so how it's perceived by users with cognitive difficulties is maybe a real concern.

Any views?

J.
