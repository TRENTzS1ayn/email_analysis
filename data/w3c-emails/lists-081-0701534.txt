As a rule of thumb the reset button should never be present. It is
almost never of any use, and most often just potential harmful as you
rightly say. Joe Clark is telling us the same thing in his book Building
Accessible Websites, page 281: "Reset buttons are a miserable idea...I
have never once found a Reset button that truly needed to be there."

There could be exceptions, but I don't know of any.

Emne: reset buttons in forms - useful or not?




Hi all,

just a thought but how useful are reset buttons in forms? It strikes me
that to give the user an opportunity to accidentally wipe out all the
info they have just typed in may not be the best idea in the world. Is
the type attribute of "reset" considered to be enough warning for users
not to accidentally choose it? 

Also, I have seen several instances of the reset button being located
before the submit button (both in layout and mark-up flow) which causes
momentary uncertainty in my mind so how it's perceived by users with
cognitive difficulties is maybe a real concern.

Any views?
