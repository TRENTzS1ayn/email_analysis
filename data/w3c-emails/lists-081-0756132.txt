Not in my experience; it was probably turned off by the manufacturer
(or LAN team, at work) because I'm in the US -- but this shutoff is
probably not unique.  Even if it were always shipped on, I suspect
many intenet cafes would end up having it turned off by a customer,
so that it isn't there for the next customer.
