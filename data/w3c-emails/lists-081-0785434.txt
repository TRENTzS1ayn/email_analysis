I don't think you could mean this, really.  There's a general consensus that
computer technology is way too complex to configure.  My guess is that fewer
than 5% of any given *non-professional* user population changes any defaults
at all.  I'm not blaming you, or anyone in particular.  But this stuff *is*
hard to learn.

Actually, in a blue-sky sense, this is a good idea.  Hence the success of
the "... for Dummies" series, Cliff Notes, etc.  Anyone from the Semantic
Web want to chime in?

Hi Kurt,

I was not writing from a "mandatory" perspective.  I agree that beyond
meeting the accessibility requirements, designers should not be on the hook.
I was relating to the fact that the encounter between a person and a
technology takes place in a complex setting: the user's previous experience
with technology, their degree of confidence, their expectations of what the
technology will do, etc.  For most of the important factors, people with
disabilities are disadvantaged beyond the reality of their functional
limitations.  That is, it's bad enough to have low vision, but low vision
users may be predominantly poorer, older, less well educated, less socially
connected than non-disabled users.

So when we expect these users to configure browser settings, it may be an
unreasonable expectation.  I'm not blaming web designers.  The solutions lie
in entirely other domains.
