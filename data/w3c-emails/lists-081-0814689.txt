Let's stress this point.  Much of the configuration on modern browsers is
per user,  not per system, so there was no real conflict between these
two users as they should get different configurations.

It is only when you go deeper into language configuration on Windows XP
that you start hitting commercial limits.  Windows XP is capable of 
presenting different user interface languages, in depth, to different
users, but you have to pay extra to licence that version, as it is
aimed at certain sorts of multi-national companies, not home users.
(Something similar, but with gaps, and without the commercially
driven restrictions, is in Red-Hat 8, but one would not normally
reccommend that to naive users as they will be confused because
all their friends and most web sites will assume they are using
Windows.)
