Again, there are unwarranted assumptions here. First, that they are 
actually using a Windows version that allows easy switching between 
different users (and especially that they are using XP); and secondly that 
they even know they _can_ set up different users, each with their own 
configuration.

Technically, yes, it's possible they can have two different users, and each 
set up their own language preference in the browser. In practice, many 
people don't know such options exist, let alone how to use them.
