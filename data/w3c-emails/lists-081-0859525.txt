Publication
-----------
The workshop proceedings will be published as 'The Proceedings of the
ACM W4A International Cross-Disciplinary Workshop on Web Accessibility
2004', part of the ACM International Conference Proceedings Series.
Extended abstracts of each full paper will also be published in
'ACM SIGCAPH Computers and the Physically Handicapped'.

Selected papers will be invited to submit a revised version for
consideration for a special issue of the The New Review of Hypermedia
and Multimedia focusing on Accessible Hypermedia and Multimedia.
These papers will go through an additional reviewing process to ensure
quality and accepted papers will be published in the special issue,
scheduled for the second half of 2004. See the NRHM website for
general background: http://www.comp.glam.ac.uk/~NRHM

Topics and Content
------------------
We invite submissions for W4A 2004 addressing our current theme of
?Accessible Layout - The Tension Between Accessibility and Visual
Design?.

Layout and structure are key to good visual design. They are the conduit

for both the content and the graphics. They are also very important for
disabled (e.g. dyslexic users) people and specifically visually
impaired users, as they need to be quickly and easily interacted with.
This workshop aims to address layout, structure, and presentation from
the viewpoint of accessibility and good visual design; where these are
in opposition, the workshop aims to facilitate discussion between
interested parties so that a solution (or at least the beginners of a
solution) can be formulated. The workshop organizers support inclusive
design or one design for all however how can this be the case if users
have differing needs? The organizers also assert that no one should be
hindered when interacting with layout. Will making layout accessible
hinder sighted or ?conventional? users?

Topics of interests include (but are not limited to):
- Technological advances to support web accessibility.
- End user tools for accessibility.
- Design methodologies for web accessibility.
- Accessibility evaluation techniques and tools.
- Accessibility evaluation guidelines.
- Adaptive applications and graphics.
- Tools and techniques enabling authors to create accessible layout /
content.
- Psychology of end user experiences and scenarios.
- Innovative scripting/markup languages that support web accessibility.
- Universally accessible graphical design approaches.
- Graphical transcoding techniques.
- Accessible graphic formats and tools for their creation.

W4A addresses the fourth dimension of the web; accessibility from a
cross-disciplinary perspective. Conventional workshops on accessibility
tend to be single disciplinary in nature. However, we are concerned that

this focus on a single participant group prevents the cross-pollination
of ideas, needs, and technologies from other related but separate
fields. This workshop will be decidedly cross disciplinary and will
bring together users, accessibility experts, graphic designers, and
technologists from academia and industry to discuss how accessibility
can be supported. We also encourage the participation of users and other

interested parties as an additional balance to the discussion. Our aim
is to focus on accessibility by encouraging participation from many
disciplines. Views will bridge academia, commerce, and industry and we
hope that arguments encompassing a range of beliefs across the
design-accessibility spectrum will be presented.

Submission and Important Dates
-------------------------------
We will accept both position and technical papers. Position papers
should only be in short paper format whereas technical papers can be in
