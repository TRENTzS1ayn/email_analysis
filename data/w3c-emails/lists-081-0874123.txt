If it is not good practice to post these type of questions, then my 
apologies...

I have set access key 2 for our skip nav link, but it does not appear to 
be working on http://www.csu.org.  Anyone know why? 
Since access keys don't function in all browsers, should we list which 
browsers they work on  from our accessible page 
http://www.csu.org/extrx/disclaimer/wai.html?

We are novices to the WAI, so any other suggestions are more than welcome. 


Thank you much,
