Matthew Smith replies:

On Mozilla under Linux, this does work to a point.  Using the accesskey ALT+2, 
the browser jumps to the URI http://www.csu.org/#skip   However, your styling 
for the 'skiplink' class has display:none - I wonder if this is throwing things out.

I feel that there is a lot of superfluous code around the actual anchor:
<span class="skiplink"><a name="skip">Skip</a></span>

All you need for the actual anchor is:
<a name="skip"></a>

Hope this helps.

Cheers
