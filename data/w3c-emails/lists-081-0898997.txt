>However, I would suggest that, at the moment, the reasonable assumption

on a pre-configured XP Home.<

Perhaps in your part of the UK. In this poor rural area where computer
literacy is perhaps not as good as it could be, about 50% of the people I
know who even have a PC tend to have old (often misconfigured by inept
"repairs" or virus attacks) Win95/98/ME machines - and that includes
business as well as home users.

(On a brighter note, the sun is shining on the primroses in the hedgebanks,
so it isn't all bad <grin /> )
