I wrote to AOL using its e-mail address listed on its accessibility web page
(AOLAccessibility@aol.com)
and received the bounced message below.  Apparently, AOL access is not
functioning either as an e-mail address or as a company concept.

Its new media player does not have a means to control volume that is
accessible to the blind.  it is controlled using a slide bar and mouse only.
For those who want an example, check out:

If you don't have the AOL media player, you will be offered the opportunity
to download it.

If anyone knows how to contact AOL so this problem can be raised with them,
please let me know.  Thanks.

Kelly
