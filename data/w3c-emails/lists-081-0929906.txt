I dont know about the email address and if AOL is aware of the issue and
is working on it or not...  I am taking your word for it.

Why not?  It is not good enough to say dont worry about it because that is
the way they all are (inaccessible).  And Kelly is trying to alert AOL of
IT'S inaccessible embedded media player.  What you wrote here gives the
feeling that since noone has attempted to fix the problem, it is ok to be
inaccessible until one (or more) comes along that is accessible.  This way
of thinking (whether or not you meant it that way) is one reason most of
the web is still inaccessible and businesses not moving to rectify it. If
everyone else is not accessible, then why should I bother until I am in
the minority.  And with the majority thinking that way, accessiblity will
not be an important issue with them.

Very good point!

I have a problem here.... dissmissal no, but if it is inaccessible on one
thing... it is STILL inaccessible.
