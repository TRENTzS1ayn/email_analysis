The DC Accessibility Working Group's next face-to-face meeting will be  
in Brussels on April 30th. See below for details. If you would like to  
attend but have not yet registered, please contact Martin Ford asap  
(mmi-dc@ofir.dk).

Although many of you will not be attending the Workshop, we are sure  
that many of you do have concerns about accessibility metadata. We  
would like to encourage you to write a one or two page description of  
your concerns and interests (and achievements, if possible) so that  
they can be shared with all through the publication of the Workshop  
activities, and so they can be considered by the Workshop participants.  
Already we have had some informal input - short papers allow us to use  
this more effectively. We are keen to hear from a wide range of people  
so please do not think this invitation is only for accessibility or  
metadata experts. We want to cover all concerns, if possible, including  
those of people who are likely to need to use accessibility metadata in  
one way or the other.

Please submit these to me (Liddy.Nevile@motile.net), in an accessible  
form - plain text, the text of an email message, accessible HTML,  
...and send them to me in an email with 'position paper for April 30'  
as the subject header. I would really like to have them by April 16th,  
if that is possible.

Original invitation to April 30th meeting:
------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
------------------------------------
An invitation to participate in the:
Metadata for Accessibility Workshop

Date: 9:30-4:30 Friday 30th April 2004

Location: CEN Rue de Stassart 36, B-1050 Brussels
Organized by: CEN/ISSS WS/MMI-DC

In conjunction with:
CEN/ISSS WS/LT APLR (Accessibility Properties for Learning Resources)  
project
DC Accessibility Working Group

You are invited to participate in a special one day open workshop  
session of
the next meeting of the CEN/ISSS MMI-DC Workshop. This open workshop  
will be
held in the CEN/CENELEC Meeting Centre, Rue de Stassart, B-1050  
Brussels on 30
April 2004. The aim of the workshop is to identify and investigate the  
way
that metadata can help achieve efficient and future-proof solutions to
accessibility. It is assumed that this encompasses the provision of  
adequate
access to information for people with disabilities and for everyone in a
multilingual and multicultural environment. The environments include:
1. e-government,
2. e-business,
3. e-education and more.

A wide range of participants is expected to find this workshop of  
interest,
including those who wish to present their case for:
1. what is needed,
2. what is available and should be respected,
3. what is not available but is necessary, and
4. what they want people to know about.

All participants will be expected to submit a short summary of their
particular interests in this context (maximum of 2 pages). As a group,  
the
workshop will consider a number of perspectives and scenarios and  
develop a
report that WS-MMI-DC will make publicly available online after the  
workshop.
Those who cannot attend but would like to contribute papers are welcome  
to do
so.
The number of participants will be limited so you are urged to register  
(at no
charge) as soon as possible (or to submit short papers).

Please register your provisional acceptance to this invite asap.
Papers should be submitted by 14 April 2004.
