I'm not sure where you're reading me stating that this is a non-issue that
shouldn't be worried about.  In fact, I state the exact opposite a couple of
paragraphs down.  I wrote, "the fact that other embedded players doesn't
provide justification for the inaccessibility of the media player".

Kelly is welcome to alert AOL, and he should do so.  He has brought up many
excellent points about access issues that I have seen.

The feeling you describe is not what I was trying to convey.  You're
applying a bias to my words that is not supported by the actual words I
wrote.

Agreed.  That mindset, which neither I nor the my contacts at AOL hold, does
impede progress.  In any large organization you are bound to have people
that are at either end of the spectrum.

The player is not accessible and there is no good justification.  However,
AOL does a lot more than provide a version of the WinAMP player that is
embedded in Web pages.  To state that "AOL access is not functioning...as a
company concept" is unnecessarily inflammatory and doesn't accurately
reflect AOL's ongoing work addressing accessibility in its products.
