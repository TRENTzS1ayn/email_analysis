I have no problem with posting a question about the media player to this
list, or directly to AOL or any other the other creators of inaccessible
media players.

I have no problem with directly challenging the maker to make it accessible,
and "outing" a player or inaccessible product is fair game.

What I disagree with is when a generalized condemnation is made based on a
single and very specific point.
