**My observation is that Access to imbedded anything, whether it is media
players, e-mail or instant messaging clients, or anti-virus software, is
poor.  Separate, stand alone applications are nearly always preferable.

**Agreed.

**I have not heard from AOL if WXRT radio can be listened to using its stand
alone player so I don't know if this is an actual possibility.  I could
indeed write to the radio station but where would they turn to for support?
Their partner AOL?  It seems that AOL provided no suggestion or information
about accessibility to its AOL radio partners.  Further, AOL provides no
information in its help file about accessibility whatsoever.

By contrast, the BBC radio player offers a link for those having trouble
listening to the broadcast.  When this link is selected, Real Player is
launched as a separate application and the audio stream is now controlled
from the stand alone Real Player rather than the imbedded BBC media player.
Obviously,controls are accessible from the stand alone Real Player.

**let's see what some of the problems have been in the last few days:

*e-mail bounces from highly publicized address specifically established for
accessibility.

*No telephone contact on access issues if e-mail is inoperative

*Highly publicized AOL accessibility website that speaks mostly about the
AOL online service and not other products such as AIM or the AOL Radio
product or AOL media player.

*AOL Media Player help file that says nothing about accessibility.

Taken together, these items represent something more than an isolated and
specific issue.  considering the enormous resources of Time Warner, the
world's largest media and entertainment company of which AOL is a part, we
should have a more coordinated and comprehensive response to accessibility.
