Ok,  I am not picking on Mr. Kirkpatrick or trying to start a flame.  I am
making a point to all to watch what they say in a public forum where
businesses can use the words (albeit out of context maybe) by accessiblity
advocates against their (our) cause.  Here is an example of what I mean:

Me (a made up lawyer for a made up company who is going to court to fight
an accessiblity issue that they dont want to be bothered with): I call Mr.
Kirkpatrick to the stand.

Me: Mr. Kirkpatrick are you a member of WAI and an established expert in
web accessibility?

Mr. Kirkpatrick: yes

Me: Mr. Kirkpatrick did you say this (refer to the previous message about
all embedded media players)

Mr. Kirkpatrick: but...

Me: Yes or no please.

Mr. Kirkpatrick: Yes

Me: Was this the exact statement of everything in the paragraph?  Yes or No?

Mr. Kirkpatrick: Yes

Me: Thank You

Me: (to the court) I rest my case

Is this cheesy? yes. But it is done and done very well to get their point
accross.  It makes it look like WAI agrees with their side.  Now I, being
in the Washington DC area, have seen this tack employed far too often.

Andrew,  I know you did not intend it to be read like that.  And I am
truly sorry that your message was the first that I saw since I took an
active interest advocating the web accessiblity issue.  I am just doing a
service to all whose job it is to advocate web accessibility.  It is
definately not personal and I look forward to working with you and
everyone on this list to make the web accessible to ALL!

-Steve
