Based on another streaming media radio site, I think that many organisations
providing these don't want you to be able to get at the underlying URL
which would allow you to open the site in a standalone player.  This might
be a combination of ignorance and the liking for "designed" sites, but it 
may well also be because the streaming media is a loss leader to get you
to the advertising on the embedding page.

On the one I am thinking about, they intercept attempts to get at the media
player controls, so, if you don't turn off scripting, you can't get a 
full screen display.
