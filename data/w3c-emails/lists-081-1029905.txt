This exchange between me and a lawyer who is trying to use one sentence out
of several in an email assumes that the lawyer on the other side is
completely incompetent.

It is true that most embedded media players are largely inaccessible to
keyboard and screen reader users, and I would be dishonest to say anything
else.  Part of the entire message is that this is no excuse.  I wrote that
at the outset, and a qualified plaintiff's attorney would draw that out if I
was forced to answer a misleading question with a yes or no 
answer.
