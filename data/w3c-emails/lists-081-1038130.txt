Not a good thing, although it appears to be an isolated incident.

I'm not making excuses for AOL, but I see this more often all the time.
They do have telephone numbers for support on the same page as the email
address.  The numbers are more general, but they are listed on the
accessibility page, so one would hope that the operators are able to offer
help or a referral.

You're right, there could be better info there.

Again, improvements are needed.

There have been a few exchanges about this, and I feel like you have
clarified additional points that you may have had in mind when you stated
that AOL access was not a functioning concept.  I think that you have stated
the basis for your opinion much more clearly and with this additional
information people can better make up their own mind.  My reaction was to
the idea that an inaccessible embedded media player and a bounced email
equates to "AOL (or any company) doesn't care about accessibility".  It's
just not enough information.
