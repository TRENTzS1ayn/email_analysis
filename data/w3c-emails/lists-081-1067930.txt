err......no did not try it myself (mia culpa) I took Kelly's experience at
face value, besides who is to say that this list is not monitored and
corrective action has been taken. In which case job done!

"I believe that
the way to get good decisions made regularly is to work with the companies
and the people who are making decisions about whether to implement feature X
or feature Y.  The threat of a big lawsuit can be motivating, but working
with the people on the ground is the real key."

I agree, in a perfect world. Alas Utopia is a long way off. Say what you
like AOL have not honored the agreement with the NFB or at best translated
it to fit into their business model, which was not the spirit of the
original agreement. I feel wrists need slapping.

Lewis Carrol....

Speak harshly to your little child
and slap him when he sneezes
He only does it to annoy
Because he knows it teases.
