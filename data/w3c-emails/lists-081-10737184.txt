Dear Sir

RE: URGENT AND CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS PROPOSAL
I know that this will come to you as a suprise.
I am Dr. paul odigwe the Director and Funds
Co-ordinator of the Finance/Contract Department of the
FEDERAL MINISTRY OF PETROLEUM RESOURCES.Terms of Reference.
My term of reference involves the financial management
and disbursement of proceeds from petroleum products
and also the award of contracts to multinationalcompanies.
My office is also saddled with responsibility of
screening categorization and prioritization of
projects embarked upon by this Ministry as well
as feasibility study for selected projects and
supervising the project consultants involved. A
breakdown of the fiscal expenditure by this office
as at the end of the fourth fiscal quarter of 2001
indicates that this Ministry paid out a whooping sum
of US$736M (Seven hundred and Thirty Six Million
United States Dollars) to successful contractbeneficiaries.
The Ministry is now compiling beneficiaries to be paid
this third quarter of 2002. The crux of this letter is
that the finance/contract department of this
Ministry deliberately over-inflated the contract value
of the various contracts awarded. In the cause of
disbursements, this department has been able to track
down the sum of US$20.5M Twenty Million Five Hundred
Thousand United States Dollars) as the over-invoiced
sum. This money is now lying and floating in the
Ministry's domiciliary account with the Apex Bank,
Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). 
My colleagues and I now want to quickly transfer these
funds to a safe nominated account for possible
investment abroad. We are not allowed as a matter of
Government policy to operate any foreign account
because of our status as Civil/public servants. Hence
the need to solicit for your account to transfer thisfund into.
We have also evolved a sharing formula as follows:
(1) 25% for the foreign account owner(2) 70% for I and my colleagues
(3) 5% will be set aside to defray all expenses both
locally and internationally during the course of this
transaction. Furthermore, we shall be relying on your
advice as regards investments of part of our share in
any blue-chip Company in your country. Be informed
that this business is genuinely and 100% safe
considering the high-powered government official
involved. Send your private fax, telephone numbers
and your mobile telephone if any and same of your Bankand Account number.
This is to facilitate easy communication with you.Contact me strictly by email.Looking forward to healthy business relationship withyou.Sincerely,
DR, PAUL ODIGWE
