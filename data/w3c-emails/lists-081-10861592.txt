Dear Friend,

I am the Director of credit and foreign payment of the Union Bank of Nigeria PLC

I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my bank with account number 64-652-2809/UB/T who perished in the kenyan air-crash with the whole passenger aboard.

Since the demise of this our customer, I personally have watched with keen interest to see the next-of-kin
who will come to claim his funds of $20.5MUSD which has been in my bank for a very long time; however
nobody has shown up, hence this letter to you.

On this note, I approach you to submit your particulars through me as the next-of-kin so that with
my contact in the bank I can process it and the money will leave to any account you will provide. The
banking regulations here do not allow such money to stay more than 4years after this period of time, the
bank would usually recall the money to the tresurery.

In view of this, I will give you 30% of the total sum after a successful conclusion of the transaction. Any
expenses incurred by both parties in course of this transaction shall be refunded from 5% set aside for
this purpose. I shall need the following from you:

1. An account where the fund will be transfered.
2. Your private telephone and fax numbers.
3. A copy of your international Passport for the applications in the bank.

Finally be informed that the entire transaction is risk-free.Upon the receipt of the above requirements,
we hope to be through with the transaction in 5 working days.

Please reply me via this e-mail address : keres1010@euroseek.com

Yours Faithfully,
Dr Philip Jaja
