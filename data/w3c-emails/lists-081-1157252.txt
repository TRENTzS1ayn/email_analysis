Yes! And not just for screen reader users, but anyone without the use of a
mouse.

Headings could be wrapped inside an anchor tag <a>.

Again, wrap the headings with an anchor tag.

Yes, that is a good point, if you go too far with skip links than you have
those additional links to tab through too.  There needs to be a balance of
accessiblity to different parts of the page by skipping to them without
wading through a bunch of unwanted skip links.  This is where thought
comes into play when designing a good page.  For example, no need to skip
to the main menu bar from the skip links at the top, because if you have 2
skip links, one to a "page related menu" and one to the start of the
content, then the main menu would be the third tab if it followed the skip
links at the top of the page.
