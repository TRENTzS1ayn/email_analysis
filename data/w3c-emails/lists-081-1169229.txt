You can't do it with IE out of the box, but keyboard-friendly browsers 
like Opera have had headings navigation for almost a decade, and one of 
the common script-based add-ons to Explorer and Mozilla (lots of people 
produce these, including Jon Gunderson's group at uiuc, Jim Ley, and 
more recently NILS) for accessibility is indeed keyboard-based headings 
navigation.

I think this demonstrates precisely why the skip links thing is a bit 
of a hack designed to get around the fact that most user agents never 
got the hang of grouping links and passing over them - something that 
was readily available in HTML in the mid-90s (and was implemented in 
early browsers like Lynx). I agree with Jim that having a page which 
grows an extra 15 links which all say "skip this" or something similar 
isn't a huge net win.
