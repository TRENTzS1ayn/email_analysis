If you have that much to skip, perhaps it needs its own page.  If you need a 
long page, you need link groupings as long as it is necessary to use a 
keyboard in a crippled user agent that is the most accessible around for 
screen reader users.  We are a small minority, but on the other hand, making 
things tabable does not hurt anyone.

You can't do it with IE out of the box, but keyboard-friendly browsers
like Opera have had headings navigation for almost a decade, and one of
the common script-based add-ons to Explorer and Mozilla (lots of people
produce these, including Jon Gunderson's group at uiuc, Jim Ley, and
more recently NILS) for accessibility is indeed keyboard-based headings
navigation.

I think this demonstrates precisely why the skip links thing is a bit
of a hack designed to get around the fact that most user agents never
got the hang of grouping links and passing over them - something that
was readily available in HTML in the mid-90s (and was implemented in
early browsers like Lynx). I agree with Jim that having a page which
grows an extra 15 links which all say "skip this" or something similar
isn't a huge net win.
