And if javascript is turned off? As many using AT do to avoid
complications.  Anchor tags with "well thought out skipping" works for all
browsers "out of the box".

This is not a because of a poor user agent or lack of a good
specification. It is just poor understanding of proper web page layout
design. Am I wrong?  Look at the newest websites as compared to those
"state of the art" websites from 5 years ago. Skipping is only the natural
thing to do.  How do you read the news paper?  Do you honestly start at
the upper left corner and read EVERYTHING?  Of course not, first thing you
do is read the headings. Then SKIP back to the heading that interested you
most and continued reading from there.  Users of screen readers can get a
list of headings and jump to the one they want, but if you are using a
switch as input, without proper skip links, you have to read through all
of the content. There is no way to skip to the next heading.  The
javascript routines are nice, but they may conflict with other AT
applications reading from the browser and cannot be guaranteed to work at
all times.
