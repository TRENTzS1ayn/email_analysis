Per specifications, HTML/XHTML can be designed to be highly semantic.  A 
good user agent can take advantage of this information and allow the 
user greater possibilities than a developer can, even if so inclined.

Skip links are, in my opinion, presentational, and ideally would be 
unnecessary.  Given the state of support for header navigation, skips 
links can still be useful.

I agree that this is a desireable way to read a doument, but better user

Opera is the main browser that allows this from the keyboard today 
(Amaya?), without scripting.  I'm not sure about handheld browsers, but 
I'd be willing to bet that this is more common a feature on small devices.

Ideally, users or people who are in a position to help should try 
different solutions.  Hopefully they will work -- a good user agent 
would be a lot easier than dealing with sites with no skip links. If you 
consider the number of designers that are not willing to put in a single 
visible skip link, let alone several, I have a difficult time believing 
that skip links are the solution you hope they are.
