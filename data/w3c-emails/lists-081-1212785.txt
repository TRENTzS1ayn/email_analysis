VERY TRUE!

Possibly... But designers dont use Headings and continue to use styles to
change the heading text which makes user agents unable know what is
symantically a heading and what is just styled text.

I would hope that, through effective website designing (including skipping
of and to certain areas of content) AND user agents that can truly handle
multiple modes of input/output, web accessiblity would be taken for
granted.  I am not arguing against better UAs,  I am arguing for better
website design to complement better UAs.
