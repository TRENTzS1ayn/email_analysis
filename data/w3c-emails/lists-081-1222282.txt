Actually, I wonder if User Agents could offer a list of links/headings
with the capability of setting the focus to a selected link/header in the
list? Similar to screen readers but in a side window? This would aleviate
the need for designers to code skip links or even some menus and just (or
almost) mark up the page with content, headings, and links to other pages.
 Images would be under content in this scenerio ( I am not mentioning
about changing this part ) But, what about adding a capability to list
images/figures too?  As in a printed document with a table of figures.
