Patrick,

   When I said that designers dont mark up headings with the headings tag
but instead use styling.  I was countering Andrews point about
designers not adding skip links.  He made the point that designers
didnt want to add links to the page and that the User Agent could
handle it. (and rightly so if marked up properly)  I just was stating
that it is not generally marked up  properly either, which leaves the
User Agent unable to symantically determine headers.


Andrew,

   You are correct about the CSS usage.  But CSS can style paragraphs <p>
to make them look like headers without the header <h> tag.  I know that
you knew this.  I am just saying that even with an execellent User
Agent, designers must still mark up their content correctly.  I am very
glad to see the use of CSS improving.  I believe that CSS is going to
be a very big key in website design as we shift away from designing
from the PC centric design to a multimodal design.  CSS along with the
upcoming CC/PP work can tailor which style sheet is sent along with the
html to the browser.  The stylesheets can then be written to display
the content more effectively for the device in which the content is
being viewed.

-Steve
