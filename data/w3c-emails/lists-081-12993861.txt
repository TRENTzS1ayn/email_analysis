Dear Friend,

 I, on behalf of my colleagues from different Federal Government of Nigeria owned 
parastatals decided to solicit your assistance as regards transfer of US$10,500,000.00 
(Ten Million,five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) into your bank account. 

These funds emanated from unclaimed contractual proceeds of foreign contracting firms 
who could not meet their financial obligations to their creditors. We, as holders of 
sensitive positions in our various parastatals, were mandated by the Federal Government 
to scrutinise all payments made to certain foreign contractors and we discovered that 
some of the contractors have not been paid their contractual entitlement which 
collectively left the sum of US$15,500,000.00 (Fiftheen Million, five Hundred Thousand US 
Dollars) lying in a suspended Account.

 However, from our investigations, we discovered that the foreign beneficiary companies 
have since been liquidated, and to all intents and purposes no longer exist in Nigeria, 
thus providing us with this opportunity, provided that we have a capable partner, to 
execute a transaction of this nature.

 We agreed that the said amount would be transferred into an overseas Bank Account to 
be provided by a reliable foreign firm/associate. This is because as serving Government 
workers the Civil Service Code does not allow us to operate foreign Account. In our 
initial attempt to do this, we succeeded in transferring part of this amount US$5m (Five 
Million Dollars) into a United States Dollar Account in Beirut, Lebanon, but our foreign 
associate failed to honour our mutual agreement insisting instead that the total amount 
be transferred into the Account before we can share the money.

 As a result, we have lost confidence in the ability of our Lebanese partner to see this 
matter to its logical conclusion, and until the initial transaction is satisfactorily resolved, 
we have cancelled further transactions with him. In the light of the foregoing, it is clear 
that we require a partner that is not only capable of rendering assistance and 
cooperation in executing this matter, but will honour the terms of agreement when we 
reach the concluding stages of this transaction.

 We therefore offer the amount of 20% of the entire sum in return for 
services/assistance rendered in successfully carrying out this project. We trust that you 
appreciate the sensitive nature of this matter and the need for initial caution on our part, 
but when a relationship is confidently established and operations commence you will be 
provided with all relevant information.

 I remain at your disposal to entertain any questions/enquiries relating to this proposition 
and you may contact me as a matter of urgency via e-mail, for further information on 
the procedures and requirements of this transaction.

 In your reply, remember to indicate a safe telephone number where I can always reach 
you. Hope to hear from you soon. Please treat with the strictest confidentiality and 
expediency. 

Yours faithfully,

Mr.Okon Etiebet
