YES!  That is what I meant by adding more skip links.  If the floated
section is small enough to view the rest of the main article, hidden links
are fine.  But, if you are going to jump to a section off the current
display, but still on the same page, visible links would be encouraged so
that those with graphical browsers but no mouse could easily jump to the
section not currently displayed.
