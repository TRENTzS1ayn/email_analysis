What you don't want to do though is write generic links if you have multiple 
stories on the same page that could be come repetitious so you need a 
mechanism that puts the title of the story that is being continued in the 
body of the link such as continue with bush sells out america instead of 
continue story.

It seems to me that a list of links is not the only thing that risks
interrupting the narrative of a page for linear renditions such as speech.

I sometimes write a page designed to render in multiple columns for
majority visible browsers.  Schematically, things like

<h2>Main Story</h2>
<p>here is a first paragraph at the top</p>

<div class="right-inset-30%">
<h3>Some subsidiary story</h3>
<p>bla bla bla</p>
</div>

<p>This continues the main story, flowing around the inset.</p>


This works well in graphical browsers, but breaks the story for
linear browsers.  The alternative of keeping the main story together
loses the ability to float-and-flow for the majority readers.
Also "headers navigation" does nothing for it, because there's
logically no header to mark the continuation.


I think perhaps we need to view this kind of situation as a
generalisation of "skip links", and provide a similar kind of
workaround.  I have used the following, and wonder if it is
satisfactory in all realistic cases:

(1) Use the above schematic for the benefit of visual browsers:
(2) Add a "Continue this story" link and a "Main story continued"
    target before and after the insets respectively.
(3) Style the "continue" anchors as "display: none"

The URL in my .sig is a case in point.
