There is a beta version available of a free IE extension 
that will provide lists of the following information in 
dialog boxes:

1. Links (Alt-F12)
2. Headers (Alt-F11)
3. Accesskeys (Alt-F9)
4. Links in MAP elements (links defined with either AREA or 
A elements) (Alt-F10)
5. Configuration (Alt-F8)
