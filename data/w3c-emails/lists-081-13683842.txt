From Mr. Andreas Usman
Chief Accountant of the Nigerian
National Petroleum Corporation,
34 Wemco Road,
Ikoyi, Lagos Nigeria

Dear Sir,

I am Mr. Andreas Usman, the Chief Accountant of the Nigerian National
Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) headquarters in Lagos, Nigeria. I reliably
got your contact from Nigeria Chamber of Commerce. I have no reason to
doubt your honesty and credibility hence I make this proposal to you.
Please, treat with utmost confidence and excuse me for the embarrassment
this letter might cause you as we have not met or known each other before.
I have the mandate of my colleagues Mr. Williams Okere  to solicit
for your assistance for a deal we want to execute, My Corporation (NNPC)
awarded a contract of US$86,700,000.00 (Eighty - Six Million, Seven
Hundred Thousand U.S Dollars) to a Foreign firms to supply Rig & Drilling
Equipment for Kaduna Refinery here in Nigeria but because of my position,
this contract was over invoiced to US$115,300,000.00 (OneHundred and Fifteen Million, Three Hundred Thousand United State Dollars).
The original contract sum has been paid to the contractors that executed
the project, now we are left with the over- invoice sum of
US$28,600,000.00 (Twenty Eight Million, Six Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars
Only).
All arrangements have been concluded on how this money would be moved. Our
constraints lie on the fact that we required a foreign firm or individual
account number where the money will be paid into; whose owner will be
portrayed as a contract beneficiary of fund. Infact this is why I am
writing you this letter. NOTE: - There is no risk involvedas we have taken care, loopholes covered.

As a civil servant, we are aware that some financial assistance would be
required to conclude this job, we are prepared to give as much as 30% of
the total sum to for your involvement, while 60% of the total sum will go
for me and my colleagues. To this effect, 10% would be earmarked to cover
all the expenses (Local and International). This is because the process
would pass through some Directors in the Ministry of Finance and Central
Bank of Nigeria (CBN).
These officials might require some tips to facilitate payment without
delay since they are not aware of the deal. Please, should you be willing
to assist, we shall require the following information to enable us put
claim immediately. Your bank name, Address and Account Number, Fax number
of the Bank where the money will be transferred.
But should you not be in a position to assist, this deal has to remain a
secret till the end of time. It is important I mention that the officials
involved in this transaction are top Government Functionaries who have put
in years of service to this Country. For the maintenance ofpersonal integrity and prestige of all persons involved in this
transaction, you are implored to exhibit utmost secrecy throughout the
duration of the transaction. You are strongly advice to avoid discussing
this transaction with a third party as that could jeopardize the entire
transaction.
You may open a separate bank account in any Country for this purpose if
you wish. All arrangements of this transfer for this quarter payment for
the year, 2002 have been properly organized and further action awaits your
immediate response. Hurry and send to me the Account Number where the
money will be transferred into, so that we can start toprocess for the approval of this payment.


I look forward to hearing from you.

Best Regards,

Mr. Andreas Usman.
