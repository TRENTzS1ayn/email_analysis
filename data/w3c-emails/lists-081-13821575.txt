Dear Sir, 
REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE-STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL

I am Dr. SANI SABO, a top management staff in the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and I head a seven-man tender? board in charge of Contract Awards and Payments Approvals. I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction that involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account. There were series of contracts executed by a consortium Multinationals in the oil industry in favour of NNPC among which were:
The Supply of Y2K Compliant Personal Computers and Accessories to the Warri, Port Harcourt and Kaduna Refineries; Supply of Drugs and Relief materials to the victims of the Niger/ Delta crises; The construction of Schools, Hospitals and Housing Units in the Niger/Delta Region. 
The original value of these contracts were deliberately over invoiced in the sum of USD TWENTY ONE MILLION, FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ($21.5M) which has been approved and is now ready to be transferred as all the Companies that actually executed these contracts have been paid and the projects officially commissioned.
Consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the total amount to your account for subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants are prohibited by the Code of Conduct Bureau (Civil Service Laws) from opening and/ or operating foreign accounts in our names.
In return for your services, we have resolved to give you 25% of the transferred sum, while 5% shall be set aside for incidental expenses (internal and external) between the parties in the course of the transaction. You will be mandated to remit the balance 70% to other accounts in due course.

Furthermore, Modalities have been worked out at the highest levels of the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of Nigeria for the immediate transfer of the funds within 10 working days subject to your satisfaction of the above stated terms. Our assurance is that your role is risk free.
To accord this transaction the legality it deserves and for mutual security of the fund, the whole approval procedures will be officially and legally processed with your name or any company you may nominate as the Bonafide beneficiary.

Once more, I want you to understand that having put in over 26 years in the service of my country, I am averse to having my image and career dented. This matter should therefore be treated with utmost secrecy and urgency.

Kindly expedite action as we are behind schedule to enable us include this transfer in the third batch of this financial quarter payment.

Please acknowledge the receipt of this message via my direct email: sani2002@safe-mail.net

Yours Sincerely,

Dr.  SANI  SABO
