I agree totally and this is the way we do things. It is really
simple; if the user cannot access the page with the settings
the author set, the user must be able to change the settings.
Common sense really, although I have met people saying more
or less "I do not care about those that cannot read my pages
as they are a minority".

We try to give the user multiple choices as they may want
to change some parts, but not all.

We have a button in Opera which toggles between document
colors and user colors.

No!!! The user is right. Trying to make a clever system
just makes the whole thing unpredictable. There may even
be cases where the author does not want the text to be
visible as default, but show it after a while or something.
By enabling the user to toggle between his and the
documents setting I think we are getting the best result.
