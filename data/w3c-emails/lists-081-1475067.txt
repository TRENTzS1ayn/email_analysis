Sure they can. Amaya, Opera, iCab, and perhaps others do this already, 
and have done for years. There is one browser in wide use that happens 
to be pretty poor in this respect. Even with IE I believe it would be 
possible to write a client-side XSLT (IE does implement XSLT to some 
extent) that would give anchors to all headers - at least they would 
appear in the general navigation. A bit more work and you could include 
a scriptlet that navigated between them - or use Jon's existing tools 
to do so.

Again, this can be done. Although I am less clear on the use case...
