JRG in response to Joe Roeder:
Some sepcialized technologies for people with disabilities are being denied
access.  Not all the denials are for security reasons, some people want to
force users to use a particular browser so that you see there WWW pages as
the author intended.  It may also be a marketing strategy being used by
server/browser developers to promote there products over competing
products.  The one scenario that has been presented is banks requiring a
specific browser to do bank transactions, so if you are using lynx you are
out of luck.  This scenario is probably based on security.
