be ignored.

JRG:This could lead to a mixture of user and author formatting information
if the user doesn't specify all colors, fonts and sizes in the default
style sheet, which could lead to unpredictable results.  I think the
recommendation should be to ignore author font, color and size formatting
and use only the user preferences.

jrg: This is probably a technique documented in DHTML to provide dynamic
text presentation (like blinking and other visual attention effects).  So I
am not sure where the W3C stands on the topic.  While it is an important
problem can it be satisfied by other means.  Like in the default style
sheet the user cannot set colors to produce invisible text.
