JRGs response to Joe Roeder:
I don't think there is any single reason for browser sniffing.  It
something that is happening right now and affecting technology used by
persons with disabilities.  Especially since persons with more severe
disabilities do not tend to use the most popular browsers.  So the goal of
this discussion is to determine what WAIs response should be.  You seem to
have suggested that if the guidelines are followed by the major browser
developers, then the problem is the same for everyone reguardless of
disability.
