"Browser sniffing" is no different than a Windows or Macintosh application
checking the version of the operating system it's running on.

How many applications check to see if they are running on Windows 3.x or
Windows 95?  

There is nothing morally wrong with this.  If the end-result is
inaccessibility, deal with that issue.  Preventing "sniffing" isn't the
answer.

As a browser developer we must say that browser sniffing is a problem.
The result is that we need to say that we are Netscape to get pages
that are ok or even get pages at all in some cases. What would have
been much better is to be able to ask for pages using a system where
you say whether the browser and user want certain things such as

  - frames
  - tables
  - java
  - javascript
  - images

This allows the page designer to take these things into consideration
and deliver an optimal page. Sadly, some of them will just say "turn
on feature X".
