Of course there is a difference. The point is that the user
doesn't need to be on a certain platform. He can be on any
platform. He can have any kinds of needs. What the designer
of the web page should know is what the program and user
are capable of handling or like. Not only which program it is as the
users of the program can have different requirements. Let's put it this
way:

  - A designer wants to check if the browser can handle frames.
  - It finds the browser is Netscape X.Y, MSIE A.B or Opera F.G.
  - These browsers can handle frames so he returns a framed page.
  - The user, however, would like a non-frames page.
  - (Please do not tell me they can use the noframes tag. A lot
    of companies do it this way).

Designers are using browser sniffing because there isn't a
better way to check what functionality the browser and
user support. If there was an easy way to check this 
they would do that. Simple as that.
