During the LA UA meeting we started a discusion on what tasks
should be done by the screen reader and what tasks should
be done by the browser.
There it was not the place and not the time to extend this
discussion. I expected some more arguments on this here.
Since they did not come up to now ... I'd like to start this discussion.

It is my opinion you should - if possible - solve a problem only
once.
Since a browser is only one of the appication I run the screen readers
must give the intelligent suport needed anyway.

Therefore ... do NOT implement non-browser specific reading requirements
in the browser.
- This will only complicate the browser,
- increase costs and/or wait time (before the browser is ready)
- Reduce the chance of rapid upgrades,
- increase the change of reading conflicts.

For a discussion on general applications with screen reader
features and intelligent screen reader features  
please see my comments on:

If you do not agree ... please let me know.

Best regards,
Jaap
