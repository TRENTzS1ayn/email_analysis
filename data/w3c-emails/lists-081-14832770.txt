When you look at a ruler as such it is _only a visual objet", but
a (good) designer adds a ruler for some reason:
- to devide a text in parts
- TO draw attention to a paragraph etc.

When you look at a today's HTML page you see several types of
tables:
- Tables to force some layout. They normally do not have a border
  since that would disturb the layout.
- numerical or textual tables. In these case the borders are
  used to identify the diferent cells and/or rows/comuns.

It is not exeactly the border that I need, but the 
column/row/cell build up even if the table is implemented in
nice or straight forward textual format.

(see also parallel message on screen reaers).
