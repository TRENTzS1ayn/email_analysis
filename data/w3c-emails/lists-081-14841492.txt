Very interesting offer...   really.

But what I missed in your great offer:
Do you also give accessibility tips?
Are the pages you send accessible?

I suppose so!

It is good to offer a goodie that not all others offer,
but than it would be nice to add this to your list of
good things you offer !

Best regards,
Jaap
