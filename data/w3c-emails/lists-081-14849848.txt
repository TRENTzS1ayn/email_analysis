That is the ideal situation.
If the situation was always so nice I would fully agrre.
We of course ask for good ALT texts and LONGDESCs.
I like and agree on yhour good example which is ... ideal.

The real situation is though that we may be glad if there is an 
ALT text and we may even be happy if there is a LONGDESC.

I would like to know when a posible pitfall is nearby and
there for I do not want to trust on possible good ALTs.
Just to replace a "possible good ALT" by being sure "an ALT has been
added to someting els".
We ALWAYS must be aware there is something for which an ALT is added
i.e. it is an alternative, a stand in, never a 100 % garanteed
form of the origional thing showed.

Best regards,
Jaap
