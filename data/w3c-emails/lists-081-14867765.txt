Right.  Let's not make the ideal impossible to reach by assuming that
authors can't write good ALT text.  We can recognize that some authors
can't write good ALT text and accommodate this by providing a user option
to render ALT text distinctly.  But requiring a distinct rendering for ALT
text would make it impossible for us to achieve the kind of seamless
device-independence that would make the Web truly accessible.

Which means that you can never enjoy the clean presentation of a page with
good ALTs.  Users should have the option to trust or not trust the author
to provide a device-independent document.  Perhaps browsers could save
these trust relationships for future visits so that the user doesn't have
to bother switching between the two modes.
