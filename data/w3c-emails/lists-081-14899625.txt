I finally got in and read the page.  I have a couple of comments.  is it
possible for the ua to sense that there is a screenreader and
automatically make at least the basic adjustment to pages that come in or
perhaps automatically set a default that prevents the text from extending
outside the window?
there are a few other things, but I'll be going back over the document for
them.
