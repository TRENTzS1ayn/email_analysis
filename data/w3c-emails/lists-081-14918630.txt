Hi Joe,
Thanks for your message.
Because of its interest I reply through the list as well.

O, know I fully agree with you, but your arguments
do not let me use my screen reader system wide either.

I think initiatives like MSAA and maybe even better: JAVA API
are the only way out for the screen reader builders.

A well documented API to reach accessibility allows the
"screen reader" builders to leave the screen for what it is:
a media to look at.
It will allow them:
- to have access to the context of the information allowing
  them to implement more intelligent features easier.
- to get rit of the "of screen model" which is slow, memory
  consuming and - most important - always inconpatible.
- to make platform independant "readers" in the future.

O, yes that is true, but in the future we will not do a good
job if we wait for the pieces that fall of the table of the rich.
I need to ask for features from both the browser venders and
the screen reader builders.
That is why I listed some of these features on my web page
(which is available again).

Our task is to make sure APPLICATIONS are accessible in the future.
This concerns more then only browsers.

On the other hand a wish list for browser venders will help
everybody who needs access on the short term.
It is my opinion though these features must concentrate on
accessible formats and not on "screen reader' behaviour.

The (screen) reader must develop to a tool that reads information
instead of screens.

The period between now and full API support - if that time will ever 
really come - will be difficult. The screen reader builders
need to support the "of screen model" approach, the MSAA and teh JAVA
API. A hard time for these (too ?)small companies.

Still building specific applications with screen reader 
capabilities will splinter up the market.
The only way to solve this is to concentrate on some not too small
companies that are able to build a generally oriented reader.

Up to now MSAA support - both of MS and of the screen reader builders - is
limitted. As far as I know no-one uses the JAVA API;
the IBM (demo ?) reader excluded.
I wonder if IBM will be the first to introduce a reader that
supports both traditional screen reading and JAVA support 
in ONE product.

Best regards,
Jaap
