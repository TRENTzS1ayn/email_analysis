Response to David by JRG:
I think it would be difficult in some operating systems for the browser to
know there is a screen reader, escpecially UNIX.  I think that the browser
should have features that can support screen readers, but I am not sure we
should require screen readers to be detected.  It is not clear to me that
there would be a good consensus between screen reader manufactures about
what the browser should do if it new there was a screen reader present.
