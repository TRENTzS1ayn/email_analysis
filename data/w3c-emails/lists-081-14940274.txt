in the example I was siting, all that the browser need do is set an
appropriate font size for pages.  as for detecting screenreaders, they
detect all kinds of other things upon installation and If I understand
correctly, screenreaders are not that difficult to detect because they are
resident during install.  As for what screenreader developpers would like
browsers to do, well, perhaps they could present pages to us with noframes
or pup up a listbox.  I'm going to be carefull here.  I'd like to see
browsers do things that would benefit all not just screenreader users too.  
One idea would be for a screenreader friendly style sheet to be envoked
upon install and all this of course is changeable at will by the user.
as for unix, lynx doesn't need anything that I know of in terms of access
to screenreaders.

I think the paper is well done and most of our needs concerning
screenreaders are met in it.  I do see advantages though to making as many
things changeable as possible because there are older screenreaders out
there and others for whom the benefits would be great.

I also think it would do no harm to ask browser developpers to include an
accessability section in their documentation explaining some of the things
that can be done and how to do them that would optimize their browsers for
diffferent needs.
