Within the Windows Platform we have a flag, known as the "Screen Reader
Present" flag.  It is set and queried through the SystemsParameterInfo()
API.  There is no end-user means to turn this flag on, it must be done
programmatically via the screen reader.

Internet Explorer 3.x and 4.x do the following when this flag is turned on:

*When images are turned off, automatically enlarge the image box to
include all the ALT text that is available.

Similarly there is a "High Contrast" flag which can be turned on and off via
the Accessibility Options Control Panel.  Please note that while HC color
schemes are available for Windows NT 4.0, the High Contrast flag is not.
This is fixed in Windows NT 5.0 and is of course available on Windows 95 and
Windows 98.

Internet Explorer 3.x and 4.x do the following when this flag is turned on:

*Turn off the background bitmap
*Double the font size being used
*Ignore the page specified fonts, colors and font styles and use the
ones specified in the Colors and Font dialog box.

Response to David by JRG:
I think it would be difficult in some operating systems for
the browser to
know there is a screen reader, escpecially UNIX.  I think
that the browser
should have features that can support screen readers, but I
am not sure we
should require screen readers to be detected.  It is not
clear to me that
there would be a good consensus between screen reader
manufactures about
what the browser should do if it new there was a screen
reader present.
