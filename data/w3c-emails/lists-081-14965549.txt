There is no Reply-To address specified on this email list.  Normally list
servers send mail with the From: field correctly specified but the Reply-To
address contains the list address.

What this means is that email clients use the From address for replies and
as such, the mail goes to the sender and not to the list.  If you do a Reply
All, then the original sender gets two copies - the one directly from the
new sender and one from the list server.

The WAI lists have this problem, but the UACCESS-L from Trace does not and
all the other lists I subscribe to.  I believe it's an option with most list
server software, but I'm not familiar enough with them to know for sure.

Thanks,
