I've been interested in testing this concept.  Having a site where a
keyboard shortcut (or the first link on the page) that opens a navigation
window (in pop-up or the same page, user's choice).

I'm interested in seeing how sighted, keyboard, and blind/visually impaired
users respond to it.  This could also be done as a user preference for a
site, and users could choose to have the navigation on the page or offered
separately as I just mentioned, but it would be good to get some data from
users who might want to use this feature.

I'll mock something up and post a link to the list so people can give it a
try.  I'll put in a feedback form and post the results.
