options are always good.  I don't have a third way but it seems there
should be one.  I'd probably like to see the long desc automatically
effixed if immages are off but retain the d-link as is said for backward
compatability.
I also have some feeling and this seems contrary to what I said that I'd
like to be able to view the info on the graphic say long desc
independantly sometimes.  sometimes, I want to skip it, sometimes, I want
to come back to it.
sorry for the confusion.
