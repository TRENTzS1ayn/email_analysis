You can do this with Opera. Opera has three modes for
images:

  - Load and show images.
  - Show loaded images (missing images formatted 
    as the doc specified leading to more correct
    layout, but worse access to the alt text).
  - Do not show images (missing images formatted
    based on the alt text).

This feature is available for each independent 
window through button and keyboard.
