IE 4.0 does this quite nicely.   They also post a utility on their IE
website that lets you add a button to your address toolbar called
Toggle Images.exe

You'll find it at

http://www.microsoft.com/ie/ie40/?/ie/ie40/powertoys/main.htm

Install it. It is great.  You punch it and it will toggle images on
and off.  ( It would be nice if it automatically did a refresh command
at the same time,  but all you need to do is hit the refresh button
after you hit toggle and the images appear or disappear depending on
what you have images toggled to.)

The button is even in text so you can find it with your screen reader.

Note:  it usually installs the button way off to the right ... where
you have to scroll the toolbar to see it.  But you can just grab it
and drag it over to the left end of the  bar where it always shows.
