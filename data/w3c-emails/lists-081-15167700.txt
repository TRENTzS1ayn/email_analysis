JRGs response to Marja:
I think that your concerns are valid about ordering and that there should
be something in the guidelines about ordering.  In the short term the weak
solution is asking authors to put things in logical order.  This is weak
because it is dependent on the author to do the ordering.  Most authors
will not know it is important, or won't know how to do it with the tool
they are using to create WWW pages.  The stronger solution is probably
labeling of sections and have user agents recoginize some standard set of
"labels" that would be used to identify block level information.  Users
could use this to navigate to the sections of text they are interested in.
