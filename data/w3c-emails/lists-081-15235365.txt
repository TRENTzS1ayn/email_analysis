This is a reminder of the telecon tommorrow.  I will be updating the
guidelines at 4:00 CST today.  So please try to review them for tommorrow.
If you have not indicated that you will be participating please let me
know.  Currently there is plenty of space for people to join in, but if
alot of people join and I don't know about it we may exceed the 12 person
limit of the call.  The limit can be changed before the call, but not
during the call.  So let me know if you plan to join in.
