First, let me say that I am not trying to be a troublemaker here.  I am
only trying to help.  This topic may have been discussed many times on
this and other lists, but apparently the people that see my point didnt
make themselves clear or WAI was not (or could not be) in a position to
see it at that time.

As it should be.  No one can be an expert in the whole accessiblity
issue.

Understood.

And my point all along is that the USERS of at should be the ULTIMATE
input into the deliverables.  These suggestions from users CANNOT be
swept aside because it makes no sense in the current or future
development of standard website design.  I am a big proponent of
standards, but these standards MUST NOT compromise accessiblity,  they
must ENABLE
accessiblity.  This is a very tough thing to accomplish, granted, but
that is why WAI was founded.  Please dont give into the easy way out,
please keep in mind WHO BENEFITS from this activity.

Yes, it is a growing process.

We need to analyze what the problem REALLY is and not offer solutions
that suggest only one way of possibly correcting it while poo pooing
other ways without serious consideration of what problem is attempted to
be
corrected.

>If something is correct, let's make sure we know what it is.
I think a knowledge base system would be a great idea for this.
Something that can be updated and modified as we learn what works and
what doesnt.  Waiting for the next standard to go through the approval
procees in order to distribute this information causes a great delay and
many correct ideas may be forgotten by then.  The standards should
gather information from these knowledge bases when it comes time to
update the standards.  These knowledge bases should have many ideas on
how to solve many types of problems encountered.  A possible solution
should be included no matter how politically wrong it is.  Given that it
may be politcally wrong, it may not be perfect, but it plants a seed for
someone to improve upon.  Often with these lists, an initial idea comes
to light to address an issue.  This idea is "not quite right"
politically, it gets improved upon and built upon.  In the process of
improving the original idea, the original problem gets lost and the
"Correct" way of doing something solves a totally different problem than
what the original problem was.
