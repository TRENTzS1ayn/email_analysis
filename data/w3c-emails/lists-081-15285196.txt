In today's user agent teleconference there 
was a discussion regarding interaction between 
user agents and operating systems flags. This 
topic was discussed in the context of Windows
95, 98 and NT flags. For example if the "high
contrast" mode has been selected, should the browser
recognize this and automatically make adjustments.


Please correct me if I am wrong, but I 
I believe the question is whether
or not the user agents guidelines should 
recommend that browsers make use of OS flags 
or communicate is some way? 

Does this issue apply across operating systems?

Please comment.
