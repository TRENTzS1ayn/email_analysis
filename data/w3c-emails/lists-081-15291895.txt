Again, the following topic was discussed on today's
call in reference to the section of the guidelines
on presentation of objects. I have included this
section of the guidelines at the bottom of this
message.

Apparently, at least in Internet Explorer, 3 
situations can be encountered.

1. OBJECTS are turned off by the user
2. The OBJECT could not be found for whatever reason
3. The Object could be found, but user has turned off images

The user agent groups needs to come up with 
recommendations on how to present alt text,
longdesc, name, inner markup and title in 
each of these situations.

Comments?

Thanks,
Kitch


User selectable option is available to turn off 
the display of images and display the ALT text 
alternative for the image. Both the IMG and OBJECT
tags provide a means for displaying images in HTML
4.0. When the user turns off images the 
alternative text available should be rendered for the image. 


For the IMG tag there are two potential sources 
of alternative text information: ALT attribute
and NAME attribute if the image is part of a 
Anchor. The priority of presentation is the
ALT text and then NAME text. The entire alternative
text should be rendered no matter what the 
source of the text or the dimensions specified 
for the original image. 

For the OBJECT tag the image specified should not 
be displayed and any text associated with the 
inner most level of the OBJECT tag should be 
presented in place of the image. The text 
should be fully rendered, even if the 
dimensions of the image are smaller than
the dimensions specified for the image in the OBJECT.

In the absence of any alternative representation 
of the image the file name should be presented to
the user as the alternative representation.
