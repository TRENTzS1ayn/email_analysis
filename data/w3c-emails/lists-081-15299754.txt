You may have noticed that I have separated each
"topic of discussion" into separate messages,
even though there is certainly a good deal
of overlap on some of these issues.

This message is meant to stimulate some 
discussion regarding the presentation of
IMAGES.  Like OBJECTS, we need to come
up with guidelines for handling images
in different situations such as :

1. When IMAGE are turned off 
2. When IMAGES could not be found

Likewise we need recommendations for
implement alt, title, longdesc, etc.

Please correct me if I got this wrong
but one suggestion that came up during today's
call was that the D-link would be tab 
stoppable. That is, as a user tabs through
a page, images would receive focus as if it
were a link, the user would hit enter 
and be taken to the long desc.

A second suggestion was to use a 
a user activated script that would 
identify images on a page and if
a longdesc was available, present
it to the user. (Anyone on the
call might want to clarify this
I am not sure if I stated this
idea correctly.)
