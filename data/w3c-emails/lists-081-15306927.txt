One more topic for discussion based on today's call.

A question was raised about having browsers present
a structural view of the document and allowing users
to navigate through this view. The current statement in the
guideline appears at the end of this message. Current
browsers do offer access to some structural information
such as list of links. 

Questions include:

Does this assume that web pages are documents versus applications?

Will this feature improve access? If so how and to whom?

Is this type of navigation something that should be provided
by assistive technology?

If we include it as a recommendation, what priority 
should we give it?

User has the option to view information from 
selected tags in the currently loaded document. 
This provides a means for a user to quickly 
identify tags of interest on a page without needing 
to scroll through the entire page and in some cases
not being able to identify tags of interest due to 
the lack of tag information available on the screen 
or through assistive technology. For example headers
(H1-H6) would be a common alternative view for some
one to quickly view the major topics within a 
document. A keyboard/menu command is needed to 
change between the full and outline view of the 
document. Switching between the outline and full 
view would maintain a synchronized view between 
the two views of the document. The tags that are
displayed in the outline view should be selectable
selectable by the user and be primarily block level tags.
