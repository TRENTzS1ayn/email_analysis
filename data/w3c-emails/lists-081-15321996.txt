Can someone please clarify something for me.
In the guidelines presentation section we
have the following "recommendation" 

"User can adjust the highlight foreground 
and background colors used by the browser"

If the focus is on a link, is it safe to
assume the link would be highlighted?


I know IE 4, Opera, and possibly other 
browsers will allow you to prominently
change the look of links as you tab 
through them. In older versions of 
browsers it is often difficult to see
which link is selected is you don't
mouse over. I would like to see 
this feature make it into the guidelines
and I just want to make sure the term
highlight is the right word to use.

Or am I confusing two separate issues?
