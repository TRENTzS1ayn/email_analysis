Hi Chuck,

Here is the information about keyboard navigation in frames and the focus
following. Here are some URL that illustrates the problem:
http://web.inter.nl.net/users/wittingen-ede/genea/genealogie.html
Using tab you begin in the top left corner frame and move through the
alphabet. I chose "B", hit return to follow the link. The frame below the
alphabet square changes to reflect "B" names. If tab is hit again the focus
moves to "C", not the first name in the "B" list. To me, I would expect the
focus to follow the anchor to a new frame or new page. 

On the Microsoft page microsoft.com/java you can tab through the links to
get to the frame on the left side of the page. Activating any link brings
up an entirely new page with new frames so tabbing starts you over at the
top of the page again.
