I think this referes to browsers like webspeak that highlight text as it is
read or to let you know the current item on which the cursor rests.
Currently, you cannot change the highlight color in webspeak (I think it is
planned for a future release). The grapic browsers have the focus box but
there is no color change. Lynx changes the color of the link on which the
cursor sits. I don't know of a way to change the color.
