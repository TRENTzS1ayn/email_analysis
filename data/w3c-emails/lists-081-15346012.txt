I beleive there are 6 colors of importance:

1. Standard background
2. Standard foreground
3. Highlighted background (for selecting text and objects, typically with a
mouse)
4. Highlighted foreground (for selecting text and objects, typically with a
mouse)
5. Link not visited foreground
6. Link visited foreground

The highlight colors are important for 3rd part assistive technologies to
detect a user election for potential reading.  Usefull for keyboard
navigation, since highlight can be sed by 3rd party assistive technology to
detect the "focus".
