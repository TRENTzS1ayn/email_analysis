I wanted to make an attempt to point out one
issue that came up in many forms during today's
call - providing users with access to elements.

The following questions represent only a
small snapshot of the discussion, but
hopefully those of you who could make the
call today can add your thoughts.


1. Should user agents present users with a list
of elements?

2. Should there be keyboard commands to navigate
between non-link elements?

3. Should user agents provide focus to non-link
elements, so for example using keyboard 
commands someone can select and copy text
