The idea of temporary change is important because Web designers develop
situations that browsers cannot predict. Its best to give users clear, easy,
& varied navigation controls since the person using the computer is the most
intelligent part of the system. That occurred to me when frame follow
through was discussed. Once a link in 1 frame is picked having the browser
activate the updated frame is a good idea, except there are pages with no
need to change frames. Below is a discussion page URL where visitors pick
messages in the 2nd [upper right] frame which appear in the 3rd frame
http://winweb.winmag.com/bbs//win98/default.htm
There's little need to work in the lower frame unless there's a interesting
link in the message. Of course, screen readers must be told of new text.

Next is a 4 frame page where only frames 2 & 4 need visitor input
http://mateengreenway.simplenet.com
I'd like to see the big browser makers develop a keyboard command to switch
input focus between the 2 frames that use visitor input, once the visitor
determines which frames control navigation. Then the person using the
computer can use frame follow through or manually switch between 2 main
frames, whatever suits page layout.

Bryan
