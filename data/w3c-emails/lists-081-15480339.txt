Usage of ALT and TITLE:
       ALT: Image description.--- might be better as: "text replacing image".
       TITLE: Tool tip

  D. Alternative Representations for Video, Movies and Annimations
  
    1. [Priority 1]
       User selectable option is available to turn on audio descriptions
       of videoes, movies and annimations for videos.
    2. [Priority 1]
       User selectable option is available to turn on closed captioning
       of video, images and annimations.
---I'd like to be able to turn them on or off.

    3. [Priority 2]
       Extended document summary information is displayed on user
       command.
---we might consider changing this to priority one.

---as part of a brief summary appearing on the status line we might
consider it dynamic partly and include a percentage of page pointer
in text somehow.  this can be gotten from the scroll bar.

---I'd add a priority 1 to accessability menus to render all toolbars
in text. that may not be the place to put it but it is an alternative
menu view.
   
5. Compatibility with 3rd Party Assistive Technology

  A. Standard OS Controls/Menus/Dialog boxes
--- priority 1.  
   Using standard rather than custom controls in the designing browser
   applications increases the accessibility of the application. Third
   party assistive technology developers are more likely able to access
   standard controls than custom controls. If you must use custom
   controls review them for accessibility or check for controls that
   support Active Accessibility or the SUN Soft Accessibility API (see
   following sections).
   
  B. Microsoft Active Accessibility in Windows 95/NT versions.
  ---priority 2: lots of 3rd party access is going to be slow to impliment msaa 
   When developing new applications for Windows 95/NT build into the
   specifications and design active accessibility compatibility. This
   provides 3rd party asssistive technology with important information
   for accessibility about your program for persons using 3rd part
   assistive technology. More information on active accessibility can be
   found at [43]Microsoft WWW site on Active Accessibility.
   
  C. SUNSoft Java Accessibility API in Java Code
  
   When developing new applications using SUNSoft Java technology build
   into the specifications and design the use of the Java Accessibility
   API. This provides 3rd party asssistive technology with important
   information for accessibility, so persons with disabilities can use
   assistive technology to more efficiently access your programs. More
   information on Java Accessibility API can be found at [44]Java
   Accessibility Utilities.
