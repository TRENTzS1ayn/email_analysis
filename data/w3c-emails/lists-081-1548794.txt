I would be happy to host the knowledge base if the W3C has a problem with
suggesting politically incorrect solutions and/or constant changing of
documents without an approval routine.  I think the W3C's document
approval system is great, but this eliminates unwanted but valid solutions
to problems as stated above.  I am not trying to change the way W3C does
reccomendations.  I believe that the techniques of WAI are a good start,
but again, not very broad and only "approved" solutions are in there.
