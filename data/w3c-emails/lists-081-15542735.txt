Ian Jacobs is an editor with considerable experience in developing W3C
working drafts and recommendations, and he has made several excellent
suggestions for improving the UA working draft.  One of the overriding
comments was that the document needed better background and definition
information for referencing key terms and orienting users to the different
sections of the guideline.
 
The following is a new table of contents for the browser document:
1.0 Introduction
2.0 General Principles of accessible design
3.0 Assistive Technology
4.0 Parts of a Browser User Agent
5.0 Interaction with a document
6.0 CSS Support
7.0 Presentation
8.0 Orientation
9.0 Navigation
10.0 Visibility
11.0 Operating System Aceessibility Compatibility

Ian is currently setting up the documents to better handle revising the
document and tracking comments on issues that are rasied in the group.
This will take a few days to setup.  Anyone with any comments on the
guidelines structure is urged to speak up now, since there will be some
major changes in the dcoument over the next week.
