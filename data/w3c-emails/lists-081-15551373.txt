I think 2,3,4,5 (even though I don't know the exact content) could be
folded into one background section, so that people that *knows* about
this stuff can jump directly into the guideliens per se.

I'd like 6.0 to be more "Format Support" or "Standard Support",
something that would include more that just CSS, but also HTML, and
maybe more later.
I fact, it could include 11.0 and be a "Capability" section: support
html4, css, local os stuff, etc.
