Ok.

Yes, the latter sounds good. I brought up CSS explicitly
because 

(1) there are some guidelines that only make sense
    for UAs that implement CSS; these guidelines should be
    grouped together (at least I think for the moment, although
    experience will determine whether this organization works).

(2) there are concepts like "default values" that are well-defined
    in CSS (defaults cascade with author and user style sheets) and
    so a general term like "UA defaults" should be defined with
    the CSS meaning in mind, and should be consistent with it, even
    if the definition does not rely on the notion of style sheets.
