Hi all,

No this time TAB has nothing to do with keyboards. Its an almost universal,

This article is ripe with insight about disabled people using the Web &
computers that most browsers makers need to know so further enhancements
don't make the Web more difficult to use than have previous additions.
[Sorry Opera team, again this doesn't apply to you because have it covered
:-)] I dislike having to bring a note of discord to this group, but it is
disheartening to see Microsoft talk about accessibility since Win 95 is more
difficult to use via keyboard than is Win 3.1x, & IE well, I will not repeat
myself. I've gone through MS's Web site, & downloads, to find change ahead
to no avail. It seems odd to me that with so much else going into the Win OS
that the concerns of disabled people are left to other developers to service
via Active accessibility. If a MS person wants to send me a direct note I'd
me happy to read it or visit again. Despite my interest in outer space I'm
sure software doesn't develop well in a vacuum. 

Regards,
Bryan
