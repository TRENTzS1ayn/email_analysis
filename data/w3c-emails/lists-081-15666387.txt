Agenda
We need to release the WD soon (Wed morning?)to the Interest Group for
comment.  I would like primarily to go through the priorities of the
current WD items and see if we can get our #1 priorities down to about 10
items.   Other items related to wording and clarification can be noted for
an item, but we will not have time for discussion.
