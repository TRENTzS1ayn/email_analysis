What is a certified at specialist?  Tell us more about how you use the web?

Knowledge bases are good We have something resembling them from the 
development side called techniques documents for the guidelines.  These are 
ways of implementing the guidelines that have been tested and found to be 
good practice.

I'd like to extend the discussion of end users a bit.  At the risk of 
appearing to slight someone, I will say that this is not meant to harm but 
to perhaps explicate.  There are ways to get end user data from those who do 
not have the ability to readily provide that data due to a lack of 
understanding of the processes envolved in what they do or for some other 
reason.  There are end users who can readily provide information from their 
experiences as input to the process.  We tend to gravitate toward working 
with the latter as data from the former can be expensive to retrieve and 
make usefull.  End users in the second category and I am sure that this is a 
continuum and I may be over simplifyin this often learn from their 
interactions with developpers so that the bar can be raised in the quality 
of their use.  This can help fascilitate the process for all the stake 
holders since it both provides a mechanism for moving forward at least 
somewhat and helps to ensure continued accessibility.

Yes,  thank you for this response!  I would be interested in helping
anyway I can with the new WCAG guidelines.  I would be interested in what
you think of the knowledge base idea.

-Steve, (a user and VERY soon to be a certified AT Specialist)

ps: note the user before the specialist.
