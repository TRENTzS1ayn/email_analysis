I'm wondering a couple of things.  are some of the #1s duplicated (sorting
through them now), and some of the #2s seem 1ish
perhaps we need a 1.5? <sheepish grin>
I would still like to see some form of notification as to relative
position on a page in focus much like in a text document processor.
it might be best expressed in percentages like at the fith link, the
statusline might have a little 30% on it.  that assumes that the fifth
link appears 30% down the page or through the pge.  This tells me that
there is 70% of the page left to traverse.  it is much like what we see at
the top of the page using lynx where it says page 5 of 30 or some such.
