In our telecon it was discussed that the OBJECT element needs a LONGDESC
attribute, just like the IMG element.  The main reason is that the user may
want both the OBJECT and the LONGDESC information.  In the current
structure the user can only have one or the other using the OBJECT nesting
structure.   Another reason is that the OBJECT nesting will be used to
provide alternative representations of the function and most time this will
probably be: "get a browser that can render this object".  This will also
provide a more consistant implementation of images since both IMG and
OBJECT will have LONGDESC atttributes.

What do you think?
