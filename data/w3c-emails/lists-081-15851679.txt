noise is not tolerated (library, cubicles area, when children are asleep
etc.), people with wi-reless devices, people whose hands are tied or
concentration is low (e.g. driving a car) etc. etc. This would emphasize
the benefits to almost everyone in some environment.

JRG: good point.  I will send this item to the Page Authoring group
developing the central document.

>This was discussed already. I just would like to clarify my suggestion of
allowing the users create cus-tomized switch sets (e.g. a window with check
boxes where fonts, images, colors, tables etc. are selec-ted or turned
on/off/leave as is) these sets can then be named and presented as buttons
or menu items. When a button is selected it activates the switches and
selections unless they are "leave as is". Some readymade definitions could
be available for instance only text or only sound button. This would allow
users a way to easily change the attributes they wish in bundles that suit
them.

JRG: I will add a section under visibility for a configuration section of
the browser for persons with disabilities.

shouln't we be able to turn these on and off also and display the
alternative text or longdesc instead? I guess the type of an OB-JECT tells
if it is an image or something else.

JRG: This primarily relates to synchronous descriptions as images change on
the screen and is described through an audio file.  This can be done using
the SMIL specification. 

>3. Provide a serialized view of tables
>This could be more flexible. At least the user should be able to toggle
between rows first/columns first serialization. The summary of the table
should probably be a switch too that can be turned off and on.

JRG: These requests seem to be dependent on the table purpose.  The user
will probably not know what they want until they read the table.  This will
require the browser to reload the table with a different format.

JRG:  I don't think we need to specify this.  But, we could say for the
duration the browser is running.

JRG: There will only be a TAB stop if the image is a link.

JRG:  It could be a separte window.  Or could be an alternative view of the
document.  Is there a reason to be more specific in the implementation?

commands rather than forcing everybody to use them?

JRG: The primary reason to display short cuts is to make them more visible
to able bodied persons, so if they help somebody with a disability they may
be aware of the keyboard short cuts.
