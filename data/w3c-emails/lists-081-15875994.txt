JRG: Interesting idea, I will add it to the issues page.  This may tie into
the current labeling of LONGDESC with class or rel.

JRG: I think there is a consensus that file names are bad and I believe
TITLE is listed as an alternative source now.

JRG: Could you write up a guideline that says what you think it should say
using scope and headers?  For navigation row and col info should be put on
the status line.

JRG: No this is a problem with the link or control that has the focus not
curently being in view window of the document.  People using Page down may
change the view but the control with the focus is still at the top of the
page out of view.  When they use the TAB key to move to the next control
the view abruptly changes to the top of the page.

JRG: It is no longer a priority #1.  It is useful for people with visual
impairments to get some info about the document.

JRG: I think this item needs some work.  I think the intent is that the
user be able to get information about what an element is (Header, list
item, para...) and also if the element can respond to an event.  I am not
sure the working reflects the goal or how non link and conrol elements
would get the focus.

JRG: The title here refers to the title in the HEAD of the document, not in
an image.  I will make that clearer in the document.

JRG: We are recommending the implementation of the outline property in
CSS2.  WHich would provide a means to do these things.

JRG: I agree and it has been changed.

JRG: none of these items can currently receive the focus

JRG: The element text content (this may be a problem) or ALT text would be
used along with the event that is associated with the element.
