   Where is the user in the document?
   
   This question pertains mainly to visually-impaired users, since
   sighted users have the benefit of the proportional scrollbar thumb,
   which is now standard on all major platforms. A possible solution for
   visually-impaired users would be to associate the position of the user
   in a document with the "amount" of the document that has already been
   presented to them. For example, indicating to a user that s/he is one
   third of the way through a document, indicates that there is roughly
   twice as much information in the document as they have already
   "viewed". This idea would be of value even when users moved through
   the document without reading it.
*dp* the percentage as text available would be even more exact.  this is
something like the <more> view of text documents.
if this is presently integrated in the guidelines, I appologizing for
rehashing it.
