Comment 2:

where it says

    1. [PRIORITY 1]
       Allow the user to turn on audio descriptions of sound, videos,
       movies, and animations. This would set a flag ...

I suggest that you clarify the set of user choices and align them
as closely as you can in good conscience with the predefined "test
variables" in the SMIL specification.  Link from this document to
that document as well.
