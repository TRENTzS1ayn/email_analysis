Major leap?  Ah, I fear you may have read more than what I wrote.

What I said was:

In the Browser guidelines it talks about passing a flag to a
multimedia player to cue the display of captions.  In section 4.4
of the SMIL spec it talks about responding to such flags.  I said
it would be a good idea to check this definition of the flag(s)
against that definition and try to align the UA discussion of
such flags with the flags defined there.  And do the hypertext
thing of making the reference a link.

This does not tie HTML players to being SMIL players.  But they
should, subject to approval by the WAI-UA working group, signal
with the same user preference flags.
