Nir:
WAI user agent guidlines may apply to browers which do not
support stylesheets. For those who support stylesheets, this 
requirement is indeed trivially satisfied.

Nir:
A user may want to know if an image is a link or not. Also he may 
want to know what is the active frame for scrolling with the 
keyboard or printing. (These requirments too may be achieved with
stylesheets.)

I think we all agree that good support for CSS2 makes a browser 
more user friendly and improves accessibility.
For example a user may override practically all presentational elements:
E.g.,

FONT {font-family: inherit;
      font-size: inherit;
      font-color: inherit;}
      
but still the UA guidelines specify these explicitely.
