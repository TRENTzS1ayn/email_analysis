Good LINKs in the HEAD would be better, especially since they're already
supported by many browsers (though not the Big Two).  For example,

<LINK rel="Prev Chapter" href="chapter1.html" title="Chapter 1 of Foo">
<LINK rel="Next Chapter" href="chapter3.html" title="Chapter 3 of Foo">
<LINK rel="Contents" href="contents.html" title="Foo Table of Contents">
<LINK rel="Chapter" href="chapter4.html" title="Chapter 4 of Foo">
<LINK rel="Chapter" href="chapter5.html" title="Chapter 5 of Foo">

Then UAs can present the list of links without loading the entire document
or having to parse through all A elements.
