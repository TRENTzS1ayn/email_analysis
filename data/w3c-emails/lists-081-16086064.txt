Hi,

I have a few comments to the current ua draft. 

First the word Agent is used instead of browser, does this indicate
an awareness of the fact that much development will make it possible
to surfe from small pocket phones, televisionsets and other devices
than standard computers? and will it be possible to make such devices
compliant with these recommendations? 

The following to paragraphs 4.5 and 6.2 seem to be saying almost the
same, especially because the alternative view gives the user the
possibility to perform the navigation in the structure.

  4.5 Alternative Views of a Document
  
    1. [PRIORITY 2]
       Allow the user to identify quickly the important [95]elements of a
       page. For example, when used properly, header elements (H1-H6) may
       be used to create an outline of major topics. The user should be
       able to select headers in the outline view, causing the
       corresponding locations in the main view to be displayed.
       If the browser provides more than one [96]view, the user should be
       able to toggle between the full and outline view of the document.
       Selections between views should be synchronized.

  6.2 Hierarchical Navigation
  
    1. [PRIORITY 2]
       or [PRIORITY 3]
       Allow the user to use the keyboard to navigate a hierarchical or
       outline representation of the document. Highlight the focus within
       the hierarchy in a way that is compatible with third-party
       assistive technology (see section on [107]compatibility). The user
       should be able to use keyboard commands to navigate, expand or
       contract the hierarchy. The hierarchy should be based on
       structural block level elements like H1-H6, UL, OL, etc.
