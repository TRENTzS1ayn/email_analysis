What's wrong with:

<OBJECT title="Web Design Group Logo" data=wdg.gif>
  The Web Design Group. <A href=wdg.htm rel=dlink>D</A>
</OBJECT>

To get more specific, we could also advocate using

<OBJECT title="Web Design Group Logo" data=wdg.gif>
<PARAM name="longdesc" value="wdg.htm">
  The Web Design Group
</OBJECT>

But I don't think we need a new attribute on OBJECT.
