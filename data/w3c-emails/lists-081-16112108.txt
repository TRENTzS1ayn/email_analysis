It's just a more cryptic version of

<OBJECT title="Web Design Group Logo" data=wdg.gif>
  The Web Design Group. <A href=wdg.htm rel=dlink>Long description</A>
</OBJECT>

which forces the user to recognize "The Web Design Group." as an object
with a visual description.  Many users (i.e., me) would prefer when
browsing non-visually to be given a completely non-visual page.  The notion
of some text actually being an image is an unnecessary distraction for
these users.

I think the universal applicability of a long description would make
LONGDESC as useful on OBJECT as some of its other attributes like TYPE or
WIDTH, which could also be specified using the PARAM element.  However, I
do like the way that your use of PARAM allows the user to choose exactly
how he or she wants to deal with objects, without forcing the concept of a
visual page on the user.  Using PARAM for the long description would be a
great interim solution, or a good second-best if the idea of LONGDESC on
OBJECT is rejected.
