MP: I'm sorry, I shouldn't be interrupting this conversation...but again, I
really think that too many assumptions regarding user needs are implied
when statements like, "many users (i.e., me) would prefer" are made. It's
true that accessibility is not an exclusive term to people with
disabilities. But it's also true that unless someone actually does
usability studies around web content, its creation, retrievable and
delivery mechanisms, no one can honestly assume what a user really needs.
