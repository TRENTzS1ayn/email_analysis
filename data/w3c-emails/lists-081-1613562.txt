I know Cynthia checks for an Accessibility report and/or a site map by
parsing a text string of your choosing (under Settings, Accessibility Rules
Settings...).

You could customise this to look for a string of text pointing to the
Privacy policy.

I'm running AccVerify DS2 by HiSoftware Inc

Hope this helps

Subject:    Validator with check for Privacy Policy



Hi,

I saw some sort of validator a while back that also checked the site had a
privacy policy.  Can anyone please refresh my failing memory on this?
