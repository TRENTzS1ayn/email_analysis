WAI UA Teleconf
Date: 11 June, 11 am - 12 pm EST

Present:

Harvey Bingham
Kitch Barnicle
Marja-Riitta Koivunen 
Ian Jacobs (Chair/Scribe)

Ian discussed process of preparing a public working draft (Director
 acknowledgment, publicity stuff, freezing of document known to 
 WG several days before).

- Comment on http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA: careful about table (inaccessible).
- Fix bug in mktoc

Kitch: Note on 6.3. What does this guideline mean exactly?

Discussion of distinction between "abstract" guidelines 
 (e.g., give user control of presentation) and those
 related to user interface (e.g., tab through links).

Discussion of implementation-free guidelines, such as
"Show percentage of document read" versus "Show it in the title bar".
(e.g., 5.4)

Marja: Consistency across UA interfaces would be good. 

Kitch: But NN and IE differ even on bookmarks, unfortunately.

Marja: Give user possibility of selecting different types of
    information (e.g., number of page in a set of documents, or
    percentage within a page, etc.) Customized status information.
    
Ian: But what's important for accessibility?

5.3.1: What are structural elements? Headers, links.

Harvey: What about images? This could be helpful information to
someone to know if the document might be problematic.

Kitch: Have you seen page checker from NIST?
     [See http://www.nist.gov/webmetrics]
  And in particular:
     [http://zing.ncsl.nist.gov/~webmet/sat/websat-process.html]


Ian: combine both 5.3.1 and 5.3.2
Marja: On user request more important.

What does 5.4 mean? Needs more explanation. Don't mention "status
line" (implementation).

Harvey: Fix links to central.htm#INTRO.Profiles

Ian: Not broken. PAGEAUTH points to the same location. 

Marja: Create an independent document for the intro sections
 on accessibility.
