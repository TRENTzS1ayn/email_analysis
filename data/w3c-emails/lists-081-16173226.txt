The next face to face meeting of WAI Accessibility groups will be in
PeterBorough, UK on July 24-25th.
Additional information can be found at:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/1998/07/agenda

I encourage all to attend that can make the meeting.  Eventhough the UA
working group will not be meeting it is important to coordinate our efforts
with the other WAI working groups.
