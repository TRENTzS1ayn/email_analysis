Do we need to say something about the accessibility of on-line
documentation? The current draft makes reference to having materials
available in alternative formats. But should we say that on-line help
systems should follow the page authoring guidelines?

Also, the systems that display the help can also be accessible.

Both Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer use HTML for help, yet, the
relative accessibility between the two systems are vastly different.  Our
HTMLHelp engine has a few problems with accessibility that we are working
on.
