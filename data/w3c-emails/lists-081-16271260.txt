Then maybe instead of putting the entire online documentation under the
umbrella of providing it in plain text, it should just be those parts
relating to accessibility?

There may be a Catch-22 here.  Who is the documentation of the
Web client for?  Someone who doesn't fully understand how to
use the Web client.  To be fit for use by the intended audience,
maybe the Web client documentation should not be hidden behind
the Web client UI?

The standards for the user's safety net are appropriately more
severe [as regards accessibility] than the standards for general
Web literature.  Just as fire escapes have to be more fireproof.
