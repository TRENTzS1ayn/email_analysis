I would want to hear how David feels about this.  

However, for myself, I would be inclined to believe that it could
be a subset.  While this subset is correlated with the
accessibility features, that is not exactly how I would frame it.

I would look at learning the UI as a progressive learning
experience and frame a bootstrapping sequence which prioritizes
skills.  One can probably isolate a core set of skills that
ensures you can manage the rest of the course materials.  The
first bit of the course needs to be extremely robust to be sure
to get everyone on board the lifeboat.

That is an area where Microsoft has scored big with the general
audience: the first step is _not_ a big one.  But it may be
necessary to walk through "the first step" in _several_ different
adaptive-tech modes to be sure that the ease of getting started
is there for everyone.

That is how it strikes me.

PS: a very accessible, access-smart installer is on my Christmas
list.  That seems to be one of the process steps where
independence goes right out the window.
