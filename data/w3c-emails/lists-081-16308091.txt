I agree here, but there are certain types of learning that compell one to
have a "book" available as they work through the steps to using a product.
If the subset approach is taken, it would have to include more than just
the accessability features to help beginners get off the ground as al
pointed out.  A side benefit to putting the whole thing in plain text is
that it would provide a chance to see if it relly reads the way it should.
Often, we do things differently for the html (hypertext environment), then
we would for text which can cause disastrous results for the reader.  We
actually, I am willing to forgo the ease of using the html during the
reading of the text document just to get a handle on what's there and how
it works.  I'll use the hypertext to click where I'm told to go for this
and that much better once I already know where I'm going.
so not to put to fine a point on it, if you put it in plain text and
review it from that standpoint, you may decide to change the hypertext
version because of things that jumpped out at you while reading the text
version.  Considder the following:
"the brown fox Jumpped over the (click here).".
Thanks!
