Perhaps the idea below should take the form of an automatic message
generated to the author of a site with a link to an url that explains the
benefits of compliance?  Often a site developper is just getting round to
understand the intricacies of a new format or a new revission of an old
one as is the current condition.

Annother stab at this is automatic vallidation when errors of this nature
are detected with the results sent to the author or developper.  Often
though it might not be possible to asscertain who that might be <grin>
