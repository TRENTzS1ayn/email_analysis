The UA working group will be meeting at Peterborough.  An agenda for the
meeting is being put together and will be released in the next few days.  The
agenda will be based on the issues list posted on our WWW site:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/wai-ua-browser-issues.html

Please note there is an updated agenda available for the WAI meetings in 
Peterborough, UK, on July 24 and 25. It is available at 
http://www.w3.org/WAI/1998/07/agenda.html
The Peterborough meeting will include meetings of the following WAI groups:
- WAI Interest Group 
- WAI Education and Outreach Working Group 
- WAI User Agent Guidelines Working Group 
- WAI Page Author Guidelines Working Group 
- WAI Evaluation and Repair Interest Group (forming) 
- WAI Protocols and Formats Working Group (members and invited experts only)
Please note that this represents a change from the preliminary agenda where 
the Authoring Tools working group was scheduled to meet, and the User Agent 
Working Group was not.
Registration deadline is Friday, June 26. Early registration (before June 
26th) is appreciated. The registration form is linked from the agenda page.
Hotel and venue information is linked from the agenda page as well. Please
