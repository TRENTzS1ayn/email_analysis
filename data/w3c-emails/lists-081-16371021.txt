Date: June 18, 1998

Thank you and congratulations to members of this Working Group, and to Jon
Gunderson, the Chair.  

I am pleased to announce that the W3C today released the first public
Working Draft of the "WAI Accessibility Guidelines: User Agent."

The W3C/WAI looks forward your continued involvement to move this towards a
Proposed Recommendation and eventually a W3C Recommendation.

The press release is available at http://www.w3.org/Press/1998/WAI-UAGL in
English and Japanese.

The Working Draft is available at http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-WAI-USERAGENT.

Regards,

Judy Brewer
