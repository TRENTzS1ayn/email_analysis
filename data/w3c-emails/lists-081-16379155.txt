The current UA Working Draft states that 'In the case of the APPLET
element, the values of the "alt" or "title" attributes (in order of
preference) should be used.' [1]  Why not use the content of the APPLET
element first, since it is not limited to plain text (as with "alt" and
"title")?

(From an author's point of view, the "alt" attribute is useless on APPLET
since all browsers except HotJava make the sensible choice to use the
content of the APPLET element as an alternative to the applet.)
