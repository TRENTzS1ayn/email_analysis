AccVerify has customised reports that can check for privacy policy settings
- you can download some sample reports from the HiSoftware site.

Beware though that it is not the easy solution that you may think - indeed I
have found the software in general to need a whole host of tweeking and
bespoke extras adding to it in order to release its full potential.
Hopefully HiSoftware will improve these aspects in forthcoming editions - it
aint cheap - its got great potential (used wisely of course) - but the
interface and many of the reporting options are not geered towards
delivering the information that you might expect (indeed demand).

Hi,

I saw some sort of validator a while back that also checked the site had a
privacy policy.  Can anyone please refresh my failing memory on this?
