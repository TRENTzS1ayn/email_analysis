Internet Explorer 4 provides a sound notification when the page is in a
state that can be navigated.  The entire page may not be downloaded, but
enough of it has to allow navigation.

This sound event is called "End Navigation" and can be set to whatever sound
file you choose by the Sounds Control Panel.

IE4 users can also go to the add-on page and download the "IE Sounds Pack"
to automatically set the "Begin Navigation" and "End Navigation" sounds.

Subject: sound notification when browser is not working 



Hi,

I would like to have a new topic discussed for the guidelines the
possibility of getting some other feedback than a visual one when the
browser is not working. Both Netscape and IE has a visual indication
of the fact that the browser is working retreiving data. This is of
course of little practical use if the browser is working fine, but
when it takes minutes to download a page, or when the browser hangs
for one reason or another, it would be nice to be able to get a kind
of notification. The obvious idea is that the user through an option
can turn on sounds and some beeps will be used to indicate that the
browser is working.

There are many other visual indications that it could be
interesting to get in other ways, examples could be if a page is
loaded from the cash or retreived from the net, and also some of the
new pluggins that make it possible to pay for information retreived
from the web uses visual indication of the fact that you pay for
following a link. But the only thing to do about all these situations
would be a general statement indicating that such information should
be available in different ways.
