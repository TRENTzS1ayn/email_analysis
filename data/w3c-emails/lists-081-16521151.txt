They are defined there, but not well. I will improve the clarify
of the definitions.

It is likely that if this usage is "standardized" by a W3C
Recommendation,
this usage will be recorded in some future version of HTML. However, 
even in HTML 4.0, the listed values for rel/rev are only informative,
i.e.,
we put the list in the specification to capture current practice.

I'm glad this comment was useful. As this document evolves, I hope the
distinction will be clearer and that the guidelines will be organized
along this line.

Ok.

I believe people will be able to achieve this with SMIL (see
the new W3C SMIL Recommendation).

I'll get more feedback from the Working Group.

I'll get clarification from the WG.

I don't know that it's more important. However, it's more reliable. With
style sheets, you can position content anywhere on the screen. Choosing
source
order means that consistent numbering is more likely.

Of course, using the CSS style 'display:none' on a link means it won't
be rendered at all, so source order doesn't ensure 100% consistency
either.

Good point. The guidelines attempt to be implementation-independent as
much
 as possible.

Ok.

And thank you for your comments. I'll raise your points with the
Working Group.
