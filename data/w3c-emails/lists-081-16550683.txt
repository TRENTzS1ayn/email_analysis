And on the Lynx side, for current information please start at
http://lynx.browser.org/

The University of Kansas, with leadership from Michael Grobe,
released Lynx under the GNU Public Licence a number of years
back.  While Kansas remains active as a distribution site, most
new code since then has come from others.
