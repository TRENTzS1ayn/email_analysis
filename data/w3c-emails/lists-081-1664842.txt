Hello All:

First HiSoftware Validators that can test for specific and custom privacy
policies. Second this is not marketing - it is an answer re our products.
And there are tons of "Free" "No Strings" Stuff here :)

HiSoftware Online Tester: Exact Quality Requirements testing
http://www.hisoftware.com/accmonitorsitetest/ 

Test for Privacy, Searchability, Accessibility, Etc.... Give it a spin it is
free :) 

Something free (and good) from a P3P perspective (Free is good ;))
http://www.hisoftware.com/access/valueaddp3p.html 

Download it try it out, learn about p3p and use it...It is Free. 

AccVerify:

Will test for all the above and I believe the DS2 Series is the easiest to
use and "Still" The Most Powerful on the market.

Check out the DS2 Enhancements

Ease of Use: hmmmmmmmmm check it out a short video will also answer this
check out the interaction builder (part of AccVerify in Action)
http://www.hisoftware.com/support/InteractionBuilder.htm


Of Course AccMonitor will handle privacy:

Our Solution for Online Accessibility will handle privacy:
http://www.hisoftware.com/SOA/Index.html

But With privacy and Accessibility as well I would suggest talking to one of
our experts on deciding what is best: 888.272.2484 or 1.603.229.3055. And
watch for my new book "Understanding Content and Site Quality" Due out from
HiSoftware Publishing in about 45 days
