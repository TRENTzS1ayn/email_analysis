I would like to welcome you to the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative User
Interface working group.  Currently WAI is reviewing the current set of
accessibility guidelines for WWW page design, which have ramifications for
Authoring Tools and Browsers.  I would like you all to look at the page
author guidelines and send any comments to the page author guidelines
working group.  The page author guidelines can be found at:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WD-WAI-PAGEAUTH-0130.html

In addition a draft of the User Interface Guidelines is available at:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/UI/wai-browser-gl.html

The charter of the User Interface group is also at:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/UI/charter.txt

I have already received some comments on the UI guidelines document.
Please review these documents and send comments to the UI list. 

I would also like everyone to write a short paragraph about their
background and movitation for participating in the group, or submit the URL
to their personal home page.  This informaiton along with the other
informaiton will be put on the WWW as part of our WWW site, so people can
get to know each other better.  It will also be a good reference for new
people entering the group in the future.  Just send the paragraph or URL to
the UI list.

So, there are 3 tasks.
Task 1. Review the current page guidelines. 
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WD-WAI-PAGEAUTH-0130.html

Task 2. Read the current charter and draft user interface guidelines.
http://www.w3.org/WAI/UI/wai-browser-gl.html
http://www.w3.org/WAI/UI/charter.txt

Task 3. Submit a short papragraph on your background and motivation for
participation. and/or a URL to your personal home page.  

Look forward to working with all of you!  Please submit you questions,
ideas, problems and solutions to the list for discussion.  This is a new
list so feel free to ask questions and we need to be patient with each
other as we get to know each other.  We will be organizing a conference
call in the next few weeks.
