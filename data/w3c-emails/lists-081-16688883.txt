Hi everyone,

As much as I hate talking about myself, I honored Jon's request and 
added a few paragraphs about my background to a web page at
www.interport.net/~kitch/kitch.html .  The short version is that I work 
part time at the American Foundation for the Blind, my undergraduate
degree is in biomedical engineering, and I am currently doctoral student 
in Health and Behavior Studies at Columbia University. I am interested 
in human-computer interaction and I will be conducting a usability 
study of GUI interface elements from the perspective of speech
users.  I hope that I can offer a contribution to this group as it 
addresses the user interface needs of individuals with visual
 impairments. My colleagues at AFB will also be playing a 
significant role in supporting my participation in this group.

On a side note, I thought that if I were going to refer people to my
 web page I should make an effort to update the page using the 
latest page authoring guidelines. I thought that I could review 
guidelines, use the guidelines, and begin to get myself up to speed 
in preparation for participating in this working group. Needless to
 say, it quickly turned into an ordeal even though my page is 
basically a text-only list of links to conferences and articles. 
So I quickly realized that I have a lot to learn and things aren't
as always simple as they seem. 

I look forward to working with all of you.

Kitch
