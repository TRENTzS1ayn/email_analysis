Hello Jon And all,
In 1982, I began an earnest experience with computers that talk.  In 1991,
I began to work in the field of assistive technology and have come to know
and enjoy the benefits that connectivity can bring.  I am blind since
birth and the computer revolution for us opened a whole new world for me
to explore and work in.  My interest in the process in which we are about
to participate stems in part from my work with the WAI interest group and
the WAI working group which I was honored to be a part of.  Using numerous
browsers, web authoring tools  and interfaces, I hope to bring to this and
other groups some ideas for moving forward with our goals and also to
learn.
Thank you!
