Hi!

I am the CEO of Opera Software. We make the Web browser Opera.
I have a special interest in making the Internet acessable.
I believe that the Internet is a tremendous oportunity to make
things better. It started off great with the original standards
and now we just need to continue making progress.

We try our best to make the Opera browser as accessable as 
possible and users in the beta group include two guys that
use headwands on their head to access the computer and some
user with no or limited vision. They give us great feedback
on how to improve our product. I hope that being part of this
group will give us even more great ideas and hopefully we
can contribute with a few as well.
