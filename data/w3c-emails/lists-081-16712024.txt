I have placed a draft checklist for usability features for Browers at:
http://www.w3c.org/WAI/UI/wai-browser-cl.html

Please review the list as a basis of discussion.  The list is going to be
used for looking at accessibility of the Amya browser in a telephone
meeting monday.  So people who are going to be a part of that discussion,
please review the checklist.
Thanks,
Jon
