Chuck,

Jon will be setting up conference calls for the WAI UI Working Group, which
you're on, and you'll get notice of the meetings.  

The call he referred to in his note is a preliminary meeting between Amaya
staff & WAI staff, in which a few of the WAI WG chairs will be
participating for issue identification.  He'll bring issues from that
meeting to the UI Working Group as needed.

- Judy
