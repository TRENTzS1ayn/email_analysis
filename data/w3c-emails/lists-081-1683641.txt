You could probably use JavaScript. I haven't used frames in a few years 
so the syntax may be off, but it would be something like this:

onclick="return 
!(top['frameName'].document.getElementById('anchorId').focus());"

Leave the regular target and href value that you already have in the 
link. If the JavaScript doesn't work (or is disabled or unavailable), it 
will return true and the regular HTML link will work. If JavaScript is 
on, it will focus the right spot without reloading the frame.

Note: The source files of both frames should be on the same web server 
or you may get a security warning.

Good luck,
James Craig
