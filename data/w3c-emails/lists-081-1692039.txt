Actually, lots of things about frames are good - unfortunately there 
are a few architectural problems with them.

In this case I would rely on the users. In common setups like IE/Jaws 
the users will be able to move between frames as a function of the user 
agent. In systems that don't present all the frames (Lynx, Amaya, etc) 
the user will be offered a choice of which frame they want to see (so 
they can choose the navigation frame, or the content frame, or 
whatever), or they can just work with the noframes version.

Cheers
