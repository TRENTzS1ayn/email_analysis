Hi Chaas et al,

     Just a quick note that there is a company that is making a signing
type captioning to distance ed classes.   There seems to be still
many problems with it, but it is pretty far along.   I cant remember
the facts off the top of my head but will look into it.

     The video phone piques my interest being an old telecom software
engineer. <sigh>   True the bandwith with the new 3G networks will
support the video streaming.  However, I doubt that compression would
be a viable solution for mobile phones as that is a very consuming
process.  I wouldnt worry too much about compression and go with the
full signal at maybe a reduced resolution.  I would also be wary of
reducing the frames/second too as you may lose some subtle movements
that may be key.  And now that I touched on visual information, I
think signing in person is preferable than aviators for a couple of
reasons:

   1) Signing is more than just the hand signals, there is body language,
lips being read, etc to help fill in the total communication.

   2) In using aviators, where would you store the avaitors to send?  You
will build up a huge collection very quickly.  My thinking is that
avaitors would be similar to PECS symbols in AAC.


Sorry to be a bit on the negative side, just wanted to head off anyone
spending too much time on this without those thoughts.  I DO like your
idea Chaas and will look for that company/product.

-Steve
