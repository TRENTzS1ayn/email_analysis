This is scary.

How much have you talked to blind Web users?

I fear that asking volunteer evaluators to undergo the hardship
of wrestling with a web form will radically restrict your ability
to tap their knowledge.  Please reconsider.  Seriously search for
a sponsor for the phone time to talk to your respondents instead.
Or at least prominently offer a plain-text email option for the
web form.

The bibliography in the Page Author Guidelines is a good start.

Maryvonne Lumley <maryv@minster.cs.york.ac.uk> did a similar
study seeking understanding of colour effects in web sites by a
rather ambitious web contstruction.  You might check to see how
she fared.

You may have done the following already; here is my checklist for
things you should have done before you set the scope of your
investigation and decide the clinical details of how you will
collect data.

- spend some time in the lab with people using adaptive
technology to browse the web

- interview a few expert computer and web access evaluators
such as
Patrick Burke <burke@ucla.edu>
Neal Ewers <ewers@trace.wisc.edu>
Kelly Ford <kford@teleport.com>
