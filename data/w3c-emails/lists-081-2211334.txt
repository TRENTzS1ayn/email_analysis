Oh, goody. A cross-post, and one whose topical appropriateness is probably
already in question, regardless of where it appears!

S. Dolloff said (in the email to which Kynn is responding):

First, I am not a "Disabled Person," I am a person with a disability. If
you use my name, that should be capitalized, not my "Physical Condition."

It was having a physical condition -- WHATEVER it's called -- being
capitalized for which I expressed the opinion it's unnecessary and might
even suggest to some a distinction is being made which no one intended and
no one needs. If this body can debate ad nauseum the purpose or phrasing of
TITLE or SUMMARY or OBJECT, I feel perfectly justified in addressing an
issue of personhood when it is introduced in the same forum.

SD::
I neither require, nor seek, your applause. Please tell me how I might have
phrased my entire email differently that you would not have so totally
misunderstood its intent.

SD::
Indeed, you are speaking from a non-disabled perspective. As I recall, this
thread began when someone mentioned her desire to hear from disabled people
on the Internet.

I might suggest you become more attentive when listening to the people
whose cause you are "championing" then.
