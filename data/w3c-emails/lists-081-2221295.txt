Wanted you to see an email that came across the WAI lists today. (He
cross-posted it, no less!) This is from Kynn Bartlett, the guy who asked me
to join the HWG Governing Board. My reply to him follows in the next send.

Except that terms like this, especially when dealing with cross-
cultural issues -- one person in England, one person in the U.S.
-- rarely mean the same thing to the same people.

I think that worrying about specific terms distracts us from
realizing that we're on the same side and share common goals
here; it's possible that the original poster's culture could have
lead her to use a term that's completely appropriate and fine, but
which may offend you.  These things happen -- and in general, I
feel it's best to look beyond the particular terms and instead
focus on greater issues, especially if we understand what she
meant.

On the other hand, there are a lot of people who _are_
physically disabled, blind, handicapped, whatever you want to
call it, who _can't_ use the web or the net.  The vast majority
of them aren't online, in fact.

For a sighted person to get on the net -- like me -- it's
pretty easy; go to Fry's, buy a computer system for $1200,
plug and play, and hey, I'm surfing the net within hours. 
Someone who is blind doesn't have it nearly that easy.  There
are many more steps necessary before a non-sighted person can
surf as easily as I can.

There are some of you who have done it -- who have taken the
technical steps and financial steps and logistical steps
necessary to put yourself on the web.  And that's _great_, and
I applaud you for it.  Years ago, when getting on the net
wasn't so easy, I had to use crusty old Apple //s to dial
up into a unix system; those hurdles were a lot larger than
the very minor ones facing today's sighted newbie.

However, the newbies -- sighted or not -- may be the very people
who we need to study.  The ones who are NOT able to use the
net now; the ones who don't think they can do it or get
access to it.  Not those of us who have already figured out our
own adaptations for whatever obstacles we faced.

Ahhh, here we have a slight contradiction. :)  You see, this
is the kind of reasoning which I'm supporting -- contacting the
people who aren't experts -- but in my mind, any blind or
disabled person who is using the net now, in its current state,
is _already_ an "expert" at overcoming the obstacles to getting
on the net.  (Or if not an expert, at least a veteran.)

Veterans are worth hearing from.  So, though, are the rank
newbies.

That's a pretty broad generalization; I don't think it's true to
the extent that you may think it is.  I can only speak from the
standpoint of a non-disabled person, though.  :)

I understand not wanting to be the "star performer" -- "oh
lookie, she used the potty without wetting herself" -- but I
don't think you can discount everyone who wants to see universal
accessibility come about as someone caught up with morbid
fascination over your disability.

Me?  I think it's a symptom of my overactive sense of justice.
Too many comic books as a kid, don'tcha know.
