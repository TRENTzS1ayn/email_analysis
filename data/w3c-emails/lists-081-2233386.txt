My apologies to the list and Kynn Bartlett in particular for having
inadvertently sent a copy of a personal email to this body. Kynn and I have
corresponded privately in the past, and he has my general respect despite
the fact I vehemently disagreed with his opinion in the referenced posts.

Um...guess who the bigger idiot is now?

Ree' Dolloff...wishing she had a Superhero right about now to get her out
of this one <gulp><blush>
