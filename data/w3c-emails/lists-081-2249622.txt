Well, I dunno, sometimes people use Capital Letters for no good
reason at all.  I myself am an unrepentant Capitalist.

Well, I applaud myself for getting on the net when it was a lot
harder, 12 years ago.  Maybe I'm just a clap-happy guy?

I dunno.  What was your intent?

Actually I think she was talking about some research she was
planning to. :)

Point of order -- I'm not championing _you_ or your cause.  I
"champion" justice.  It's unjust for a certain class of people
to be unable to access the net; so I work to make a net where
everyone has equal access.  But I'm not doing it "for the poor
blind people" (that's sarcastic quotes; I don't go around
pitying folks or whatever), I'm doing it because I Do What Is
Right.

PS:  What did I crosspost?  Near as I can tell, my original message
     on this subject went to you, and the mailing list on which
     you had replied to the original poster.
