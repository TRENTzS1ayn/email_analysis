I was willing to let go of this thread (including NOT writing another email
to acknowledge my substitution of "sell" for "sale," anal retentive that I
am <grin>), except for these last remarks of Kynn Bartlett's.

As I said to you privately, whatever the paths we take -- and they ARE
different paths -- I, too, believe the destination is ultimately the same,
to-wit: getting the Web to a point where disabled people can use it as
easily as non-disabled people. Making this into some kind of moral endeavor
or a debate about who is "more right," whose motivation more "objective,"
is inviting even more obstacles to achieving that goal. 

If, as a disabled person, I can speak up on something which may not have
occurred to a non-disabled person, or just add another perspective to the
common trough, then I will do so. I am not here SOLELY as a disabled
person, though. I learn just as much from the discussions about whether or
not to include a FOR attribute in a LABEL tag as I do when the discussions
veer off into the philosophical or social spheres. When I have something to
contribute to a discussion about attributes (for example), I will also
speak up then.

Seems to me everyone gets to be his/her OWN champion that way. 

Hoping this is my last word on this thread (and figuring a lot of other
people are hoping the same thing <laugh>),
