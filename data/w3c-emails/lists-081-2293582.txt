Another point that came up in the discussion of research methods was the
point that people with disabilities can get treated inappropriately in
research.  For example, Susan Doloff's remark that 

quote
it gets very old ... listening to people ooh and ahh when we manage to
perform an ordinary task without running into a wall
unquote

I personally am continually impressed with the barriers that people with
disabilities overcome and I sure hope I've avoided ever giving that
impression.

I'd like to invite people to contribute suggestions for guildlines we
might offer to people doing research in this field, especially well
intentioned people who are new to the area.
