Only hints.  I haven't used DSSSL or Jade myself.  

Some people who know more than I know on this topic are the
evaluation and repair group that Len Kasday <kasday@att.com> is
organizing.

Dave Pawson at RNIB is a good person to know on this issue.  He is
working on transforming documents.

There is a reference page on the W3C website linking to tools that
implement CSS and related technologies.
