Please post the URIs for any resources on the Web that are useful for
the purposes of evaluating, certifying, affecting, (or whatever) the
accessibility of web documents.  Those already mentioned in the
guidelines (Bobby, lynxit, W3C validator) need not be reiterated but
specifics of any proxy servers, email retransmitters, etc. are fair
game.

If you have written such a resource (even if just a "toy") please post a
pointer to it so we can start evaluating and making decisions as to
which direction to take and which "features to steal" in any
undertakings by the ER-WG as well as getting threads going on ER-IG when
those lists activiate.
