In my previous message I called for submissions of resources that would
get us started on making a compendium of such but Kynn's working version
at: 

http://www.cgu.edu/degrade/evaluators.html 

not only has such a list but has the facility for using them built right
in.  I hope as new useful addenda are located they will find their way
onto his site.

The proxy servers will probably be a bit more complex.  I use InterMute
which is a program that inserts itself into your browser as the proxy
and filters all ads, animations, sounds (or whatever you decide) but it
is a resident of your computer and the idea of having one's own "poor
man's firewall" has some potential in our endeavor.
