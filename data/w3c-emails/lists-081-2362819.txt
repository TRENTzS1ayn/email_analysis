As I mentioned last Friday, 

> The RC Group now has a new name, Evaluation and Repair (ER), to better

> access problematical sites.

and we (the WAI coordination group) are transitioning it to two groups to
carry on this work: an Evaluation and Repair Interest Group and and
Evaluation and Repair Working Group.  

The proposed charters are posted at 


 http://www.w3.org/WAI/RC/draft-charter-er-ig.html
 http://www.w3.org/WAI/RC/draft-charter-er-wg.html  

We haven't gotten any comments on them yet.  Please take a look at them if
you haven't already.

The next step in the W3C process will be to get the charters for these
groups approved by the W3C director.  The charters will then fix the mission
and scope of the work and we want to make sure they best reflect what we
should do.

Please post your comments back to this list by thursday June 4 or friday
June 5 if possible.  We'll be telling the WAI interest group this weekend to
get more feedback, but we'd like to incorporate your comments before then.
(Of course, you'll still be able to comment after it goes to the WAI
interest group). 

Thanks in advance!
