Hello Len and others,

I am looking forward to the evolution of this group. I am not sure what my
level of participation will be, but I do have a few comments regarding the
charter for the evaluation and repair group charters. I think you have
covered all of the major areas of concern, most of my comments are related
to clarifying some of the statements in the charter.

Thanks,
Kitch

2.1.1  

When I first read "Types of Users", I thought "users of what" tools or the
web?   You might want to call this section  "Potential Tool Users" Or
"Target Audience for ER Tools and Accessible Web Sites"

Also, you use the term "tool vendors."  Do you mean Evaluation and Repair
Tool Vendors or Page Authoring Tool Vendors or both?


2.1.2

You might want to clarify that when you say "features" you are talking
about tool features. For example,
What features are needed for a web site evaluation tool?
What features are needed for a web site repair tool?


4. I might make the following change - A high level description of the
processes used to incorporate the comments of ER tools users and users of
web sites evaluated with the ER tools shall be posted.  If that is what you
mean.

8.2
You might want to add government agencies to the list of external groups.
For example, NIST  recently released a web site evaluation tool also
agencies like the Department of Education etc.

"NIST is pleased to announce that Release 1.0 of the 
WebMetrics Tool Suite is now available.  The WebMetrics project
is focused on providing tools to help with rapid, remote, and
automated usability testing and evaluation of web sites.
