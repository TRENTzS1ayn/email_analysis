They both look good from here and I have dome comments with excerpts
below.

  6.1 Groups whose work will be used
  
    1. WAI Page Author Guidelines Working Group (WAI-GL). We will use the
       author guidelines as a basis for discussion.
    2. WAI Evaluation and Repair Working Group (WAI-ER-WG): We will look
       to this group for tools and plans for tools which may raise
       issues.

*dp* I'd add:
3. the ua guidelines working group:  some of our issues may be solved
here.
different wording is acceptable but that is the general idea.
