                  ANNOUNCING WebMetrics 1.0

  From the National Institute of Standards and Technology
     Free software at http://www.nist.gov/webmetrics


NIST is pleased to announce that Release 1.0 of the
WebMetrics Tool Suite is now available.  The WebMetrics project
is focused on providing tools to help with rapid, remote, and
automated usability testing and evaluation of web sites.

Please feel free to send out our url to others as appropriate and
link to our web site. If you are using our tools, please contact
us about participating in the collection of case study data to
help
validate our tools.

We need your feedback! Please send your comments, bug reports,
and questions to webmetrics@nist.gov.

Here is an informal description of these tools. All run on Unix,
Windows NT, and Windows 95.

  o The Web Static Analyizer Tool (WebSAT) checks the html of
    a Web page against numerous guidelines. The output from
WebSAT
    identifies potential usability problems which should be
    investigated through further user testing.  WebSAT can be
    executed from any web browser or downloaded to accommodate
    those behind firewalls.

  o The Web Category Analysis Tool (WebCAT) helps the usability
    engineer quickly construct and conduct a simple category
    analysis across the web.  WebCAT should be downloaded and
    installed on your web server for local storage of your result
    files.  Examples of WebCAT are available on the web site.

  o The Web Visual Instrumenter Program (WebVIP) helps the
usability
    engineer rapidly instrument a web site for local or remote
    testing by employing visual instrumenting as well as
automated
    techniques.  WebVIP must be downloaded and installed on your
    web server before it can be run.


Thank you,
