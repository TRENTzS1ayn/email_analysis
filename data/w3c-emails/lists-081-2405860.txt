Thanks for the comments on the charters, actually charter since the comments
seems to apply to the interest group charter.   

Bill described the milestones as "hopelessly optimistic" (Bill's original
comments are archived at 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-rc/1998AprJun/0024.html

. Here are the milestones Bill referred to, repeated for your convenience.  

1. Initial recommendations for major issues and concerns: 3 weeks after
charter approval by w3c
2. Evaluations of beta tools: for each tool, initial review 2 weeks after
tool availability.  Final review 4 weeks after tool availability.
3. Additional Milestons and Commitment dates: 4 weeks after charter approval
by W3C

What do other folks think of these milestones?

He also suggested that all members be required to maintain a personal web
page to get first hand experience.  Opinions?  My own opinion, BTW, taking
off my chair hat, would be to require member pages to be accessible if they
have pages but to not absolutely require pages of everyone.  This is because
some of our targets are people who are non technical, and also some people
who might find it tough with the current state of accessibility.

A further suggestion was to be aggressive with tool vendors and w3c
companies to embrace efforts.  Bill... Do you mean to write that into this
charter to to work closely with the EO group?

Also, Bill suggested making our output "similar to recommendations",
"brought to attention of w3c members".   Right now, the charter is output is
directed just at the evaluation and tools working group.  What do other
folks think?

There were a number of suggestions if there no objections, I'm going to

- add ISP's  and government agencies to groups from which we invite input
and participation
- invite EO to relay feedback they receive
- add monthly progress report to deliverables to emphasize
- add that we will relay feedback re guidelines to guideline group
- clarify wording for "users" and "vendors",  "features" "processes"
- strengthen wordings in the voting section

Also, NIST tool is now on the tools list.
