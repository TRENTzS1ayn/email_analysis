Hi ER folks (aka RC)

Since there were no objections, I modified the WAI-ER-IG charter thusly:

   1.added ISP's and government agencies to groups from which we invite
input and participation 
   2.invited EO to relay feedback it receives 
   3.added monthly progress report to deliverables section 
   4.added use of solutions created by User Agent and Authoring Tools groups

   5.clarified wording for "users", "vendors", "features", "processes" 
   6.de-emphasized non-formal nature of recommendations  

Thanks to the folks who made the suggestions.   

It's in the same place,

The other charter, for the WAI-ER-WG, wasn't changed.

Next, the charters are going out to the WAI IG, in an update from Judy
Brewer, so you'll be getting a request for input again <grin>.

I'm holding off on larger changes to the charter till we get more feedback
from the WAI IG.
