To the  ER group (aka RC)

This is a reminder that we'll be having a fact-to-face, working meeting of
this group at the next WAI meeting, which will be hosted by RNIB (Royal
National Institute for the Blind).  The meeting will be in

Peterborough, UK, July 24-25

Attendance is open to anyone interested in the WAI, although you'll need to
be familiar with what we're doing, since we wouldn't be giving tutorials.
