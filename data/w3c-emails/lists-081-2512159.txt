>Welcome to the RC discussion group.  Our first task is to create a group
>charter to describe what we will accomplish.   Previous related
>discussion is listed on the RC home page http://www.w3.org/WAI/RC/.  
>
Let's start fresh with a Brainstorming session about what specific
>things we'll do.  
>I suggest a couple of ground rules.
>
>1. Please include a one-sentence Summary for each proposal and comment. 
>I'll transfer the summaries to a "blackboard" at
>http://www.w3.org/WAI/RC/blackboard.
>
>2. Let's hold off negative criticisms until later.  I think for now it's
>best to  focus on the value of each suggestion, by discussing advantages
>and extensions.  But please remember your concerns  for Brainstorm 2,
>when we'll filter and refine.
>
>After  we asymptote on this part of the discussion we'll proceed to
>Brainstorm 2, when we'll  compare pro's and con's and decide on our
>goals.
