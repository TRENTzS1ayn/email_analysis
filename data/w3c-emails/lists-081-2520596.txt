All,

My first comment and perhaps my last, is that whatever we do we must keep it
as simple and understandable as possible.  It seems to me that most of the
people building web sites are associated with small to medium sized
businesses with small businesses.

The Greatest value of the web is the fact that almost anyone can put up a
site for all to go to.  Let us not make our guidelines, ratings,
suggestions, and other things we recommend inaccessible to them because of
overwhelming technical complexity.

I hope this is not taken in a negative manner because it is not meant that
way.


Sincerely,

Mike Burks
