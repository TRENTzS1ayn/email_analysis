Summary: A site accessibility survey across multiple URLs should help assess 
the work required to fix them.

The next release of Bobby will allow analysis of multiple URLs referenced 
from the supplied URL. For an executive overview across more than one URL, 
I'd like a summary report as well. 

1. Should pass/fail suffice for each URL?

2. Should the kinds of problems in a summary correspond to clauses of 
the guidelines?

3. Should the kinds of problems in a summary be further subdivided by 
required/recommended?

4. Should each different manifestation of a problem kind be reported?

Regards/Harvey Bingham
