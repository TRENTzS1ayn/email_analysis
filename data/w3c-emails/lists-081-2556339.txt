One lesson from the PICS experience in parental control over harmful
content is that not knowing the criteria and the techniques used for
rating/filtering is the worse thing to do. Whatever technique we use
for rating sites for accessibility must be completely transparent,
i.e. explained in simple words at the top of every document
communicating the rating/evaluation.
