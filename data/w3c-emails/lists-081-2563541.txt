In my opinion the key here is expressing the criteria in simple words.  To
me this is critical.  Clear, simple and concise so it can be quickly scanned
and understood.  Particularly by those who may not be sophisticated in the
ways of HTML.  Many sites are built by small business people who are
perfectly willing to make things accessible if we can show them easy ways to
do it, and how it will be to their advantage.
