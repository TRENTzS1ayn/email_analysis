         Reply to:   RE:Reporting of accessibility problems
Harvey,

Thanks for the summary, I'll be interested to hear how other people respond.

I think one of the other issues  to raise is that not all of the guidelines are readily quantifiable by a computer program.

Also, we are abandoning the four star rating system in favor of pass/fail based on the analogous argument: "1 step or 100 steps, it's still inaccessible."
