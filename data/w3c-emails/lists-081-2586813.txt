I question your use of "empirical" if first-person accounts do
not qualify.  What steps are you taking to ensure that the
studies you do accept into your knowledge base actually cover the
range of phenomena that turn up in the first person accounts?

Miscellaneous starting points:

http://www.afb.org

http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/ -- related to the page author
guidelines there is a semi-extensive bibliography, and most of
them people still care to cite.

Please keep the WAI-RC working group <http://www.w3.org/WAI/RC/>
in mind as such a peer activity and posted of your findings.
This can be done by email to <w3c-wai-rc@w3.org>.
