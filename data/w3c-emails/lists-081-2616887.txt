Subject: What sorts of activities shall we do with respect to tools.

We need to decide on the specific things we will do as a group.  One
general area is that of tools (like Bobby) that evaluate accessibilty.

Which if any of the following shall we deal with?

 1. accessibility tests that can be done in a purely automatic manner
 2. tests that require human judgment
 3. tools to help the humans do those judgments
 4. an algorithm for an overall score
 5. automated repair of access problems
 6. semi-automated repair of access problems
 7. Other, viz. (fill in the blank)

And what sort of involvement should that be?  For example, 

a. write a specification
b. collect data needed for evaluation, e.g. capabilities of current
browser/screenreaders
c. develop tools
d. provide master page that forwards to one or more tools
e. serve as clearinghouse for tools (and what does clearinghouse mean)
f. Other, viz. (fill in the blank).
