I am in favor of numbers 3, 5, and 6.

Tools to help do the assessments should be easily understood and usable by
all.  They should make it clear what the accessibility features are, and how
they can be easily implemented.  We need to keep things simple for people
who are not sophisticated web page designers and builders.  With the low
barrier to entry many sites will be put up for small businesses.  For both
their benefit and the benefit of the users who need accessible web sites we
must be sure that these sites can be accessible.  If we raise the barrier of
entry too high for the small web sites, then we destroy the web.

Automated and Semi-automated correction tool can help correct errors and if
properly designed they can help the uninitiated to make their sites
accessible.

These are my thoughts...I repeat again that we must keep things simple.

Sincerely,

Mike Burks

         Reply to:   RE:What shall we do about evaluation tools
My vote would be a combination of 1 & 4.  I think that an automatic checker
is more appealing to the "nonconverted", and quantitative feedback  is much
more tangible.
