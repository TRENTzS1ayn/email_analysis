As you may be aware, a Call for participation has gone out
via the WAI Interest Group mailing list for two new groups
on tools for Evaluation and Repair (of web content).

If you were not aware of this, please consult the archived
message listed below and follow the instructions to sign up for
the new groups.  The RC group will cease to function as soon as
the new ones are going.
