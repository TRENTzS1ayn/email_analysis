I think this is a great idea. It could be especially useful for
finding bugs with obscure things like content/language negotiation,
where responses can vary depending on user settings and the UA doing
the request.

I don't think I can commit any of my own time to work on this,
but it's really a service that anyone can set up anywhere; one way
to get it implemented might be just to post something to Usenet
saying "here is a useful project for someone to work on."
