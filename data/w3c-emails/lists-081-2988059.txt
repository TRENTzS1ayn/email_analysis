As a fellow professional, you will find great interest in the
marketing concept of this company

They have superior approach to a market that certainly
has its detractors.

View their website at www.missfleiss.com.au and note
how they market their product and why they are so
successful. Or call (02) 93103011 and listen 
to their Telemarketing .

Please also note their magazine Highrollers Magazine
listed in the top three travel sites at www.top50.com.au 
www.highrollersmagazine.com.au

I look forward to your comments 
Please note the Gay market used the disposable income
concept to Advertisers to attract Corporate Advertising
This company Miss Fleiss uses same concept to the
heterosexual market

Very well done. They are marketing to a very
class conscious market
