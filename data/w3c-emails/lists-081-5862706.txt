 FROM:CHIEF PAUL ROBERTSON
 UNION BANK OF NIGERIA PLC 
 40 MARINA LAGOS, NIGERIA
 
 Sir,
 
 First, I must solicit your confidence in this
 transaction, this is by virtue of its nature as being
 utterly CONFIDENTIAL and TOP SECRET. Though I know
 that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one
 apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that
 all will be well at the end of the day. We have
 decided to contact you by email due to the urgency of
 this transaction, as we have been reliably informed of
 it's swiftness and confidentiality.
 
 Let me start by first introducing myself properly to
 you. I am CHIEF PAUL ROBERTSON, a Director at the Union
 Bank
 Nigeria PLC, Lagos. I came to know of you in my
 private search for a reliable and reputable person to
 handle a very confidential transaction which involves
 the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign
 account requiring maximum confidence.
 
 THE PROPOSITION:
 A foreigner, late Engineer Johnson Creek, an Oil
 Merchant/contractor with the federal Govenment of
 Nigeria, until his death three years ago in a ghastly
 air crash, banked with us here at Union Bank PLC.,
 Lagos, and had a closing balance of USD$32.5 M
 (Thirty Two Million, Five Hundred Thousand United
 States Dollars) which the bank now unquestionably
 expects to be claimed by any of his available foreign
 next of kin or alternatively be donated to a
 discredited trust fund for alms and ammunition at a
 military war college here in Nigeria.
 Fervent valuable efforts are being made by the Union
 Bank to get in touch with any of the Creek family or
 relatives but all have proved to no avail.

 It is because of the perceived possibility of not
 going to be able to locate any of late Engr. Johnson
 Creek?s next of kin (he had no known wife and
 children) that the management under the influence of
 our Chairman, board of directors, Retired Major
 General Kalu Uke Kalu, that an arrangement for the
 fund to be declared "UNCLAIMABLE" and then be
 subsequently donated to the Trust Fund for Alms and
 Ammunition which will further enhance the course of
 war in Africa and the world in general.
 
 In order to avert this negative development, myself
 and some of my trusted colleagues in the bank now seek
 for your permission to have you stand as late Engr.
 Johnson Creek?s next of kin so that the fund,
 USD$32.5M would be subsequently transferred and paid
 into your bank account as the beneficiary next of kin.
 
 All documents and proves to enable you get this fund
 have been carefully worked out and we are assuring you
 a 100% risk free involvement. Your share would be 30%
 of the total amount. 10% has been set aside for
 expenses while the rest would be for myself and my
 colleagues for investment purposes in your country.

 If this proposal is OK. by you and you do not wish to
 take advantage of the trust we hope to bestow on you
 and your company, then kindly get to me immediately
 via my email, furnishing me with your most
 confidential telephone, fax number and exclusive
 e-mail so that I can forward to you the
 relevant details of this transaction.
 
 Thank you in advance for your anticipated
 co-operation.
 Regards,
 
 CHIEF PAUL ROBERTSON
 UNION BANK OF NIG. PLC.
