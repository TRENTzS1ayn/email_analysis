Dear , 
I am the Executive Secretary of the West African Development and Rural Integration Projects Board (WADRPB for short). Our client submitted a list of goods supplied to The ECOWAS PEACE MONITORING GROUP ( ECOMOG ) by some suppliers. The suppliers have already be paid in full, and the supplies completed. My colleagues and I, decided to set aside the sum of USD20.5 Million (Twenty Million, Five Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars), which came as a result of over-invoiced contracts awarded to the suppliers. This fund will be made available to you through a CERTIFIED INTERNATIONAL BANK DRAFT, as soon as you consent to handle this risk free transaction. Could you please provide your Office address, mailing address, telephone and Fax numbers to us immediately. We will enter into an agreement, clearly specifying how the fund will be shared between us. For your information, the fund will be shared as follows: 70 percent of the fund will be 
 for my colleagues and I, while 30 percent will be for you. As soon as we commence this risk free transaction, the Bank will be contacting you. Please keep thistransaction strictly confidential. 

Best regards,
