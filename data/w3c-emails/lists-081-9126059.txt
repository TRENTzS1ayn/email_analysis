            BE FINANCIALLY FREE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!! Before you say
            &quot;BULL&quot;, please read the following. This is the letter you
            have been hearing on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this
            letter on the internet, a national weekly news program recently
            devoted an entire show to the investigation of the program designed
            below, to see if it really could make people money. The show also
            investigated whether or not the program was legal. Their findings
            proved once and for all there are &quot;absolutely NO laws
=            prohibiting the participation in the program, and if people can
            follow the simple instructions, they are bound to make some mega
            bucks with on $25 out of pocket cost&quot;.<br>

            CASH HIDDEN IN HIS CLOSET</font></b></font><br>
            <br>
            Does this headline look familiar? Of course it does. You most likely
            have just seen this story recently featured on a major news program,
            (USA). His mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she
            came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried
            beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15 year old
            son's closet. Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got
            when she opened the bag and found it full of cash. Five dollar
            bills, twenties, fifties and hundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in
            labeled piles. &quot;My first thought was that he had robbed a
            bank&quot;, says the 41 year old woman, There was over $71,000.00 in
            that bag - - more than my husband earns in a year&quot;.<br>
            <br>
            The woman immediately called her husband at the car dealership where
            he<br>
            worked to tell him what she had found. He came home right away and
            they drove to the school to pick up there son and get an
            explanation. Little did they suspect that where the money came from,
            was more shocking then finding it in the closet.<br>
            <br>
            As it turns out, the boy had been sending out a &quot;type of
            Report&quot; to e - mail addresses that he obtained off the
            internet. Every day after school for the past two months, he had
            been doing this from his computer in his bedroom.<br>
            <br>
            &quot;I just got the e - mail one day and figured what the heck, I
            put my name on it like the instructions said and I started sending
            it out&quot;, says the clever 15 year old.<br>
            <br>
            The e - mail letter listed 5 address and contained instructions to
            send one $5 bill to each person on the list, then delete the address
            at the top and move the addresses down, and finally to add your name
            to the top of the list.<br>
            <br>
            Within the first few days of sending out the e - mail, the post
            office box that his parents had gotten him for his video-game
            subscriptions began to fill up, but not with magazine subscriptions,
            but envelopes containing $5 bills.<br>

            This is what one had to say, &quot;Thanks to this profitable
            opportunity, I have received a total of $610,470.00 in just 21
            weeks. I am amazed and money is still coming in&quot;. PAM Hedland,

            <br>
            Here is another testimonial: &quot;This program has been around for
            a while but I never believed in it. One day when I received this
            again in the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the
            simple instructions and walaa.3 weeks later the money started to
            roll in. The first month I made $240.00 but the next two months
            after that I made $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months, by
            re-entering the program, I have made over $710,000.00 and I am
            playing it again. The key to success in this program is to follow
            the simple steps and not change anything.&quot; More testimonials
            later but first:<br>
            <br>
            Foe each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME &amp; NUMBER OF THE REPORT
            YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E - MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose name
            appears on that list next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN
            ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail
            problems.<br>
            <br>
            You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your
            computer.<br>
            <br>
            Within a few days you will receive, via e - mail, each of the 5
            reports from these five different individuals. Save them on your
            computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1000's of
            people who will order them from you. Also, make a floppy of these
            reports and keep on your desk in case something happens to your
            computer.<br>
            <br>
            IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next
            to each report, or their sequence on the list in any way, other than
            what is instructed below in step &quot;1 through 6&quot; or you will
            loose out on the majority of your profits. Once you understand the
            way this works, you will also see how it does not work if you change
            it. Remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter it, it
            &quot;WILL NOT WORK&quot;. People have tried to be greedy and
            nothing happened; SO DO NOT try to change anything other than what
            is instructed, because if you do, it will not work for you.
            Remember, honesty reaps the rewar<br>

            <b><font color="#ff0000">METHOD # 1 BY SENDING BULK E - MAIL LEGALLY</font></b><br>
            <br>
            Let's say you decide to start out small, just to see how it goes,
            and we will assume you and those involved send out only 5,000
            e-mails each. Let's also assume that the mailings receive only a
            0.2% response. (the response could be much better but let's say it's
            only 0.2%). Also, many people will send out hundreds of thousands of
            e-mails instead of only 5,000 each. Continuing with this example,
            you send out only 5,000 e-mails.<br>
            <br>
            With a 0.2% response that is only 10 orders for report #1. Those 10
            people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
            50,000. Out of those 50,000, only 0.2% responded with orders. That
            equals 100 people responded to order report #2.<br>
            <br>
            Those 100 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000
            e-mails. The 0.2% response for that is 1,000 orders for report #3<br>
            <br>
            Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5
            million e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response for that is 10,000
            orders for report #4.<br>
            <br>
            Those people send out 5,000 e-mails for a total of 50,000,000 (50
            million) e-mails. The 0.2% response for that is 100,000 orders for
            report #5. THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00 (half a
            million).<br>
            <br>
            NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL AND PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST
            POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL
            STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY!...REMEMBER, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10
            PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU E-MAILED TO. Dare to think for a
            moment what happens if everyone or half or even a 4th of those
            people mailed 100,000 e-mails or more. There are over 150 million
            people on the internet world wide and counting. Believe me, many
            people will do just that and more.<br>

            My name is Mitchell. My wife Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an
            accountant with a major U.S. corporation and I make pretty good
            money. When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about
            receiving &quot;junk mail&quot;. I made fun of the whole thing,
            spouting my knowledge of the population and the percentages
            involved. I &quot;knew; it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my
            supposed intelligence and a few days later she jumped in with both
            feet. I made merciless fun of her and was ready to lay the old,
            &quot;I told you so&quot; on her. Well the laugh was on me! Within 3
            weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she had
            received a total of $147,200.00. All cash. I was shocked. I am now
            joining Jody in her &quot;hobby&quot;. Mitchell Wolf, Chicago,

            &quot;Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make
            up my mind to participate in this plan. Conservative that I am, I
            decided that the initial investment was so little that there was
            just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my
            money back. I was surprised when I found my medium size post office
            box was crammed with orders. I made $319,210.00 in the first 12
            weeks. The nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter
            where people live. There simply isn't a better investment with a
