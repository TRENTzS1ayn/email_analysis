ZENITH INTERNATIONAL BANK HEADQUARTERS
PLOT 84 AJOSE ADEOGUN STREET
VICTORIA ISLAND LAGOSATTN:
 PRESIDENT/CHAIRMAN
              STRICTLY A PRIVATE BUSINESS PROPOSAL
I am Dr. PETER EFETOBOR,a manager in the Bills and Exchange at the 
Foreign Remittance Department of the ZENITH INTERNATIONAL BANK 
I am writing this letter to ask for your support and cooperation to 
carry out this business opportunity in my department. We discovered 
an abandoned sum of$15,000,000.00 (Fifteen million United States 
Dollars only) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign 
customers who died along with his entire family of a wife and two 
children in November 1997 in a Plane crash.Since we heard of his 
death, we have been expecting his next-of-kin to come over and put 
claims for his money as the heir, because we cannot release the fund 
from his account unless someone applies for claim as the next-of-kin 
to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines.Unfortunately, 
neither their family member nor distant relative has everappeared to 
claim the said fund. Upon this discovery, I and other officials in my 
department have agreed to make business with you and release the 
total amount into your account as the heir of the fund since no one 
came for it or discovered he maintained account with our bank, 
otherwise the fund will be returned to the banks treasury as 
unclaimed fund.We have agreed that our ratio of sharing will be as 
stated thus;20 % for you as foreign partner,75 % for us the officials 
in my department and 5 % for the settlement of all local and foreign 
expences incurred by us and you during the course of this 
business.Upon the successful completion of this transfer, I and one 
of my colleagues will come to your country and mind our share. It is 
from our 75 % we intend to import Agricultural Machineries into my 
country as a way of recycling the fund. To commence this transaction, 
we require you to immediately indicate your interest by a return e-
mail and enclose your private contact telephone number, fax number 
full name and address and your designated bank coordinates to enable 
us file letter of claim to the appropriate departments for necessary 
approvals before the transfer can be made.
Note also, this transaction must be kept STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL 
because of its nature.I look forward to receiving your prompt 
response. FAX NUMBER234-1-7592911
Best Regards
Dr Peter Efetobor
