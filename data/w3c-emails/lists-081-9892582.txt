in the security/finance company we need an associate
and partner to proceed as soon as possible to receive

(25%) of the total
sum to whom ever shall handle this funds for us while
the remaining 
sixty-five percent (65%)shall be for my client and
ten-percent (10%) for me as the attorney.

cash on our behalf we shall furnish you with the
details and information you will need to accomplish
this task.
