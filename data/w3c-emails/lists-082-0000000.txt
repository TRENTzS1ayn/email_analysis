Hi,
I think that there are two characteristics that software engineers who
are developing GUI's need to understand about screen readers.

The first characteristic is that screen readers are very good at reading
blocks of text.

The second characteristic is that screen readers can be very inefficient
or weak when navigating through combinations of graphics elements
or combinations of graphics and text elements.

Designing a program for accessibility needs to take advantage of the
first characteristic and minimize the influence of the second
charasteristic.
