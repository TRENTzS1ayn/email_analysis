Chuck,
The Amya development team asked for input from the WAI project on
accessibility.  The conference call was setup for input to Amaya group from
the WAI prgram office.  Amaya is developing their goals for the next few
months and they want to do somethings with acessibility.  

Your main concern is probably the discussion of the browser guidelines
themselves, this is not part of the discussion with Amya group.  The
guidelines will be discussed within the browser group, hopefully within the
next few weeks.  But comments and discussion are welcome anytime.

Jon
