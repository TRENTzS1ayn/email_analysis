Hello,

My name is Evan Wies.  I am a Research Engineer at Immersion Corporation.
Immersion develops force-feedback technologies -- technologies that let you
"feel" things on your computer.  Although our products are targeted at the
mass market, we are very interested in making them a useful, if not invaluable,
interface for people with  disabilities.  We have spent a great deal of effort 
on integrating force-feedback with the Web.  By being in this working group, I
hope to share our ideas with you, as well as to learn ways to improve upon our
work.

Our web page is at http://www.force-feedback.com.  Feel free to email me at
evan@immerse.com if you have any questions.


Sincerely,

Evan Wies
Research Engineer
