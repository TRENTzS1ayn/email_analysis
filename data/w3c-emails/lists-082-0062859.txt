Based on discussions during the telephone meeting today it was clear that
the priority of the UI group is to develop a set of browser accessibility
guidelines for commercial browsers like Explorer, Netscape, Opera, Amyia
and Lynx.  Chuck Opperman from Microsoft stated that these guidelines would
be useful to him as he works with the Explorer 5.0 development group, but
he needs the recommendations by the end of the month.  To meet this
deadline we have scheduled two telephone meetings for next week.  The two
meetings are scheduled for:

Tuesday, March 10th, 1:00 pm Eastern Standard Time for 60 minutes
Friday, March 13th, 1:00 pm Eastern Standard Time for 60 minutes

By monday March 9th members are requested to review the current guideline
checklist at:
http://www.w3c.org/WAI/UI/wai-browser-cl.html

Please review and comment on the current checklist using the following
1. Rate the importance of each item on the following scale:
    Highest Priority
    Second Priority
    Third Priority
2. Propose additional checklist items that you feel are missing
3. Propose deletions of checklist items that you feel should not be there
4. Ask questions if you don't understand an item

Please post your response to the entire group.  I will collect the
consensus monday morning and rebuild the page by monday afternoon with an
updated checklist that will include the priority informaiton.  We will
discuss the updated checklist on tuesdays telephone meeting.

Thank you for your participation and look forward to hearing your comments.
 Even if you are not particpating in the telephone meetings please
contibute to the review process.
