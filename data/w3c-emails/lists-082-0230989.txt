Hello,

I have a few thoughts related to previous posts.
Those of you who are developers and those of you who have
worked with developers in the past can tell me if I am off base.

If we were to focus on the needs of users and leave the  implementation
up to the developer, exactly what type of information should we be providing
to the developer. A description of what the user needs to accomplish?
A description along with what would be required in order for a user to
accomplish
a task? It seems like developers would need some guidance on implementation
because
interaction with assistive technology will play a key role in access. 

I don't know if we should be providing a list of "desired features",
"accessible
design principles" , "user needs" or some of everything.

As a rough example consider the following.

Task: An individual who uses a screen reader must be able to read and fill
out an on-line form
using only the keyboard for navigation.

In order to do this he or she must be able to:

1. Identify the fact that there is a form on the page
2. Get to the beginning of the form (via a landmark?)
3. Read the form control labels (preferably with the option of reading all
 the labels before filling out the form so he or she can decide if it is
worth filling out, and what will be required)
4. enter each form field sequentially, knowing the name of the field or
control, and what information is required
5. be able to activate any required controls (e.g. submit, clear)
6. know that form has been submitted successfully

Is this the type of information a developer needs? If a developer
says, yes, I can provide keyboard navigation for those steps and 
pages are created according to page author guidelines is that enough?

I hope you don't mind me thinking out loud.

Kitch
