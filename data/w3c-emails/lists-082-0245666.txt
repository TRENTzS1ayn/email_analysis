Hi,
Here's what my suggestion for the CSS options.

    *  Ignore cascading style sheets

    *  Use cascading style sheets

                                                      +------------+
    Optional accessibility cascading style sheet      |            |
                                                      +------------+

                                                      +------------+
    Optional user's personal cascading style sheet    |            |
                                                      +------------+

There are two radio buttons for the cascading style style sheets,
The first says ignore style sheets while the second says to use
the style sheets.  (The default would be to use the cascading style
sheets.)  Under the second button and indented are two file name boxes.
The first file field specifiecs an optional accessibility CSS file name.
The second file field specifies an optional user's personal CSS file.

Providing for a separate accessibility CSS file in addition to the
user's personal CSS gives the disabled user the option of overriding
various aspects of the accessibility CSS file to more easily
tailor it to his/her needs without needing to duplicate or
modify the accessibility CSS file.

What do people think of this approach?

Scott
