The User Interface group will be changing it's name this week to User
Agents.  The name change is due to the changing nature of what is a browser
and the need to deal with new browser technologies.  User Agent is a more
general label for the working group to deal with the interface between the
user and the WWW document.

Implications:
The mailing list will change from w3c-wai-ui@w3.org to w3c-wai-ua@w3.org. 
The old e-mail address will work though for an indefinite period of time.

WWW address to the home page will change to: http://www.w3c.org/wai/ua
