Hi,
I'd like to support Kitch's approach to using scenarios to understand
user needs.  It is an extremely useful tool.

Here's a scenario that I quickly mentioned in a previous note, but
one common enough that it needs to be addressed.  As a blind person
is tabbing through fields of a form, how does he know when one
form ends and another form begins?

Scott
