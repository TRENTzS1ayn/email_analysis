Hi,
I haven't been able to attend the meetings so I don't know if this has
been discussed.  One aspect to specifying user interfaces is called
"user empathy".  The idea behind this is to step outside of who you
are and into the user's shoes.  Were there any user empathy techniques
discussed?  (Amazing how often programmers dislike that touchy-feely stuff.)

Scott
