Hi,
Someone asked me about user empathy techniques.  There are a number of different
approaches.  I think the real basic one is to get into the habit of
asking yourself each time you make a decision which will affect a user
one of these questions:

    If I were ....., how would I feel if I had to ....   ?

    If I were ....., how would I feel if I couldn't ...   ?

Some people can get into this pretty easily if they're able to step outside
of themselves pretty easily and are aware of their reactions.  Other people
need to practice it on a repeated basis to get their mind used to changing
views.

Scott
