Hi,
Here's a quick story I tell MBA and engineering graduate students about
user/customer satisfaction.

A few years ago I was in a Berkeley restaurant and a young college
couple were at the table next to me.  The young womans tells the waiter
what she would like for desert.  When the waiter leaves, the young man 
tells her  "You can't be hungry.  I just bought you a $15 dinner."

Scott
