Hi,
How about a scenario like this?  A blind student has to register for
a class via the web.  The registration web page has multiple forms.
In addition, two different submit buttons are provided towards the beginning
of each form for different actions.  Also, each form has a link to a help
web page for that particular form.

What features would be helpful for the blind student to choose the correct
form, fill it out and then submit it?

Which features should be in the browser and which supported by third party
accessibility software?

Scott
