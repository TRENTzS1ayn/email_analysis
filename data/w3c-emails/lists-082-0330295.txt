Hi,
Just a couple of thoughts about deciding if a feature should be in a
browser or in third party accessibility software.

If a feature meets any of the following criteria, the feature should probably
be in the browser:

    a.  the feature falls into universal design because it can benefit both
disabled and non-disabled users

    b.  the feature can be benefit more than one disability, e.g. a feature
which helps both blind and quadriplegics

    c.  the feature is of such basic or significant benefit to a particular
disability group that the disability group would benefit from the
feature being centralized  in the browser rather than re-created
in various third party accessibility software packages


The above 'c' criteria is included for situations where it makes
sense for the browser developer to do some work once rather than
perhaps screen reader companies using their limited resources to duplicate
each other's work.  The disabled users also benefit in that it will
be easier for them to switch between screen readers without having
to learn all sorts of new browser commands associated with each screen reader.
(Screen reader developers can of course still add their own browser-specific
features.)

What do people think?

Scott
