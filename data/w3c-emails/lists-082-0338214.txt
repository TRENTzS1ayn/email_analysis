your statement about screenreader developpers duplicating each others work
may make the last point moot because if the browser provides the propper
information to the third party device, the only thing the third party
device needs to do is be sure to take advantage of it.  perhaps we need to
develop annother third party device to go between but that may be a topic
for another time and annother list.
I'd say the strongest case can be made for features that can benefit all.
I'd also say that many features benefitting one using a screenreader can
probably benefit all even if that eans that the feature need be adapted to
fit annother catagory.
