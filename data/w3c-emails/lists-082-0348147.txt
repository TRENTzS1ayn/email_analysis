Hi,
I disagree with your point for a couple of reasons.  First, how
much work will the developer have to go through to write and debug
the code to use the information provided by the browser?  This
may or not may be trivial.  My other concern is what are the advantages
to the blind user to have the feature provided by the screen access
technology versus the browser?  I might be wrong about this, but I don't
believe that the blind browser user will want the browser functionality changed
out from under them each time they switch screen reader.  Do you think
that blind users want this?

Scott
