Hi all,

I do think that we need to get as much access
as possible built directly into browsers. I wouldn't want to
 take the attitude that the access technology can
provide access to certain information, when that access can be provided
via a browser feature.  For the time being, though,we may have to 
prioritize our list of desired features by considering what the 
access technology can do. 

So, it sounds like we need to come back to the notion of
prioritizing features by:

1. reviewing the existing checklist

2. determining how the features listed, or added features, 
would benefit users with and w/o disabilities (this can be done using 
scenarios, empathy, task analysis, common sense and/or 
some other preferred method)

3. discussing these features and benefits 

4. and applying Scott's or some other criteria

Please forgive me for taking the simplest example I can think of, but here
goes.

Feature: User font size override 

Benefits: all users, including but not limited to,
- individuals with visual impairments
- individuals who for some reason cannot sit close to the monitor 
(classroom, public place, reclined in a wheelchair)
- instructors who want to display a web page via and an overhead projector 
- screen reader users who want to fit more text on the page
- people who want to print a document in a small or large font
- reporters who want to video a web page for a news story

Discussion: does this make sense?

Priority: High priority, meets all three of Scott's criteria
 

Kitch
