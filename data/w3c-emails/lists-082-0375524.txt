Hi, Kitch
I think you have some good points.  The checklist has some very good
ideas.  The one area I'm concerned about most is the navigation
aspects.  I'd like to see that fleshed out a little bit more
before prioritizing the checklist.

Another possible disability group for your example.   People who have
problems using a mouse might prefer slightly larger text for links
to give them a larger target to hit.

Scott


PS  I'd hate to see screen readers become browsers.  This would mean
that blind users would always be behind in technology.
