Hi, Dave
I'm not quite sure of your approach here.  Could you maybe give some examples
of what browser-related functions should be in screen readers
and not in browsers themselves?  This would help give a better sense of what
information the guidelines need to specify that browsers should make
available to screen readers.

I tend to lean towards putting more functionality in the browser and less
in the screen reader as a way to minimize the lag between browser
enhancements and screen reader releases.

One area which I think is screen reader based is that the screen reader
should be able to speak intermixed text and button labels without
skipping.  The browser should provide information to the screen reader
in such a way that it can do that.

I think that navigation is a shared responsibility.  The browser should be
able to change the focus via keyboard action and the screen reader
should be able to speak the new area being focused on.  (I'm not sure how
braille output should be handled.)
