Hi,
The Lynx version 2.8 has some nice features which I think should be
considered in some form for the guidelines.

1.  The ability to navigate/scroll the web page to a specific link by number
    in addition to choosing a link by number.

2.  Form fields and buttons have ids or numbers assigned to them.

3.  Options in menus are numbered and can be referenced by numbers.
    
4.  Menus can be navigated by option number or / .

5.  The search command positions the page so that there are four text lines
    appearing above the line with the matched item.

Scott
