I haven't checked if other people had the same comments, so sorry in
advance for repeats.

First I looked at
  http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/wai-browser-gl.html

- II. Browser Accessibility Checklist Description
  sounds like it's not what it says it is. To me, it's a general intro
  to the Guidelines. In fact, the checklist shouldn't need any intro:
  it's just that: a checklist for the guidelines.
  Suggest this is moved in intro and better structured, as a list for
  instance. 

- in A, "CSS Override and User Specification"
  Where does it says that UA *should* support CSS in the first place ?
  In fact, I don't see a section on "Capabilities" when it should say
  that UA should understand HTML4, CSS1 (and 2 in the future), and
  maybe going into the details such as: FRAME algorithm or use NOFRAMES
  part, NOSCRIPT, etc.
  Under "Capabilities", we could also put things like "recommended
  that smiley are supported" or "provide a way to extend the context
  of a link text upon user demand" 

- One of the thing missing from the background/intro section is a blurb
  about the difference between an accessible "Markup Aware UA" and a
  simple "Screen Reader" whose input is the output of another UA.
  Mention of "voicing agent" vs. "textual linearizer" agent should be
  put in here as well.

- in A still:  "One proposal is that it (longdesc) should be rendered
  as a D link after the image if the option is turned on"
  I don't really like that as I've been trying to have people use both
  longdesc attributes and D-link when authoring. If we make them
  exclusive, we have little chance that longdesc takes any role in the
  future. 

- Regarding ALT algorithm, we need to wait for the PAGEAUTH guidelines
  to be done with that item. Also we should look at the algo mentioned
  in the HTML specs (pointing to using HTTP title, then the filename,
  etc)

- Browser Menus and Dialog Boxes
  I think this is not Web UA specific and should be removed or much
  shorter. 

- in B, "The link list dialog box" concept is implemented in the  ETH
  Zurich - Proxy helper project
  (http://www.inf.ethz.ch/department/IS/ea/blinds/)
  using both a list of link and a list of header that is inserted in
  the view.

- this "Navigation Commands with Mouse Equivalents" section start with
  "first type of navigation..." but I can't find the mention of the
  second type in the same section.

- In terms of navigation, one important thing to support if the LINK
  conventions for prev, next, index, etc, that are mentioned as
  informative in the HTML spec (lynx 2.7 does it).



I also looked at

  http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-WAI-UA-BROWSER-0312.htm

but it has only one section (1. Presentation Adjustability), so
it's probably not up-to-date

Anyway, on the form:

- I think [VERY IMPORTANT] should be renamed [REQUIRED]

- What is [SENERIOS] ? Is that SCENARII ?

- It should be updated to use UA, not UI.


One question I have is what is the process for doing from
UA/wai-browser-gl.html to WD-WAI-UA.htm ? The first document is very
rich in information but not very well structured in terms of
categorizing and itemizing all guidelines.
