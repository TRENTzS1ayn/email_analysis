Hi, Kelly
Thanks for your posting.  Some of us are collecting scenarios of problems
to analyze.

The HTML 4.0 has a new tag called LABEL which associates label information
with a field.  An idea I'm proposing to the browser group in the WAI
is that the browser provides an information command or menu item
for each form field.  The blind user could then use the command to
ask the browser display information about the field including label.
Would that approach make it easier for you to use the form?

Scott
