Hi,
Here's a philosophy or model of user interfaces that I try to pass on
to the students here at Berkeley.

Basically, I look at a user interface as a kind of a butler for the user.
The idea is that the butler accomodates the master's needs and behaviors
instead of the other way around.  The butler makes life easier for the
master by knowing his preferences, etc.  The butler does more work of the
work so that the master can do less work.

Scott
