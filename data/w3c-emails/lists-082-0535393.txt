We don?t have ?information commands? on regular dialogs ?
why do we need one for an HTML form?

Hi, Kelly
Thanks for your posting.  Some of us are
collecting scenarios of problems
to analyze.

The HTML 4.0 has a new tag called LABEL
which associates label information
with a field.  An idea I'm proposing to the
browser group in the WAI
is that the browser provides an information
command or menu item
for each form field.  The blind user could
then use the command to
ask the browser display information about
the field including label.
Would that approach make it easier for you
to use the form?
