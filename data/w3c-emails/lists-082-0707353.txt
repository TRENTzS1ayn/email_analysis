I would like to start an issue by issue discussion of browser accessibility
guidelines.  The first topic will be part of presentation adjustability.
The draft can be found at:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-WAI-UA-BROWSER-0330.htm

Thje issues discussed in this initial discussion are font characteristics,
colors and CSS override.  Feedback is needed on working, rating of
importance and missing information. 

If any one has questions or needs clarification, please feel free to ask.
There are no dumb questions.  We have people on the list with a wide range
of experience and knowledge, and we want to be sensitive to new people who
are not as familiar to the terminology or technologies as some of our
participants.  

Look forward to hearing from all of you on our first topic.

Jon
