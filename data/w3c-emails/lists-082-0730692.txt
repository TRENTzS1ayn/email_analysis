I have a question/quiry and a thought.  is this not a server issue?  the
server through a "script" that examines where a user is coming from gets
the user agent information and decides what to do with it.  this is most
likely similar to deciding to put up those nasty messages like "you're
browser is not frames capable, download this or that browser and try
again".  or you are not using xxx shame on you.
is there a group in the wai that handles server issues?
here's the thought.  in our ua guidelines, we can have a list of browsers
that support security and hope/ask servers to allow them.
