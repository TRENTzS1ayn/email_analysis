In response to David Poehlman,
Broswer sniffing is a server issue, and I think WAI will bring it up with
the server people at W3C.  I think in general W3C is against browser
sniffing, but it not clear what power they have to stop it.  Do you think
it is something UA should be dealing with and make a statement?
