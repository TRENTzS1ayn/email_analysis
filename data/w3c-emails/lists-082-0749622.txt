Jon, I think a request that if it is used it should be used judiciously is
in order.
if a browser is truly insecure than I under stand partially the point.  if
it is being uused to deny fredom of information than that is something
else again and should be garded against. I guess we could tell user agents
how to break it.  it can be a simple trick to fool a site that looks at
the user agent into passing your browser by falsifying the user agent.
not all browsers can do this, but some can.
