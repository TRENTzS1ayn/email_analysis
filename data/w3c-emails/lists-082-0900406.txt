I'm still confused. It's important that we understand your point, so
let me ask again.

MathML is a simple W3C XML tagset, and access to the specification is
public (http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-MathML).

Access to the source of the documents using MathML on the Web should
be fairly similar to access to source of documents using HTML today:
MathML is the format being sent by the server, so if you're a UA, you
have it, if you're a user, your UA should give you a "Show Page
Source" menu to give access to it.

Access to the parsed MathML should come thru an API like DOM (W3C
Document Object Model), which works with XML in general.

What is your issue then ?
