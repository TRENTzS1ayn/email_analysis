One of the outcomes of today's user agent teleconference is the formation of a subcommittee to look at MathML issues. The first task for this subcommittee is to report on what types of action (if any) should be taken by this group concerning browser access to MathML. The report is tentatively scheduled to appear on the agenda for a conference call to take place on August 12th.

This is a call for participation in the MathML subcommittee. If you're interested, please send an e-mail to madeleine_rothberg@wgbh.org or reply to this message. As evidenced by discussion on this list over the past couple of days, MathML and its potential opportunities and existing access barriers warrant thorough exploration, and we welcome your participation! Madeleine Rothberg will contact interested participants sometime next week to work out further details.
