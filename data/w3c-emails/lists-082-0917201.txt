Oh my.  This all started because I didn't understand how your user agent
guidelines could be expanded to include good access to math, and I was
hoping that the group could enlighten me.

Please correct me if I misunderstand, but your recommendations are
apparently a list of user options and a list of good practices to ensure
that user agents work well with access technologies.

I can personally imagine only one way that your paradigm can include math.
That is to give the user an option to represent the math in a linear form.
Screen readers can be given a symbol dictionary that will pronounce the
math and markup symbols correctly.

There sure are many better ways to display math in audio than this (ask
Raman).  But none of the methods I know or can imagine can be accomplished
in your user option/access technology paradigm.

So apparently it is I, not daniel, who is confused.  Please enlighten me.

John
