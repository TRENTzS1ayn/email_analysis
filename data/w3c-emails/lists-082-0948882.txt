Hello,

I've re-released the public working draft of the UA Guidelines at [1].
This document has a couple of accessibility improvements (correct
color combinations, brackets around navigation bar links, "title"
attributes in IMG used as a link and in HR elements). It also corrects
SUNSoft to be Sun Microsystems.

None of the guidelines or prose changed.

I ran the document (successfully) through the W3C CSS Validator
and Bobby. The CSS Validator does return a warning, but the CSS rule
in question is not used in the document, so there's no problem.

The link to this document from the W3C TR page [2] has been updated.

 - Ian
