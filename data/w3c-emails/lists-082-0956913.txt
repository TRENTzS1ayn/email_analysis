The UA cannot control what the applet or object does.  I can write ActiveX
controls and Java applets that do nearly whatever I want without the UA's
knowledge or ability to control it.

What about <BLINK> and <MARQUEE>? Those are not W3C supported tags.  I agree
there be a recommendation that UA's should only display the first frame of
an animated GIF if a option is set.  This would also disable the blinking of
<BLINK> and the scrolling of <MARQUEE> text.  Although in the case of
MARQUEE, there could be information loss.  A better suggestion would be to
ignore the <MARQUEE> tag and display the contents in-line.

Note to Judy:  Once again, I almost sent this reply directly to Ian and not
the list because of the screwy listserv in use at the W3C.

Hello,

In light of this email, I propose a guideline along the lines of:

"Allow the user to supress rendering of blinking and flashing
images and applets."

This may be a subset of "control presentation", but it may
deserve to be its own guideline.

All comments welcome,

 - Ian
