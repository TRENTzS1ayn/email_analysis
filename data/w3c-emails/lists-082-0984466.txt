An action item from the July 2 teleconference was the formation of a
subcommittee to look at SMIL issues.

This is a call for participation in the SMIL subcommittee. If you're
interested, please send an e-mail to allan_jm@tsb1.tsbvi.edu or reply to
this message. Jim Allan will contact interested participants sometime next
week (6/13) to work out further details. The task of this subcommittee is to
report on issues and actions necessary concerning accessibility of the SMIL
user agent. The report is tentatively scheduled to appear on the agenda for
a conference call to take place on August 12th.

As a first step, participants should review the following document, for UA
implications and issues.
