I don't thinkk this fts in the category of a guideline. I think this is part
of following standards - producing a new version of something (as opposed to
a new product entirely) means that one of the conventions established is the
particular user interface for that product.

so I would argue that the checkpoints which should be added to the existing
guideline are

1. Ensure consistent user agent behavior from release to release

2. Organize user interface controls in a manner consistent with previous
versions and self-consistent with the user agent's conventions
  
and the checkpoint

- Clearly document significant changes to the software, notably those known
to affect accessibility

should go into documentation

I think the rest of the stuff is techniques
