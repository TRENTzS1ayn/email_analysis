Hi,

Glad to see keyboard controls come up again. It is necessary to give some
details as keyboard controls vary greatly in usefulness. For most
applications, example Eudora Pro email, Alt & Ctl modifiers are fine because
they aren't used too often, time is spent reading & writing. Browsers are a
very different type of program that require much navigation to select
various kinds of hyperlinks. Web pages often have scores of links so using
TAB, SHIFT-TAB & ENTER is too tiring using 1 finger or a headwand. I can see
why this working group can't specific exact key usage a reference to 1 key
keyboard commands & reasonable spacing (there's a vast void between ENTER &
TAB) is necessary. Bill McMurray http://members.localnet.com/~billmc/ was
thrilled to find Opera in fall 1997 because of its extensive 1 key keyboard
controls that doesn't force us to chase all over the keyboard or use
modifiers. We should be able to settle this vital issue simply.

Regards,
Bryan
