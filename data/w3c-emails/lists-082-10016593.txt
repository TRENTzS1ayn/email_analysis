They are actually in the TOC, but not in the <UL> of the TOC
(because they are external documents and I wanted to distinguish
them). Thus, after "6. References" of the <UL>, the following statement
indicates they are appendixes:

" The appendix list of checkpoints is available as either a 
  tabular summary of checkpoints or as a simple list of
  checkpoints. "

There are more references to the fact that these are appendixes
to this document in the Status sectino.

Charles is working on a W3C Note that will include references to
vendor-specific guidelines for software accessibility. I would
like to refer to that Note once it's available.

This is meant to refer to element instances (not link text or link
destinations). Thus, every "A" element is numbered (uniquely). It's
useful to know that I'm on the 75th link of the document if I
have a navigation mechanism that lets me return to it (by number).

I admit, this is very technique-y as it suggests numbering links
as a way of letting readers know where they are. There are undoubtedly
other techniques. For this reason, I question whether these
checkpoints should be checkpoints at all (to be discussed at the
23 June teleconf).

Refer to checkpoint 8.14

This could appear in the techniques document, but in my opinion
goes to far in suggesting an implementation. The purpose of the
checkpoint is not to ensure fast downloads (though this is interesting)
but to provide a measure of progress (whatever the speed).

I'm not sure what this means. Can you give an example?

No. Conformance will refer to a specific, frozen version of the
specification, not the latest version.

That's an interesting point. For example, must I be able to type
via the mouse (e.g., by using an entry palette)?

For generality, we should not assume an operating system or
file system (e.g., when using a kiosk). Where should we mention this?

There is information about this in the Techniques Document
(3.9.1 of 11 June version).

Jon has flagged this as an issue for discussion.

I would suggest that "support for author style sheets" means that
they are parsed and cascaded with other style sheets according to 
the style sheet spec. Turning off support would mean they are ignored.

Some browsers support META element declarations such as this:

   <META http-equiv="refresh" content="5; http://www.acme.com/newpage">

After a 5-second delay, the new page is loaded.

It sounds like there are two scenarios: streamed video and 
local playback. Does is matter which type the user is viewing?

I think "at the same time" doesn't mean "synchronized with"
in this case, but rather that both are rendered. In other words,
when captions are available (and as captions they are
already synchronized), all the user to view them while the video
is running (as opposed to captions-only).

The focus is a mechanism used to identify active elements. It may
not be the only mechanism.

See comment above about numbering "A" elements.

Which list elements are those? I think the word "element" is supposed
to suggest markup.

A "chosen link" means a particular A element, not the content
of the element or the destination of the link.
