We'll take this to the teleconf.

It sounds like Guideline 2 will be reduced significantly
by the (re)creation of a guideline for keyboard support. There
will be two checkpoints left and perhaps we should find a
different place for them.

I see Guidelines 4 and 5 as much more similar: one is about
turning features on/off, the other about values in-between. I have
been tempted to merge them but they are quite long already.
