The topics are: images, background images, video, sound, captions.

Background images: I think this not an alt content issue: it's about
                   inability to see text (for example) against a
                   certain background.

Captions: This is mostly about alt content and could be in guideline 6.

Images, video, sound: I can see wanting to turn them on/off to get
  them out of the way (reduce distraction) or speed up downloads.
  But can someone provide a good answer to how they "reduce"
  accessibility? (The guideline is about that.)

How about a situation where you want to get back screen
real estate (e.g., using screen magnifier) so you turn off images?

I see your point. I think the goal is access to the frame's content
(covered by another checkpoint). One technique is linearization,
which may or may not happen when you turn off the frames.
