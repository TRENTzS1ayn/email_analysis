Interesting extension of the word "appendix". My book-centric
use is appendix in the same document. Why bother to call these 
external documents "Appendices?"

Old screen readers went across table cells as they knew not of the possibility
to fold cell content onto multiple lines.

That DUA only serves a particular class of use, and presumes some information
in its dependency with the general UA. How is that interface specified?

So far as I am aware, that capability was omitted from XMetaL 1.0, possibly
to be put back into XMetaL 2.0. It was available in HoTMetaL, I believe since
version 3. It and the other accessibility features of that product never got
any mention in any product reviews, so their inclusion in the first product
of SoftQuad Software, Inc. was less important than getting to market with
a product.

Not sure. Without assumptions, what can we say about making that process
accessible?

That "automatic page forwarding" remains semantically confusing. Can we
describe it differently, or expand the description. The "forwarding" part
implied to me that I will somehow be doing the forwarding. "Refresh" is
the concept that asserts server-side action. How about
"automatic refresh to a different page content after a time delay"?

Good point. The issue remains at what granularity is the synchronization, 
or "at the same time". I guess I read more into "at the same time" than
just "concurrently".

In the DOM sense, structure and sibling sequence preserves structure.
Unordered list items may have no presentational differentiation. Nor may
definition list terms. For these, the sequence of occurrence might be
used associated with a count of position for that otherwise undifferentiated
structure.

My proposal would mark all occurrences of a visited link, if any one were
visited.
