consistent

>>               o Use system standard indirections wherever possible

>>
>>Configurability
>>               o Allow users to create profiles
>>               o Allow control of timing, colors, sizes, input/output

>>Icons, Graphics, Sounds
>>               o Provide visual (text) equivalents for sound warnings

>>               o Provide text equivalents for images/icons

>>               o Use icons that are resizeable or available in multiple
sizes
>>
>>Layout
>>               o Do not rely on color alone for meaning. Use color for
>>differentiation, in combination with accessible cues (text equivalents,
>>natural language, etc)
>>               o Position related text labels and objects consistently,

>>               o Ensure default window sizes fit in screen
>>               o Allow for window resizing (very small to very large)
>>
>>User Focus
>>               o Clearly identify the user focus (and expose it via API)
>>               o moving focus should not cause unexpected events
>>               o Allow user control of timing - delays, time-dependent
