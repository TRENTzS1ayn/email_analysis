Hello,

I had an action item for several weeks to pursue a perceived
dependency with the Micropayments WG about how User Agents
would recognize (and convey) information about paying links.
Below is the response from one of the Micropayments WG members.

Here is the link to the 9 June Working Draft from that WG:

    http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WD-Micropayment-Markup-19990609 

I believe the pertintent section of this document is 4.5
("Price field"). However, the document in question says:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The price parameter, which takes a character string,
displays the amount and currency to the Customer.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

I think "display" is the wrong term. Also, perhaps there
is a shortcut to indicate that the price is zero.

I will continue to pursue this issue with the Working Group.

 - Ian

Actually I believe we have addressed this perfectly well in the existing
markup proposal. Specifically, per-fee-links have been defined in a
_different_ way than regular (free) links. Indeed we even gave some
guidelines as to how the user agent (in our case we call this agent the
`per fee link handler`) is to indicate the fee. However of course for
accessibility reasons, special per-fee-link-handlers may implement special
ways of indicating fees (e.g. for blind users). In summary - I believe
you'll find our existing recommendation is fine
regarding this particular comment. Your feedback on this and other points
welcome!
