Hi Amir,

Thank you for answering my question. I am looking at the 9 June
draft of the Micropayment Markup spec [1], in section 4.5, which
I believe to be the pertinent section. Some comments:

1) The current text begins:

    "The price parameter, which takes a character string,
     displays the amount and currency to the Customer."

   I propose that this be changed to:

    "The price parameter, which takes a character string,
     specifies the amount and currency that the Customer
     will be charged upon dereferencing the link."

   (Question: How does caching work? Is this dealt with elsewhere?
    I'm sorry if this is not a pertinent question.)

2) Perhaps there should be a reserved value for non-fee links.
   For example, "0", with no currency specified. This would be
   more international than "free", for example.

Please let me know if these comments make sense. Thank you
again, 

 - Ian
