Please consider that WAI-PF also holds a dependency, here.  The issues that
we have raised with the X-Link working group about the model of link
activation overlap the considerations here.

Hopefully we can get X-Link to consolidate the behavior and information
model for links.

Some instant comments, however:

It is not clear why there should be a text field for the price when the
price is an amount in currency.  Will XML Schema have a way for us to make
this a typed currency amount by the time that micropayments are entering on
service?  If not, is the upgrade path to typed quantities clear?

Rather than defining a behavior on the assumption of GUI use and adding
special attributes for other uses, we would rather define the maximally
refined process that works for phone, blind, etc. users with full consumer
protection as the reference model and define quicker processes as shortcuts
against the full process.  Or at least that this kind of tradeoff should be
considered.
