subcommittee is to report on what types of action (if any) should be taken
by this group concerning browser access to MathML. The report is
tentatively scheduled to appear on the agenda for a conference call to take
place on August 12th.

to this message. As evidenced by discussion on this list over the past
couple of days, MathML and its potential opportunities and existing access
barriers warrant thorough exploration, and we welcome your participation!
Madeleine Rothberg will contact interested participants sometime next week
to work out further details.
