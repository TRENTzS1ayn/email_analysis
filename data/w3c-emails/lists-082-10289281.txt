This includes me!

Looking through my inbox, we haven't reached consensus
on a few more proposals:

Proposed changes to Guideline 7:
(http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999AprJun/0207.html)

Guideline for Keyboard Accessibility:
(http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999AprJun/0208.html)

I'd like to get more input on these proposals at tomorrow's meeting.
I realize that Jon, Rich, and Mark Novak won't be at the meeting,
but this will be an opportunity for others to comment on the
proposals. If you haven't had a chance to review them yet, please
take this opportunity to do so.

Thank you,

 - Ian
