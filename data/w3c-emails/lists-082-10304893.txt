Note: We've allowed access to metadata in attributes in content, such as
title="...", or class="...", lang="...". There may be significant metadata
in the document head. Some of this may be less-clearly found in the
body. 

Suggest new checkpoints. Place it near discussion on searching attributes
of elements: name="value".

1. Allow search on metadata in document head:

1a. Allow access to the META element content, either unqualified, 
or qualified by user supplying value for name="..." to get content="...", 
and with returned list of each matching that name value. [priority 2]

1b. Allow access to the BASE value if any. [priority 3]

1c. Allow access to the TITLE value. [priority 2]

1d. Allow access to list of those URIs referenced in LINK. [priority 3] 

Comment: Use includes searching on common keyword list. 
Search can also be on the Dublin Core finding aids.

Comment: Only the title of this material is in the "visible" content, 
and that title appears in a different context from the "visible" content.

Comment: The head information is value-added that has retrieval value,
and to learn about the document in manner different from its content.

Question: Is there value in searching on LINK? 

Answer: The list of links can show the "reach" of the document, and the
relationships to it.

Question: Is there value in finding out what the document BASE URI is?
