In response to Denis Anson,

I think we want developers to make their rendering technology accessible
and to be compatible with assistive technology by using accessible design
techniques.  I think where we want to draw the line is asking developers to
implement "tricks" that may help a current assistive technology, but may
not be a general long term solution to the problem (for example
linearization of tables).  Often times these tricks are only partial
solutions and may take years to actually get implemented and by that time
the "trick" may not be useful to the assistive technology.  

Technologies like palm tops I do not think have any assistive technologies,
so it maybe impossible for it to be compatible with assistive technology.
If it wants to provide access to people with visual impiarments it would
need to directly implement the user agent techniques that appply to Braille
ad Auditory rendering.
