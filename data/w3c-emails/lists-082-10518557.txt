I am not sure if this is the case, and I doubt that it will continue to be
the case. Palmtops are capable of interfacing with computer devices, and
could be used for example to provide assistive access to kiosks, ATMs and
other public information devices. They are also, in essence, little
computers which can run software. Since they could be used as a personal
assistive device, a User agent designed for a palmtop should where
possible provide an interface. More to the point, if we say now that this
is not necessary, and then decide in a year or two that it would have been
a good idea, we are doing a disservice to developers. If we think that it
is not very useful now, but we expect it to be necessary in two years, we
should flag that by requiring it 'where possible'. That provides a
common-sense test. It also notifies designers now that their products may
have to be extended to provide a particular functionality in the future -
this can make life a lot easier than having to retrofit accessibility into
a product afterwards.
