In response to Al Gliman,

The intent of the User Agent Types was to define the functional output
meida capabilities of different types of user agent technologies and the
examples were only intended to give informational material on the current
commercial technologyies that would need to pay attention to a particular
user agent type specification.  There is not intent to have "Explorer" or
"Navigator" user agent type, but there are user agents that render their
information on a graphical screen (at least 640x48), have a 102 key
keyboard interface, pointer and etc.. that can can have built-in
accessibility features that are particular to these characteristics.
Different media types have features that are needed for that media type.

Our strategy for asssitive technology ahould be to help them understand W3C
technologies and how to use it in their products to make the WWW more
accessible. Therefore a screen reader could use DOM technology already
available to create a audio or Braille rendering of a document, rather than
have the screen reader try to read information off the screen and have the
user agent implement some tricks to make the visual rendering more
"compatible" with a screen reader.  As in my previous messages, I think
these tricks would be difficult for developers to accept and therefore take
a long time to get implemented by many developers.  In many cases the
rendering features or "tricks" may not even be needed or appropriate by the
time they would be implemented.  I think our energy is better spent getting
W3C specifications implemented and providing information to assistive
technology vendors on how to use the specifications in their products.  The
assistive technology therefore becomes the user agent to access the WWW
document in a way that will be much more robust and usable than looking at
a complex interaction of screen renderings, user agent controls and
assistive technology controls.   

Mainstream developers role in this process by implementing W3C standards
(or at least important one for accessibility), including accessibility
features related to the media types they directly support (visual,
auditory)  and incorporating operating system accessibility standards into
their products.  

But if a technology does not provide auditory rendering or element
information, then I don't think we should require them to implement a whole
bunch of features that only are useful for auditory rendering.  I think
this was the consensus of the Face-to-Face meeting.  If the user agent does
start supporting auditory rendering then it wil need to support the
accessibility features of that user agent media type.  

In terms of employment and education I think that providing accessible WWW
technology in the most expedient time frame is our part in that process.
If we develop guidelines that industry does not find useful, then
implementation will be slow and difficult.  By defining user agent types
that developers can easily recognize for their product, I think they will
feel much more comfortable knowing what their role is and will find the
guidelines more palitable.  But if we ask every developer to solve all
accessibility problems, I think we will have an uphill battle to get the
guidelines implemented and to get the developer community to participate in
the WAI process.   This does not serve the purpose of employment and
educational access.

Maybe we should rename the user agent types to user agent media types, to
make it clearer that the types are related to rendering media capabilities?  

Does anybody think that would help?
