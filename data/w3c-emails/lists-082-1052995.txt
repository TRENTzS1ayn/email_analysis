Jon,

This is part of a larger issue of how to include
XML in HTML and vice-versa and is meant to be addressed by a
future HTML Working Group. I believe the current recommended practice
is to use OBJECT:

      <OBJECT data="partderiv.mathml">
            This is a partial derivative ...
      </OBJECT>

The Math subgroup should stay in touch with the 
HTML Coordination Group to help them keep track of progress in
this area.
