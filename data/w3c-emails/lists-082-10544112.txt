In response to charles.
In my interpretation of the user agent types, if a palmtop has
text-to-speech capabilites and uses text-to-speech to render the a WWW
document then to be compatible with the guidelines it must implement the
user agent type techniques associated with auditory rendering.  Whether it
is done by the developer or through assistive technology, the guidelines
would not care.  The guidelines only care about the funcational user
interface as the result for that user agent media type.  

I am not sure how many palmtop developers would include text-to-speech for
just disability access. But since there are many other reasons to include
text-to-speech capabilities, let us have guidelines for that media type to
help them make it accessible to people with disabilities that can beenfit
from that media type.  It is the media type that is important, not whether
it is a plamtop or desktop; naive or through assistive technology that is
important for our guidelines.  Although we may want to have a media type
that is related to the LCD displays found on palmtop devices.

I do agree that palmtops are potentially very useful to persons with
disabilities for many types of tasks, but we need to focus on WWW access.
There are other groups that are working on some of the other issues you
mention.  If you or others are interested, I would suggest contacting the
trace center.  I beleive they are doing a lot of work on access that
includes palmtop technologies (www.trace.wisc.edu).  We may want to
consider having a Kiosk media type that could reference the use of palmtop
technology for Kiosks based on WWW technology.  But I think this should not
be a primary task at this time.
