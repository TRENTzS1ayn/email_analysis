I'm not sure the revised name is the right one, but I think you are on the
right track.

If we back up and look at the web as it exists, we can say that it contains
a number of different media.  There is text content, there are graphics
(some of which look like text, but are not), there are sounds, there are
videos, animations, and, in the future, equations.  Each of these media
contains information.

The role of a user agent is to make that information available to the user
in a format that is apprehensible to the end user.  Not all user agents
render all forms of content.  In fact, some agents may be nothing more than
switch boards, sending content to the appropriate helper application, and
not rendering anything intrinsically.

The guidelines should focus, I think, on the concept that a user agent that
renders any particular type of medium should render it in a fashion that is
as inclusive as possible, and not, by design or inadvertence, exclude any
population of users.  (Note that populations are different that single,
worse-case situations.)  Since many of the designers of user agents are, at
best, clueless about the needs of people with disabilities, the role of the
guidelines is to make the developers aware of the issues involved in
rendering different types of media, and to *suggest* strategies to make that
rendering as inclusive as possible.  Whether the specific technique used is
the one suggested in the guidelines document or not is irrelevant.  The
issue is whether an individual with a disability has access to the
information being conveyed by the medium being rendered.

This has significant implications for the focus and target of the document,
I think.  We would want to say, "If your user agent renders this type of
medium, then it should do so in a way that allows the following
functionality..."  Providing that functionality might be native, or it might
be through providing an interface that could be used by third party AT to
provide the functionality.  However, if your user agent does not render this
content at all, then ignore this issue.  If your user agent hosts embedded
applications to render the technology, then you must also provide a means to
setting the point of regard on the embedded agent, and recovering the point
of regard into the host UA.

Subject: Re: PROPOSAL(revised): User Agent Types

In response to Al Gliman,

The intent of the User Agent Types was to define the functional output
meida capabilities of different types of user agent technologies and the
examples were only intended to give informational material on the current
commercial technologyies that would need to pay attention to a particular
user agent type specification.  There is not intent to have "Explorer" or
"Navigator" user agent type, but there are user agents that render their
information on a graphical screen (at least 640x48), have a 102 key
keyboard interface, pointer and etc.. that can can have built-in
accessibility features that are particular to these characteristics.
Different media types have features that are needed for that media type.

Our strategy for asssitive technology ahould be to help them understand W3C
technologies and how to use it in their products to make the WWW more
accessible. Therefore a screen reader could use DOM technology already
available to create a audio or Braille rendering of a document, rather than
have the screen reader try to read information off the screen and have the
user agent implement some tricks to make the visual rendering more
"compatible" with a screen reader.  As in my previous messages, I think
these tricks would be difficult for developers to accept and therefore take
a long time to get implemented by many developers.  In many cases the
rendering features or "tricks" may not even be needed or appropriate by the
time they would be implemented.  I think our energy is better spent getting
W3C specifications implemented and providing information to assistive
technology vendors on how to use the specifications in their products.  The
assistive technology therefore becomes the user agent to access the WWW
document in a way that will be much more robust and usable than looking at
a complex interaction of screen renderings, user agent controls and
assistive technology controls.

Mainstream developers role in this process by implementing W3C standards
(or at least important one for accessibility), including accessibility
features related to the media types they directly support (visual,
auditory)  and incorporating operating system accessibility standards into
their products.

But if a technology does not provide auditory rendering or element
information, then I don't think we should require them to implement a whole
bunch of features that only are useful for auditory rendering.  I think
this was the consensus of the Face-to-Face meeting.  If the user agent does
start supporting auditory rendering then it wil need to support the
accessibility features of that user agent media type.

In terms of employment and education I think that providing accessible WWW
technology in the most expedient time frame is our part in that process.
If we develop guidelines that industry does not find useful, then
implementation will be slow and difficult.  By defining user agent types
that developers can easily recognize for their product, I think they will
feel much more comfortable knowing what their role is and will find the
guidelines more palitable.  But if we ask every developer to solve all
accessibility problems, I think we will have an uphill battle to get the
guidelines implemented and to get the developer community to participate in
the WAI process.   This does not serve the purpose of employment and
educational access.

Maybe we should rename the user agent types to user agent media types, to
make it clearer that the types are related to rendering media capabilities?

Does anybody think that would help?
