Jon,

I think, though, that we still need to focus on the type of content that is
being rendered, not on the characteristics of the agent that is doing the
rendering.  If you decide to develop a UA for the Palm Pilot, for example
(and there is one), you decide that some types of content are not going to
be rendered.  And, you decide that that is acceptable.  But you also make
decisions about how you are going to render those things that you will
render.  The guidelines should say, in effect, if you render this type of
content in these ways, or with these functionalities, then you include the
widest possible number of  users, and that is the goal.

In response to Denis Anson:
In my original message on this topic I do have two categories.  One for
rendering element text as speech and another for rendering multi-media
content.  I agree we need different requirements for multi-media vs. speech
rendering for text.

Please review my orginal posting on user agent types:
