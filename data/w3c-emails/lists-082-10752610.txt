The table navigation, rendering and orientation issue has been a
particularly difficult issue for the UA group to resolve.  To help resolve
table issues I think we need to:

1. Define the media contexts that features are designed to enhance.
2. Checkpoints define the problem and not specific resolution of the issue.
3. Use the technique documents to suggest implementation techniques.

During the face-to-face meeting last month a small group of people was
given the task of coming up with some new ideas for the checkpoints related
to tables.  I would like to use their results and the results of
discussions on the list and telecons as the basis of a proposal for
discussion during the week and at the next teleconference on Wednesday.  

Please take the time to review this proposal and comment, or to submit your
own proposals or counter proposals.  Let's try to get the issues all on the
table before the telecon next week.

Checkpoint 1: Allow a user using an auditory, Braille and/or visually
enlarged rendering of a document to view the information in a single table
cell.

Checkpoint 2: Provide a user using an auditory, Braille and/or visually
enlarged rendering of a document commands to move the rendering focus
between table cells.

Checkpoint 3: Provide a user using an auditory, Braille and/or visually
enlarged rendering of a document an option to have header information
viewed as part of the table cell rendering.

Checkpoint 4: Provide a user using an auditory, Braille and/or visually
enlarged rendering of a document a command to view the header information
associated with a table cell.

Checkpoint 5: Provide a user using an auditory, Braille or visually
enlarged rendering of a document a command to view the summary information
of the current table.

Checkpoint 6: Provide a user using an auditory, Braille or visually
enlarged rendering of a document the ability to search for text in the
current table. 

Checkpoint 7: Provide a user using an auditory, Braille or visually
enlarged rendering of a document the ability to view the nesting
relationships of nested tables.

Checkpoint 8: Provide a user using an auditory, Braille or visually
enlarged rendering of a document commands to move the rendering focus
between nested tables.


Checkpoints 1,2,3,4 and 5 may be also good to think about in relation to
access to frames.

Sorry this is a day late but my daughter was sick yesterday.
Look forward to your comments,
Jon
