I think you hit upon some central issues.

1. The inclusion of rendering medium in the checkpoint.  I think we need
this, otherwise as long as a user agent renders a table cell (no matter
what medium) it will satisfy the checkpoint.  

2. I used the word "view" to indicate the presentation of orientation
information (either automatically or on command) and "command" to indcate
the user control over changing the focus.

3. I think in the case of nested tables we want to make sure that the user
can be oriented to the tables and navigated between the nested tables.
