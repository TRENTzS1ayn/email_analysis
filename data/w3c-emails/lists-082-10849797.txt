I simply don't understand the proposal.  It appears that all the
Checkpoints, from 1 through 8 only apply to specialized browsers and not
mainstream browsers such as Internet Explorer.  Am I understanding this
correctly?

If so, why are we telling folks like pwWebSpeak how to implement their
product?  Isn't it assumed that specialized browsers will take care of their
specialized audience?  I'm my impression that the problem of access to the
web is with the mainstream browsers that are often times forced on students
and employees.

Am I on the right track here, or have I been gone too long and missed too
much discussion.  Feel free to email me privately if you choose, or publicly
on the list.

I would like to see more discussion about table issues.  This has been a
BIG issue for the group.  Please see the issues list for background
information and a list of recent e-mails on the topic.

There is a proposal for discussion at:
