CMN:: Not quite. The way I read Magnified screen means that a large font
size (say 48+ point, although there is no good way of defining this) on a
'mainstream browser' would qualify - in which case they all apply to IE,
unless you make it restrict available font sizes. I don't think that is
the intended result. Hence my 'counter proposal' (I know it is long, but I
did think quite hard before I wrote it, so I hope people will actually
read to the end. Or even read the proposal itself, which is quite short,
and skip the preamble)
