Agreed.

I think you're on the right track as far as where we should be
heading, but you're on the wrong track as far as where you assume the
WG is heading.

In other words, what you believe is the best track as any given point
(which happens to be what I believe is also the right track) is not
necessarily what the WG believes is the best track.


Even before we discuss TABLE navigation issue, we should decide as a
group if we need a more focused charter for this group.

The current charter is being reworked by W3C staff and the chair, so
it might be a good time to act.

The current charter has a broad scope in terms of what kind of User
Agent it considers, and although I think it's important we produce
guidelines for everybody, from voice agent to kiosque, I think it's
even more important that we do mainstream browser first.

Therefore I would suggest we recharter to have 2 deliverables:
mainstream browser guidelines, and any user agent guidelines.

Even Einstein did his Relativity theory in two deliverables :-)
