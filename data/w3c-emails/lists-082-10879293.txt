Rather than think in terms of font size, it might make more sense to think
in terms of viewport bandwidth.  By which I mean, if the display shows less
than 40 characters per line, and fewer than 12 lines on the screen at a
time.

The advantage of thinking in these terms is that we address the real issue,
which is the fact that the browser can render only a small amount of
information at a time.  This would include screen magnified browsers, large
font sizes, and small screen sizes also.

I recognize that modern displays can't be thought of in terms of 80x24
character grids, but that does convey, in a general way, the issues of
limited window size.

CMN:: Not quite. The way I read Magnified screen means that a large font
size (say 48+ point, although there is no good way of defining this) on a
'mainstream browser' would qualify - in which case they all apply to IE,
unless you make it restrict available font sizes. I don't think that is
the intended result. Hence my 'counter proposal' (I know it is long, but I
did think quite hard before I wrote it, so I hope people will actually
read to the end. Or even read the proposal itself, which is quite short,
and skip the preamble)
