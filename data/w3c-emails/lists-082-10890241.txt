Chuck,

I think that the issues raised to apply to main stream browsers that want to
provide functionality via third party assistive technology.  The reason that
table navigation is such a hassle is that many screen readers read the
display, as that is the only way to get the information out of a program.
And, as such, as we all know, they tend to read all of one line of a row of
cells, then all of the next line of the row of cells, etc.

The issues 1 - 4 of the table navigation list mandate that all browsers
provide a means of accessing cell contents as discrete units, independent of
display on the screen.  For IE to be compatible with screen readers, it
would need to provide some mechanism for the screen reader to extract the
information a cell at a time, along with the relevant header information.

I would say that a large part of the purpose of these guidelines is to point
out the issues of access that browser designers need to address.  Many
designers do not have a firm grasp on the issues of disability access, and
even those who develop specialty browsers may think in terms on just one or
two disability types.  By describing the issues in broader terms, we can
help designers to expand on their view of the potential users of their
products.

I simply don't understand the proposal.  It appears that all the
Checkpoints, from 1 through 8 only apply to specialized browsers and not
mainstream browsers such as Internet Explorer.  Am I understanding this
correctly?

If so, why are we telling folks like pwWebSpeak how to implement their
product?  Isn't it assumed that specialized browsers will take care of their
specialized audience?  I'm my impression that the problem of access to the
web is with the mainstream browsers that are often times forced on students
and employees.

Am I on the right track here, or have I been gone too long and missed too
much discussion.  Feel free to email me privately if you choose, or publicly
on the list.

I would like to see more discussion about table issues.  This has been a
BIG issue for the group.  Please see the issues list for background
information and a list of recent e-mails on the topic.

There is a proposal for discussion at:
