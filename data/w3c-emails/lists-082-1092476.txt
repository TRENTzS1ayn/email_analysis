Currently reads as follows:
<<
User option to include the text contents of LONGDESC links to be included in
text searches of the current page. If the search text is found in a LONGDESC
link, the focus should be changed to the LONGDESC link on the current page
>>

That's a lot of overhead!  Asking the UA to open and then search for strings
inside of other pages is somewhat extreme.  Given how LONGDESC is proposed,
I'm not certain that this is a useful feature, regardless of it's priority.
