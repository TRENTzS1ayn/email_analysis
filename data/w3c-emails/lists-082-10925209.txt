I think this material is more suitable for the PF list than for UA,
even if it's just FYI.

I think this analysis is missing the role of the UA in the middle.

In any table, the user may want help to navigate, this help is
normally provided by the UA, but if the table is too complex (and the
number of column/row is irrelevant as far as the UA is concerned),
then the UA needs help from the author, using TD/TH binding, etc.
