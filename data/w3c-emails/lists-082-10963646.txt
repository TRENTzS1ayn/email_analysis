Chuck,

It has always been my opinion that if we focus on the functionality that
must be provided, and not on the methods to produce that functionality, then
the same rules can be applied to mainstream browsers, kiosks, and other
specialty settings.  It's no less important to have access to the
information in other settings, just the implementation methods change.

The current charter has a broad scope in terms of what kind of User
Agent it considers, and although I think it's important we produce
guidelines for everybody, from voice agent to kiosque, I think it's
even more important that we do mainstream browser first.

Agreed.  The problem that the WG needs to solve is with mainstream
*browsers* first, mainstream media players next and then investigate other
types of user agents.

That's my opinion of course.
