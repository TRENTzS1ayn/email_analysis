Some comments:
<<
2.2 Criteria for success 
Criteria for success of user agent WG include: 
Adoption of guidelines by user agent developers 
Inproved [sic] access to the WWW by persons with disabilities 
>>

How do we measure success?  Items 2 "improved access to the WWW by PWD" is
really vague and unmeasurable.

Also:

<<
13.0 Level of involvement of Team 
5% Ian Jacobs 
5% Daniel Dardailler 
5% Judy Brewer 
>>

In my opinion, 5% of someone's time is unrealistic for meaningful input.  If
meaningful input is not expected, then change to reflect that.
