In response to Charles Oppermann,
I do not see anything wrong with user agents like IE or Navigator providing
APIs for other (assistive) technoloiges.  Personally, I think that the
fastest way to improve accessibility of the WWW for people with blindness
is to help assistive technology developers understand interfaces like the
DOM to provide alternative user interfaces to the information.   Wilson
Craig of Henter-Joyce is very excited about the possibility and we are
trying to schedule workshops at ATIA events for assistive technology
developers this summer and in the fall. 
 
Would you or other people at Microsoft be interested in helping with these
workshops?

But I feel the guidelines should reflect what the user needs.  Mainstrean
browsers that do not provide a checkpoint feature natively could provide an
interface to allow an assistive technology to provide the checkpoint and
that would be an available response to a particular checkpoint available to
a developer.
