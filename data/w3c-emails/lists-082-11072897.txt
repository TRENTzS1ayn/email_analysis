A generic definition would be a Web UA targeted for use on a standard
desktop platform with: graphical screen, keyboard, mouse, audio (I'm
sure the PC industry has a definition of a standard desktop somewhere,
we don't need to redefine that), primarily by non disabled users.

A specific definition is: one of 
  - Netscape Navigator, Microsoft Internet Explorer
  - any other that compete with these two (Opera, IBM WebExplorer, etc)

A corrolary of these definitions is that a mainstream browser, as
Chuck Opperman said on the list,"is often times forced on students and
employees." who would otherwise use more specialized user agents best
suited to their needs.
