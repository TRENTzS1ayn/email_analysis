In response to "mainstream" browser definition:
I think the main problem here is determining the scope fo the guidelines.
My impression of the consensus of the group is to define the guidelines and
checkpoints  based on user centered accessibility issues, rather than a
mainstream browser centered problem document.  The techniques document
would be the place to talk about implementation ideas for different types
of user agents (i.e. main stream, Web TV, assistive technologies,
specialized browsers).  

Therefore talking about a mainstream browser does not make sense to me give
the recent discussions of the group.  If you did not participate or review
the discussion on conformance and user types, please do so before
responding to this discussion.

We need to bring this "scoping" issue to a close and I propose that the
next telecon we revisit this topic and try to bring it to resolution once
and for all.
