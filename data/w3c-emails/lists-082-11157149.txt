The following are proposed changes to the working draft contents based on
discussions at the F2F meeting in Boston on 11-12 December.

Section 3.1 Ensure that the interface is accessible

Combine Technique 3.1.1, 3.1.2 and 3.1.3.  The resulting technique should
include the following principles:

1. Functionalities of a user agent should be available through redundent
and device independent operation
2. User agents should use the principles of accessible design
3. Accessibility also includes installation and updating utilities for the
user agent

Section 3.2 Ensure the user agent accessibility features are configurable

Technique 3.2.1 eliminate, covered in Section 6.2

Technique 3.2.3  Change from priority 1 to priority 2 

Section 3.3 Ensoure that users can disable features that might interfere
with accessibility

Technique 3.3.9 Change from priority 1 to priority 2.  User agent should be
able to render frames in an accessible manner.

Section 3.4 Provide documentation about accessibility feature and ensure
the documentation is accessible

Technique 3.4.1, 3.4.2 and 3.4.3: Change from priority 1 to priority 2.
Was not felt that this was critical for access to user agent, but was still
very important.

Section 3.5 Provide summary information about keyboard access

Technique 3.5.1 Priority 1 to priority 2.  Was not considered critical for
using keyboard short cuts, but still important for user visibility.


Section 3.6 Allow users to interact with the document in a device
independent manner

Technique 3.6.3  No consensus, but there was motion to remove the
technique, since it is primarily the responsibility of the page author to
make pages that respond to user actions accessible.

Section 4.1 Allow the user to control document styles

Technique 4.1.5 Change from foreground and background color to presentation
style.     This term is rendering media independent.

Technique 4.1.6 Change from foreground and background color to presentation
style.     This term is rendering media independent.

Technique 4.1.7 Remove.  It is enough for the user to be able to turn them
off.

Technique 4.1.8 Change from priority 1 to priority 2: User can turn off
animations if they cannot be used as intended by the author.  Author should
also have alternative representation.  

The technique should includ controls for stop/start, rewind and variable
speed slow motion.

Technique 4.1.10 Does this technique need to include the ability to
maintain pitch.

Technique 4.1.15 Change from priority 1 to priority 2

Technique 4.1.16 change from priority 1 to priority 2

Section 4.2 Provide access to alternative representations of content and
control of its rendering

Technique 4.2.2 Change priority from 1 to priority 2.  Not considered
critical.

Technique 4.2.8 Change priority from 1 to priority 2.  Not considered
critical.

Technique 4.2.9 Change priority from 1 to priority 2.  Not considered
critical.

Technique 4.2.10 Change priority from 1 to priority 2.  Not considered
critical.

Technique 4.2.11 Change priority from 1 to priority 2.  Not considered
critical for a large enough population.

Technique 4.2.12 Change priority from 1 to priority 2.  Not considered
critical for a large enough population.

Section 4.3

Technique 4.3.1and Technique 4.3.2 should be removed.  They do not address
the issue adequately for both short and long term solutions. 

Section 5.1 Provide information about the content and strucutre of a
document and the user interface

Technique 5.1.1 Priority 2, not considered critical, the user could find
this information in other ways

Technique 5.1.1 Priority 2, not considered critical, the user could find
this information in other ways

Technique 5.1.1 Priority 2, not considered critical, the user could find
this information in other ways

Technique 5.1.1 Priority 3, not considered critical.  There are much more
difficult issues relating to access to table information.

Section 5.2 Provide information about document view and point of regard

Technique 5.2.1 Change from priority 1 to priority 2

Technique 5.2.2 Remove since it is a basic part of what a user agent does
if it provides the capability

Technique 5.2.4 Change from priority 1 to priority 2

Technique 5.2.4 Change from priority 1 to priority 2.  Change from point of
regard to selection and focus of the document

Section 5.4 Allow sequential keyboard navigation to structures within a
document

Combine Techniques 5.4.1, 5.4.2 and 5.4.3 and use the term active element
(link, form control, longdesc links)

Section 5.5 Allow keyboard navigation of the document and views of the
document

Technique 5.5.2 Remove

5.6 Allow the user to search for information on the page

Searches are not required for access, but are considered very helpful and
therefore are priority 2s.  

Technique 5.6.1 Change from priority 1 to priority 2

Technique 5.6.2 Change from priority 1 to priority 2

Technique 5.6.3 Change from priority 1 to priority 2

Technique 5.6.4 Change from priority 1 to priority 2

Technique 5.6.5 Change from priority 1 to priority 2

Section 6.1 support language accessibility features

Add technique for full DOM1 implementation to be used as an API by
assistive technologies

Section 6.2 use and provide accessible interfaces to other technologies

Combine techniques 6.2.3 and 6.2.4 


If you have any comments on these changes to the document please review the
