There are some techniques people have used to measure this.  At
the Federal WWW Consortium Seminar on Universal Access last
Tuesday, Educational Testing Service (the people who brought you
the SAT) briefed what they have done as a part of quality
improvement project for the accessibility of their web
publishing.  They have an approach to consolidating user
evaluations that seems to make some sense.  There is also some
work out of Cork, I hear.

I suppose the questions are:  Do we want to listen to actual
users?  If so, how?

This is one area where it will be good to coordinate with the
Evaluation and Repair Interest Group.  The WAI may or may not be
organizing user testing, but somebody is going to be doing it
somewhere, and we probably want to make it part of our plan to
find out what they are learning and use that knowledge here.
