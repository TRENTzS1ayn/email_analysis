What is to be tested?  Existing browsers, mockups, paper walkthroughs? Who
will run these tests?

It should be expected that the browser developer perform usability testing
of their own product (we do, I am sure the others do too), which is
inclusive of the intended user population. When we hit design issues we
can't resolve ourselves, we turn to outside research. If we can help explore
an issue through quick changes in our code, we are more than happy to do so.

The WAI setting up usability testing is not the answer.  Facilitating the
exchange of information between the groups doing this work is a better use
of resources.

Perhaps we can say in 2.1:  "Identify and develop resources to support the
implementation of the user agent guidelines by developers.  This includes
industry, governmental, and university groups who will participate in the
exchange of information and research findings relevant to guideline
implementation."

If we need to include "evaluation" in 2.1, perhaps it should be based on
6.2, where it says the guidelines are:
"... consensus-based, technically sound, and reflect the most current
technology."
This implies some analysis/evaluation led to the adoption of given
guideline.

Where we don't have any findings (or where they are unclear) it would be
of value to have a "hit list" of design issues in need of research, which
are not presently addressed by any group.
