Hi

We've done a quick once-over your list (URL below), and believe you have
a very good list.  There may be some re-wording or re-organizing you
can do, as per Charles M. 's response, but  we think your checkpoints
are solid and agree with the priorities you've suggested.

As an FYI, we are hoping to "complete" several "proof of concept" tools which
deal directly with your checkpoints 4.3.x, 5.5.x, and 5.2.x, and add to them
to the Trace web site by the end of next week.
