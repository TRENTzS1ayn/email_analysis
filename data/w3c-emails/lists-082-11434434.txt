JRG: There was discussion on this issue yesterday at the telecon.  I think
that this checlpoint will need further revision and it may not make it in
the final draft.  It is an attempt to use the built-in scripting
capabilities to create user defined custom interface for people with
disabilities or to provide compatibility with legacy technology.  There was
concern in the call yesterday that this was maybe too specific of
checkpoint and  reads more like a technique .  Personally I think this kind
of feature allows the development of more grass roots solutions and allow
current AT developers a bridge to better interfaces.  But we shall see what
happens.

JRG: I think embedded technoloies are important and our work shouldn't
ingnore the issues, but right now I think we need to keep the desktop
graphical user agent as our  primary model for access.  In the case of
embedded application environments, there are usually accessibility APIs the
assistive technology is also using that could identify the embedded HTML
and pass on the DOM to the assistive technology.

JRG: Our current guidelines require that the user have the final control
over font rendering by asking that the user be able to turn off author
supplied font information.
