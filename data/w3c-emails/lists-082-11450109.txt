There were several points raised at the teleconference yesterday
on this topic. The most important, in my opinion, was that the proposed
checkpoint can be generalized and that users should
have final say over scripts. The guidelines already state that users
should 
have the final say about styles. This would extend that control to
scripts.

The W3C CSS and FP Working Group is currently working on proposals 
(called "Behaviors" and "Action Sheets") that would allow users 
(and authors) to associate scripts with elements and event handlers 
in a manner very similar to style sheets (using selectors, for example). 

I have sent email to the Chair of that Working Group indicating 
a possible dependence with WAI on this matter.
