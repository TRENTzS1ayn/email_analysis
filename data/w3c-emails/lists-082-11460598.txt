The CSS1 Recommendation runs as Denis says. This was changed in CSS2,
which became a recommendation in mid 1998, to give the author final
control.

We should suggest that CSS is used to implement a number of the
checkpoints, and that if this is done then the CSS2 Cascade order should
be used, not that of CSS1.

  JRG: Our current guidelines require that the user have the final control
  over font rendering by asking that the user be able to turn off author
  supplied font information.
