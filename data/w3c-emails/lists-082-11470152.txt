Modifiers for Accesskeys will be dependent on the keyboard model of the
operating system and therefore would be difficult to assign a standard of
"ALT".  Even with operating systems with the "ALT" key some operating
system already assign values to some of the keys.

I think one of the major issues with Accesskeys is that the accesskey
information be rendered visually on the disaplay so people know that there
is an accesskey he available.  This could be done by underlining the
character in the label of the control or link associated with the
accesskey.  If the accesskey is not a part of the label, then the user
agent could add the letter in parenthesis after the label or link.
