Minutes by: Jim Allen

1. Charter comments

Define success - must be measurable, some comments that current definition is
vague

Usability testing-no mechanism (financial) in group, without recommendation
can't test.  Some manufatures are testing, ua group needs to tap into testing 

Suggestion that UA group should try to encourage, coordinate and compile
results of UA testing

Milestones - 6 month goals
Draft in September, recommendation by January or
Jon's preference - Rec. for html 4 and css by October, with update by January 
- no disagreement from group
Discussion--Jon will check with Judy about need for implementation of
guidelines

2. f2f meeting-kitch to chair meeting, agenda
        draft charter
        issues list-a) longdesc/dlink and object, b) semantic markup to adjust
presentation - how to id purpose of table - data or layout, c) rel
attribute in
link - how they should work (nav bar, toc) popup list, d) xml--mathml, smil,
implications

3. Issues list-format of page, resolution should reference working draft...
page for smil and mathml subgroup-not chartered, report back to ua group, work
done is incorporated in ua-group. Chair to maintain subgroup page, download
page edit directly send to Jon for posting.

Dlink, longdesc, object--last time- simplify, 
Image tag - recommend Use of longdesc, no dlink, rel, etc.
Image that are embedded in objects - e.g. graph that is activex control,
dynamic
        Use inner text as alternative text and a hard coded dlink if wanted
David-people have problems with dlink, should be hidden by default and show
only if asked for
What if you want object and text simultaneously
How to display, consistency between display of image, and object
        Authoring guidelines suggest dlinks for backward compatibility with
older browsers, should use longdesc for HTML 4.0. Most authors will not use
OBJECT for images since object is not backward compatible with older browsers.
Jon-UA shouldn?t  deal with dlink, have object display what ever is in the
inner text. Alt and longdesc put in inner text of object if someone wants to
use OBJECT for images. Object is generic item. If the user cannot get
information from the object what information should be displayed to the user. 
Simultaneaity of inner text and object- david rather have user control of
display.
        Toggle-show inner text as caption below object-discuss on list

4. semantic markup-use rel to semantically generate list
