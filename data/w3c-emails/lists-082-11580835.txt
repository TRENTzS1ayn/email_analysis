This will be an ongoing process with bridges like MSAA. You never get all
the information you need because it is too much effort to expose all the
information that resides natively. Like MSAA, the Sun Java accessibility
bridge for Windows assistive technologies does have the same limitations.

What these accessibility bridges do is package up what the authors think
people will need and it is often the case that information that could have
been made available is lost to the assistive technology.

The one thing we do need is a very comprehensive accessible DOM interface
that can be supported by browsers while they extend their DOM
implementation to meet their needs.

JRG: I think we can look into this, just as we have for HTML and CSS.  You
are right what we really want implemented are the parts of DOM that
critical for accessibility.

Is this something that you would be willing to write a proposal?

JRG: Much of the current Microsoft implmentation of DOM is already exposed.
 By your response it indicates that some parts of DOM are not currently
accessible be external processes.  Again what we want are the parts that
are critical for accessibility to be available.

JRG: This was discussed in the telecon yesterday and will be refined.  But
this checkpoint is for Assistive Technology Conformance and would not need
to be provided by the Desktop Graphical User Agent.

JRG: Use the first row or first row and column of a table as assumed
headers, even though they may just be TD elements.  It is a repair strategy
for incomplete table markup of header information by the author.
