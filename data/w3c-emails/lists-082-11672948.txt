I still think the WG shuld say "Implement DOM Level 1" even
if that doesn't solve the entire problem today. This would be
one of the WG's choices that refers to future solutions, not
legacy solutions.

I agree that without exporting the DOM, its utility is reduced.
I propose that we (again) invite someone from the DOM WG to
enlighten us during a teleconf.
