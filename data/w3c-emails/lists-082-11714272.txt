I don't think they need to think of DOM as a special case, just a different
case or representation of information being rendered.  Your demonstrations
of the intergration of HTML into a wide variety of applications at the F2F
meetings would indicate that the is a place for a content model like DOM.
As XML is developed the DOM model will probably become even more important.
