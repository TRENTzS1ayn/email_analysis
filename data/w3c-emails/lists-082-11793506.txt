Is it necessary for WAI to put requirements on what browsers do internally?
 The checkpoints are summarized as:

It would seem that point 2. is sufficient:  expose an interface or
interfaces (we probably want both the scripting and interprogram
interfaces) through which AT can inspect and edit the document, in
accordance with the W3C Recommendation(s) for the DOM.  I am not sure what
a requirement to "implement the DOM" would mean other than in the context
of such an interface.  In its own terms, the DOM is a pattern of features
to be present in an interface.
