What about exposing DOM thru scripting, like JavaScript ?

While not specifically targeted at accessibility, it's very important
that people follow the DOM standard when implementing DHTML stuff.

It's also exposing an interface, a different one, but not to assistive 
technology (at least til AT can be programmed as scriptlet that users
can attach to their user agent)

So maybe "Expose DOM level 1 thru a public interface" is all what is
needed.

Or do we need to have two for
  - exposing thru an external public interface
  - exposing thru a internal script interface
?
