Denis,

In a sense, I agree with you: the issue of interprocess communication
can be seen as an implementation issue. However, making 
support for DOM/exposing the DOM a technique means that it becomes
a non-normative solution. In my opinion, to promote interoperability,
the issue of communication must be addressed in the checkpoints
as well.

This is indeed the approach taken for the large majority of the 
checkpoints: they reflect user needs. As the editor, I still wonder
whether it's best to write the checkpoints with language
that reflects user requirements or UA developer actions. For
the checkpoints to have an impact, I have leaned towards expressing
them in terms of what UA developers must do (while still retaining the
essential that these are to meet user needs).

However, there are a few exceptions to the "rule", including
references to non-human interfaces.

I don't think this is implied, and it's certainly not what is meant.
The idea is: when it is necessary to communicate information to other
agents, use interoperable means. It is not necessary for every
functionality. It may be *useful* to provide programmatic access 
to almost all information provided by a browser, but it is not
the only way to provide access to Web content. 

Promoting interoperability through the DOM is one issue. Deciding
which checkpoints must be implemented natively is another.
