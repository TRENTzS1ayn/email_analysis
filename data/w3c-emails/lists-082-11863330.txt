Denis,

I'm not sure which language you're referring to. The proposal
reads:

This means (and perhaps it needs editorial work if not clear enough)
that the WG will have to choose which checkpoints must be implemented
natively and which may be implemented through an interface. Thus,
conformance depends on some hybrid, which the WG must establish.

Furthermore, conformance for ATs is defined, in exactly the same
way: some combination of natively implemented checkpoints and
communication through an interface. 

This conformance proposal implies two (challenging) tasks for the WG:

 1) Establish two subsets of checkpoints
 2) Decide which ones must be implemented natively.

I hope this addresses your questions.

As mentioned above, conformance is not defined as native implementation
of all checkpoints. Thus, discussing communication through an interface
- The DOM - remains a vital subject for consideration.

The following provision of the conformance proposal can be
tightened up to allow this if the WG desires:

Currently, it reads "should". Making it a "must" would ensure that
other software could implement the other checkpoints that are
not required for conformance. The WG must decide if it wants
to strengthen this requirement.
