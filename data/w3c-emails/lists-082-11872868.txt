It is true that the implementation and exposure of DOM to assitive
technology does not do anything for accessibility unless assistive
technology does something with it.  But from the beginning this group has
wanted to draw lines over what "mainstream" or desktop graphical browsers
need to do and what AT developers will have to work with form the user
agent.  These checkpoints are that line and it is contained in the
compatibility section.  The RATIONALE is to provide access to document
elements to assistive technology.  As long as mainstream browser do this,
they have done their part.  It is up to assisitve technology vendors to do
their part and use the object model to improve functionality.  

If the group doesn't provide clear directions on this issue, I do not think
we will be advancing the accessibility of user agents very much.
