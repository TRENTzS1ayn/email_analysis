The following checkpoints are based on last weeks telecon discusion on
tables conformance for AT.

Checkpoint 5.5.a [Priority 1] Allow users to navigate between cells of a table

Checkpoint 4.3.a [Priority 1] Allow the user to view one table cell at a time

Checkpoint 4.3.b [Priority 1] Allow the user to view header information
associated with a cell

Checkpoint 4.3.c [Priority 2] Allow the user to view assumed headers
associated with a cell

This checkpoint would use the HTML 4.0 header algorithm and other
techniques to determine assumed headers for a table cell.  This can be used
to repair poorly authored pages.

Checkpoint 4.3.d [Priority 2] Allow the user to view the CAPTION element of
a table

Checkpoint 4.3.e [Priority 2] Allow the user to view the SUMMARY attribute
of a table

Checkpoint 4.3.f [Priority 2 or 3] Allow the user to view element
structural information about a table

This checkpoint provides information on the dimensions of the table and
other information like does the table have any header elements defined or
that it is an embedded table.

Checkpoint 4.3.g [Priority 2 or 3] Allow the user to view element
structural information associated with a cell

This checkpoint provides the row and column information for a table cell.
This maybe be useful as a last resort repair strategy for poorly authored
tables. 

Checkpoint 4.3.h [Priority 3] Allow the user to view one table row or
column at a time

This checkpoint is a convience function for access an entire row or column
of information.
