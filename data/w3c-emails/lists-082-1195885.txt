Note: Members of the WAI-UA group have formed a subcommittee to look at browser issues related to MathML. This committee will be using this list to communicate and will use "MathML" (without the quotes) in the subject line so others can pass over these messages if they so desire. If you decide to read these messages, keep in mind that your input is most welcome!

To MathML subcommittee:
I'd like to schedule a conference call next week so we can get this committee off the ground. I know the last thing any of us needs is another conference call, but I think a group meeting is probably the fastest way to get everybody's interest on the table and solidify what this subcommittee wants to do. After this call, we should be able to handle everything via e-mail.

I have checked the W3 conference call schedule for next week and selected two possible meeting times. Tuesday, 7/21 at noon eastern or Wednesday 7/22 at 4PM eastern. Please send a message to me directly to let me know whether any of these times work for you, and your first preference. I'll post the exact meeting time to this list on Monday 7/20.
