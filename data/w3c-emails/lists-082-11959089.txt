In general I think the checkpoints are good.

Specific comments interspersed - see CMN:: and JG::

  The following checkpoints are based on last weeks telecon discusion on
  tables conformance for AT.
  
  Checkpoint 5.5.a [Priority 1] Allow users to navigate between cells of a table

CMN:: 
Does this mean horizontally and vertically? If not then it is made
redundant by 4.3.a (following)

JG::  
  Checkpoint 4.3.a [Priority 1] Allow the user to view one table cell at a time
  
  Checkpoint 4.3.b [Priority 1] Allow the user to view header information
  associated with a cell
  
  Checkpoint 4.3.c [Priority 2] Allow the user to view assumed headers
  associated with a cell
  
  This checkpoint would use the HTML 4.0 header algorithm and other
  techniques to determine assumed headers for a table cell.  This can be used
  to repair poorly authored pages.

CMN::
I would lower the priority of this to 3 and raise the priority of 4.3.h
(below) to priority 2

JG::  
  Checkpoint 4.3.d [Priority 2] Allow the user to view the CAPTION element of
  a table
  
  Checkpoint 4.3.e [Priority 2] Allow the user to view the SUMMARY attribute
  of a table

CMN::
These two could be P1 - I am not sure.

JG::  
  Checkpoint 4.3.f [Priority 2 or 3] Allow the user to view element
  structural information about a table
  
  This checkpoint provides information on the dimensions of the table and
  other information like does the table have any header elements defined or
  that it is an embedded table.
  
  Checkpoint 4.3.g [Priority 2 or 3] Allow the user to view element
  structural information associated with a cell
  
  This checkpoint provides the row and column information for a table cell.
  This maybe be useful as a last resort repair strategy for poorly authored
  tables. 
  
  Checkpoint 4.3.h [Priority 3] Allow the user to view one table row or
  column at a time
  
  This checkpoint is a convience function for access an entire row or column
  of information.

CMN::  It is more than that. It may in fact be a possible technique (or
fragment) for 5.5.a, but it allows the user to easily use the structure of
the table to provide the context which is implicit in a visual rendering.
