It is useful to separate these two issues.

Clearly the highest and best implementation of this checkpoint would allow
the user to set a preference controlling whether the full contents or the
ABBR for each relevant header cell was presented here.  That was the intent
in adding ABBR into HTML4.

The hard part is not so much finding the ABBR in the TH cell but finding
which TH cell pertains.  That is the part that the algorithm in the HTML
spec worries about IIRC.
