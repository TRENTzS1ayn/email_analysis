In response to Scott, 
The object model approach is becoming the standard means for AT companies 
access information, at least in windows. Many vendors are AT already using 
the Active Accessibility to access object models for MS-Word and MS-Excel 
to access information. 

We are contacting ATIA to encourage member companies to review the next 
working draft release. We are contact the ATIA president and trying to get 
his cooperation in helping to get ATIA member companies more interested in 
reviewing and hopefully participating in the working groups.
