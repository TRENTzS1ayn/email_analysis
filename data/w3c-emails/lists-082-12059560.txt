  I am trying to set up a meeting between the UA working group and people
  involved in the Document Object Model (DOM) working group to discuss issues
  related to using DOM as the interface between a user agent and assistive
  technology.  In setting up this meeting, I would like to know who would be
  interested in attending. 
  
  Some potential questions are:
  1. Interface between external programs and DOM
  2. What are the most critical features of DOM for accessibility
  3. User defined scripting interfaces for document rendering
  
  Please let me know as soon as possible.
  
  Thanks,
  Jon
