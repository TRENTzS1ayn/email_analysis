Sure, many screen reader provide a "review" system to allow the user to
freely move a cursor, sometimes the mouse pointer, over items that appear on
the screen.  The user can then request more information about the object.
The accessibility aid uses the "element from point" feature to get a
reference to the object at a particular location on the screen.

Screen magnifiers and alternative input devices also use this feature.
Mouse utilities also use this feature to "know" when to slow down over
certain objects.

That's a common use of hit testing, in addition to what I said above.

Chuck,

Can you explain the value of such a feature? It seems to me that it is
only useful in understanding a particular visual layout (that of the
current display). I fail to see how that information is particularly
valuable in the context of a 'complete' Object Model which gives access to
the various components of the current document.

(By hit testing I am assuming you mean something like determining where a
mouse cursor was when it was clicked. I am not certain that this is what
you mean, which adds to my confusion.)
