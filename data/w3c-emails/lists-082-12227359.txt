This "explosion" of features is exactly what I'm getting at regarding
needing a standard interface for communication with AT devices.  If the back
end of access systems, whether input or output, were standardized, then
products would differentiate themselves in terms of the user interface.  A
screen reader would be noteworthy in terms of ease of use and
configurability of controls rather than the fact that it will read an Excel
spreadsheet or other specific application that may not matter to some set of
users.

Jim--

It's true that quality of table rendering --or any other
form of rendering for that matter can be used by
speech browsers (as with any other browser) to differentiate
a specific tool/user-agent in the market place.

However, this does not necessarily argue in favor of having
a broken world to start with --just so the various
screenreader vendors can compete on the basis of their
specific ideosyncracies and kluges.  I do not think IBM home
page reader would do the above (somewhat dubious/immoral
marketing)-- but I'm afraid screen-reader vendors in general
will simply stick in heuristics that work for specific pages
or popular sites and then market their product on this
basis.

Take the current state of affairs with Windows
screen-readers-- in the last few years, each vendor has
tried to say "we're the best because we can do foo with
application bar" --and the net effect is that most if not
every screen-reader impaired user I know has more than one
screenreader installed --simply because "screenreader foo
works in a desirable manner with application bar --but not
with something else" --the combinatorial explosion of this
mess that would result if access vendors started touting how
well they worked with a specific site or class of sites
e.g. CNN or Time is mind-boggling --the resulting FUD that
would result helps no one.
