Jon,

In general, I agree with these checkpoints, but would suggest a bit of
clarification of 4.3.a.  As written, it suggests that the user might want to
see a cell as the only thing on the screen.  (In fact, this might be true,
but not the norm.)  The actual issue is that the user be able to render the
cell as a discrete element.  There might be other cells rendered at the same
time, but the distinction between one cell and the next *must* be there.
(This might imply, for visual browsers, the ability to turn on borders in a
table where the author had set borders to zero, by the way.)

Subject: PROPOSAL: Checkpoints related to TABLE elements for Conformance
by AT Developers


The following checkpoints are based on last weeks telecon discusion on
tables conformance for AT.

Checkpoint 5.5.a [Priority 1] Allow users to navigate between cells of a
table

Checkpoint 4.3.a [Priority 1] Allow the user to view one table cell at a
time

Checkpoint 4.3.b [Priority 1] Allow the user to view header information
associated with a cell

Checkpoint 4.3.c [Priority 2] Allow the user to view assumed headers
associated with a cell

This checkpoint would use the HTML 4.0 header algorithm and other
techniques to determine assumed headers for a table cell.  This can be used
to repair poorly authored pages.

Checkpoint 4.3.d [Priority 2] Allow the user to view the CAPTION element of
a table

Checkpoint 4.3.e [Priority 2] Allow the user to view the SUMMARY attribute
of a table

Checkpoint 4.3.f [Priority 2 or 3] Allow the user to view element
structural information about a table

This checkpoint provides information on the dimensions of the table and
other information like does the table have any header elements defined or
that it is an embedded table.

Checkpoint 4.3.g [Priority 2 or 3] Allow the user to view element
structural information associated with a cell

This checkpoint provides the row and column information for a table cell.
This maybe be useful as a last resort repair strategy for poorly authored
tables.

Checkpoint 4.3.h [Priority 3] Allow the user to view one table row or
column at a time

This checkpoint is a convience function for access an entire row or column
of information.
