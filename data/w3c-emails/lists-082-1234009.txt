Below is a agenda for Wednesday's conference call at 4PM Eastern. Please feel free to add to this agenda.

I. Introductions (interest in participating in this subcommitee, etc.)

II. Discussion about how user agents will render MathML in the short and long term. Also, are different access solutions required for different UAs such as plug-ins, native support for MathML in mainstream browsers and specialized browsers like PWWebSpeak.

III. Discuss how user agents can reliably convey both semantic and presentation markup to people with disabilities.

IV. Summary and plans for future work.

A couple of sections from the MathML spec that may help facilitate discussion on the topics mentioned above are:
(1) http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-math/chapter1.html#sec2.1.1
(2) http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-math/chapter7.html#sec7.1.2
The first URL contains a paragraph on presentation and semantic markup. The second URL looks at interface issues.

Talk with you on Wednesday.
