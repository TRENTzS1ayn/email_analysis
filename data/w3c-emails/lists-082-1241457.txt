This is in response to an (eclosed below) message to the GL list 

I think that pop up windows should go to User 
Agents too, not only to authoring guidelines.

What I do to avoid them is that I turn off JavaScript and Java.

It would have been better if browsers could have been configured 
to disable/customize particular scripting functions.

I suspect though that this can be put in a User agent guidelines,
only after there is a DOM spec. recommendation.
