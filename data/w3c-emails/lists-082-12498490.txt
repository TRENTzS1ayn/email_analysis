I think we are talking about two kinds of access:
 1) Access through the user interface
 2) Programmatic access.

For case (1), the guideline that requires device-independent
access to all functionalities offered by the user interface
should suffice. 

For case (2), one can distinguish access to the document structure
from control of the user interface proper. I am forwarding the
idea that these guidelines should not address programmatic
control of user interface controls. It would certainly be
interesting to have programmatic control of *everything*, but 
attempting to achieve that would grind the process of producing
these guidelines to a halt. Broad checkpoints such as "Ensure that the
user interface follows principles of accessible design" do
not belong in this document for similar reasons: we should limit
ourselves as much as possible to addressing the accessibility of
the content.

As I've mentioned in an earlier email, we do address the user
interface in several ways:

  - Device-independence (access to functionality, as well
      as installation, configuration, and access to help)
  - Keyboard access
  - Accessible electronic documentation formats
  - Configuration profiles

Thus, user interface issues do appear in the document. However,
I think trying to limit where they appear will enable us to
move forward more rapidly.

I still feel as though general user interface accessibility
issues lie outside the scope of this document. 
Here's a quote from Chuck Opperman from the MIT face-to-face
meeting minutes (11 Dec 1999) [1]:

   <BLOCKQUOTE>
   This is a very difficult problem: making a user
   interface and one that's accessible. Not
   the goal of this group (making content accessible). 
   There are plenty of good references about how to make 
   an interface accessible.
   Don't ignore the issue, just don't want to spent a lot of 
   time on this issue. Use platform guidelines. 
   Let's worry about HTML-specific issues.

Apparently this is an issue that needs resolution at the
next teleconference.

It's always possible to do something wrong. We should try
our best to promote what's right and indicate what's
the wrong way to do something, but we cannot prevent someone
somewhere from doing the wrong thing.
