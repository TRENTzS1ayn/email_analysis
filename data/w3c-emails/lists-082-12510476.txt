Ian,

I agree that we can't keep someone from doing things wrong.  But a broad
guideline that says that the user interface should be accessible via
standard AT devices would at least allow us to say that a developer *has*
done it wrong.  If we ignore the user interface, or say that that is not our
mandate, then it is possible to have a completely compliant browser that is
also completely inaccessible to one or more groups with disabilities,
because they have no access to the control structure of the browser.

I don't suggest that we get into the minutia of the user interface.  I do
suggest that we require standard system calls and AT interfaces where they
exist.

It's always possible to do something wrong. We should try
our best to promote what's right and indicate what's
the wrong way to do something, but we cannot prevent someone
somewhere from doing the wrong thing.
