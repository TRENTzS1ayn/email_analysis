People complain when the checkpoints are vague and too broad.
I propose instead non-normative text to that effect. Such as:

       The topic of accessible user interfaces exceeds the scope 
       of this document; user interfaces must be intuitive, simple, 
       and tested. This document does address aspects of 
       user interface that directly impact accessibility,
including                           device-independence, accessible
product documentation, 
       and configurability.

We cannot guarantee accessibility with this document, however
strong the priorities, checkpoint language, or conformance statement.
A UA *could* comply with these guidelines and be inaccessible, but
that's less likely if the document represents the broad knowledge of the
working group members. A UA could also not comply with these guidelines
and still be accessible. While there are no guarantees, I think
that the more focused the document remains - on content - 
the more effective it will be in promoting accessible UAs.

Perhaps the UA charter needs clarification about the scope
of the guidelines.

I believe we already do that in several checkpoints of section 6.2 of
[1].
