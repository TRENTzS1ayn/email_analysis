In response to RIch's comment
There is no statement that MSAA would be used as a cross plateform
solution.  MSAA is ONE TECHNIQUE developers could use, currently only on
some microsoft windows operating systems,  to provde access to information
about information being rendered to the user agent.  

We would certainly include informaton about other accessibility APIs like
the Java accessibility tool kit for people developing Java based user
agents.  

The key I believe is to state the prblem assistive technology has in
accessing user agent interface information and then use the techniques
document to describe the different methods that can be used to by user
agents and assistive technology to solve the problem.  This allows
inovation in improving the interface.
