I would like to discuss the issues brough up in the recent proposal sent to
the UA list about assistive technology compatibity with user agents.  

I have invited several assistive technology developers to attend the
discussion to get their input to the guidelines.  I think the group needs
their input so that we make sure we reflect their needs in the guidelines
and checkpoints.

People who have already agreed to come tommorrow are:
Glen Gorden, JAWS Screen Reader
Faser Shein, Wivik On-Screen Keyboard
Ben Wiess, ZoomText

I have invited others, but have not received a confirmantion they will attend.
