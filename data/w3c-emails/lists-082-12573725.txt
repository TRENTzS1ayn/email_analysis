I did not say it couldn't be done.  All I said that is that the DOM is for
documents - the implication being "currently."  I truly believe that the DOM
will expand and that HTML will continue to grow into the application space.

However, I'm not going to sign off on a requirement saying "Support all of
DOM" if that isn't a solution to folks.

Let's try to separate out the theoretical from the practical and get back on
track on solving the problems that people have today.
