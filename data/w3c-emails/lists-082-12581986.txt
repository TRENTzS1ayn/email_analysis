I agree that we should be concentrating on providing solutions. However,
I think it has to be said that some of the problems which require
solutions arose because the theoretical aspects had not been considered
early enough in the process, and people became obsessed with 'solving
today's problems' at the expense of careful planning.

The use of DOM is, in my view, such a case. If we expect the DOM to expand
its coverage rapidly, and HTML/XML to become an important component of
many applications, then planning for the use of DOM may provide great
benefit.

Although it is currently 'the extra mile', as Glen said, the choice of DOM
may provide a predictable interoperable interface, which would enable the
next x generations of assistive technology to keep pace with applications,
instead of forever lagging behind. DOM is not the only possible solution,
and there is an open issue about whether some of the problems which it may
help tackle are within the scope of this group. (Personally, I feel that
they are.) But it does appear to have great potential as an important part
of a good solution strategy for a number of problems.

I therefore feel that it is worth thinking very carefully about this
issue. On the other hand I am eagerly awaiting the new draft, as I think
there are several other important issues, some of which may have very
simple solutions, and which also need our attention.

  Let's try to separate out the theoretical from the practical and get back on
  track on solving the problems that people have today.
