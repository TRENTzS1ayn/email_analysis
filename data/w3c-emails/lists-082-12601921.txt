The following assitive technology developers have agreed to join us for
today's
telecon:
Douglas H. Geoffray, GW-Micro
Ben Weiss, AI Squared
Glen Gordon, Henter-Joyce
Fraser Shein, WiVik OnScreen Keyboard 

I would like to give them a warm welcome and thank them for taking the time to
participate in our working group.

The discussion will focus on helping the working group understand the needs of
assistive technology developers in providing alternative renderings of and
input into user agent technology.   Based on their input, the guidelines
should
be a reflection of their needs as much as possible in the sections relating to
assistive technology comaptibility.  

I would like to invite these guests back in two weeks to review and discuss
the
actual checkpoints related to assistive technology compatibility for their
comment. 

The following questions will be the basis of discussion with the AT
developers:
1. What would you want to tell Netscape and other browser developers to make
their products more comaptible with your technologies?
2. From your persective what are the limitations and strengths of current
operating system specific accessibility APIs? 
3. From your perspective what are the limitations and strengths of current
application and document object models?
4. What are the number one priorities for accessibility you would like to see
reflected in the guidelines at this time to user agent developers?
