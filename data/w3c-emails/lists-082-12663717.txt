This was posted to UA because I was suggesting UA look at including access
to information wich can be encoded within graphics (etc) standards (such
as GIF.)

  Actually, it sounds like a checkpoint to me - a thing which Authoring
  Tools "should" do to significantly increase the accesibility of the end
  product. It is certainly not a priority 1. Techniques for this include
  supporting the use of standards which allow information to be encoded with
  it (such as GIF), as well as asking User Agent Guidelines to consider
  providing access to that information.

    This sounds like a technique to me.
    
    The principle is:
    
        "Make it easy for users to suply alternative text."
    
    The technique is:
    
        "...by including default descriptions for things you give them."
    
    Anyone have suggested working for the checkpoint, though?
