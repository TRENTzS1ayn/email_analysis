I want to remind working group members to read the new working draft and
post specific comments about guidelines and checkpoints to the list.  This
draft will be the basis of the proposed recommendation and we want to
collect specific comments and record discusions on the checkpoints and
guidelines from the working group during the next two weeks for revising
this draft.  We will use the telecons as the basis for resolving
outstanding issues.  The comments will be incorporated into a new working
draft for release early next month to other W3C working groups and the WAI
interest group for further comment.

I would also like to publicly thank Ian for all his hard work in generating
this draft.  
Thanks Ian!!!
