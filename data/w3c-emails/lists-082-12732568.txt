The relevance of the proposal to UA was a request to provide extra
information which can be stored in various formats.

As I understand it, GIF, PNG, WebCGM, JPEG, and some other formats allow
textual information to be included in an image. My only experience of this
is GIF, where the information is commonly used to control animations, but
it is also possible to add titles, etc. Where those things are present in
the image (or where the UA supports a given format) that information
should be made available to the user.

Collecting the information is the bit that is relevant to Authoring Tools
but not to user agents.

  I would argue that it is almost a checkpoint.  Checkpoints should be in the
  approximate form of "provide this functionality."  It should be obvious from
  the checkpoint what abilities the checkpoint provides.  Hence, this isn't
  quite there yet.  It is an arbitrary statement that you should "do this,"
  without any explanation of why or to what extent.  It also doesn't define
  what a "professionally written" description is: what profession?  How
  detailed should the description be?
  
  The statement might be rephrased along the lines of: Provide a text-based
  means for the end user to determine the content of multimedia files (e.g.
  clip art).
  
  This phrasing would state the intent of the checkpoint, and be based on
  functionality.  The technique associated with this checkpoint might be
  something like "Provide grammatically correct and descriptively accurate
  text documents and/or meaningful filenames that describe multimedia files.
  
  Now, on the other hand, is this the responsibility of the user agent?  Do
  user *agents*  include clip art and other multimedia files, or do they just
  render them? It seems pointless to require an agent to generate a
  description of files that come from elsewhere.

  Actually, it sounds like a checkpoint to me - a thing which Authoring
  Tools "should" do to significantly increase the accessibility of the end
  product. It is certainly not a priority 1. Techniques for this include
  supporting the use of standards which allow information to be encoded with
  it (such as GIF), as well as asking User Agent Guidelines to consider
  providing access to that information.

    This sounds like a technique to me.
  
    The principle is:
  
        "Make it easy for users to supply alternative text."
  
    The technique is:
  
        "...by including default descriptions for things you give them."
  
    Anyone have suggested working for the checkpoint, though?
