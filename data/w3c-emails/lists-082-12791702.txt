Denis,
I did not include the entire text in my message. I was hoping people would
refer to the present draft which has more of an explanation, justification
and description of what needs to be done.

The primary points here is that we are talking about the prepackaged media
including clip art that are shipped with the authoring tool. The action we
want is that they come with professionally written alt text and
descriptions. This is an authoring tool developer action.
Anyways, please refer to the present draft for clarification.
