Jim,
We have added some information related to multi-media accessibility to the
new guidelines.  Is there anything specifically to multi-media or the
implementation of SMIL specifcation that we should include in the guidelines?

We need to have any new information in the next 2 weeks (March 2nd).
Please let me know by Thursday (Feb 18th) if you have any plans to submit
additional information related to multi-media or SMIL accessibility to the
working group for consideration for inclusion in the UA guidelines.
