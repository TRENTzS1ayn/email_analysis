Chair: Jon Gunderson 
Date: Wednesday, February 17th
Time: 12:00 noon to1:00 pm Eastern Standard Time 
Call-in: W3C Tobin Bridge (+1) 617-252-7000

Agenda
12:00-12:20 Comments on new working draft guidelines 
http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-WAI-USERAGENT-19990210/

12:20-12:25 Assignment of working group members for detailed review of
particular sections of the new working draft.  Members will be asked to review
checkpoints in one or two sections and make specific comments on checkpoints
for that section related to priorities, changes in wording, adding a
checkpoint
and/or deleting checkpoints.  This is VERY IMPORTANT and we want to have at
least two working group members per section.  
Working group members who do not regularly participate in the telecons are
also
encouraged to contact the chair to review sections of interest to them.
 
12:25-12:45 Initial assignment of checkpoints to either the Descktop Graphical
User Agents checklist or the Dependent User Agent (assistive technology)
checklist.

12:45-1:00  Review issues list for open issues 
http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/wai-ua-wd-issues.html

I encourage members to review the new working draft and send comments to the
list before Wednesday.  Especially members who cannot attend the telecons, so
that your views can be included in the telecon discussions.
