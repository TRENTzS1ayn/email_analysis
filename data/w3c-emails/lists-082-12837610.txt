Hi Ian and Jon,

In reviewing the February 10th version of the guidelines I came across a
few items that may need clarification.

Feb 10th version http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-WAI-USERAGENT-19990210/


1. When the term "override" is used in section 5.1, as in "override
animation rates", "audio playback rate", "font family", etc, does it mean
that the user agent should support the user's preferred value? I just
wonder if we should use the word control instead of override. The word
control appears in the introduction for this section.

2. Section 5.2.3 [Priority 3]  When null alternative text has been defined,
suppress the rendering of the alternative representation.  

I am not sure what this checkpoint means. Is rendering "null alternative
text" different from rending nothing or would the previous checkpoint,
5.2.2 "When no alternative text representation is available, indicate what
type of object is present." be invoked and the object type would be rendered?
 
3. Section 5.2.4 [Priority 1]  Allow the user to choose from among
available audio tracks. 

Would this checkpoint come into play when for example, one audio track has
captions and another does not?  If so, wouldn't we need the same checkpoint
in the video section so users can choose  among the videos with captions or
descriptions if available?
