Minutes 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----

SL: Is this an issue: Access content developers don't want to use document
object models. They don't want to deal with a different object model for
every piece of software. Implication: more to be done natively. 

See Denis' comments [2]. [2]
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999JanMar/0195.html 

HB: Document object modelS (plural) was part of the concern. 

IJ: a) There will be need for communication 

b) I will have a proposal soon for the group addressing this. 

JG: We need also to ensure that the details of "what needs to be exchanged"
is addressed by this group. Neither DOM nor existing platform-dependent
APIs may address real needs. 1) Comments on 10 Feb draft [3] [3]
http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-WAI-USERAGENT-19990210/ See Kitch's comments
[4] [4] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999JanMar/0203.html 

2. Section 5.2.3 [Priority 3] When null alternative text has been defined,
suppress the rendering of the alternative representation. I am not sure
what this checkpoint means. 
JG: This stems from a Page Author checkpoint (e.g., in the case of multiple
images when only the first has alt text.) Action editors: Clarify this
meaning notably in the techniques document. 

3. Section 5.2.4 [Priority 1] Allow the user to choose from among available
audio tracks. 
KB: If this is true, do we need the same for video? 

IJ: Audio track meant to accompany video. This should be clarified. Action
editors: Clarify in document. 

KB: Then we don't need it. 

HB: We may need it for text captions (e.g., different languages). 

Proposed: If a technology allows for more than one [captioning or
description] track (for audio or video), the user should be allowed to
choose from among tracks. 

Resolved: Add one checkpoint to the document describing this. 

KB: Prose related to keyboard access. 

Proposed: change "close together" to "physically close together". 

KB: In 5.5.3, does this include the label? 

5.5.3 [Priority 1] Allow the user to search for a form control based on its
text content. 
IJ: a) For those controls with text content (e.g., TEXTAREA) b) For labels? 

JG: More valuable to search for information based on label. 

CMN: This may refer to Web Content guidelines: put text in every form
control that allows it (i.e., use default text). 

Proposed checkpoint: For explicitly associated labels and controls, given a
control, provide the user with access to the associated label. 

Resolved: Yes. Priority 2. 

Action: Editors will add this. 

Proposed checkpoint: For explicitly associated labels and controls, given a
label, allow the user to move focus to the associated control. 

Resolved: No. 

Action Ian: Find out what HTML 4.0 says about this. I think the spec says
put the focus on the control element. 

/* Jim joins */ 

SL:: Concerned about jumping from form to form when you're searching for
controls. Proposed checkpoint (HB): Allow the user to identify a form.
Technique: Number? Name? 

SL: People will assume there's only one form on a page. If they search and
end up in a different form, they need feedback that they've changed forms.
/* No resolution to 2) Review of the spec. 

/* Review of working draft sections */

Deadline for comments 24 Feb teleconference 

Section 5: Jime Allan: 

Section 4: Kitch Barnicle 

Section 5.4: Harvey Bingham 

Section 6: Charles McN. 

Sections 2 and 3: Hans Riesebos 

Section 1: Introduction: Scott Leubking 

JRG: Review the sections for adding, deleting, changing checkpoints;
changes in priorities

SL: Keep in mind definition of accessibility and whether UAs can be
competitive in addressing it. 

Techniques document: 

IJ: Recommended: If you think of techniques as you go, please tell the
editors. 

IJ: Restated process for agenda: 

Please send proposals to the agenda following the Chair's email. 
This gives the Chair the opportunity to reserve time for proposals. 
SL: Can we address the participation of Netscape in this process? 

JG: It's important to get them involved. 

/* Sublists for checkpoints */

Options: Desktop graphical user agents and dependent user agents (Review of
this document: http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-WAI-USERAGENT-19990210/ )

Options: UA/AT/Both Section 4.1 

4.1.1: Both 

SL: Should we say "device-independent" or redundance. 

JG: Let's not address that here. Editorial issue. 

4.1.2: Both 

4.1.3: Both 

JG: Maybe just for UAs 

CMN: Should be both, since low-hanging fruit. 

HB: Also, good to have it in place for people assisting users. 

SL: I've seen users get lost during installation. Provide status information? 

KB: This is a general user interface issue. 

JG: This is not on our agenda. 4.1.4: Both 4.1.5: Both Section 4.2 4.2.1:
Both 

HR: Is 4.1.1 redundant with this? 

IJ: Yes, but may be important enough to stand alone. 4.2.2: Both 

HR: Why "Interactive"? 

IJ: Printer, for example. 

HR: E.g., a braille display that reacts on keyboard input. The device is
not interactive. 

Propose: Remove "interactive". 

Action editors: Remove it. 

4.2.3: Both 

4.2.4: Both 

4.2.5: Both 

JG: Combine these three? 

IJ: We broke them out intentionally. 

CMN: Combine, define "active elements". 

Issue: What priority for 4.2.5? 4.3.1: 

Both JG: I lean towards UA in this case. 

CMN: Why not ATs as well? 

HR: I'm not sure. When you have accessible AT technology, they normally
know the group of people they're working to help. 

JG: What about people with several disabilities. Consider Jaws, for
example. "Insert" key on numeric pad used as a modifier key. If someone
were both blind and could only type with one finger, they couldn't use Jaws
(Inset + F7). 

IJ (to HR): ATs may be used by larger audience. 

HR: Lower the priority for ATs? JG: We want to avoid if possible. We could
consider for Pri 1 items. 

4.3.2: Both 

4.3.3: Both 

JG: Screen readers already deal with conflicts with between programs. 

4.3.4: Both 

JG: Some ATs don't have menus. 

CMN: Propose making this a technique for 4.3.4 

Resolved: Delete 4.3.4. Make it a technique for 4.3.3. 

Proposed: Do this again in the next teleconference. 

Adjourned 1:30 EST
