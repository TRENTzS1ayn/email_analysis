hi

[ February 10th version ]

along with Kitch's comments, I was wondering why 4.1.2, Ensure that product
documentation is available in at least one accessible, open standard
electronic
format (e.g., HTML, XML, ASCII)., was not a priority 1?   Just seems a bit
strange that so much effort is going into improving the UA, yet  "at least one"
accessible form of the documentation is only a "should" (priority 2
definition).
