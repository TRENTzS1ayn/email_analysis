The captioning or description may in fact be a video track with sign
language or a talking head for speech readers.  The language should talk
about control over selection of all available information; illustrations
can be in terms of specific media such as text subtitles for video-encoded
movies, but the logic is symmetrical across all sorts of media
combinations.  Don't imply media limitations in the general statement.

Even where TVontheWeb shows Rob Neff's seminar one has a choice of video
tailored to your modem speed.
