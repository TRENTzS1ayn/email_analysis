Kitch,

The way the system works when it works well is that a graphic will be 
displayed as graphic.  But if it is purely decorative, it can be given an 
alt="" parameter, which will suppress the [graphic] display.  

This is a good approach, and the way these points should support.  If the 
author has inserted a null alt text, that is a statement that this should 
*not* be rendered by indicating that there is anything here, since that 
information may detract from the reading of the page.
