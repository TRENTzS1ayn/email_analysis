SMIL team -- has anybody looked at Chromeffects? It sounds like it could be
a player as well as an authoring tool.

Kelly,

That's a fair question. In all honesty - just as with HTML today, the bulk
of accessibility relies on good practices employed by the author. That said,
Chromeffects can synchronize text (as in captions) and audio (as in audio
descriptions). You can also embed the Windows Media Player in a Chromeffects
object (e.g, a cube) which supports SAMI closed captioning, and with a few
lines of script (VB or Java), supports audio descriptions and synchronized
text highlighting. I will be releasing demo's of SAMI on our Web site in the
not too distant future.
Furthermore, currently if a Web author wants to produce an image of a cube,
for example, they use a bitmap which contains little useful information for
blind and visually impaired users (absent what is covered by the Alt= and
Title properties). If on the other hand, that cube is actually an XML
compliant object, a screen reader could be easily modified to recognize it
and voice that information. So, I would say that the potential for good can
definitely be realized with good authoring. Lastly I will leave you with my
personal opinion: with Microsoft's commitment to accessibility (which I get
the pleasure of seeing first hand), you are likely to see improved
accessibility with each subsequent release of our products, including
Chromeffects and Media Player. Maybe it's not fast enough for some, but it
will be steady and always moving in the right direction.

David.

My question, along with all the stunning visuals and eye
catching effects
the hype suggests for this product, will it help or hurt the
accessibility
of the web?

>Microsoft Announces Chromeffects Software Development Kit
>Next-Generation Interactive Media Toolkit to Spark a New
Genre of Tools,
>              Applications and Interactive Media Content
>
>
>ORLANDO, Fla., July 21 /PRNewswire/ -- At SIGGRAPH 98
today, Microsoft
>Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT) announced plans for the release of the
>Chromeffects(TM) software development kit (SDK), available
for download on
>Aug. 17, 1998. Previously code-named `Chrome,` Chromeffects
interactive
>media technology is an add-on feature to the Microsoft(R)
Windows(R) 98
>operating system that unlocks a new range of
high-performance interactive
>media content for applications, multimedia titles and Web
sites.  The
>Chromeffects SDK allows Web authors and application
developers to leverage
>the ease and flexibility of HTML to take full advantage of
the DirectX(R)
>API-based multimedia power of the Windows 98 platform.
Developers can
>deliver compelling new content enhanced with Chromeffects
and powerful new
>tools and capabilities to catalyze innovation and new
market opportunities.
> In support of the Chromeffects SDK, leading vendors,
including Live
>Picture Inc., MetaCreations Corp. and Zapa Digital Arts,
are offering tools
>and add-in components to enhance the use of Chromeffects.
>
>The Chromeffects SDK includes technologies to benefit a
range of
>developers, from Web and title designers to professional
application and
>interactive media tool developers.  Designers with skill
sets ranging from
>point and click to scripting and programming will be able
to easily create
>interactive content using Extensible Markup Language (XML)
in Chromeffects
>for simple integration with HTML.  Designers using
Chromeffects can take
>advantage of sophisticated 2-D, 3-D, audio and video
effects to
>differentiate their HTML content in a single 3-D
composition space.
>
>`Chromeffects is one of the most exciting media
technologies we've seen,`
>said Rob Enderle, director of desktop and mobile
technologies at GIGA
>Information Group.  `Chromeffects provides the ability to
work around
>bandwidth limitations and use the power of the performance
personal
>computer, much of which would otherwise be wasted.  This
technology, while
>clearly on the cutting edge today, is expected to be
mainstream in Web time
>and will help open our eyes to even more of the as yet
untapped potential
>of the Internet before the end of 1999.`
>
>Chromeffects Delivers a Fast, Flashy and Functional
End-User Experience
>
>Chromeffects interactive media technology gives developers
the power to
>dramatically improve the end-user computing experience by
adding visual
>impact and unique real-time functionality without the
lengthy downloads of
>current bulky multimedia.  Chromeffects takes advantage of
the latest
>multimedia enhancements to the Windows operating system and
leverages the
>power of the latest PC hardware to deliver an end-user
experience that is
>uniquely entertaining and efficient.
>
>Fast.  Chromeffects introduces a host of new interactive
media data
>
>types to achieve richer interactive graphics with smaller,
faster
>
>downloads, increased frame rates and real-time performance.
XML tags in
>
>Chromeffects allow lightweight descriptions to be sent over
the Internet
>
>for the Windows 98-based client to render and process the
media,
>
>exploiting the latest PC hardware for acceleration gains in
performance
>
>and real-time interactivity.
>
>Flashy.  Developers can now easily create high-fidelity,
>
>television-style
>
>effects and animations never before seen on the Web.  By
utilizing the
>
>16-bit color and 3-D compositional space of Chromeffects,
designers can
>
>create a more entertaining, engaging and memorable viewer
experience.
>
>Functional.  Content optimized for Chromeffects can be used
to improve
>
>overall navigation and communication of information.
Mapping HTML text
>
>or images to a cube can multiply the effective real estate
of a page.
>
>Rather than navigating through pages, the user can
mouse-over a cube to
>
>bring a new side of information to the front.  Chromeffects
also enables
>
>bend-away menu bars, to increase focal area on the screen.
The
>
>Chromeffects SDK provides many interactive examples of how
the
>
>technology can be applied to greatly improve functionality.
The
>
>documentation on the SDK itself is an actual example of how
the
>
>Chromeffects technology inspires viewers to interact and
explore
>
>concepts.
>
>`The Chromeffects SDK puts the ability to create compelling
interactive
>media content in reach of a far broader community of
graphic and publishing
>designers,` said Eric Engstrom, general manager of
multimedia at Microsoft.
>`By making it simple for third-party developers to design
and adapt add-in
>enhancements to Chromeffects, we intend to fill the huge
void in the
>easy-to-author tools space.`
>
>Benefits of Chromeffects
>
>Chromeffects is designed to make interactive media
authoring simple to gain
>widespread adoption:
>
>Ease of use.  Because Chromeffects technology exploits the
DirectX
>
>multimedia services in Windows 98, developers and content
authors are
>
>spared the labor-intensive aspects of media integration,
animation,
>
>interactivity and distributing a run time.  Developers can
add real-time
>
>2-D and 3-D rendering and animation -- synchronized with
audio -- to
>
>HTML content via simple XML tags and popular Internet
scripting
>
>languages.  Chromeffects offers the ability to scale
content, so viewers
>
>on systems without Chromeffects are able to see standard
content.
>
>Extensible architecture.  Through DirectX Transform,
third-party
>
>developers can extend and enhance the functionality of
Chromeffects.
>
>Transforms are add-ins to create effects beyond those
provided by the
>
>default library.
>
>Built-in run time.  With the run time built into
Chromeffects-enabled
>
>systems, independent software vendors (ISVs) save the
significant
>
>development, distribution and support costs associated with
building a
>
>run time.  In addition, end-user downloads are no longer a
factor in
>
>developing an application or add-in.
>
>Rich Design Elements of Chromeffects Expand Capabilities
for Developers
>
>Chromeffects enables different forms of media to be
integrated in one
>seamless composition space encompassing an entire Web page,
rather than
>being limited to a specific area of a page.  Core elements
of Chromeffects
>include the following:
>
>2-D.  A set of XML tags, based on the Vector Markup
Language (VML)
>
>proposed standard, can be used to generate complex animated
artwork
>
>integrated with HTML content without using script.
Chromeffects also
>
>delivers flexibility so that scripting languages like the
Visual
>
>Basic(R) development language Scripting Edition,
JScript(TM) development
>
>software, Visual Basic and Java can be used, if desired, to
create
>
>dynamic graphics that respond to user input.
>
>3-D.  Chromeffects provides a library of XML tags and a
real-time 3-D
>
>rendering engine for adding 3-D objects, scene objects,
textures,
>
>animations, interactivity and lighting to content.
Two-dimensional
>
>surfaces can be wrapped around 3-D objects in real time,
including live
>
>HTML Web pages with active hyperlinks.
>
>Sound.  Chromeffects allows developers to use XML tags to
insert wave
>
>audio and MIDI into a scene with controls for various
playback methods,
>
>volume, pan and muting.  Developers can use multiple sound
sources at
>
>the same time to combine or synchronize their playback.
>
>Video.  Chromeffects allows developers to map video onto
2-D objects and
>
>3-D surfaces while providing a standard set of video
playback controls.
>
>Additional Features
>
>For additional functions, the Chromeffects SDK will provide
a library of
>image and 3-D effects.  Effects can be applied to objects
(dissolve,
>explode, ruffle, etc.) and to images (wipe, composite, fade
and more).
>Through DirectX Transform, third parties can also add
effects to enhance
>the capabilities of Chromeffects.  A robust set of
third-party effects and
>add-ins on the SDK will include the following:
>
>MetaCreations Corp.  MetaStream for progressively streaming
scalable 3-D
>
>graphics over the Internet; MetaCreations image effects --
liquid,
>
>vacuum, page curl and many more -- for eye-catching image
transitions
>
>Squishy FX.  A new genre of interactive, continuously
generated organic
>
>effects and music integrated into reusable art forms
>
>Zapa Digital Arts.  A library of Zapa Characterz with human
behaviors
>
>and personalities to liven up 2-D, 2-D animated and 3-D
environments
>
>Live Picture.  Award-winning software for fast interaction
with
>
>photographs, illustrations and 3-D objects
>
>By utilizing standards and familiar authoring formats, the
Chromeffects SDK
>provides flexibility and ease for application and content
developers to
>innovate now and in the future.
