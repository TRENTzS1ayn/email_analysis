Neil,
In the discussion at the December Face-to-face meeting these exact
arguements were presented in defence of documentation accessibility issue
being a priority 1.  I don't know of anybody in the working group that
doesn't think that accessible documentation is not important.  The
consensus of the group on level 2 was based on based on the following idea.  

If a company was chosing between making the documentation more accessible
and adding improved keyboard support, what would you want the developer to
do?  If both are priority 1 then to the developer they are equally
important.  So we want to limit the priority 1 to items that are most
critical for implementations.  In most cases the user can still use the
user agent even if the documentation is not completely accessible.
Remember a priority 2 still indicates very difficult, while priority 1
means impossible.


The issue is closed and can only be reopened if new information is provided
to the group on why the status should be changed.  You can review the
discussion of the the F2F meeting at:
