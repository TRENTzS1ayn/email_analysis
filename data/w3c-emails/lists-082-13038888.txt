Although it is not obvious, based on my meeting this week with Microsoft, 
we should have another checkpoint:
The user agent should expose the keyboard location to allow keyboard 
emulators equivalent control over keyboard input.

There are really two issues here:

1) Visual indication of keyboard input (focus) and current selection.  The
visibility is important for print disabilities including low vision.
2) Programmatic indication of focus and/or selection.  Important for
accessibility aids to discover the current area of user interest (sometimes
known as the "Locus").

This is not automatic in software.

I agree that this should probably be Priority 2.  Spawned windows may 
confuse some groups, but in general, confusion does not preclude access, 
merely makes it difficult.
