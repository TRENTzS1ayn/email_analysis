I wonder if a slightly different slant on 4.1.1 vs. 4.1.2 might not help us
here.
The installation is given priority 1 and the documentation priority 2.
What I might suggest as in scope at priority 1 is not all documentation,
but not just installation.  Perhaps 4.1.1 should include all things
necessary to begin basic use, including installation and any orientation or
basic training required to start use. 

The product may think it is self-explanatory; this is open to validation by
user testing.
