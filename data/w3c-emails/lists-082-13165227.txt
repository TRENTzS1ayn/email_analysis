Harvey,

While it is certainly true that some data tables use TH cells, I don't think
that we should suggest that any table without TH is a layout table, which
this wording seems to imply.  We might want to say something like "Data
tables may have distinct TH and TD cells..."  As I recall, TH cells are new
to HTML 4.0, and many designers are using the conventions of 3.2 as
standard.
