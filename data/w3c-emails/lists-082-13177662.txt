thanks for the URL to the f2f notes, I've now had a chance to go back
and review some of the history, that certainly helps.

in short:

at the risk of being a pest, I'm going to suggest that this "issue" is not
closed and that this topic be re-opened for discussion?  While I didn't
have access to the "document" used for discussion at the f2f meeting, I am
concerned that most of that discussion seems to have centered around
3.4 "providing documentation about accessibility features" ,  which is
considerably different than 4.1.2, "ensuring that product documentation
is available in at least one accessible, open standard format
(e.g., HTML, XML, ASCIII)."

Therefore, I'd like to make the following proposal:

Reword Guideline 4.1.2 as follows:

Ensure that accessible product documentation is available (or
available upon request ?).

I'd also propose that this become a priority #1 item.


Then, in the techniques document, I think the technique for providing
this guideline should state something like (or whatever best words this):

Accessible documentation may take an electronic format (ASCII, HTML, etc.),
Braille, audio tape, large print, etc. ... and must be available upon user
request.

- with the key issue being, the user having access to whatever form best suites
their needs when/if they request it.


While not my first choice in solving this problem, I think this method
still conveys the importance and responsibility to the UA developer for
accessible documentation as requested, but should not take away from their
ability
(time and development team effort) to also create the best and most
accessible UA,
which meets as many priority #1 items as they can.

thoughts ?
