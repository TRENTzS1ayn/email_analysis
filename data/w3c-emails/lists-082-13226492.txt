I agree. I have one clarification though.  if html or xml perhaps are
one of the formats of choice, and they or one of them is chosen as the
only media, then, we still have to use a browser to access the
documentation, so, drop the forms of documentation that require a
browser to use from the list and we have a good priority one item.  My
rationale for this is that if you are going to class to learn how to
use the tool and you don't have the tool available to use that having
a portable means of studying the documentation is a high priority.
Further, it is impossible for some people to work with something they
have not read about there fore fitting into the priority one class
this need for documentation.  Lastly, Explore though you might, if you
are in a situation where help is unavailable and the browser is
configured by default or by someone else in such a way as to render it
inaccessible, you have the documentation to start with.  This then is
priority one because it provides an anchor for a starting place that
cannot move.
Thanks.
