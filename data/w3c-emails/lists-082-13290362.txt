3.2 Provide comprehensive accessibility help to authors

 
Techniques:

Provide frequent linking between: those mechanisms used to identify
accessibility problems (e.g., icons, outlining or other emphasis within
the user interface), help files, and automated correction utilities.


Checkpoints:

3.2.1: [Priority 1] 
Provide examples of accessibility solutions in help text. 

3.2.2: [Priority 1]
Provide explanations for all special accessibility terms, as well as
tasks related to accessibility in help text.

3.2.3: [Priority 2]
Explanations of accessibility barriers related to non-deprecated
elements emphasize appropriate solutions rather than explicitly
discouraging the use of the element.
