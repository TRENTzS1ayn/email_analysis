I'll miss WAI-UA telamon Wed 29th. I'm presenting to OASIS-Open then
on what their members can do about accessibility issues. OASIS-Open 
is taking responsibility for both the SGML version of the Docbook SGML
application, and its conversion to an XML version. I expect to start a 
new Docbook task to add accessibility features.
