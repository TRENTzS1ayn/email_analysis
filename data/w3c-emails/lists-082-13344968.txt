JRG: Some operating systems, like Windows 95/98/NT have operating system
supported flags for indicating when a user has selected:
1. High contrast display options for people with visual impairments
2. Show sound for people with hearing impairments

The program can then make adjustment to how it provides information to the
user.

JRG: Not that I am aware of, but it is a orientation problem for many
screen reader users.

JRG: I am not sure if any borwsers provide this functionality.

JRG: 
Attributes for links can be considered markup used to group links like a
navigation bar.  The Web Content guidelines describe methods to markup
groups of links. 

Attributes for forms include relationships between text labels and form
controls.  A user can search for a label and have the form control receive
the focus.  There are two methods:

1. Explicit Labeling:

<P><LABEL FOR=name>Name</LABEL><P>
<P><INPUT TYPE=text NAME=name ID=name>

The ID and the FOR attibutes provide the link between the label and the
control.

or 

2. Implicit Labeling:

<P><LABEL FOR=name>Name<INPUT TYPE=text NAME=name ID=name></LABEL>

In this case the LABEL wraps around the control element.

In either case a person could use a search method to find name and move
focus to the control.

JRG: This is a technique used in lynx and is one method to efficiently move
through a page with a large number of links.

JRG: In the actual implementation, especially for sequential access, it is
more efficient to have a function that moves through "active elements" on a
page.  There fore the same command would sequentially move through links,
form controls, longdescription links and other active content.  It is
broken up in the guidelines to clearly indicate what elements should be
included in navigation.  Of course you want the user agent to orient the
person to the type of element that has just received focus.

JRG: Block level elements are defined in HTML 4.0 DTD specification:

http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/sgml/dtd.html#block

While HTML DTD is a very specific and technical about block level elements,
the concept for our purposes is to allow the user to move through
functional blocks of information in a document easily.  The functional
blocks probably correlate very closely to the DTD specfications for block
level elements.  The functionality is intended to let the user easy read
through and be oriented to the rendered elements of a document with a
minimum set of commands.

JRG: Thank you for your review and questions.  This is the type of feedback
we need.  Many of your questions need to be answered in the techniques
document of the guidelines, which if you have looked is very sparse at the
moment.  If you or your staff are interested in helping complete the
document, please contact me.

Also congradulations to you and your staff for releasing HomePage reader.
I will be downloading the demo copy soon to take a look at it's features.
