Last summer Jon Gunderson asked for a subgroup to be formed
to look at MathML from the user agent perspective. Below are
three proposed checkpoints on which we'd like your feedback.
Since MathML implementation is still pretty vague at this point,
our checkpoints are extremely broad.

Last summer Jon Gunderson asked me to head up a WAI-UA subgroup to look at MathML. Below are some proposed checkpoints. Since MathML implementation is still pretty vague, our recommendations are very broad. Please send any feedback to the list.

 Thanks!

Checkpoints:

1. Mainstream browsers should implement MathML rendering.

2. Allow keyboard access to components of MathML equations
comparable to the way access is provided to objects in forms.

3. MathML objects should be available as part of the DOM, so
that assistive technologies can use that content to effectively
convey the math to users of access technology.
