How is the MathML embedded in the HTML?  Is a plugin an option?  Desirable?
 What do browser vendors have to say about the pros and cons of asking
authors to use XHTML if there is going to be MathML in the document, vs.
some other way
of embedding MathML in vanilla HTML4?

"Comparable" may need to be broadly interpreted, here.  Math expressions
form much deeper trees than forms and form controls.  So keying your way
around to isolate a particular subexpression is more like walking the Hn
hierarchy of a document than form element access, in some respects.  Those
with AsTeR experience can probably say this more clearly.

MathML is XML and per DOM1 has that much support in the DOM.  To decide if
more is needed we may need to work in terms of a specific audio interface
representation and interaction strategy, or Braille, or some other
alternative morph of the MathML content.
