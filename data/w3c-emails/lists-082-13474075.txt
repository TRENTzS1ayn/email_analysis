Could the tabbing among different kind of elements be defined similar to a
"find" and "find next" dialog box (in accessible way). In addition to the
text string, the user could select which element types are searched e.g.
header, table, paragraph, table cell, a named element.

The user could then define some of the most useful searches to be in a
separate list easily available to users e.g. when alt tab is pressed.

Can this be done in an easily accessible way?
