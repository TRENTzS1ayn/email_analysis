What you describe is the systematic, structured programming way to describe
the capability.  

Find [next] instance matching <pattern>.  Where pattern includes both
content and context qualifiers (context includes HTML element names and
attribute values, c.f. selectors in CSS).

Have you played with the Lynx functions?  They are pretty simple but there
is some adjustment of what class of elements is numbered, and then there is
both incremental and absolute motion within that class.  [Incremental
motion over a default class even when nothing is numbered]  This is of
enough interest so that this functionality is still growing.
