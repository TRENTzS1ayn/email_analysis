If one saves a Web document containing a form in a local file, is the state
of the controls in the form preserved?  When one re-opens the document, do
the controls have values as set initially by the site from which the
document is first accessed, or do they have the values that the user had
set before saving?

How should this work?

How much does this relate to accessibility?

Should we say something about this in the User Agent guidelines, or defer
it to XML application guidelines?
