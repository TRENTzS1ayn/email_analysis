Al Gilman has advised me that you are the appropriate group to consider
switching off alt tags.

I am a teacher of adults with learning difficulties few of whom can read. It
is hard to find sites without text and even then the alt tags are very
confusing.

Please contact me for further clarification

This would seem to be an issue to address in the User Agent guidelines.

In the current draft User Agent guidelines it says the user should be able
to turn off animated or blinking text.  But you may need to work with them
to get this clarified so it is clear it applies to the popup [=animated]
display of TITLE and/or ALT attributes as is now common.
