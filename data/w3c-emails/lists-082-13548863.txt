To be as intuitive as possible, you might have a generic "Find the next like
this" command that worked for all types of markup.  If the point-of-regard
were on a Header1, it would find the next Header1, if on a form control, it
would find the next form control, if on a table, it would find the next
table.

This is an implementation question, but could be a fairly cool feature to
have in a browser!

Subject: Tabbing idea

Could the tabbing among different kind of elements be defined similar to a
"find" and "find next" dialog box (in accessible way). In addition to the
text string, the user could select which element types are searched e.g.
header, table, paragraph, table cell, a named element.

The user could then define some of the most useful searches to be in a
separate list easily available to users e.g. when alt tab is pressed.

Can this be done in an easily accessible way?
