This could be done by extending the number of options available in a
search. DIfferent UA's have different interface techniques, but for most
of them it should be fairly obvious how to do it accessibly.

  Could the tabbing among different kind of elements be defined similar to a
  "find" and "find next" dialog box (in accessible way). In addition to the
  text string, the user could select which element types are searched e.g.
  header, table, paragraph, table cell, a named element.
  
  The user could then define some of the most useful searches to be in a
  separate list easily available to users e.g. when alt tab is pressed.
  
  Can this be done in an easily accessible way?
