I will clarify this.

Denis' comment in this thread is accurate and I will
reword the related checkpoints as follows:

5.2.2: When no alternative text representation has
       been specified, indicate what type of object is present.

5.2.3: When alternative text has been specified explicitly
       as empty (i.e., an empty string), render nothing.

Please propose wording for an appropriate checkpoint to the list.

Thanks again,
