This is a User Agent implementation issue. In this case I would say that
the implementation of keyboard access is not intuitive. Which means that
the documentation of alt-down-arrow is crucial for accessibility.

  Try pressing alt-down arrow when on the list.  I did this on the page and
  could move through the list of states without triggering the event.  If I
  pressed enter on the state I wanted, again after pressing alt-down arrow
  and moving through the list, I then went to my selected state.
