Subject: Re: PROPOSAL: Information that needs to be exhanged between
Descktop Graphical User Agents and Dependent Assistive Technology

DOM currently does not provide all the information that assistive
technology developers say they need to make browser technology more
accessible.  Some of the major limitations of the current DOM are:
1. Lack of support for simulating both UI and scriting control events
2. Lack of information about rendering position of an element
3. Lack of information about UI controls, menus and dialog box information

We want to as precisely as we can identify the information that needs to be
exhanged between a user agent and assistive technology.  In this way it can
be used to guide both DOM development and accessibility APIs.  

May the user with a disability win!!

Jon
