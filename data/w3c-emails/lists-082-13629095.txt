Yes, I recall the topic being discussed there.

My personal preference for faster cycling of the draft process is in part
because it enables such things to be reflected before they are forgotten.

Somehow or other we need to find a way of keeping track of these things -
not just in UA but in the various working groups. Memory is good, but not
very easily shared...
