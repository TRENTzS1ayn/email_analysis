Hi Mark,

Thank you for comments.

I'll add a cross reference.

I'm not sure which checkpoints you're referring to 
(presumably in http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-WAI-USERAGENT-19990210/)

Good question. What do we do, for example, for XML applications.
One goal of this checkpoint is to find links based on the value
of the "title" attribute (e.g., when IMGs are in links). 

ISSUE to discuss during a teleconf.

I agree. You can get to the link by tabbing. Direct navigation is
convenient, but the document is not inaccessible without it.

PROPOSED: 5.3.4 is a Priority 2.

This is a very good question, and one I've been struggling with.
I've been trying to think of checkpoints in a way that doesn't
necessitate having a table selection mechanism. For instance,
if you can navigate to a table, the selection mechanism is implied.
However, navigation among tables is not likely to survive as
a checkpoint, so I agree that there probably needs to be a checkpoint
about selecting a table.

The selection might be the mechanism used to indicate which table
has been selected, but the table identification mechanism is
probably independent of it. I think we shouldn't use focus
if it's implied that focus is for element activation.

I think this question also applies to table cells and forms.

Links and form controls are covered by the focus.

Note that such checkpoints used to be in the document.
See http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/WD-WAI-USERAGENT-19981112/

   [Technique: 5.5.3] [Priority 1] 
        Provide a mechanism for designating the current table of a
document. 
   [Technique: 5.5.4] [Priority 1] 
      Provide a mechanism for designating the current cell of a table.

In 25 Feb 1999 teleconf resolved to priority 2.

I'll add a cross-reference to the pertinent guideline.

Is it true that you navigate label to label? I would think you
would navigate among other form controls (perhaps including LABEL)
and that you would want access to the label for each control
(where specified explicitly).

Same issue as above.

Thanks again Mark,
