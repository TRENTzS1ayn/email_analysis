To discuss in a teleconf.
ISSUE: What document summary information must the UA make
       available? Specific information should be the in
       the checkpoint, the rest in techniques. If no
       specific information is required, the checkpoint
       should be dropped and the topic discussed in 
       the techniques document.

I agree that 6.1.9 and 6.1.11 should be combined and that
the information required be specified more clearly.

The last example about whether following a link involves a fee is
related to the W3C ECommerce Activity, Micropayments WG. This
sounds like a dependence with that group, i.e., that markup
of a "fee link" must be recognizable in some way.

PROPOSAL: 
   - Drop the "fee link" part of the example
   - Talk to the Micropayment WG about this dependency.

For 3., I will use your wording. Notice that it allows searches
that span more than one element.

Agreed. This will be covered in the conformance section by the
definition
of "applicable checkpoint".

I'm not sure. That's why the checkpoint refers to "associated
event handlers", which in HTML will mean "on*" attributes. I don't
think the WG has enough information yet from the DOM to say more.
