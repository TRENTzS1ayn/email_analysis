One of the areas often overlooked under "acessibility" is the
internationalization issue. As the Internet works it's way to the rest of
the world and as more and more ancient texts become archived online,
detailing support for as many of the[1] ISO 639 language codes as possible.
Who knows....in the future, User Agents may be built to recognize the
languages and translate them to whatever language the User Agent is set
to....
