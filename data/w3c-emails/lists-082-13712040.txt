I suspect not.  In the classic pathological case where the script reads the
mouse position and does different things based on where the mouse was,
there is nothing in the paramter profile which says the mouse position
dependency lines up with the layout boundaries of elements in the document
tree.  So I am afraid that it is like a server-side image map.  One should
be able to navigate to the element for which an on* event is bound to a
handler, but not necessarily wander the tree inside that element.  That is
just too many places to go.  Unless you are going to slave a pseudo-mouse
position to the layout geometry associated with the elements navigated to
in the parse tree, the navigation does not tell the script anything that
calling the script from the enclosing element (where it is mentioned) fails
to tell it.
