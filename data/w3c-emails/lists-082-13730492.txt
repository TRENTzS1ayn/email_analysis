I think this is covered by "make alternative content available", allow
the user to navigagte among active elements (links, form controls,
elements with associated event triggers)" and "allow the user to navigate
the DOM tree".

But Your point is well taken - I will think about this a bit longer.

On Sat, 6 Mar 1999, Al Gilman wrote on the question of whether searching
for attribute values was a priority 1 capability, after I had said it
probably wasn't:
  
  This capability may be more critical than it at first appears.  The
  critical failure in Lynx was when people could not find SUBMIT buttons even
  though they clearly said SUBMIT in the rendered text.  It turns out that
  the text 'SUBMIT' was not content but an element attribute.  Anything that
  is going to show should be included in the text which can be found by a
  search.  I don't know how to reword the checkpoint right away but this is
  the capability that may yet merit Priority 1.
