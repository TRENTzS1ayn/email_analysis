That sounds like a Lynx problem. If they are submit buttons, then 'submit'
should be rendered by the user agent and thus be found in a standard page
search (find).

It was incredible to consider 'searching on attribute values' as a priorty
one item, even more to know the reason.

This capability may be more critical than it at first appears.  The
critical failure in Lynx was when people could not find SUBMIT buttons even
though they clearly said SUBMIT in the rendered text.  It turns out that
the text 'SUBMIT' was not content but an element attribute.  Anything that
is going to show should be included in the text which can be found by a
search.  I don't know how to reword the checkpoint right away but this is
the capability that may yet merit Priority 1.
