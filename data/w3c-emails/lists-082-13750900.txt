What aspects of these three types of objects must
be available?

Perhaps complete this list with:

  - selection and notification of selection change
  - focus and notification of focus change
  - point of regard (how to do this?) and change thereof.

I don't know what the rendering order means.. I know what
logical order is (i.e., document order), but what is
rendering order? Of what? Strings only? Pixels?

> 3. Rendering graphical position and size on visual display

What does this mean exactly? There are two structure/presentation
mappings of interest, I think:

1) For a given element, what real estate on the visual display
   comes from that element's rendered content?

2) For an x,y position on the screen, what element
   produced that pixel. Note that not all pixels are
   produced by elements - some come from style sheet-generated
   content (e.g., the :before pseudo-element in CSS2).

Are both important? Are both reasonable requests?
I don't believe DOM 2 will address this (but I could
be wrong).

All of the following are provided by DOM 1.

Almost certain to be part of DOM 2.

Again, I'm not sure what rendering information
is required. See comment above.

> 3. Element attributes

I think all of the rest are provided by DOM 1.

I'm not sure what explicit header cell references
are.

This is control of user agent by another.

Yes.

All four of these provided by DOM 1.

What do you mean by type? That it's "onclick", for example?

This is control of user agent by another.
