how about list access key definitions in a way that is easily
retrievable.
and in addition, they can be rendered in any other way.  if for
instance, they are rendered in a graphical image of the character, the
alt atrib for that image could be the represented character.
Just a couple of thoughts. A usage of term as well, auditory or
tactile.  this then implies possible use along with other aids than
nonvisual.
Thanks!
