Hi,
I took a quick look at section 1 of the guidelines.  One concern I have is that
I think it is important that the readers have a clear understanding
about how access to browser can impact people's lives.  The current
and future uses of browsers in both education and employment environments
should be addressed.  A little more discussion on the importance of
navigation might be helpful.  Sighted people often don't understand
the navigation challenges.  The "disoriented" comment could benefit
from a clear example.

Scott
