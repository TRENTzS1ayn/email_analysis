Thank you for your contribution to this section.

I disagree though about removing the checkpoint.  I think we need a way for
users to navigate sequentially through each block of the document.
Especially naive users need a means to easily move through all the content
of the document.   I think this is a checkpiont for AT and its priority
should be raised to priority 1.  This complements the sequential active
element checkpoint.  If both these checkpoints are implemented the user has
a means with two keyboard commands to access all the active elements and
the contents of the document.    

Jon
