I would prefer to rewrite 6.2.2, currently allow the user to view a
document outline so that is allowed navigation of the semantic document
tree structure - ie headers, paragraphs, lists, etc.

I have assumed that this is primarily a concern for HTML and that
well-written XML schemata will not have the same split between the
semantic and the syntactic structures. Which could well be wrong.

  I disagree though about removing the checkpoint.  I think we need a way for
  users to navigate sequentially through each block of the document.
  Especially naive users need a means to easily move through all the content
  of the document.   I think this is a checkpiont for AT and its priority
  should be raised to priority 1.  This complements the sequential active
  element checkpoint.  If both these checkpoints are implemented the user has
  a means with two keyboard commands to access all the active elements and
  the contents of the document.
