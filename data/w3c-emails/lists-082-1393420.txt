SMIL Participants for Monday, July 27th from 11:00am to
12:00noon Eastern - Jim Allan, Jeff Freed

Agenda:
1. Introductions
2. Identification of Players
2.1 G2 from Real Media (http://www.real.com/g2/products/player/index.html)
2.2 GRiNS - (GRaphical iNterface for SMIL) player
(http://www.cwi.nl/SMIL/GRiNS/)
2.3 HPAS - Hypermedia Presentation and Authoring System
(http://www.research.digital.com/SRC/HPAS/) this is a JAVA based Player only
works in Netscape.

3. User Control Issues
3.1 Keyboard access to player controls
3.2 User control of element positioning
3.3 User control of FONT attributes (size, color, type, etc.)
3.4 ability to toggle the captions on and off
3.5 ability to toggle audio descriptions on and off
3.6 toggle the video on and off
3.7 toggle the audio on and off

4. Other Issues?
4.1 No support for HTML in G2 Player only real text - this is proprietary,
difficult to scale caption size. No facility for moving captions to a
different location.
4.2 Microsoft not supporting SMIL in Netshow
4.3 SAMI is designed for captioning, uses html as text, projected release
late in '98, may have simple authoring tool. New version of Netshow, may
have ability to slow presentation to half and quarter, caption slows also,
4.4 Internationalization - method of choosing language track or are there
separate files for languages
4.5 change rate of playback

5. Is there a need for another telecon?

The difficulty with developing UA guidelines for a SMIL player is there is
only one player (G2) to develop from. The group has listed some guidelines
see 3.
