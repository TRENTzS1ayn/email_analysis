1. In the guidelines we want to have features that support several types of
user strategies.  It is important to remember that the checkpoints are not
strategies, they are features that support users access a document.
Therefore the checkpoints should support many types of users and there
strategies.  

2. Users with disabilities have the same tasks as other users.  They want
to know the content of the elements in a document and they want to use the
active elements (links and controls) to naviage to new information or to
send information to another location.  We want to have controls and
renderings that help support their access to WWW documents.  

3. Most of our understanding of the techniques and strategies use by
persons with disabilities is based on group memebrs own personal
experiences or experience working with people with disabilities.  Kitch
Barnicle has just completed a study on people with visual impairments
accessing the WWW.   Many people with severe disabilities have little or no
experience using the WWW to understand their strategies.

4. Most users do not know what the content of a WWW document is before they
get there, so unless they have been there before they will probably use a
similar strategy for all WWW documents.  My guess is that most strategies
are not overt or well defined.


The sequential (tabbing) feature is considered the most rudementary
technique for accessing the document.  But it is still very powerfull since
it requires little user sophistications in learning how to use it to access
information.
