Based on discussion in the telecon and the list I would like to clarify the
characteristics of a checkpoint.   

1. Checkpoints represent one feature for accessibility.  It often requires
a group of checkpoints to implement accessible functionality or improved
usability.  Therefore when we talk about a sequential navigation feature we
must also remember there are other checkpoints that discuss orienting the
use to the element, and there are also other check points that talk about
more direct navigation like searching.  

2. Therefore when evaluating checkpoints, please look at how it relates to
other checkpoints in the working draft.  It is time to look at all the
checkpoints as a whole and not individually if are going to advance this
document.  The checkpoints should provide the users with the tools they
need to support their strategies for access WWW documents.

3.  The techniques document is where the details of suggested
implementations of a checkpoint reside.  The techniques document should
provide the developer a clear understanding of ways they can implment a
feature and to highlight the functional benefits to user with disabilities.
 The relationships to other checkpoints also needs to be acticulated in the
techniques document.
