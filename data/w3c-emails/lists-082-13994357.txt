hi, jim:  here are a few comments:

don't you mean "accessed by using different methods"?  "different media"
makes it sound like i can turn video into audio and vice versa.

as i understand it, "system-captions=off" means that you can never turn on a
caption track.  but if an author has gone through the trouble of supplying a
caption track, then why would he even USE "system-captions=off"?  and if the
author didn't create a caption track, what's the use of
"system-captions=off"?  i guess it sounds like something that can be tossed.
perhaps i don't understand its use...

i definitely agree here.  the G2 forces the author to define a text region
in which to display the captions.  but the guideline above is also confusing
to me-- are you saying that the user should have control over where the
captions are displayed?  if so, i'd also lobby for having the authors always
supply a default location in case the user doesn't care where the captions
are displayed or doesn't know how to determine their location.
