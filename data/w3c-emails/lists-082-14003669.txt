And to know how to best support the users and their strategies one needs to
first understand them (at least at some level). And that is what I'm trying
to do.

So the checkpoints are not totally separate from the strategies. If we
select to tab through links and controls it is different strategy than e.g.
tabbing through main headers and links and controls semantically contained
by those headers.

What is the document e.g. in a page like http://www.cnn.com/? I myself look
first the title of the selected news article but if I start following the
links and controls (by using the source) it will take me forever to get
there. And it will take forever to understand the structure of the page.
When looking at this example I think that the least the content guidelines
should do is, in addition to pointing out the navigation bar, to point out
the starting point to the main content of the page as well. But of course
it is not the whole answer.

(sidetract: maybe there should be a tool to group things together according
to the groups appearing visually e.g. what is near each other and when
these is space between the elements, elements with same background, which
groups have titles with similar font, size and color etc.)

Probably others in the group understand this better. I know too little so I
just try to imagine doing the things I normally do without seeing them
visually. Kitch's work sounds interesting. Could you give the address again?

That is probably true and therefore it is important to be able to support a
good strategy.
Another thing is that if the page has some metadata about its type that is
available to the user, the users might be able to modify their strategies
according to that.

I agree tabbing is easy to learn. However, I missed the point here. Are you
talking about tabbing through every element or selected elements (or
groups) such as active ones and what kind of selections should be offered
to the users?
