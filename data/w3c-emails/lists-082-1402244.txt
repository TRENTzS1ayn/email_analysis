to follow up on what James Allan said:

> SMIL Participants for Monday, July 27th from 11:00am to
> 12:00noon Eastern - Jim Allan, Jeff Freed
> 
> Agenda:
> 1. Introductions
> 2. Identification of Players
> 2.1 G2 from Real Media (http://www.real.com/g2/products/player/index.html)
> 2.2 GRiNS - (GRaphical iNterface for SMIL) player
> (http://www.cwi.nl/SMIL/GRiNS/)
> 2.3 HPAS - Hypermedia Presentation and Authoring System

> 3. User Control Issues
> 3.1 Keyboard access to player controls
> 3.2 User control of element positioning
> 3.3 User control of FONT attributes (size, color, type, etc.)
> 3.4 ability to toggle the captions on and off
> 3.5 ability to toggle audio descriptions on and off
> 3.6 toggle the video on and off
> 3.7 toggle the audio on and off
> 
> 4. Other Issues?
> 4.1 No support for HTML in G2 Player only real text - this is proprietary,
> difficult to scale caption size. No facility for moving captions to a
> different location.
> 4.2 Microsoft not supporting SMIL in Netshow
> 4.3 SAMI is designed for captioning, uses html as text, projected release

Where it says "uses HTML as text" one has to be careful.  Some
SAMI drafts have been pretty free about re-inventing HTML.  It
would be good if the "future of HTML" process or some activity
brings SAMI and the XML technology base closer together.
                                           
> late in '98, may have simple authoring tool. New version of Netshow, may

I have been hearing about something called ChromEffects (approx.)  This
is more than a simple authoring tool.

> have ability to slow presentation to half and quarter, caption slows also,

> 4.4 Internationalization - method of choosing language track or are there
> separate files for languages

Separate URI-references.  If the tracks are in one file, the
format and player need to suport a URI to access it which carries
language or track parameters or #fragment designator to do the
selection of the sub-object within the file.

> 4.5 change rate of playback

> 5. Is there a need for another telecon?

> The difficulty with developing UA guidelines for a SMIL player is there is

There are multiple players coming from the DAISY Consortium.  I
don't understand this remark.
