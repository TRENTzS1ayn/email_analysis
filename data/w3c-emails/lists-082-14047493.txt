It's an implementation level thing, but I'd really like to see a browser set
up so that you could have a "tab" to next interactive element, and a
separate command that is "find the next thing like this."

This would answer many of our checkpoints very nicely.  If you could set the
point of regard to an control group (form), you could say "Find the next
like this" to move to the next control group.  Likewise, a table with focus
could find the next table.  But you could also find the next link, the next
longdesc, the next JavaScript, or any other identified construct.

JRG response to CMN:
6.2.3 (9 March 1999 WD) already states a feature for navigating the
document tree, so it is already there.

We need 6.2.2 since many users do not know what a document tree is and it
provides a simple function for reading the entire content of the document.
While it may be considered inefficient, it is also an easy on ramp to the
WWW for new or less skilled users.

No one checkpoint will solve all of a users needs.  We need both types of
checkpoints.
