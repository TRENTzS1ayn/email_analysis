Al,

The "read" function is not part of the browser, but part of the AT.  No
general purpose browser "reads" the page, but being able to move the point
of regard (since many of the blocks don't take focus) to logical places is
essential.  Beginnings of blocks are good, logical places to begin reading.

I am confused.  Is there a "read forward from here" or equivalent command
in the command repertoire as you see it?  I suspect I have been assuming
the availability of such a function.  To me this is the function which gets
to all the content.  Because this process can be too slow, we add
requirements for navigation to get quickly to good starting points.

Maybe we should call it "linear readout."  The way I ususally interpret
"navigation," I would not call this linear readout activity navigation, but
limit navigation to stepwise motion without reading.
