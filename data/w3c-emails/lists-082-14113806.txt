A big problem with assistive technology browsing (and screen readers too)
is that there are too many commands, no one can remember them all. I cringe
at every suggestion of yet another navigation method or yet another
setting.

IBM Home Page Reader has a read function. We also have table cell, table
and heading jumps. But our (previous, current, next) structure jump is one
that hasn't been mentioned here. "Next structure" jumps to the first text
in a structure different from the current containg block. For this jump
here are the  blocks we consider:  Lists, Maps, select menus, forms, table
rows, other (body).

While I am at it, I will mention the most useful suggestion I have seen for
navigation with a speech (or braille) only browser. (This belongs in the
content discussion.) "skip over navigation links" is a local anchor at the
top of www.acb.org. The user hears it, follows that link, and is placed at
the "important part" of the page. In our new site we are developing for IBM
Special Needs Systems, we have that link associated with the top most
decorative graphic with alt-text, "skip over navigation links."

Al,

The "read" function is not part of the browser, but part of the AT.  No
general purpose browser "reads" the page, but being able to move the point
of regard (since many of the blocks don't take focus) to logical places is
essential.  Beginnings of blocks are good, logical places to begin reading.

I am confused.  Is there a "read forward from here" or equivalent command
in the command repertoire as you see it?  I suspect I have been assuming
the availability of such a function.  To me this is the function which gets
to all the content.  Because this process can be too slow, we add
requirements for navigation to get quickly to good starting points.

Maybe we should call it "linear readout."  The way I ususally interpret
"navigation," I would not call this linear readout activity navigation, but
limit navigation to stepwise motion without reading.
