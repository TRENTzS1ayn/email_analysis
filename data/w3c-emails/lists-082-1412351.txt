it seems that the captions are in some sort of graphical form?  if this is
the case, then a deaf blind person has nothing to read.
my screenreader won't read them if they are in bitmapped marqui style
which I think they are.  also, perhaps the audio description should be
text renderable as well?
lots for a braille reader to read, but then with presentation
adjustability and the ability to speed up, slow down, rewind, ff and
otherwise tinker and select components at will, it should work.
