JRG: I have two suggestions on learning about user strategies.
1. There are a number of user with disabilities in the Boston areas.  You may
want to contract some and observe them accessing the WWW.  I am sure Judy
could
give you the names of individuals or organizations that serve persons with
disabilities.  I believe MIT has an office to provide services to students
with
disabilities.

Disabilities services at MIT: http://web.mit.edu/dso/www/resource.htm

I think linking up with persons with disabilities is a great way to learn
about
their needs and problems.

2. Turn off your monitor or throw away your mouse and try to navigate and use
the WWW using adaptive technologies yourself.  If the WAI group at MIT does
not
have any adpative technologies, I am sure you could get access to the adaptive
technology lab at MIT.

JRG: Henter-Joyce JAWS 3.2 provides a simplification function by removing
images and other information.  You may want to look at some of there
functions.

We have also including othter checkpoints in the guidelines for navigating
through headers and other types of elements.  We also have checkpoints that
support searching strategies.

JRG: The following checkpoints in the 9 March 1999 working draft relate to
sequential navigation of active elements (6.2.1) and sequential access to all
block level elements (6.2.5).  There are also other checkpoints that relate to
sequential access to headers (6.2.4).  6.2.1 is useful for people accessing
links and controls on the page with the keyboard and the other is usefull as a
simple (basic) strategy to read the entire contents of the document.

6.2.1 [Priority 1] 
Allow the user to navigate sequentially among all active elements in the
document. See also checkpoints 5.3.1, 5.3.8, 5.4.3, 5.5.1, and 5.5.2. 

6.2.5 [Priority 2] 
Allow the user to navigate sequentially among block elements (e.g.,
paragraphs,
lists and list items, etc.)
