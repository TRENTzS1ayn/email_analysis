CORRECTION: from JRGs previous e-mail on blocks in response to CMN.  My
reference to 6.2.2 should have been a reference to 6.2.5 in 9 March 1999
Working Draft.

JRG requesinting clarification from Ian on his comment,
When you say you support CMN are you saying you want to remove 6.2.5 and
keep 6.2.3?  
Are you saying that you what to write the technique for 6.2.3?
Are you just saying we need someone to write the technique for 6.2.3?
