For those interested in accessible multimedia...

I've uploaded two SMIL clips which show how captioning and audio description can be accommodated.  I can't make them available via streaming just yet, but you can download them and view them offline.  Log on to ftp.wgbh.org, switch to /incoming/ncam, download CAR1.ZIP and ELEV1.ZIP and do the following:

CAR1:
1.  Create C:\CAR
2.  Unzip CAR1.ZIP into this directory
3.  Open CAR1.SMI from within the G2

ELEV1:
1.  Create C:\ELEVATOR
2.  Unzip ELEV1.ZIP into this directory
3.  Open ELEV1.SMI from within the G2

Let me know if you have questions or problems.  You should see captions and hear audio descriptions on both clips.  You might see one buggy thing, where one or two captions shift around a little bit.  I've contacted RealNetworks about this problem.
