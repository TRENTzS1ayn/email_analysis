Please find some comments.

First, globally, we have noticed within the guidelines an important effort to inform and explain better the context (notably in the Introduction and in the guideline 5.4) : the stakes are more understandable, and that's an essential point.

Second, we would like to make some comments about some checkpoints :
- checkpoint 5.3.1 : must be a priority 1
- checkpoint 5.3.5 : the number of links is important, but the number of visited and/or unvisited links also
- checkpoint 6.1.11 : must be a priority 1, but there is not the same level of priority between knowing "whether loading has stalled", knowing "whether enough of the page has loaded to begin navigating", and "whether following a link involves a fee", which can be indeed priority 3

Hoping that comments are pertinent enough.

Olivier Borius, FIDEV
