Olivier, 

thanks for the comments. They are pertinent, and I agree with all of them.

The point about knowing how many of the links have/haven't been visited
hasn't really been raised here before (as far as I can remember), and I
would like to propose that it is information which may be made available
to the user to improve accessiblity of the user agent.

  Please find some comments.
  
  First, globally, we have noticed within the guidelines an important effort to inform and explain better the context (notably in the Introduction and in the guideline 5.4) : the stakes are more understandable, and that's an essential point.
  
  Second, we would like to make some comments about some checkpoints :
  - checkpoint 5.3.1 : must be a priority 1
  - checkpoint 5.3.5 : the number of links is important, but the number of visited and/or unvisited links also
  - checkpoint 6.1.11 : must be a priority 1, but there is not the same level of priority between knowing "whether loading has stalled", knowing "whether enough of the page has loaded to begin navigating", and "whether following a link involves a fee", which can be indeed priority 3
  
  Hoping that comments are pertinent enough.
