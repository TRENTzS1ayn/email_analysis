The following DOM experts have agreed to meet with the regular UA working
group on March 31st to discuss the techniques related to using DOM to
increase the accessibility of user agent technology.

Al Gilman, Chair WAI Protocols and Format working group
Arnaud Le Hors, W3C staff
Mark Novak, Trace Center
Charles Oppermann, Microsoft
Richard Schwerdtfeger, IBM
Lauren Wood, Chair W3C DOM working group

The scope of the discussion will be limited to what we want to include in
the current Use Agent Guidelines, primarily outlining what needs to be said
in the techniques document related to using DOM for accessibility.  

I will be putting together a list of questions related to DOM that we want
to resolve during the meeting.  I request that members submit questions
they would like answered about DOM to the UA list (w3c-wai-ua@w3.org) for
inclusion in the discussion on the 31st.  

Please submit your questions by March 26th.
