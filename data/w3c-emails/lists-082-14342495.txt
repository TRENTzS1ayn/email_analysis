These things can be done, but I am not sure that tagging them is the best
way to go about it - it is a repair strategy for poor design. What should
be done is:

Collections of anchors:
use MAP

TABLE:
there should not be layout tables

events:
Events can change the DOM - either at the level of a content node or (in
DOM2) changing style properties (which is the well-designed way to do
rollover highlights etc so they can be reproduceed across different
devices). These changes can be tested, and can probably be tested in
advance as a repair strategy.
Verification events are pretty meaningless unless they have some effect.
If that effect is to make a specialised call to the server (eg saying what
is wrong) then there is not much that can be done to track them. If they
actually change the DOM (eg making a note for an input that was not
well-formed) then they would look like transformation events, and teh
heuristic for finding them would be based on the fact that they are
attached to particular types of elements (INPUT, SUBMIT, etc)

  Is there a way we could add a general section on tagging the
  purpose of certain elements.  For example the following types of elements
  could indicate their purpose:
  
  Anchors: navigation link
  Table: layout or table
  Event: decorative, used for visual affects
         verify, checks the user input, but no visual affects
         functional, is used to change content of the document
