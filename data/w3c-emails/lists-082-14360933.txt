Hello,

At the beginning of the Techniques for Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines, there is a section that
discusses the different between structural and presentation
elements/attributes in HTML. Is this along the lines of
what you mean? Also in the Techniques document, there is
an appendix of HTML elements and topics they related to.
Are you looking for something like these?
