Jon,

Per an action item from both the last DOM working group meeting and the
last WAI-PF meeting I am drafting a set of guidelines for loading an
assistive technology in the user agent and an API that can be implemented
by user agents to provide access to the DOM and all its window components.
We (WAI-PF) hope to develop and Accessible Object Model framework capable
of supporting XML based protocols and applications. Our goal is to have a
cohesive design and strategy to enable. Requirement areas will cover:

- Mechanism for loading assistive technologies
- Web Accessibility API specification to cover user agents and their DOM
- Mechanism for maping accessible XML schemas to DOM elements
- Accessible XML schema for providing semantics (Critical for submittals
like SVG)

This draft is not available for review yet, but it may be might be good to
make sure that we have a level set by adding a discussion of this to the
agenda.
