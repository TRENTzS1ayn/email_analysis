Thats great Rich,
But I want the discussion on Wednesday to be limited to what we can say
right now with current technologies and specificatipons in the UA
guidelines.  Your knowledge and understanding of the current stengths and
limitations will be a big help in helping us determine what we can say to
developers at this instint in time.  

As PF  develops new specifications and new technologies become available
the User Agent techniques document can reflect these changes.

That said we would need to have your proposal posted at least 24 hours
before to give people a chance to review it prior to the meeting to discuss
it.  

Would that be possible?

Thanks,
Jon
