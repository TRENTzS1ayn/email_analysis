Jon,

I don't thin my proposal will be done for the meeting. I expect it to be
rather large and comprehensive, but when it is complete we can certainly
provide it for review 24 hours prior. I would also want to run it through
PF first. Does WAI-UA review early drafts in development?

I would like to know the state of what is lacking in the current level of
the DOM. It is also valuable to find out what is missing in current DOM
implementation(s).

Thats great Rich,
But I want the discussion on Wednesday to be limited to what we can say
right now with current technologies and specificatipons in the UA
guidelines.  Your knowledge and understanding of the current stengths and
limitations will be a big help in helping us determine what we can say to
developers at this instint in time.

As PF  develops new specifications and new technologies become available
the User Agent techniques document can reflect these changes.

That said we would need to have your proposal posted at least 24 hours
before to give people a chance to review it prior to the meeting to discuss
it.

Would that be possible?

Thanks,
Jon
