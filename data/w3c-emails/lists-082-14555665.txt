The definitions of the system-captions and system-overdub-or-caption flags
in the SMIL spec seem to contradict each other although their definition is
not very clear. To solve the problem, could the author use the
system-captions="on" as the main flag when the user has preferred to see
captions and system-overdub-or-caption="overdub" when the user has
preferred to see overdubs. So the overdub-or-caption="caption" would not be
used by the author at all.

I think the system-captions would then function pretty much as I understand
it should function (i.e. the textual captions are turned on when user sets
it through the UA).

The attribute name system-overdub-or-caption does not make much sense if it
only tests if the user has preferred to have dubbings on. However, this
would unconnect the flags from each other so that the effect of the user
preferences is defined. And hopefully the name could be changed
(system-overdubs?) in the next version of SMIL, if it is impossible to do
it now.

This would not solve the language problem though. I think in the future we
would need separate flags for the caption and overdub languages.

Would this make any sense?
