Abstract: Braille is missing from list of dependent assistive technologies 
in abstract.

1. Introduction: second list 2. dependent user agent list
Suggest another bullet:
    o Speech command translation for voice-controlled browsing

2 ed. Guideline quote, move preposition from end: 
"Of what accessibility issues should I be aware?"

2.1 ed. Checkpoint Priorities      consistent capitalization for 2nd level
heads.

3.2 Properties, Values, and Defaults

I would like to see the explicit assertion about the precedence among
styles: user styles take precedence over author styles [is that still
conditioned on author permission?] over default styles. Also, how these
interact when inheritance affects styles. Also, how styles differ for
different assistive technologies.

Regards/Harvey Bingham
