Olivier,

Thank you for the comments. Due to my own scheduling constraints, I have
not been able to incorporate any changes into the UA Guidelines since
the
9 March draft. We will be publishing this draft to the TR page tonight
or tomorrow. Your comments are appreciated and will be considered by
the working group and incorporated into the next draft.
 
> Second, we would like to make some comments about some checkpoints :
>         - checkpoint 5.3.1 : must be a priority 1

In the 10 March teleconf [1], the WG discussed the priority of
this checkpoint (Allow the user to navigate sequentially among links.).
It was decided to ensure that priority of 6.2.1 as Priority 1
(Allow the user to navigate sequentially among all active elements in
the document.)
and to keep the special case of just links as a priority 2. I don't
think this
discuss has ended yet.

The working group will discuss this proposal.

So you are proposing creating more than one checkpoint (which we
sometimes
do when one contains too much information)? The working group will
discuss this proposal.

Thank you again,

 - Ian
