  Agenda
  
  Update on Open Action Items
  
  CMN: Send request to blinux users for info about orientation. 
CMN:
Done.
JG:
  IJ: Send similar request to IG. 
  Editors: Update document based on June 30th telecon resolutions 
  IJ: Micropayments issue: Status done 
  
  Discussion
  1. Should user agents be able recognize markup for navigation bars (Issue
  #3). 
CMN: Yes. The markup to recognise (in HTML 4) is the MAP element.
  
  2. Navigation and activation of elements with ACCESSKEY attributes defined
  (Issue #43). 
CMN: My concerns: accesskeys should not change the normal user interface -
for example interfering with the key sequence for normal functions. THe user
should be able to turn them off, and re-assign them.
  
  3. Keyboard mapping among assistive technology tools (Issue #64). 
  
  4. Adding guideline related to keyboard support in user agents (Issue #67). 
CMN: I wrote about this a little while ago. My position is still that the
guideline should just refer to the relevant checkpoints, since it is a step
away from the abstraction of the rest of the document, albeit an important
exception
  
  5. Must the user be able to do everything with the mouse that they can with
  keyboard(Issue #68)? 
CMN Yes. with the possibl exception of entering text, which would require an
Assistive technology to enable it (ie for Dep.UA only)
  
  6.  Proposed Guideline for software consistency (Issue #69) 
CMN: I don't think it needs to be a guideline - it is an explanatory note on
checkpoint 
  
  7. MK Proposal on orientation to information
