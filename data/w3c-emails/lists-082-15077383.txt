Hello,

Here is the status of some coordination issues cited by Jon:

  - #3: Should user agents be able recognize markup for navigation bars 

    Proposed technique for GL to use MAP:
    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/1999JulSep/0045.html

  - #43: Navigation and activation of elements with ACCESSKEY attributes
defined 

    This one has been addressed as of 7 July
   
[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999JulSep/0003.html]

       "Resolved: This issue is covered by checkpoints that address
       active element activation, navigation, user control
       of bindings, and documentation."


  - #12: Recommend full implmentation of MathML 

   This one has been addressed  as of 19 May.
   [http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999AprJun/0131.html]
   
   The resolution was to create a guideline about support for W3C Recs
   (to mirror the WCAG checkpoint 11.1 in WCAG 1.0) and
   to  cite MathML as the language to use when the ua supports math.

  - #33: Allow the user to view header information associated with a
cell 

    I'm not sure why this is a GL issue. HTML Markup exists, as well as
    an algorithm (that may need repairs) for identifying headers
    associated with cells. Checkpoint 5.1 of WCAG 1.0 tells authors to
    identify headers.

  - #35: Allow the user to view the summary attribute of a table

    Same as previous comment.

  - #49: Add a checkpoint that says that UAs should allow users to turn
off
         flicker.

     Resolved as of 9 June:
     [http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/1999/06/wai-ua-telecon-19990609.html]

           Since caused by scripts/applets, support for turning 
           off/pausing/controlling covers this. 
           Add to UAGL spec information specific to flicker and
epilepsy. 

  - #51: Language support

     Resolved as of 9 June:
     [http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/1999/06/wai-ua-telecon-19990609.html]

     RESOLVED: 
        ATs support language changes. Ensure that language information 
        be part of information exchanged with desktop browsers. 
        CF. Rich's techniques.
