Hello,

The 9 July versions of the User Agent Guidelines [1] and techniques [2]
are now available on line as are the list of changes to the guidelines
[3]
and the techniques [4].

In this release, the tar and zip archives should be entirely
self-contained -
I wrote a little script to download all style sheets and images so
that the document may be viewed locally.

Also, some patches to html2ps mean that the postscript and pdf
versions should be better too.

 - Ian
