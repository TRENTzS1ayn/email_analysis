attached mail follows:
This isn't really a user agent issue, so long as the user agent uses
standard system calls to get keyboard input, rather than attempting to talk
directly to the hardware.  Anyone using the mouse to generate text will be
using an on-screen keyboard, which is designed to talk to foreground
applications.  So long as the user agent accepts text appropriately, this
will be a non-issue.

>Hello,
>
>My action item of 7 July [1]:
>
>>   Ian: Propose to the list changes to checkpoint 1.1 in wording
>>        about text input through the mouse.
>>          a) In checkpoint itself
>>          b) In note after checkpoint.
>
>In the 9 July release [0], the same checkpoint is 1.1:
>
>>    1.1 Ensure that all functionalities offered by the user agent interface
>>        are available through all supported input devices.
>
>The issue (as Harvey pointed out [2]): For conformance, do user
>agents have to allow users to enter text with the mouse?
>
>I think that users should be able to enter text with the mouse
>(whether for accessibility reasons or for internationalization reasons)
>but it may not be the UA's job to provide this functionality.
>
>If the UA operates on an OS where users can enter 
>text into any piece of software through an
>entry palette, checkpoint 1.1 is satisfied (device
>independence would be "ensured"). 
>
>Hence, I would like to propose a Note to follow the checkpoint:
>
>   Note. User agents should make use of operating system-level
>         input and output mechanisms such as text entry palettes.
>
>I don't have any suggestions right now on what to say for
>UAs that operate on systems without os-level entry palettes.
>Do many users require being able to enter text with a mouse
>for accessibility reasons?
