Hello,

As discussed in the 14 July UAGL teleconf [1],
I propose sending the 9 July WG drafts [2], [3] (with
changes agreed upon during [1]) to 
the WAI Interest Group for review. After their review
(and the WG's discussion of their comments), we would
make the document a public draft.

Please let me know if you have any objections to sending
the documents to the IG.

Thank you,

 - Ian
