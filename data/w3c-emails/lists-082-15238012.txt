Hello,

In looking at the section on conformance [1] in the 9 July
draft, I see the following sentences:

> In order to conform as a desktop graphical user agent, 
> the user agent must do all of the following:

>   1.Satisfy all the Priority 1 checkpoints listed
>     in this document that apply to that class of 
>     user agent, and 

>   2.Satisfy those checkpoints natively unless the 
>     checkpoint explicitly indicates that it may be
>     satisfied through communication with other software. 

We make use of point 1 by distinguishing desktop graphical
user agents from dependent user agents in some checkpoints.

However, I don't see any checkpoints where we say that
conformance is possible by communication with other software.

I propose that we discuss point 2. at the next teleconference
and consider dropping it. I suspect that it's role has
been subsumed by point 1. in practice.

 - Ian
