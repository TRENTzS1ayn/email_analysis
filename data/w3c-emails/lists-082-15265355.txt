Hello,

The 16 July versions of the User Agent Guidelines [1] and techniques [2]
are now available on line as are the list of changes to the guidelines
and the techniques [3]. These drafts do not differ significantly from
the 9 July drafts.

This Interest Group will be invited to review this draft, as we
decided at the 14 July teleconf [4].

All comments welcome,

 - Ian
