To:w3c-wai-ua@w3.org, Alan Cantor<acantor@interlog.com>

I have requested that Alan Cantor forward a pointer to the work he did
and reported on at WWW8 on hot keys and its synonyms (keyboard shortcuts,
accessibility aids, etc). I hope he will post it to w3c-wai-ua.

Regrets 1999-07-21, I'm traveling.

Regards/Harvey
