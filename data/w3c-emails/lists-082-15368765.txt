Jim Allan and I this moring came up with a proposal to reduce the number of
checkpoints in Guideline 9 from 25 down to 11.  

1. 22 current checkpoints are consolidated into 4 new more general
checkpoints that better relect the indent of the original checkpoints
2. 4 checkpoints remain unchanges
3. 4 three new checkpoints are proposed for configuration
4. 1 checkpoint was removed since it seemed to be part of an existing
navigation checkpoint

The proposed checkpoints have the prefix "Checkpoint".

Four new Checkpoints that consolidate other checkpoints
Checkpoint: Provide summary information about the current view [Priority 1,
Both]

Consolidates the following 6 checkpoints in the current draft
9.1 Provide a mechanism for highlighting and identifying (through a
standard interface where available) the current view. [Priority 1] 
9.2 Provide a mechanism for highlighting and identifying (through a
standard interface where available) the user selection. [Priority 1] 
9.3 Provide a mechanism for highlighting and identifying (through a
standard interface where available) the current focus. [Priority 1] 
9.7 Identify a frame selected by the user. [Priority 2] 
9.9 Make available the primary language of a document's content. [Priority 3] 
9.14 Make available what portion of the document has loaded. [Priority 3] 

Checkpoint: Provide information about the attributes of a current element
[Priority 1, Both]

Consolidates the following 5 checkpoints in the current draft
9.16 Make available whether a chosen link (target) has already been
visited. [Priority 3] 
9.17 Make available whether a chosen link (target) is local to the
document. [Priority 3] 
9.18 Make available whether following a link will involve a fee. [Priority 3] 
9.20 Make available the dimensions of a chosen table. [Priority 3] 
9.24 Provide the user with access to any label explicitly associated with a
form control. [Priority 2]

Checkpoint: Provide statistical information on document content [Priority 2]

Consolidates the following 7 checkpoints in the current draft
9.4 Provide the user with information about the number of viewports.
[Priority 2]
9.9 Make available the primary language of a document's content. [Priority 3] 
9.10 Make available the number of links (to distinct targets) in a
document. [Priority 3] 
9.11 Make available the number of visited links (to distinct targets) in a
document. [Priority 3] 
9.12 Make available the number of tables in a document. [Priority 3] 
9.13 Make available the number of form controls in a document. [Priority 3] 
9.14 Make available what portion of the document has loaded. [Priority 3] 

Checkpoint: Provide relative position information for the current element
[Priority 2]

Consolidates the following 4 checkpoints in the current draft
9.15 Identify a link selected by the user. [Priority 3] 
9.19 Identify a table selected by the user. [Priority 3] 
9.22 Identify the table containing a table cell selected by the user.
[Priority 3] 
9.23 Make available the coordinates in the current table of a selected
table cell. [Priority 3] 

Four Unchanged Checkpoints:
Checkpoint: Provide access to header information for a table cell selected
by the user [Priority 1, DUA]

Checkpoint: Ensure that when the selection changes, it is in the viewport
after the change. [Priority 2] 

Checkpoint: Ensure that when the focus changes, it is in the viewport after
the change. [Priority 2] 

Checkpoint: Maintain consistent user agent behavior and default
configurations between software releases. Consistency is less important
than accessibility and adoption of system conventions. [Priority 3] 

Three New Checkpoints:
Checkpoint: Allow the user to configure summary information [Priority 3]

Checkpoint: Allow the user to configuration statistical information
[Priority 3]

Checkpoint: Allow the user to configure types attribute information
identified [Priority 3]

Remove Checkpoints
Checkpoint 9.8 seems to be defined in 8.6 (remove)

Please review and comment on this proposal.
