I support the proposed changes.

I would suggest that the old checkpoints be reworked into techniques, and I
think in a couple of cases we might want to list required information in
explanatory notes in the checkpoint, but we should look at it first.

  Jim Allan and I this moring came up with a proposal to reduce the number of
  checkpoints in Guideline 9 from 25 down to 11.  
  
  1. 22 current checkpoints are consolidated into 4 new more general
  checkpoints that better relect the indent of the original checkpoints
  2. 4 checkpoints remain unchanges
  3. 4 three new checkpoints are proposed for configuration
  4. 1 checkpoint was removed since it seemed to be part of an existing
  navigation checkpoint
  
  The proposed checkpoints have the prefix "Checkpoint".
  
  Four new Checkpoints that consolidate other checkpoints
  Checkpoint: Provide summary information about the current view [Priority 1,
  Both]
  
  Consolidates the following 6 checkpoints in the current draft
  9.1 Provide a mechanism for highlighting and identifying (through a
  standard interface where available) the current view. [Priority 1] 
  9.2 Provide a mechanism for highlighting and identifying (through a
  standard interface where available) the user selection. [Priority 1] 
  9.3 Provide a mechanism for highlighting and identifying (through a
  standard interface where available) the current focus. [Priority 1] 
  9.7 Identify a frame selected by the user. [Priority 2] 
  9.9 Make available the primary language of a document's content. [Priority 3] 
  9.14 Make available what portion of the document has loaded. [Priority 3] 
  
  Checkpoint: Provide information about the attributes of a current element
  [Priority 1, Both]
  
  Consolidates the following 5 checkpoints in the current draft
  9.16 Make available whether a chosen link (target) has already been
  visited. [Priority 3] 
  9.17 Make available whether a chosen link (target) is local to the
  document. [Priority 3] 
  9.18 Make available whether following a link will involve a fee. [Priority 3] 
  9.20 Make available the dimensions of a chosen table. [Priority 3] 
  9.24 Provide the user with access to any label explicitly associated with a
  form control. [Priority 2]
  
  Checkpoint: Provide statistical information on document content [Priority 2]
  
  Consolidates the following 7 checkpoints in the current draft
  9.4 Provide the user with information about the number of viewports.
  [Priority 2]
  9.9 Make available the primary language of a document's content. [Priority 3] 
  9.10 Make available the number of links (to distinct targets) in a
  document. [Priority 3] 
  9.11 Make available the number of visited links (to distinct targets) in a
  document. [Priority 3] 
  9.12 Make available the number of tables in a document. [Priority 3] 
  9.13 Make available the number of form controls in a document. [Priority 3] 
  9.14 Make available what portion of the document has loaded. [Priority 3] 
  
  Checkpoint: Provide relative position information for the current element
  [Priority 2]
  
  Consolidates the following 4 checkpoints in the current draft
  9.15 Identify a link selected by the user. [Priority 3] 
  9.19 Identify a table selected by the user. [Priority 3] 
  9.22 Identify the table containing a table cell selected by the user.
  [Priority 3] 
  9.23 Make available the coordinates in the current table of a selected
  table cell. [Priority 3] 
  
  Four Unchanged Checkpoints:
  Checkpoint: Provide access to header information for a table cell selected
  by the user [Priority 1, DUA]
  
  Checkpoint: Ensure that when the selection changes, it is in the viewport
  after the change. [Priority 2] 
  
  Checkpoint: Ensure that when the focus changes, it is in the viewport after
  the change. [Priority 2] 
  
  Checkpoint: Maintain consistent user agent behavior and default
  configurations between software releases. Consistency is less important
  than accessibility and adoption of system conventions. [Priority 3] 
  
  Three New Checkpoints:
  Checkpoint: Allow the user to configure summary information [Priority 3]
  
  Checkpoint: Allow the user to configuration statistical information
  [Priority 3]
  
  Checkpoint: Allow the user to configure types attribute information
  identified [Priority 3]
  
  Remove Checkpoints
  Checkpoint 9.8 seems to be defined in 8.6 (remove)
  
  Please review and comment on this proposal.
