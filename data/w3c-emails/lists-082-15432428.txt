aloha, y'all!

as dave poehlman correctly pointed out, HomePage Reader (HPR) _is_ a plugin
that cannot be used without netscape, and, yet, as he and i understand it's
inner workings, HPR does derive the information that it renders from netscape,
much in the same manner as JFW derives the info necessary for reformatting
pages from MSIE...  all of which means that the accessibility information which
the WAI was able to have written into HTML4 _is_ not only capable of being
exposed by netscape, but is, in fact, being exposed (but not rendered) by
netscape...  which is why, when i had the opportunity to speak with guido
corona of IBM SNS at the Vision99 conference in NYC last week, i asked him to
lend the expertise he has derived by working on HPR to the UA WG, for, although
HPR is a plugin, it does provide us with the a practical implementation of the
nascent UA guidelines...

i'm "looking" forward to reaping the benefit of guido's and IBM SNS' expertise
in the UA WG, and i apologize in advance, guido, for putting you on the spot!
