aloha, thatch!

thanks for the clarification...  i think that both david and i aired our views
on-list not only in order to get the word directly from the horses' mouths (if
you, and your colleagues at SNS will pardon the expression!), but to draw you
into a few of the topics currently being examined by the UA WG, in particular:

1) strategies for exposing the accessibility information built into HTML4, such
as the navigation of tables (something at which the current version of HPR
excels)

2) strategies for exposing elements and attributes in HTML4, XML, XHTML, and
CSS which are either currently un-supported, or else, spottily supported, such
as LONGDESC.

3) strategies for dealing with items such as the "Nav Bar", which can be
implemented in a host of ways (i.e. using the LINK element in HTML4, using CSS
to define the NavBar as a structure with a class, use [or, depending upon your
point-of-view, mis-use) of the MAP element, etc.)

i do, however, have one question, vis a vis the issue of whether HPR is a
browser or a plug-in -- can HPR operate independently of Netscape?  could it be
adapted for use with MSIE and Opera?  if not, then i would argue that it falls
into a grey area, not quite browser (due to its dependence on Netscape) and not
quite a plug-in (inasmuch as it is HPR which is parsing the document source,
and not Netscape)
