You can adjust the size of tooltips globally. It's ridiculously small to
begin with; I have cranked up mine to 12 or 14 point bold, and haven't
regretted it (yet).

- Control Panel
- "Display" icon 
- "Appearance" page tab
- "Item" combo box.

Tooltips is on the list in the combo box, and you can change the typeface,
font size, font attribute, and background colour.

I recommend that you name and save this environment as a scheme. 

By adjusting the characteristics of items on this page, you can create
high visibility schemes that better meet the needs of individuals with low
vision and mobility impairments. The schemes that come with Windows 95 and
98 are fairly limited. Regard them as points of departure. I usually start
with the Standard scheme, and modify like nuts. If you have over 40 eyes,
try enlarging the font size for "Message Box" to 12 or 14 point bold, and
you may be pleasantly surprised.
