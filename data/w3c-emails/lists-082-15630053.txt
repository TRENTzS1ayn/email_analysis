Jim,
I accept your position and fully understand it.  We are trying to
class web access tools however and under our current classification
scheme, if hpr is a browser than it biolages some of the guidelines
because it does not use keyboard conventions and does not allow one to
use a mouse effectively although we state it the other way round
because most browsers have the trouble the other way, it is just
important for a user agent to allow mouse useage as not.  as an
assistive technology which by the way is technology created to enhance
the acessibility of other technology which hpr certainly does, it
would not be required by the guidelines to comply with ua interface
specs.  If you want to make it a ua and be fully in compliance, I have
no objection to that.
Thanks!
