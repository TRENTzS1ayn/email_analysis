Please address the following questions in reviewing this draft. Other
feedback is also welcome.

1. Do you agree with the priorities listed for the checkpoints?

independent user agents. Are these groups sufficient? Are more required?
3. Do you have any suggestions for reducing the number of checkpoints in
Guideline 9? Please refer also to the proposal at
<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999JulSep/0036.html>.
4. Are the dependencies with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
("until user agents..." etc.) appropriately reflected here?
5. Any unclear terms?
6. Any redundant or missing checkpoints?
7. Any recommendations for additional techniques for the Techniques document?

QUESTIONS?
