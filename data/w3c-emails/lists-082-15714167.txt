What jon is proposing is not totally unreasonable given that there are
two user agents that already support most of it.  sequential
navigation is nothing new and searching for anything is not new.  they
both have been around for as long as lynx and w3 have been around. 
What we are trying to do though is write around a consensus of what
the neds for functional accessibility are and this takes a good stab
at that aim.
