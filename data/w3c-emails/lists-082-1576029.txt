I fully agree. 
But the builder's of current OS platforms resisted more specific ideas
because they interfere with the overall scheme of the platform. It seems to
leave Accessibility as a secondary issue. It would be terrific if vendors
took action to show a commitment to keyboard navigation; deeds speak.

Being one of the people who "resisted more specific ideas" I'm curious how
my comments got interpreted to mean that accessibility was secondary.

Good usability is the first priority of any user interface designer.  If the
keystrokes are different between each application - how does that help
accessibility?

I only mean to say that any recommendations are obviously going to have to
fit into platform that the browser is running on.  Are you going to force
people to not use the Command Key on a Macintosh or to use CTRL+Z on a PC
because they are close together (but conflict with the existing Undo action
of CTRL+Z?)

I'm interjecting common sense, not placing accessibility second.
