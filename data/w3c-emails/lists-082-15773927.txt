Jim,
Thanks for the comments.  The current discriptions that you commented on
were not designed to be checkpoints that user agents must implement.  Over
the past 18 months we have talked alot about different navigation
techniques and the following is an "abstrat" list of the different types of
navigation techniques we have discussed.  These strategies are designed to
provide developers with a context in which to think about different
navigation techniques.  Different strategies are better for different
people and different task contexts.

JRG: We have checkpoints which will identify particulatr items and we also
have a checkpoint that allows the user to select the items they want to
sequentially navigate to.

JRG: An exampel of this navigation technique is in lynx where you can bring
up a list of links and select one of them based on their numerical
position.  JAWS for Windows also has a direct technique for select a link
from a list of links using the first letter of the link content text.  This
strategy tries to abstract these specific methods.

>All elements or only a sub set of elements maybe part of the search.  This

JRG: This is just describing the strategy of searching, there are actual
checkpoints for searching specific element content.  We also have a
checkpoint for configuration of searching.

>JWT: I wish someone would tell me what logical elements of CNN, NYTIMES or

JRG: WIth poorly formed documents hierarchical navigation would not be very
useful, but if documents are well formed then this can be a very valuable
technique.  This is probably the most adavnced navigation technique since
it is heavily depedent on the author using structure in their document.  I
agree that all to often this doesn't happen.

JRG: The current checkpoints under guideline 8 are very general and we hope
will serve as a guide to developers.  Take a look at the current
checkpoints for the Guideline 8:

If you have some interesting navigation techniques and would be willing to
share them, could you send them to the list.  We would really like to use
them in our techniques document.

Thanks again for your comments,
Jon
