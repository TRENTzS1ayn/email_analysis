There are Two papers relevant to keyboard use which may asist with our
quest for reference in the concern of keyboard bindings and navigation
independant of the mouse.  In chronological order from oldest to
newest, they are " avoiding the mouse trap", at:
http://www.interlog.com/~acantor/csun1998.htm

and, "escaping the mousetrap" at:
http://www.interlog.com/~acantor/www8.htm

They are both excellent discussions by Alan Cantor on severring the
chord that ties many through the mouse to the computer.   
Thanks!
