Hello,

This proposal comes from an action item received at the
28 July teleconf [1]. 

In the 16 July revision of the UAGL [2], checkpoint 9.9 reads:

  9.9 Make available the primary language of a document's content. 
      [Priority 3] 
       For example, use HTTP header information or language
       attribute information from the document root. 

Proposed change (Priority 1, for assistive techologies):

  Render content according to natural language changes
  identified by markup. For unsupported natural languages, 
  allow the user request prompting when language changes.

NOTES:

a) This checkpoint is meant to cover checkpoints 4.1 and 4.3
   from WCAG 1.0: both primary language and language changes.
   Note that since 4.1 is priority 1, this one is too.

b) This checkpoint is also meant to allow users to turn on/off
   support for alerts to language changes.

 - Ian
