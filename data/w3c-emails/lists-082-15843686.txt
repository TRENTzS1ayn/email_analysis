Hello, 

I received an action item at the 28 July teleconf [1] to propose
a checkpoint that would merge checkpoints 9.16, 9.17, and 9.18
as defined in the 16 July draft [2]. In that draft, they read:

- Make available whether a chosen link (target) has already been visited
- Make available whether a chosen link (target) is local to the
document. 
- Make available whether following a link will involve a fee.

In light of decisions at the 4 August teleconf [3], I propose the
following
checkpoints:

1) Make available information about a link that will enable the
   user to decide whether to follow the link.  [Priority 3]
     NOTE: Useful information includes: whether the link has already
          been visited, whether it leads to a different document, and
          what is the expected natural language of the link target.

2) Allow the user to know whether following a link will involve a fee.
   [Priority 2].
      NOTE: This information may be provided through the standard user
      interface provided the interface is accessible. Thus, any prompt
      asking the user to confirm payment must be accessible.

For checkpoint 2, please note that this was agreed upon at the
4 August teleconference. [3].
