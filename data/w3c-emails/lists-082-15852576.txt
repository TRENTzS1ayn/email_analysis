I would add the type of the object at the other end of the link to useful
information, but otherwise it looks good to me

  Hello, 
  
  I received an action item at the 28 July teleconf [1] to propose
  a checkpoint that would merge checkpoints 9.16, 9.17, and 9.18
  as defined in the 16 July draft [2]. In that draft, they read:
  
  - Make available whether a chosen link (target) has already been visited
  - Make available whether a chosen link (target) is local to the
  document. 
  - Make available whether following a link will involve a fee.
  
  In light of decisions at the 4 August teleconf [3], I propose the
  following
  checkpoints:
  
  1) Make available information about a link that will enable the
     user to decide whether to follow the link.  [Priority 3]
       NOTE: Useful information includes: whether the link has already
            been visited, whether it leads to a different document, and
            what is the expected natural language of the link target.
  
  2) Allow the user to know whether following a link will involve a fee.
     [Priority 2].
        NOTE: This information may be provided through the standard user
        interface provided the interface is accessible. Thus, any prompt
        asking the user to confirm payment must be accessible.
  
  For checkpoint 2, please note that this was agreed upon at the
  4 August teleconference. [3].
