Hi Madeleine,

Thank you for the comments! Your analysis is great (and even touches
on points we've already resolved since that draft).
I'll only respond to non-editorial ones 
(and take into account the others on my own).

Guideline order was on the agenda for yesterday, but we didn't get to
it.
We'll take your comments into account when we discuss it.

[This is something we wanted to do for WCAG as well but opted not
to at the end.]

We  have that in WCAG 1.0 and had it for these guidelines as well.
It can be reinstituted.

Ok.

Yes. The checkpoint map will regroup all the techniques related
to a given checkpoint and all checkpoints related to a given technique.

Yes, that is another purpose. (Good analysis!!!!)

Essentially, you follow the "Techniques for X" link and
land in the checkpoint map. From there, you can find various
pertinent techniques.

Yes, we discussed this at a the 14 July teleconference [1]: device
independence in effect relates to standard APIs for mouse/keyboard.

Good call. We decided that at the 14 July teleconf [1]. Wording will
be along the lines of :

      1.1 Ensure that all functionalities offered through the
          user interface may be operated through standard input 
          device APIs supported by the operating system. [Priority 1]

We should discuss this at a teleconference.

Checkpoint 2.6 refers to how the information is rendered to the user
(e.g., underlined in a menu).

Yes, exactly.

We could say "electronic". We should address this in a teleconf.

That sounds like a good idea!

Perhaps you should join a call and explain this. I believe
there was an issue with cognitive disabilities and the need to
slow down for comprehension. Or, in a video presentation with
links, for example, to be able to change the rate of presentation
so that someone with motor difficulties could interact with the
presentation at a rate of his or her choosing.

Ok.

Yes, that was the intent.

Ok.

I don't think that was the intent.

In the past, to make it easier for developers to check off
checkpoints, we've separated functionality (hence the large
number of checkpoints instead of one with a large number
of techniques or examples). I think that's the only reason
these two are separate.

Yes, that's why. Will clarify.

Great! We need review/contributions to the Techniques.

You're right, this has to be edited. However, there may be
some deprecated examples (e.g., that make use of deprecated
elements or attributes).

Ok, we'll try to liven this section up.

I would *love* contributions. Can you coordinate with Marja
Koivunen on this?

Yes, it can. A heads-up is a good thing. However
if developers are looking for practical information today, we
can't tell them too much about what's headed their way (they may
be frustrated to not have it yet).

Yes we can, with the caveat that Working Drafts are still Working
Drafts.

Use section 7 for SMIL-specific info (e.g., attributes) and the
other sections for more abstract information (e.g., about
synchronization
or user interface).

I'll bet you can suggest a better structure than I can. I'll
have to think about this.
 
Wow! Thanks for the great comments. I wanted to get quick answers
back to you, so I apologize if some of my comments are incomplete. 
Please don't hesitate to follow up.
