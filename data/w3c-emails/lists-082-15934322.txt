thanks for posting these changes, Ian.  See comments below by MN:

MN:  wondering if we are going to ask that table dimensions be given, might
we also be interested to know a few other things.  Long ago, we had a lot
of discussion on tables, and one thing that I recall, was whether or not
a table had any TH tags, thus possibly implying a data table, rather
than a table used for markup.  Maybe dimensions implies more than
# rows X # columns.  thoughts ?

MN:  don't wish to get into a long discussion regarding whether or not
this checkpoint is required, however, the discussion seems to be
centered around "not changing keyboard keys per action between
software releases", and thus, I'd like to at least propose moving this
checkpoint into Guideline 2, perhaps combine as part of one already there, or
if a technique can be written for this, as is.

MN:  Can we combine the new 10.8 and 10.7, something like:

10.X  While loading, make available what portion of the document
has loaded, and when the document is being navigated,
make available what portion of the document has been viewed.
[Priority 3]
     NOTE: What has been viewed may be considered based on focus
position, selection position, or viewport position depending on how the
user has been browsing.
