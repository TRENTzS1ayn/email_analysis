For the sub-heading text, I've edited and included it for the next
draft.

Below I have some questions and comments.

Which specialized browsers?

Actually, I think this refers to all author-specified keyboard
behavior. "accesskey" is the HTML method for authors to 
specify key bindings.  There may be other ways in other languages. Also,
"Behavioral Extensions to CSS" suggests using a selector mechanism
for assigning script handlers to element/event combinations.

We can mention accesskey and tabindex explicitly after the main
checkpoint text.

This checkpoint means "Show users keyboard bindings by using standard
OS approaches, such as underlining letters in menu entries to indicate
the key used to activate the menu.
 
I propose this rewrite:

       Use platform conventions to indicate which keys
       activate which user agent functionalities.
          For example, on some platforms,
          if a functionality is available from a menu, the
          letter of the key that will activate that functionality is 
          underlined.

I don't think it's redundant - this one says "provide a useful default
configuration", which is separate from "ensure that all functionalities
are available from the keyboard" and "allow customization of the
keyboard". There may be ways to combine this one with other checkpoints,
but I don't see the need.

Do you mean not having tables rendered at all ('display:none') or 
having tables rendered linearly? I'm pretty sure we've resolved
the table linearization issue (by requiring that dependent UAs permit
table cell navigation and requiring that all UAs give access to
content for selected elements, including table cells). My comment
supposes that the issue is access to cell content. Is there another
issue that has to do with simplifying layout?

I propose that this checkpoint be dropped. Volume is controlled
by the knob on the speaker or at the OS level.

I agree. In the recent proposal for checkpoints of Guideline 9 [2],
there is a checkpoint requiring UAs to make available information
that will enable users to decide whether to follow a link. I agree with
you that 7.12 and 9.16 should be merged and I believe merged with
the 9.5 proposed in [2].
