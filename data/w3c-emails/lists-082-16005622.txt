Hello,

The proposal below addresses link-related checkpoints
in guideline 9 (Orientation). However, in [2], there
are link-related checkpoints related to graphical
rendering of link information:

7.12 Provide a mechanism (e.g., through style sheets) to 
     distinguish visited links from unvisited links. [Priority 3] 
        Note. Using color as the only distinguishing 
              factor does not suffice since color may not
              be perceivable by all users or rendered by all devices. 

7.13 Allow the user to specify (e.g., through style sheets) that 
     images used in links must have borders. [Priority 3] 

Should these checkpoints be folded into the ones proposed below,
or do they merit a separate existence? As written, 7.12 would
fit into the first checkpoint proposed below. 

However, 7.13 says "Use a visual highlighting mechanism to tell
people this image is a link." Checkpoint 7.13 doesn't quite fall
under 1.2:  "Ensure that the user can interact with all active 
elements of a document in a device-independent manner." since
it suggests (to me) activation, not recognition of a link.

I propose that we modify 7.13 and move it to guideline 6
(user control of styles) or guideline 9 (orientation, where
similar checkpoints reside):

  Provide a mechanism for highlighting and identifying (through
  a standard interface where available) active elements of
  a document.
    For example, allow the user to specify that images in links
    be rendered with borders.

 - Ian
