Hello,

The 9 August 1999 Working Group drafts of the User Agent
Accessibility Guidelines [1] and Techniques [2] are now 
available. Changes from the 16 July drafts
are listed online [3].

Your comments are encouraged,

 - Ian

P.S. I was not able to incorporate all comments that came
in about the 16 July draft. After further discussion at
teleconferences, they will make it into the next draft.
