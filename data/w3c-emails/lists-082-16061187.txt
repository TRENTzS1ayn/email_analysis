The following are comments I took away from a discussion with Hakon Lie of
opera software. Hakon also took some notes to find out about some features
- I hope he will be able to give us some further feedback on them.

All comments are based on the 16 July version.

checkpoint 2.5 Allow the user to turn on and off author-specified keyboard
combinations

I assume that this refers to accesskey and the like, but it is not clear
from the guidelines - an example would suffice.

Guideline 4 Allow the user to configure the User Agent (and guidelines 5 and
6 too)

Implementation of CSS will solve most of these problems. Given that the
WCAG also recommend the use of style sheets, and now rely on an interim
solutions checkpoint to cover the situation 'until user agents support CSS',
and given that CSS is a recommendation of W3C, designed to provide these
functions in an interoperable way, perhaps it should be a checkpoint. I would
suggest that it is in fact a priority 2 checkpoint - it is possible to be
accessible without it, but in the real world it causews a number of other
problems.

checkpoint 4.2 allowing the configuration of visual layout. Technique
suggestion: allow for multiple icon sizes.

5.5 allow turning on/off captions

this should say "for video/audio", unless it actually means the caption
element of a table, in HTML.

5.11 Allow the user to turn off spawned windows

An alternate approach might be to import the history nto the new window. This
solves the problem of not being able to get back to where the user was. If
this were done then the user would have to be force the inclusion of controls
in a window - currently netscape allows a window to be spawned with no
controls, and non resizeable.

9.5 ensure that when the focus changes it si in the viewport after the
change.

For features like search, the focus should not be underneath the search
window...

11.2 Support appropriate w3c recommendations

Should specify the CSS2 cascade order, 

12.1 use and provide accessible interfaces to other technologies

The wording is a bit vague. Presumably this means providing APIs..

In general guideline 12 seem a bit undercooked. I think we should ask the
people with aprticular experience in this area (Rich, Glen, Mark N, and
others) to have a close look at this guideline.
