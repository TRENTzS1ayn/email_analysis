aloha, ian!

i cast an unequivocal vote of support for your proposal...  it would be of
utmost utility for anyone using assistive technology -- not only speech-output,
but refreshable braille and screen magnification as well...

one question (with appologies to thatch) -- since the ian's proposed checkpoint
is flagged "for assistive technologies" would hybrids such as HPR be covered by
this checkpoint?

gregory.
