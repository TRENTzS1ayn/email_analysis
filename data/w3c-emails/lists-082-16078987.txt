It is merely a question of conformance. Any piece of
software may claim conformance as an assisitive technology,
which means that it satisfies a subset of the checkpoints.

If HPR wishes to claim that type of conformance, it must satisfy
that checkpoint.

The question remains: are the two categories useful and will
it make sense for software we are familiar with to conform to
one category or the other?

This issue is on the agenda of today's teleconference.... [1]
