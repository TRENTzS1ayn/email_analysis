JRG: 7.12 seems to be dealing with the same issue as the new checkpoint
proposed for determining whether a link should be followed or not.  SO I
think they should be combined.

JRG: I like the change, since it is device dependent.  This could even
relate to auditory interfaces saying "link" before saying the link text.  I
think wherevere possible we should minimize the use of visual references.
