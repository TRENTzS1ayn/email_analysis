I don't want the discussion on this list to focus on issues of developer
intent and/or their commitment to disability access.  We are here to discus
issues surrounding User Agent access features.   If anybody has a
compliment, complaint or comment surrounding a particular developers
commitment to disability access, there are plenty of other forums to
express your concerns.  This type of discussion on the UA list only leads
to alienation of working group members and hardening of views on issues
related to the guidelines.  Please let's put our energies into focus on the
issues.
