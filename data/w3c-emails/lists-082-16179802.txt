Current 8/11 checkpoint 7.2 reads:

7.2 For dependent user agents. Ensure that the user has
      access to the content of an element selected by the user.
      [Priority 1]

I don't understand what this means. And didn't find help in the techniques
document. Perhaps the problem comes from the phrase "element selected by the
user." With the keyboard? With a mouse? Can any element be "selected." If none
can be selected, is 7.2 vacuously satisfied?
