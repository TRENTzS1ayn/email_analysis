Ian, I am terrifically dense. 7.2 seems to say "provide access
to content of an element that is selected."

7.2 For dependent user agents. Ensure that the user has
    access to the content of an element selected by the user.


You say that the intention is to allow the user to select and you go into detail
about selection process.  The words of 7.2 certainly do not coincide with the
intention you described.

By my reading, 7.2 says if a user can select an element (paragraph, heading,
whatever) then she should have access to the content of that element. If no
element selection is possible 7.2 doesn't apply.

The intention is to allow the user to select content (e.g.,
structured by element or text content that may span element
boundaries) and have it rendered as speech or braille.
UAs should also allow users to select content and find
out contextual information about it (e.g., row/colum
coordinates of a table cell).

Alas, the techniques document has been slow to catch
up to the guidelines. We are turning our attention to it
more actively as we near last call.

With any supported input device.

It's not just elements - it can be attribute values. I think
that the user should be able to select any rendered text content.
I believe that the user should be able to select any non-text
content as well, but there are undoubtedly implications to
be considered for graphics, etc.

Probably, we should clarify that this refers to content
rendered natively (i.e., not by a plug-in, etc.).

Please let me know if this clarifies the checkpoint. If
not, or if you think there are issues, please let me know.
