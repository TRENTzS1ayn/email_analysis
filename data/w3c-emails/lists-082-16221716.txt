Hello,

In the Web Content WG, we are working on an "impact 
matrix" [1] for the Guidelines. The impact matrix lists
each checkpoint and the disability groups the checkpoint
is designed to help. It also lists input and output
devices/software affected by the checkpoint. The GL matrix
is in its early stages and will undoubtedly be evolving
a lot. Nonetheless, I think we should use it as a model
for doing a similar study for the UAGL. 

 - Ian
