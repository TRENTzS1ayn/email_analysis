Here is 6.6:

Allow the user to control selection highlighting (e.g., foreground
and background color).

Sure that is a nifty idea. It is also another setting, which is complexity.
But, since selection is usually reverse video, my question is, has that
ever been done before? Has this checkpoint been given adequate
thought?

If it has never been done before, if no one has seen selectable
selection colors, then I think this is an example of a priority one
checkpoint that belongs in the priority three bucket, at best.
