Here is 8.2:

Keep track of the user's point of regard in each view and restore
 it when the user returns to the view.

The link to "point of regard" at 8.2 is broken. There also should
be a link to "view." I think this (too) is too abstract.  The
important idea is that when you move back to where you have
been, the "point of regard" should be maintained. The
standard back and forward buttons of a browser are typical
examples of changing views, I think.

For a user agent that is presenting content for people who are
blind this is an especially important feature. I wish it would be
reworded so an average user agent developer could tell what
it was saying!
