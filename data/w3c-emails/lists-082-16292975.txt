Linking these words to the definitions would be helpful. In addition, there
are some helpful things that could be mentioned in the techniques. For
example, Opera does allow the user to navigate between views - in it's case
various windows, as does emacs-w3. Other systems rely on the Operating System
to do it - in MSWindows and the X window system there are keyboard and mouse
driven methods for moving among open windows.

  Here is 8.1:

  Allow the user to navigate views (notably those with frame viewports).

  I don't know what this means. The view menus of IE, Opera and Netscape don't
  offer any guidance. The terminology needs refining. Not only do I not know
what
  a view is, neither do I know what one is with a frame viewport. But then
again,
  I don't know what a frame viewport is.

  That all makes me pretty stupid, I recogonize, which is no surprise to me. But
I
  put myself at the high end on probablity of understanding one of these
  checkpoints. This is probably just a wording problem. Please help with
different
  words.
