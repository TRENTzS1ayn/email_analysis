I'm now looking at 9.1 which is:

Provide a mechanism for highlighting and identifying (through a standard
interface where available) the current view, selection, and focus.

 I don't know what this means either. The techniques link is broken. Searching
for 9.1 in the guideline I found:

3.6.6 Frames
Checkpoints in this section: 9.1.

And 9.1 doesn't seem to talk about frames.

What does it mean to highlight and identify the current view, selection or
focus?
