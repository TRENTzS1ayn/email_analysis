This is related to your earlier comments about 6.5 and 6.6.

It would seem that there is a problem of defining terms. I believe that the
glossary includes the terms view, viewpoint, selection and focus, as used in
the document, and that they are not very different if at all from their
common usage. The word highlight is not defined as I recall, but it is used
in its general sense rather than the slightly more technical and much more
specifc sense of reverse video on a computer monitor. Perhaps an up-front
list of the words which were defined in the glossary, or linking the first
(or perhaps all, for improved accessibility) occurrence to the definition
would be a good solution.

In answer to your actual question, which could presumably used as part of the
techniques discussion of the document, to highlight and identify the current
view, selection and focus means to ensure that they are readily distinguished
from any other view, or other possible selections or foci, and that what
makes them different is a "positive" feature, such as a different colour
scheme, larger text, or being louder than other objects, rather than a
negative feature, such as being hidden, or quieter. In addition, having these
objects identified so that a query through an appropriate API (Application
Program Interface) can identify them, is important to dependant technologies
in particular.

  Resent with subject!!
  
  I'm now looking at 9.1 which is:
  
  Provide a mechanism for highlighting and identifying (through a standard
  interface where available) the current view, selection, and focus.
  
   I don't know what this means either. The techniques link is broken. Searching
  for 9.1 in the guideline I found:
  
  3.6.6 Frames
  Checkpoints in this section: 9.1.
  
  And 9.1 doesn't seem to talk about frames.
  
  What does it mean to highlight and identify the current view, selection or
  focus?
