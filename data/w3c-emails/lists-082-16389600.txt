Jim,
There is a definition of views in Appendix A of the guidelines document
which should help clarify the meaning of views.  It maybe useful to have a
link on the key word "view" to the definition.  I will check with Ian on
the possibility of doing that.

Thanks again for your comments, they are very important for getting this
document into a usable shape.
Jon
