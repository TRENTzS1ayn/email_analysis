Jim,
This checkpoint is designed to help keep users oriented so that as they
move between documents and return to previously viewed dcouments that the
users previous position in the document (i.e. the link or control within
the document that has the programatic focus) and view (what part of the
document they see, hear, etc..)  is the same as when they were last in the
document.  So as the user navigates through documents and are using the
BACK command to return to previously viewed documents, the user is NOT
forced to the beginning of each previously viewed document.
