Jim,
This is an orientation checkpoint for orienting the user to the
organization of a document or a set of documents if frames are being used.
The user needs to know which document in a set of frames currently has the
focus, which control or link in the document has the focus and if there is
any seleted elements in the document.

We need to have better links to the definitions for each checkpoints.  It
will certainly help to improve the techniques document, so that examples
are available for implementation of the checkpoint.  We are moving our
attention to the techniqes document.
Jon
