I get the impression that you guys have been working so long on these
checkpoints without others interacting that when someone comes in and says, what
does that mean, you think, wow, she must be out in left field.

Yes I am fully aware that the techniques document is not ready. But, darn it, we
are on the same side, so to speak, I know assistive technology, and I know the
web. The responses I have gotten have been like pontification. Quote This is the
way it is Endquote.

On the subject checkpoint, the wording is not consistent with the glossary. I
believe that quote frame viewports endquote does not make sense. And the
checkpoint should not require reference to a glossary. If this is important,  if
should stand on its own.  That is true for other checkpoints I have asked about.

I believe that if I can't understand the points being made, then it is a problem
with the wording of the points.  If I can't evaluate an agent against the
checkpoints/guidelines then there is a problem with the checkpoints.

Thanks for thanking me for the comments!

Jim,
There is a definition of views in Appendix A of the guidelines document
which should help clarify the meaning of views.  It maybe useful to have a
link on the key word "view" to the definition.  I will check with Ian on
the possibility of doing that.

Thanks again for your comments, they are very important for getting this
document into a usable shape.
Jon
