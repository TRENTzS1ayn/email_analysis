What you have said is there exist assistive technologies that require X.
Therefore we have made X a priority 1 requirement for user agents. How do you
determine the quote weight endquote of X before you decide that it is heavy
enough to have this effect.

I am trying to look at this from a home page reader perspective; I could not
care less that some AT uses selection for speaking.

Jim,
Some types of assistive technology, like TextHelp, ZoomText and Aurora,
use selection to identify information to speak.  This is especially
important for browsers which do not have a cursor for AT to track.  A user
could select a section of text using the mouse (or hopefully directly the
keyboard someday) and use one of these assistive technologies to read the
selected information.  TextHelp and Aurora speech output features are
designed for people with learning disabilities and ZoomText is for people
with visual impairments.

This why it was given a high priority.

Jon
