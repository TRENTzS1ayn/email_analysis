You mean other people are meant to read this document???

I think we can rely on the glossary and may have to. Not all
terms are used the same way, and having a definition that's
internally consistent is important and perhaps the only way to
ensure that the document as a whole stands up. Internal inconstency
is a bad thing, however.
