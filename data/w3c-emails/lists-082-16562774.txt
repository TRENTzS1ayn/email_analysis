Seems to me to open up an interesting issue. It is possible to create a user
agent that is very handy for a specific group of people (it has certainly
been done for people who are interested in graphic rendering of websites on a
computer monitor) without making an accessible (by which I think we
understand universally useful) tool.

In the specific case of highlight and identify the selection, I think the
functional requirement is that the user can make sure that the selcted area
is identified in a way which is useful to them (within the limitations of the
User Agent's rendering methods). Does that sound like an essential
requirement, and if so is there a way we can word it better? (If not, is it a
lower priority, or a poorly conceived idea? Or have I just got the cart by
the horse...)

  What you have said is there exist assistive technologies that require X.
  Therefore we have made X a priority 1 requirement for user agents. How do you

  I am trying to look at this from a home page reader perspective; I could not
  care less that some AT uses selection for speaking.
