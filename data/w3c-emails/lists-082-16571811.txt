It is always a danger when working on something clsely that you forget how
people see it on first meeting. But I think that we have made certain
assumptions. One of them is that there are a few terms we want to define so
we can use them, and view is probably one of them.

Whether we can do that better is of course an open question.

I think in the specific checkpoint what we want to do is allow navigation
between views and/or viewports (such as frames or multiple windows).

which I'm sorry)
