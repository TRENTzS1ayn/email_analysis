Hi Gregory,

I support your proposal and have only one small wording suggesting: say
"explicitly activated" instead of "directly activated".  To my ear, at
least, this better conveys what you're proposing.  After all, pressing the
return key is a direct action, but it doesn't explictly request submission.
