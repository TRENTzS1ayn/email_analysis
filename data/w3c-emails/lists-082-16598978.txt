This guideline will also protect us all against other asocial means to
submit forms, e.g.

- automatic submission when all fields are filled out,
- submission via mouseover.

I realize it's implausible that people would actually do things that crazy,
but it seems like anything that can be done will be done sooner or later
whether it helps usability or not.

Hmmm.  This actually is a can of worms since you can do such things today
with javascript.  

To what extent should the user agent protect the user from asocial javascript?
