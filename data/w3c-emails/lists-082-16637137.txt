>Jim,
>I agree with you that we have been working on the guidelines for a long
time and there is a danger of developing our own language that is not going
to be useful to developers.  We are hoping to go to last call soon and will
be putting the guidelines to a test from the entire W3C membership.  We are
trying to develop the techniques document to provide a better description
of what issue each of the checkpoints is intending to solve.

>I appologize if my e-mail responses have sounded condensending, I had no
intent to do so.  Input from yourself and others is critical if these
guidelines to be useful to developers.

>We are scheduling a face to face meeting in Redman, Washington on October
11th-12th.  I would encourage you to attend the meeting.  I think your
participation would help us improve the guidelines.
