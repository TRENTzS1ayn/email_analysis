JRG: The group discusses the issue (telecons and the list, but mostly
telecons) and determines if the checkpoint is:
1. Critical accessibility: information cannot be accessed or will not be
avialable to the user
2. Important for accessibility: information is available but maybe
difficult to access
3. Useful feature:  a very useful feature that primarily improves usability

JRG: We spent alot of time on yesterdays telecon talking about conformance
issues.  We had a number of people accept action items, including Rich S.
for HPR, to look at using the current conformance sub-grouping of
checkpoints for mainstream browsers, assistive technology and specialized
browser like HPR to see how well the conformance statement works with
current technology.  

From your response about selection and evaluating HPR there would be
several questions to ask.
1. If HPR doesn't support selection checkpoint 6.6 would not apply to HPR.

2. If HPR does support selecting web content, it maybe that you consider
speech to be the only medium that you are concerned about supporting and
any visual information rendered about selection is not relevent to the
design of your system.  Therefore checkpoints that relate to color and
other visual rendering do not apply.  Although some people in the UA group
may disagree with this statement.

3. If HPR does support selecting web content does it make information
available to other assistive technologies using standard interfaces. For
example somebody who is deaf and blind could use home page reader with
another assistive technology to read WWW pages through a refreshable
Braille Display?

Do these question amke sense?

It would be great if you were will to go through the current checkpoints
and indicate which ones you think would apply to HPR and which ones would
not.
