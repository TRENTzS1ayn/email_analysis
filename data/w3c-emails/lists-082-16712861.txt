Checkpoint 6.15 was not considered critical for accessibility, but pitch
and gender can be very important for some disabilities.  I have worked with
a few people with closed head injuries using reading technologies, and they
seem very particular about the articulation characteristics of the speech.
Most people I have worked with who are visually impaired though don't seem
to concerned about pitch and geneder, as long as the voice quality is high.

Do you think these should be a higher or lower priority?

Jon
