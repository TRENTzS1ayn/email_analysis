Thank you for your detailed comments related to keyboard navigation and
your participation in the discussion.  This is an important time to get
ideas and comments on these features.
The main reason to use menus is not primarily functionality, but
visibility.  By placing information in menus, the feature is much more
salient to both users who are able bodied and have disabilities.  Many
users with disabilities will be relying on able bodied persons to help them
learn how to use the browser, since many persons with disabilities do not
have access to skilled users with their disability.  If an able bodied
person does know a feature exists many users with disabilities may not,
unless they have the skills and motivation to discover the information on
their own (and many do).
