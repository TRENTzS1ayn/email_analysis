Here's 9.1 for reference again:

9.1 Provide a mechanism for highlighting and identifying (through a standard
interface where available) the current view, selection, and focus.

Is the following a fairly faithful representation of the intent in, say, a
Windows environment?

Ensure that the user can detect which/what is the current view, the current
selection in that view and the focus. Expose the current view, selection, and
focus to assistive technology.

In your wording, is it "highlighting the current view and identifying the
current view through an API for assistive technology?" or is it "highlighting
and identifying the current view through an API for assistive technology?

If I have three views/frames/windows in a row, and the current view always
contains the system caret and I can't select anything, is checkpoint 9.1
satisfied? Instead of the system caret, what I change the border of the current
view to yellow (changeable, of course)?

Jim,
This is an orientation checkpoint for orienting the user to the
organization of a document or a set of documents if frames are being used.
The user needs to know which document in a set of frames currently has the
focus, which control or link in the document has the focus and if there is
any seleted elements in the document.

We need to have better links to the definitions for each checkpoints.  It
will certainly help to improve the techniques document, so that examples
are available for implementation of the checkpoint.  We are moving our
attention to the techniqes document.
Jon
