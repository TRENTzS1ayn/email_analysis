Sound like you have captured it very well. My understanding is that the
current view needs to be made clear by some kind of highlighting mechanism
(for example being the only thing visible, or being the thing that responds
when you ask for the title of the current view), and that this needs to be
exposed through an API to assistive technologies. So long as the system caret
is clearly identifiable I think your first technique satisfies the
checkpoint. I think the second one might, but this is also a case where using
system conventions is important - for example in enlightenment and afterstep,
the window managers i use, there is a title bar for each window. The current
view (active window) has a blue title bar and others have a grey or brown one
(depending on which window manager i am using. I also have my setup ensure
that the current view is always on top (this is an option in the window
manager, but makes life easier as a user).

  Here's 9.1 for reference again:
  
  9.1 Provide a mechanism for highlighting and identifying (through a standard
  interface where available) the current view, selection, and focus.
  
  Is the following a fairly faithful representation of the intent in, say, a
  Windows environment?
  
  Ensure that the user can detect which/what is the current view, the current
  selection in that view and the focus. Expose the current view, selection, and
  focus to assistive technology.
  
  In your wording, is it "highlighting the current view and identifying the
  current view through an API for assistive technology?" or is it "highlighting
  and identifying the current view through an API for assistive technology?
  
  If I have three views/frames/windows in a row, and the current view always
  contains the system caret and I can't select anything, is checkpoint 9.1
  satisfied? Instead of the system caret, what I change the border of the current
  view to yellow (changeable, of course)?

  Jim,
  This is an orientation checkpoint for orienting the user to the
  organization of a document or a set of documents if frames are being used.
  The user needs to know which document in a set of frames currently has the
  focus, which control or link in the document has the focus and if there is
  any seleted elements in the document.
  
  We need to have better links to the definitions for each checkpoints.  It
  will certainly help to improve the techniques document, so that examples
  are available for implementation of the checkpoint.  We are moving our
  attention to the techniqes document.
