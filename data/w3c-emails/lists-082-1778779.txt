Hi,

I think the goal of the Group is to make all computers easy to use for
disabled people. Extensive configuration decreases that possibility. More
importantly I believe the Group has the knowledge to recommend 3 or 4 (maybe
8) QWERTY keyboard options covering the needs of almost all disabled people.
After 11 years of DOS & Windows (& 9 years CP/M before that) computing with
5 macro programs I'm totally at ease with making new keyboard controls. Yet
it would have been *much* better to have things more laid out. It would be
great to let buyers make changes once there is a solid base to build on.
Newcomers (& disabled people using a different computer) should be able to
reach a reasonable level of usability in minutes. Keyboard profiles that
blend various platforms to disabled buyers will be most helpful for a great
"Out of Box Experience"! More customization could follow as familiarity grows.

Regards,
Bryan
