Some comments on

I think the guidelines in 8.1

  1.[PRIORITY 1]
    Allow the user to turn off author styles represented by author style sheets. 
  2.[PRIORITY 1]
    Allow the user to adjust default values represented by browser style sheets. 
should be moved up in 

4.1 Control over Browser Defaults and Author Styles

There are not really about Compatibility, but Adjustability.

Also, the "allow the user to turn off" CSS should be reinforced as
being thru a simple user option, not done thru a script of some kind
(I've heard IE supports the later, but that's not enough)


Also, in the Compatibility section, I'm still in favor of saying:
support all of HTML4.0, since by the time this guidelines is out,
HTML4 will have been there for a year. We could add, "in particular,
you need to support these...", but I'm not sure this will help.

For CSS, we should say: full support of CSS1, in particular float,
display:none, and then the list of CSS2 additions as it is in the
document. 

5.4 Title Information 

  1.[PRIORITY 2]
    Make the document TITLE available to the user. 

I'd like to add a P3 about getting the TITLE element of the target
HTML document when the information is missing in the TITLE/ALT
attribute at the source (in IMG, A, or FRAME).

The TITLE element can be retrieved using a HTTP HEAD request or (if
there's no TITLE in the HEAD), using an HTTP GET with a limited
byte-range (just to get the beginning of the HTML file).


In 

 Available formats
 This document is available in the following formats:

some links are broken (like the .txt for instance)


In 4.3.2,
  ... The LONGDESC should be rendered as a link with a "D"

I'm not sure how I should read the issue list, but I thought we'd
decided to *not* recommend a particular UI for longdesc (e.g. in
Windows, they use alt f someting to access a property sheet)


I suggest saying *before* the appendices, that 
  The following appendices are informative only.
rather than repeating it (and forgotting some)
