Hi
Here is 1 response to 2 replies. It is good to have Accessibility info as a
Help topic. Yet the Help menu item seldom has sub-items that change how a
program functions so it isn't too intuitive to have Accessibility settings
there. Also not every applet has Help or Preferences options so naming the
option seems too specific, though those aren't poor places for these
settings. Having Accessibility in the first option is a way to ensure that
the uninitiated (the point J Gunderson notes below) can easily come upon the
settings, & easily toggle them On/Off. File is the common first menu option & 
it has many varied sub-items in it. Example, Eudora email has 'Check Mail'
under File so it seems what goes under what menu option isn't too
structured, suggesting a particular location for a sub-item doesn't seem
disruptive.
