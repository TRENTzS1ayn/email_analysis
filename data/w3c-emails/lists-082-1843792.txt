I like it in options, prefferences or perhaps a menu by its self?

BCHere is 1 response to 2 replies. It is good to have Accessibility info as a
BCHelp topic. Yet the Help menu item seldom has sub-items that change how a
BCprogram functions so it isn't too intuitive to have Accessibility settings
BCthere. Also not every applet has Help or Preferences options so naming the
BCoption seems too specific, though those aren't poor places for these
BCsettings. Having Accessibility in the first option is a way to ensure that
BCthe uninitiated (the point J Gunderson notes below) can easily come upon the
BCsettings, & easily toggle them On/Off. File is the common first menu option & 
BCit has many varied sub-items in it. Example, Eudora email has 'Check Mail'
BCunder File so it seems what goes under what menu option isn't too
BCstructured, suggesting a particular location for a sub-item doesn't seem
BCdisruptive.
