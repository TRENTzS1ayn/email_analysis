CSS2 offers very little in the way of
style sheet control over the user interface. Features
include:

 - stylistic changes when certain mouse events occur
   (hover, focus)

 - Some control of cursor presentation

 - The ability to refer to system colors and
   fonts in property values.

 - Dynamic outlines (e.g., to show focus).


See also a recent Submission to W3C that discusses "Action Sheets",
which are like style sheets but for behavior. See [1].
