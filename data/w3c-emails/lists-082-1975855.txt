In my understanding of CSS, the author of the page uses it to define how the
page should be displayed.  But in the case of providing access, the *reader*
of the page would be the one defining control.  Is there an option for
someone to have an overriding CSS document that replaces the one provided by
the author of the page?

It helps to think about universal access to commanding the
computer as like key remapping but a little higher level.

Daniel had experience in the X work with defining abstract
commands and binding concrete device events to them.

This is the general direction I hope we can use DOM to go in:
display device objects with methods where you write the
properties of the object, and command device objects where you
listen to the events on the attached device.

CSS migrates to something which provides abstract-to-concrete
class bindings.  And yes, for control as well as for display.

In dual-display scenarios as when one is mirroring a graphic
display in speech, one wants to put listeners on the displays as
well, as Rich S. has pointed out.

Neil Scott out at the Archimedes project has a rather highly
developed system that we could learn a lot from.  Their system
uses an unmodified desktop workstation and emulates the mouse and
keyboard signals of the "normal" user exactly at that interface.

But there is a whole computer in the assistive device and they
often expand composite nominal-interface actions from macros that
are better adapted to voice or head-stick input.  It's that
library of macros that I expect contains best current practice
in terms of universal command concepts.
