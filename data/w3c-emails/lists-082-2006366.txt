yes, and a document could accompany the package explaining how it is
compliant with universal design concepts and what that means.
we live in a universal age eh?

DAI'd like to put in a big plug here for a general concept.  When we put

DAdisability (even when it's called "Accessibility") the message is that these
DAare features for people who are somehow "not right."  As a result, two
DAthings happen.  Many MIS folks feel that they don't need those features on
DAtheir computers and remove them.  Although we fought a long, hard battle to
DAget accessibility part of the default install, I've still done workshops
DAwhere those features had been removed from the computers in question.
DASecond, many people who could benefit from features don't know that they
DAexist, because they do not identify themselves has having a disability!
DAThese include folks with marginal vision, or low-normal coordination, who
DAwould benefit from having access features turned on, but who don't have a
DAmedical diagnosis.

DAI'd like to see access features be considered "customization" features.  In
DAthe package, some access feature settings should be broadened a bit: bounce
DAkeys could be made a bit faster, so that it would compensate for keybounce,
DAfor example.  But in general, the idea should be that each user could
DAcustomize the performance of his or her browser or other software to match
DAhis or her style of use.

DA<<
DA Yet the Help menu item seldom has sub-items that change how a
DAprogram functions so it isn't too intuitive to have Accessibility settings
DAthere. Also not every applet has Help or Preferences options so naming the
DAoption seems too specific, though those aren't poor places for these
DAsettings. Having Accessibility in the first option is a way to ensure that
DAthe uninitiated (the point J Gunderson notes below) can easily come upon the
DAsettings, & easily toggle them On/Off.

DA
DAThis is a difficult issue, because so many things affect accessibility.
DAThis is one of the reasons we created the Accessibility Wizard for Windows
DA98.  That wizard asks the users a series of questions and sets options
DAacross the system, including display resolution, mouse pointers, and
DAaccessibility-specific options.
DA
DAJust taking the browser for example, you have colors and font type settings
DA- should those be in the Accessibility dialog or in a more general place?
DAAfter all, everyone uses those and if they are in a Accessibility dialog,
DAmainstream users might not find them.  Same is true of the font size.
DA
DAOur philosophy is this - place accessibility-specific options in a dialog
DAclearly labeled "Accessibility" and gotten though from the first page of the
DAOptions dialog.
DA
DAAs far as the guidelines go, the recommendation should be something like
DA"Make accessibility-specific features and options available in a clearly
DAmarked and easily accessible section of the program.  Preferably alongside
DAgeneral and often used settings."
