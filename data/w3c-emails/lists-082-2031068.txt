In response to Denic Anson,
Browsers that don't support CSS (Lynx for example) ignore style sheet
information.  
Netscape 4.0 allows you to disable the use of style sheets.
Explorer 4.0 is more complex.  It allows for the provision of user style
sheets.  Items specified in the users style sheet will override author
defined styles sheets.  This can be a problem though if the authors uses
style names or elements not included in the user styles sheets.  Explorer
does provide partial disabling of author style elements by checking ignore
color, ignore font size and ignore font style in the accessibility options.
 It doesn't allow the disabling of all style elements in the author styles
sheet, most importantly positioning attributes.
