to follow up on what Denis Anson said:

The CSS2 specification embraces the concept that ultimately, the
end-user should have the upper hand in control over styling.
This is implemented in two ways, by saying that a !important
marking from the user overrides such a marking by the author, and
by remarks about stylesheet management in the browser.

It is still up to the user agent software to implement these
provisions.  

Jon reviewed the current practices of various browsers.

The Browser Guidelines document has the opportunity to clarify
priorities for the browser implementation of style management
functions.

Hope this helps,

Al
