For number 1, absolutely there should be implementation guidelines.

For number 2, that's more difficult.  First guess would be that frames are
really separate browser windows and in the JScript/VBScript world, one frame
does not know about another frame.  Given that isolation, I'd say that the
numbering of links would be consecutive within a frame.  Focus can only be
in one frame at a time, however selection can be in multiple frames (just
like in Windows Explorer where you can tab between the Tree View and the
List view.  The selection remains in both panes (frames) but the focus is in
the currently active pane (frame).

FYI - once again this message almost didn't make it to the list because of
the stupid way the W3C won't set the REPLY-ALL header.  During the spell
check I noticed the list was not on the TO: line. Last week one of my
messages did not make it to the list and someone replied to one of my
messages that maybe was intended for the list.

Subject: frames and frame attributes


I have a few questions and comments regarding frames in relation to the UA
guidelines.

1. Should the guidelines specify that the UA should provide access to the
frame title and longdesc attributes, both of which are included in the page
author guidelines? The way the guidelines are currently formatted it seems
like this guideline should appear in 8.2 compatibility with HTML 4.0 but I
wonder if we need a separate section on frames.


2. Will the mechanisms for providing direct access to elements change if
the page is framed? I am just wondering if numbering links or searching for
links and moving the selection /focus will be affected by the use of frames.


Thanks,
Kitch
