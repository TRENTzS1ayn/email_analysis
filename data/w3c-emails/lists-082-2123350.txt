A couple of points - the W3C does not create standards, they create
recommendations.  The guidelines reference Java Accessibility API which is
considered fairly proprietary.  If the guidelines recommend those, why
should they not recommend SAMI?

I don't believe SAMI is a W3C standard.  SAMI I belive is a proprietary
standard of Microsoft and the W3C from my understanding does not comment on
proprietary standards.  If some one from Microsoft or anywhere else has any
other information, please post to the list.  This same issue came up with
accessibility APIs.
