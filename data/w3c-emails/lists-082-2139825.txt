You could create a user style sheet that would set all the known CSS
properties to a setting you choose, but there is no general user interface
for disabling all author-side CSS properties.

Last I was told, but I didn't have time to check, and maybe if Chuck
is reading that, he can tell us how to do it, this is possible in IE
using some script (JavaScript, VB, I don't know, I don't even know how 
to plug it in).
