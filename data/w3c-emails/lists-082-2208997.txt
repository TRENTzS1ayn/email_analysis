I originally posted this as part of the smil track because those of us in
that subgroup are looking at all of these types of pluggins and operables
if you will just like we all look at the different browsers.  My reason
then was to provide something besides g2 and the wgbh smil examples for us
to look at for issue comparison.  I think unless jim allan and the rest of
the ggroup are ready to do so that I'm not aware of, we don't have a
guideline or an issue track as yet unless you look at the current work.
Also chuck, I'm quite interested in the audio description component soon
to be added.
and I've a question.  is there going to be a player independant util for
this.  for one reason or annother some of us will not or cannot use the ms
media player.  I am not one of them but there are issues even if rhumoured
you know.
Thanks!

CCOSo is the question "Should SAMI be included in the guidelines similar to
CCOMSAA and JAP?"  or is the question "Let's review SAMI as part of the UA
CCOguidelines?"
CCO
CCOOf course, I'm just talking about the first question.

CCOWe recommend the use of accessibility APIs, and have a reference to known
CCOaccessibility APIs including Active Accessibility.  But we don't try to set
CCOor discuss specifications for those accessibility API standards.  We can
CCOhave input into W3C recommendations.  
CCO
CCOIs SAMI part of any W3C recommendation processes?

CCO>>SAMI Article #1:
CCO>>
CCO>>With the recent release of Windows Media Player came SAMI captions. SAMI,
CCO>>Synchronized Accessible Media Interchange, is a single authoring format
CCOfor
CCO>>captions and audio descriptions.  This article and set of demos focus on
CCO>>captioning. There will be subsequent articles on audio description (see
CCO>list
CCO>>below).

CCO>>There has been much confusion about the role of SAMI vs. the role of SMIL.
CCO>>The two are quite different though they use similar techniques to
CCO>accomplish
CCO>>their goals. SMIL is a set of XML based elements used for presenting and
CCO>>positioning synchronized components of a multimedia presentation. On the
CCO>>other hand, SAMI is an authoring format solely designed to deliver
CCO>>synchronized captions and audio description. SAMI has been designed to
CCO>>provide multiple language and style support. The latter is critical for
CCO>>accessibility. That is, if the user is unable to read the captions due to
CCOa
CCO>>visual impairment then we can question whether we have provided captions
CCOto
CCO>>that user. Thus, SAMI supports multiple styles so the caption author can
CCO>>provide, in addition to a standard font, several varieties of large print
CCO>or
CCO>>color combinations for the user to select from. Furthermore, SAMI
CCO>introduces
CCO>>an optional Source ID line that continuously displays the source of the
CCO>>sound. This is valuable for many dyslexics and people with short-term
CCO>memory
CCO>>loss (those, like myself, over 40). 
CCO>>
CCO>>Future articles:
CCO>>* Using SAMI for Closed Captions on the Web (mid September)
CCO>>* SAMI Support of Audio Description (mid October)
CCO>>* SAMI as an authoring format for EIA608, EIA708, DVD, and Web encoding -
CCO>>full SAMI spec (mid November)
CCO>>* SAMI Caption Authoring Tool (mid December)
