Response to Chuck Oppermann.
1. The UA guidelines would want to focus on the potential user interface
issues of a SAMI player related to accessibility.  

2. The potential recommendation or reference to use SAMI as an authoring
format for accessibility would be under the Page Authoring guidelines to
consider.

3. Features for Authoring Tools to create accessible SAMI documents would
be part of the tools working group.

Would you like to propose adding a section in the User Agent guidelines on
features for an accessible SAMI player?

Jon
