The 'window.open ( )' command in Javascript will spawn a new browser window.
Some of the options are browser dependent, but with some browsers you can
control
size, placement, whether there is a toolbar, whether the new window has the
focus,
whether it is independent from the parent window, etc.

There is a good, relatively browser-neutral description of the command at:
