The next Face-to-Face meeting for the UA group is being scheduled for
October 24th-25th in Minneapolis, MN, U.S.A.  the meeting follows the
Closing the Gap (CTG) Assistive Technology Conference, and is in the same
hotels as CTG.  It will be a two day technical meeting discussing only the
user agent guidelines and will be an important step in the process of
creating a proposed recommendation for the W3C.  There will be no other W3C
WAI working group meeting at this time.  CTG was chosen to try to bring
assistive technology developers into the UA guideline process.  

Are there any comments or concerns about the location or the date of the
next meeting?  Please respond as soon as possible.

Thanks,
Jon
