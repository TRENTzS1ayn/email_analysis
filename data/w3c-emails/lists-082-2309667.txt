Harvey is giving an all-day presentation on XML this day.
I have scheduled early lunch break at 11:30, at which time I'll
be able to join the telecon. I have been preparing this lecture for
the last week, and have not been productively contributing to the
tables work, as I had promised. I hope you can reverse the scheduled
time to do the tables discussion till after 11:30.
