The correct dates for the next W3C WAI User Agent face-to-face meeting is:
Dates: Sunday and Monday, October 25th and 26th (immediately following
Closing the Gap)
Location: Minneapolis, Minnesota, U.S.A

Only the UA group will be meeting during the 2 days and the goal is to try
to finalize a document that can be used as the basis of a proposed
recommendation.

If you think you will be attending, let me know as soon as possible.   We
are trying to figure out how many hotel rooms and the size of the
conference room needed.

Thank you, hope to see you there.
