Scott,

I think a demonstration might be useful.  Some of the concepts are not
obvious, and even when you think you understand how they work, actual
practice shows unforseen consequences.

Subject: A short demo of some keyboard navigation


Hi,
I was wondering if it might be useful if I did a brief demo of some
of the keyboard navigation in my prototype browser.  It has both
a "chunk" navigation and some table navigation in it.  The browser
is available via telnet and I could give a demo during one of the
conference calls.  (Your computer only needs to have telnet on it.)

Scott
