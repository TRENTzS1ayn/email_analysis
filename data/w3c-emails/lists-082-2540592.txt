I think that feeding audio into the phone might easily be the best way to
make the demo work.  If we were all to call of the same page, and have Raman
navigate with EmacSpeak (I always thought that was a UNIX gizmo, and never
even tried to run it under Windows!) while we all looked at the page, it
could be a very nice demo.

Hi, Denis
It's pretty easy to set up the demo.  People just need to telnet during the
call and I can demonstrate various aspects.  If someone is using a screen
reader, it might be helpful to do a test run ahead of time to make sure that
the screen reader is properly configured.

It might be interesting to hear a demo of browser keyboard navigation
in Raman's Emacs-speak.  Most people I know don't use Emacs and aren't
interested in trying to instal it on a Windows system.  Perhaps, the
demo could be done by feeding speech output from Emacs-speak into a
phone connected to the conference call?
