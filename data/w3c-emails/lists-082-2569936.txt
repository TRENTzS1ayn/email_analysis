Hello WAI UA Guidelines WG Member:

A few updates on the October 25-26 meeting in Minneapolis:

AIRLINES: 

Northwest Airlines usually carries the majority of traffic into
Minneapolis. As a result of the strike, we recommend you book your flights
as soon as possible on an alternate airline while there is still good
availability of seats.

HOTEL: 

The "W3C/WAI" reservation block is activated at the Sofitel Hotel, for
Saturday/24, Sunday/25, Monday/26 nights. If you had previously registered
at a "rack rate" or higher rate for another event, you can switch to the
W3C/WAI block for a $109/night rate.

REGISTRATION: 

The meeting registration form is now active, and linked from the meeting
agenda page which is at http://www.w3.org/WAI/1998/10/agenda-ua. The
registration form is different from W3C forms you may have used previously.
One of the forms will ask you for a "user authentication." You can put
anything in here, just remember it.

- Judy
