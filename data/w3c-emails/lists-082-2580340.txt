Not to be left out...

WebSpeak has full keyboard navigation of web pages. Documentation on the
product is available at http://www.prodworks.com/pwwr2.htm and an eval
version is also available.  Keyboard functions are customisable, as are the
rendering and what I guess might be called "chunking" rules (we call them
page elements).
