We used to run into a number of sites with the ISINDEX element
http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/interact/forms.html#edef-ISINDEX

ISINDEX is deprecated in HTML4, and the recommended example is to use a form
with no submit button.

Default behaviour is that the enter press sends the data. This is no
different than the "default action" on enter press if there were a submit
button.

In webspeak, we have taken to actually generating for the user a submit
button when none is specified.
