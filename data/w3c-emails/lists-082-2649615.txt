The enclosed is a rewrite and augmentation of the material on tables from
the UA guidelines of 19980814, subsections 4.6 and 6.5.

In the htm, I have used emphasis around some text changes. I have redone
and shortened the table examples, so they are new. I may not have done
enough with spanning TH cells, only a note.
