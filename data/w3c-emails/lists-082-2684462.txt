In todays telecon we discussed having UA developer demonstrations of their
products accessibility features during the breaks or evenings of the F2F
meeting in October.  It was felt like this was a good idea, but that there
should be some guidance to the vendors on what they present.  Particularly
that presentations should be tied to the discussions of the guidelines.
For example when we are talking about table rendering issues, that
technology that has addressed table rendering could be demonstrated at that
time or before that session discussing tables.  

There are several questions:
1. What times should the demonstrations take place?
2. What guidance should we give developers for their presentations?

Please send your comments soon, since we need to get this organized.
