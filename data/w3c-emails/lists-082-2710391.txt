I plan to be at the face-to-face after CTG to demonstrate IBM Home Page
Reader's features that illustrate implementations of the UA guidelines.

I think independent self-voicing browser vendors should be able to address how
their browsers implement each guideline with few problems. However, which
vendors will demonstrate how dependent browsers (Navigator, Opera, LYNX,  I.E.,
etc.), which work with screen readers/screen magnifiers, implement each
guideline - the browser vendors, screen reader/screen magnifier vendors, or
both? I think it would be great to hear from both types of vendors.
