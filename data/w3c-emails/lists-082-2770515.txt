To increase participation in the UA telecons I would like to move the
Spetember 16th and 30th telecon time to 1:00-2:00 Eastern Standard Time, or
one hour later than we have been meeting.  

Please let me know if this is a problem for anybody planning on
participating in the telecons.
Thank you,

Jon
