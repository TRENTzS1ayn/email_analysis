Since I did not receive any response that people could not meet one hour
later,  I would like to change the time for tommorrow's telecon and the
September 30th telecon, since the bridge is available at the later time.
We will start 1 hour later at:

12:00 EST
11:00 CST
10:00 MST
9:00 PST

Agenda
1. Discussion on the reformatting of a working draft 
2. Tables 
3. Keyboard navigation 


I will post an example of a modified section of the guidelines later today.
 I will notify people by e-mail when I post it.
