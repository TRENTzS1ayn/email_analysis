The WAI-PF group has been assigned the job of collecting
requirements ideas for the DOM.  The DOM working group is in the
process of reviewing possible requirements for level 2, the next
level to be developed.

Rich Schwerdtfeger is the focal point for collecting these ideas.
Requirements should be backed up by a description of a scenario
which illustrates how this affects usability of the Web for
people with disabilities.

If you have any ideas, please send them to the WAI-PF list
at <w3c-wai-pf@w3.org>.
