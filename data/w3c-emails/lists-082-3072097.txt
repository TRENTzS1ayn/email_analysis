Scott, is what you mean that the browsers should make the underlying 
HTML, or an equivalently marked-up rendering scheme, available to 
assistive technology plug-ins? In this case, it seems like a good idea if 
the browser wants to be a universal one. (As opposed to a browser that is 
concieved as useful for a small number of people, such as EIA, and could 
justify the 'bloat' argument.) 

To use the guidelines as a legal stick would require that they were much 
more tightly written, and thingswere much more tightly specified than is 
desirable, since it would make it difficult to accommodate advances in 
technology at a sufficient rate to be valuable. And it would seem to me 
that lawyers, who have the necessary background to create documents that 
can be used in legal arenas do not generally have the background reauired 
to formulate guidelines. Besides which, the law in the US and the law in 
Australia and the law in the UK operate differently. Are we writing an 
International treaty, or a useful document for people trying to get the 
best product to the market the fastest?
