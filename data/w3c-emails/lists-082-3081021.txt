It sounds like Microsoft may be willing to reserve specific key combinations
to
support a specific navigation strategy in their standards. Am I interpreting
your message correctly, Chuck?

I know my reply to this is late, but it's a important reply.  To be
perfectly clear - my opinion is that the goal of the guidelines should be to
inform browser manufactures of the needs of people with disabilities and
*recommend* what the browser should do in certain user/author scenarios.
Given that, I don't believe it's necessary, nor practical to recommend
specific keyboard sequences.  It should be noted in the guidelines that
whatever keyboard model is used should be consistent with the keyboard model
in place in the users platform.

Has anyone compiled a matrix of reserved key combinations and their
functions on
various platforms, like Ctrl-Z on Windows? And perhaps more important,
unreserved key combinations? Does Microsoft maintain such a list for its
standards, Chuck?

We do have the Windows Keyboard Guide on http://microsoft.com/enable/, but
it does not have a matrix like you wish.  It's a project that I want to work
on in a few months.
