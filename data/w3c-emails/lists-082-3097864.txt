Scott, is what you mean that the browsers should make the underlying 
HTML, or an equivalently marked-up rendering scheme, available to 
assistive technology plug-ins? In this case, it seems like a good idea if 
the browser wants to be a universal one.

That is already available in a browser specific fashion with Internet
Explorer through the Dynamic HTML object model.  A generic object model is
also exposed that is compatible across applications, we call that Active
Accessibility.  This has been available since May of 1997.
