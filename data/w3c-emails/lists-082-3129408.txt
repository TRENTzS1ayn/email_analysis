This is not the appopriate list for discussing legal issues related to the
W3C UA guidelines.  The W3C releases recommendations, and does not have any
enforcement mechanism to legally force any comapny to use it's
recommendations.  We want use our resouces to focus on improving the
accessibility of WWW technology and not directing our limited resources
trying to predict any future political use or non-use of the guidelines by
any country.  Remmember our group serves on behalf of the W3C advisory
group.  If they feel the guidelines are being politicized, they would
probably review our charter.

The chair and editor,
Jon
