As Scott points out, there are people out there whose job it will
be to write regulations.  The WAI-UA group did not set out to do
their job for them.  On the other hand, a scenario where the
WAI-UA guidelines get picked up and misapplied by people who are
under the gun to write regulations _fast_ seems a plausible risk,
to me.

Either of two outcomes would be an error: if the prospective
regulators viewed the document this group is producing as either

a) irrelevant to their task
b) draft public policy ready for adoption and enforcement

that would be an error.

Partly, that is why we have an International Program Office in
the WAI -- to provide the follow-through needed to see that the
results of the technical working groups get appropriately
applied.

Maybe a meta-guideline on the relationship between this technical
work and public policy initiatives would be a help, and maybe we
should ask the IPO to take the lead in developing that?
