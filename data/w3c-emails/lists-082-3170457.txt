Laws have a different test to become a reality than the current W3C WAI UA
guidelines.  While legislators in some countries may choose the UA
recommendations as a basis for an accessibility law, I am sure they will be
greatly transformed in the process and look quite different.    It would
also be one of many documents and other types of input that would go into
any law.  I think it would be wise of us to focus on our present task of
developing useful design recommendations to meet the needs of W3C member
companies and persons with disabilities throughout the world, than to
contemplate how our guidelines would be used in developing legislation in
any particular country.
