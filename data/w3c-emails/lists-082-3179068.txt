Hi, John
I understand what you mean about W3C releasing recommendations and not
having any enforcement power.  However, my impression is that
regulations could have a greater impact on developers than guidelines.
For example, if in the US the access board specifies what an accessible
browser must contain for the entities covered by 508, developers who
want to market their browser to these entities will do their best to
ensure that their browsers comply.  If regulations are developed which
are inconsistent with the guidelines, how important are the guidelines?
By developing an appendix or perhaps a separate document on using the
guidelines for developing regulations, we might be making life a little
easier for developers, regulation writers and disabled browser users.

I'm not sure that the other projects taken on by the W3C may have the
save level of susceptibility of being turned into regulation or
law.  The W3C may not understand how there can be a greater chance
of this occuring with regards to browsers as a consequence of
legislative activities related to accessibility.
