I think this discussion about using the guidelines as the basis of
regulations is premature.  Let's have great guidelines, and have a great
techniques document that can show developers different ways to include
accessibility features.   We don't have that yet.

Remember that we are part of the W3C and are serving the insterests of the
W3C membership.  The W3C didn't ask us to create a regulatory document and
if we create a document that appears to be regulatory I would assume it
would be met with tremendous opposition.  Most W3C member companies are not
looking to be regulated.  Remmember it is not us that has the last say on
recommendations, but the W3C advisory group.   

I will bring this topic to the attention of the Coordination Group and
report back to the group. 

Let's focus on the content of the guidelines.
