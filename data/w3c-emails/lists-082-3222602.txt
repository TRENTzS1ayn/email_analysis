There has been some recent discussions on the UA list about the UA
guidelines being used as the basis of a disability access law.  This is a
major distraction from our goal of developing the guidelines.  I have
reported to the group that the W3C has no enforcement power on
recommendations and that W3C is probably not interested in helping to
create regulations for it's member companies.  

Is this issue something that we need to discuss as a coordinating group?
