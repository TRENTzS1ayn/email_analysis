HTML 4.0 Attributes that invoke a script:

  onblur      %Script;       #IMPLIED  == the element lost the focus ==
  onchange    %Script;       #IMPLIED  == the element value was changed ==
  ondblclick  %Script;       #IMPLIED  == a pointer button was double licked==
  onfocus     %Script;       #IMPLIED  == the element got the focus ==
  onkeydown   %Script;       #IMPLIED  == a key was pressed down ==
  onkeypress  %Script;       #IMPLIED  == a key was pressed and released ==
  onkeyup     %Script;       #IMPLIED  == a key was released =="
  onload      %Script;       #IMPLIED  == the document has been loaded ==
  onmousedown %Script;       #IMPLIED  == a pointer button was pressed down ==
  onmousemove %Script;       #IMPLIED  == a pointer was moved within ==
  onmouseout  %Script;       #IMPLIED  == a pointer was moved away ==
  onmouseover %Script;       #IMPLIED  == a pointer was moved onto ==
  onmouseup   %Script;       #IMPLIED  == a pointer button was released ==
  onreset     %Script;       #IMPLIED  == the form was reset ==
  onselect    %Script;       #IMPLIED  == some text was selected ==
  onsubmit    %Script;       #IMPLIED  == the form was submitted ==
  onunload    %Script;       #IMPLIED  == the document has been removed ==

Many of these events depend on the visual positioning of a mouse/cursor.

These need some analysis of the effects of using keyboard equivalents, and
the different effects that do not have equivalents.

We mentioned "bubbling up" to a more global handler. 

There may be no event sequence that is dependable when working in a
different user agent.

The hands-free, eyes-free environment, where vocal command equivalents need 
to be recognized, represents another set of challenges.
