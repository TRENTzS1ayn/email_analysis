That's all supposed to be there.  Consider the use of PAR to have
the video and audio play in sync, and test-variable conditions on
the audio so that it depends on whether the user wants the
description played or not.  Another way this can be programmed is
if there is already a soundtrack, one wraps the basic sound track
and the sound track with the descriptive inlay in a SWITCH so
that the user can select among them.  This is all subject to having
the logic and implementation verified that it works, but in principle
those are already possible to do.

I don't recommend extending SWITCH to handle user-controlled
positioning.  It is basically a SELECT construct under a new
name.

The built-in layout capability is primitive, because the
long-term plan is to do the layout in CSS or XSL.  The user's
ability to re-position a caption display region is definitely an
interactive capability for the UA guidelines above and beyond
what the author gives you in layout.  [Note my long-term flames
that we need to take a more object-oriented view of the display
medium.]

The timing model is pretty flexible.  I think there is enough
in the basic model.  Yes, this is a topic where the UA guidelines
need to pick up on where the format definition leaves off.
