Keep in mind that this extension would be quite simple: the addition
of one test attribute.  The timing model of SMIL currently meets the
timing requirements of audio descriptions.  This new test attribute,
named "system-audio-desc", would be assigned as "on" to audio elements
that contain audio descriptions, causing them only to be played if
audio description is requested.  Other test attributes, such as
"system-captions", that function in the same manner for similar types
of adaptation are already in SMIL 1.0.  New test attributes are
perhaps the simplest (depending on what they test, but testing for
assigned user characteristics is trivial) and most expected type of
SMIL extension.
