The switch statement described above chooses between a layout without
captions and another layout with captions.  Here, both layouts are
specified by the author, not the user.  This enables both layouts with
the look-and-feel the author desires, which would include making sure
not visual conflicts occur.  What the user has control over is simply
which layout to use.  This author-centered adaptation is based on the
perception that proper overall layout for all adaptation is best
handled by the author because it is (currently) too complex a problem
(though it is the topic of some current research) to have the system
figure out at runtime to reconfigure the layout in a way that avoid
conflicts when the user places a screen object at any position.

But one can have a special place for captions in a presentation
system, perhaps a separate window, for example.  One way to extend
SMIL to handle such presentation-time inclusion and positioning of
media is with the idea of "channels".  Rather than, or perhaps in
addition to, being placed in a layout region, captioning could be
assigned to a channel, which represents an abstract presentation
peripheral.  At presentation time the system decides how to handle
this and other types of channels.  Channels enable a lot of adaptation
and could solve other accessibility problems as well if introduced
into SMIL.
