Instead of an ISMAP view of looking for mouse positions, the author could
have associated IDs with each of the images.  The event handler could get
the ID of the object and know which of the images was clicked on without
needing to compare mouse coordinates with image coordinates (although the
later could also be done).  

One way to partically identify elements that respond to events is to
require that they define the ID attribute.   But, IDs can also be used to
manipulate an element in response to another elements reponse to a DHTML
event, so this is not necessarily a definitive identification that the
element responds to an event.

Does this make sense?
