The mouse-location problem (and the problem with the server-sided-map 
problem under discussion) is part of the problem caused by thinking of 
things on a graphic browser first, rather than in the more abstract terms 
of a location within the document - the 'browsing cursor', or immediate 
context provided by traversing a DOM tree.

If there were a browsing cursor giving a context, and if there were
stronger classing of scripts (see my next message about DOM) then it might
be possible to provide more information to the user about what was likely
to happen, even if it remained impossible to regenerate the visual cues in
a non-visual environment.
