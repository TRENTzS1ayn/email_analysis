We cannot think of Dynamic HTML as only operating on current HTML elements.
 Dyanmic HTML needs to be though of as an application interface, that will
create and modify the HTML content on the screen based on user actions and
portential interactions with application servers.  Only the simpliest uses
of DHTML can we think of it like a style sheet which only affects the
rendering of static HTML elements.
