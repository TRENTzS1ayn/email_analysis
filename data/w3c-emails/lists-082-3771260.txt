This is true. What interests me is the question of whether, rather than an
ID identifying the elements which are dynamic, we can put it on the script
author (or the user agent to automagically extract the information from
the script) to declare which elements they act on. (Is this a page
authoring thing? or not yet?) This information combined with a knowledge 
of which properties (or classes of properties) are affected could be used 
to sort out which events are important for the user to be able to predict 
in advance, and which need not be worried about.
