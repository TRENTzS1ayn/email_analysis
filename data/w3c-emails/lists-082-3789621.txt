Thanks you for detailed descriptions.  I think your suggests are important
issues and we need to discuss these as a group.  The first two issues are
clearly under the control of the browser.  The third is dependent on
whether the browser supports multiple windows, if not it maybe a more at an
operating system level to know how many copies of a browser are running.
