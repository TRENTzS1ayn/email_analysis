assuming that you talk about text captions here: one
version is enough

the following example from the SMIL REC shows how this works,
see
http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-smil/#test

====

In the following example, captions are shown only if the user wants captions on. 

...
<seq>
  <par>
    <audio      src="audio.rm"/>
    <video      src="video.rm"/>
    <textstream src="stockticker.rtx"/>
    <textstream src="closed-caps.rtx" system-captions="on"/>
  </par>
</seq>
...

====

The second textstream object is only shown if the "system-captions"
test attribute evaluates to "true", which is the case when the
user has requested captioning

Lloyd proposed a similar test attribute to switch audio descriptions
on and off (see my previous message)
