Philipp, can you bring me up to date?

At one time we talked loosely about a possible user capability to
add/delete streams to/from the playlist.  Additions could be made
from resources whose test variable conditions failed or spare
resources from SWITCH collections.

Has the group considered this as a browser/player function?

Is this:
required functionality for any SMIL player from the SMIL spec?
        or a compatible extension of functionality?
        or a violation, an incompatible extension of functionality?

Given that we don't have a standard test variable for this, the
player should perhaps give the user the capability to turn on the
track even if the player and the author haven't got together on
the name for the appropriate test condition.

I think there is already language in the SMIL spec such that the
ensemble should contain an explanation of what each resource is
good for, suitable for guiding the user in editing the playlist.
