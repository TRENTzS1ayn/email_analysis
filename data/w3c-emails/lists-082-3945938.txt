Guideline ratings and interpretation.  I would like to get some discussion on
current guideline rating system.  In past telecons the issue has been raised
about mainstream borwsers, specialized browsers and 3rd party assitive
technology compatibility.  

Does our current rating system reflect concerns of these three groups?

Do we want to change the following definitions?


Rating and Classification
Each guideline is classified according to the following rating system:
[Priority 1] 
This guideline must be implemented, or one or more groups of users will
find it
impossible to access information in the document. Implementing this guideline
is a basic requirement for some groups to be able to use WWW documents. 
[Priority 2] 
This guideline should be implemented, or one or more groups of users will find
it difficult to access information in the document. Implementing this
guideline
will significantly improve access to WWW documents. 
[Priority 3] 
This guideline should be implemented to make it easier for one or more
groups of
users to access information in the document. Implementing this guideline will
improve access to WWW documents.
