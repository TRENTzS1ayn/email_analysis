Won't the rating system depend partly on how the UA Guidelines are organized? For
instance, will there be separate guideline sections for mainstream vs specialized
browsers? Or one guideline section with separate ratings for each browser class?
Or...?

Out of curiosity, where/how do third-party media players (e.g. VRML players) fit
in? Is that mainstream or specialized?
