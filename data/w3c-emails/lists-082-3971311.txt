Literally two minutes after I sent the last message about today being the
deadline, I got a notice informing us that the deadline has now been
extended until 13-October (Tuesday).

Tuesday is the last day to register for a hotel for the WAI User Agent
Working Group Meeting in Minneapolis on October 25-26.
