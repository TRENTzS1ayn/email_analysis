We could try to separate into "mainstream" vs. "specialized" and have
different rating systems.  But I think this assumes that we know how
technology will change in the future.  What might be consdiered a
specialized feature today, may be considered a mainstream idea tommorrow.
So we could insert the following statement into each priority level:
"by user agents as a built-in feature or through compatibility with
assistive technology"

Revised Priority List:
[Priority 1]
This guideline must be implemented by user agents as a built-in feature or
through compatibility with assistive technology, or one or more groups of
users with disabilities will find it impossible to access information in
the document. Implementing this guideline is a basic requirement for some
groups to be able to use WWW documents.
[Priority 2]
This guideline should be implemented by user agents as a built-in feature
or through compatibility with assistive technology, or one or more groups
of users will find
it difficult to access information in the document. Implementing this
guideline will significantly improve access to WWW documents.
[Priority 3]
This guideline should be implemented by user agents as a built-in feature
or through compatibility with assistive technology, to make it easier for
one or more groups of
users to access information in the document. Implementing this guideline
will improve access to WWW documents.
