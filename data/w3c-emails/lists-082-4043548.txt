JRG: I think we are currently using "impossible", "difficult" and "easier"
to describe our three levels.  I like them better than must, should, may
for UA.

We cannot specify any particular technique, but the new techniques document
(to be made public to the group this week) can recommend a range of ways to
implement a particular guideline.  I think we want to let deveolpers find
their own solutions to a given guideline, but we do want to make it clear
in the guideline the funcaitonality that is needed.  I think the techniques
document is critical in giving direction to the implementation process and
coordinating efforts between mainstrem browsers and 3rd party assistive
technology.  I think it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to say
to a develper you need to do it just like this.
