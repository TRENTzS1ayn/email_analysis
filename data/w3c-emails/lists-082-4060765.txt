A draft of the guidelines should be ready by Wednesday morning and I will
make an announcement when it is available.  The biggest difference from the
old to the new format is the creation of a techniques document to discuss
implementation strategies.  The guidelines document should be somewhat
abstract, but very stable.  The techniques document can change based on new
ideas, technology or research for implementing a particular guideline.   It
will be very important to recruit people to contribute and review the
techniques document.  So I will be asking people to help in this task.  If
we all can take a small part it will get done alot faster.
