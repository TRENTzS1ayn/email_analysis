And I think:
must/should/may applies to how important it is to implement the
guideline, which corresponds to whether the result will be impossible,
difficult or easy to use.

my concern is:
if the developer is producing both the browser and the assistive
technology which companies like microsoft are perfetctly capable of,
then it is fine for them to state that their suite of products
provides a complete solution. If we are aiming for an open forum,
where people can produce pieces of the solution, then there needs to
be a standard that says how those pieces fit together (is that an
API?). If we take Jon's approach then I suspect that we will be
pleasing the big players at the expense of the little players. Since
smoe of the user groups here are fairly small, they are likely to be
interested as little players.

I know this is getting pretty airy-fairy, but it seems that we need to
think about it. My hope is that we can say to the developers
"implement the DOM as an interface..." and it will work.
