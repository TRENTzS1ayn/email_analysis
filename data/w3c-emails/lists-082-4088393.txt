1) I agree that the guidelines should specify 'what needs to be possible' and
not the technical specifics of 'how to do it', so that the guidelines support
rather than impede advancements. Remember: Older, highly specific
specifications for wheelchairs stymied introduction of wheelchairs that are
lighter, more practical, easier to use and more fun to be in.

2) Re: "I think we should listen to our developer representatives in the group
on what helps them the most".
Yes -- As long as we keep in mind that user advocacy, not developer advocacy,
is our primary task. After all, what helps developers most is guidelines that
match what they are already working on -- which may or may not be what's best
for end users.
