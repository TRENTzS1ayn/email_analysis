We're trying to get MSAA 1.2 out the door and I cannot attend today's
conference call.  My apologies and hopefully will see everyone in
Minneapolis.

One of the these I did want to see discussed on the call today was "When are
we going to ship the guidelines?"  It's been over a year now and we've
missed the boat for Internet Explorer 5 and if there is any chance of
getting the next version of IE to consider some of the priority 1
guidelines, a close to final version needs to be published and then
evangelized to the IE team.

I would like to add to the agenda today a discussion about the
relationships and the definition of current use of focus, selection and a
new term that we have been using called the "point-of-reguard".  I would
like to spend the first part of the meeting, because I think it will be
important for wording the guidelines.

Updated Agenda
12:00-12:30 Terminology for Selection, Focus and Point-of-Reguard
12:30-1:00 DHTML issues
