proposal to give the user power over browser windows P1. Yes, absolutely, 
for the reasons outlined.

Allow the uer to block creation of new windows, analagous to current 
handling of cookies, p2(1?). I think this is a P3. Assuming new windows 
can be handled accessibly anyway, it is not so necessary, just a nice 
thing to do. Techniques  - allow user to specify (time by time, or set a 
default, at the user's option) whether to allow a new window to be 
opened, the new address to be opeened in the current window, or the new 
address ignored (ahhh - goodbye to GeoCities' advertising. followed I 
suppose by GeoCities itself. hmmm)

If the browser supports multiple windows/browsers make it happen 
explicitly. This seems to be something that every other application 
written can happilt do, but which browsers seem to leave to the OS. It 
should be a P1, but I can't think of any group who is going to be comletely 
cut off, although my experience has been that people simply hut down and 
start again after a  little while of this. I guess it is a priority 2 
really - it really would very significantly improve accessibility.

And yes, Opera certainly allows good windowing control, either by mouse 
or keyboard. Alternatively there is the Lynx approach, which also works 
wuite well, although it can make things frustrating. Accessible window 
control would be prefereable to not having any access to the convenience 
provided by a windows metaphor. W3 browser, running under emacs, also 
does this quite well.
