Hello,

I've published a new draft of the User Agent Guidelines, available
at [1]. The techniques document that goes with it is at [2]. 

The techniques document is largely empty today. Please bring your
ideas about fleshing it out to the face-to-face meeting in Minneapolis.

It is difficult to summarize the changes in this draft of the
guidelines since there have been many. I recommend that people
review the entire guidelines document to verify whether changes
they requested were made. If not, please inform the editors.

Aside from general editing, some of the main changes include:

- Section 2: General principles of accessible design. The number
  of principles in this section has been reduced to 6 in the hopes
  of making them weightier.

- Section 3: Terms and definitions. There is language that
  the definitions are meant to make the guidelines useful, but
  not more than that. The definitions have been tightened up.
  "Point of regard" has been added, but it is not fully defined
  yet (it may come from one of insertion point, user selection, or
focus).

- The guidelines now have more rationale/background information

- The techniques are now written with a consistent voice. 

- Each technique links to its "expansion" in the techniques document.
  As noted above, not many of the techniques are discussed more fully
  in the current release.

- There are techniques for scripts in 5.2 and 6.5

- In this release, the Postscript, PDF, and text versions of 
  both the guidelines and techniques documents are available (from links
at the            beginning of each document).

All comments are encouraged. 

 - Ian and Jon
