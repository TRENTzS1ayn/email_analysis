Could we strip a lot of the bulk by simply declaring the 
elements/attributes which we want supported, listed by priority level?

It seems to me that when we ask for the implementation of CSS, one of the 
features we shouold be specifically requesting is that the Cascade order 
be implemented as per CSS2 NOT CSS1, therefore we should say something a 
little more specific than "implement CSS 1"

There is not much necessity for a visual browser to implement an aural 
stylesheet, but this is one of the things that it certainly should make 
available to a third-party product such as a screen reader (which we 
should be asking to implement aural CSS)

Make something visible (used a few times) seems poor terminology - 
'expose it to the user' or somthing??
