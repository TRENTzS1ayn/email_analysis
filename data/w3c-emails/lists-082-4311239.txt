Yes, this is something the UA group should be thinking about.
The SMIL format provides adequate raw material via a declaration
of the hyperlinks much like a user-side image map in HTML.  There
is also provision for text identification for the sensitive zones
defined in time and screen space comparable to ALT on AREA.

How to integrate this into a catalog of destinations for users
who are not processing all the media in real time is open for
discussion.
