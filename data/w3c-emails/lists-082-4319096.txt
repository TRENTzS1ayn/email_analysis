Bryan,

I am forwarding this to the WAI-UA group who are developing the
User Agent guidelines, because this seems to be an issue of
browser behavior as much as what is in the page.

Thank you for the information.

Al

Charles visitors to the sites will appreciate the efforts, & it might help
to have clients read columns like these

I'm a person with a physical disability & type with a headwand, using only
keyboard controls to browse. There is an oddity with some pages like
http://tropicasa.com
that result in extra work moving the link highlight. On pages like
tropicasa.com using the Up or Previous Link control puts the link highlight
on the last link on the page, "Legal notices". Usually when the highlight
isn't on a link pushing the Up control puts the link highlight on the last
visible link at the lower right of the browser window. 
Starting in the middle of pages avoids going through routine links at page
top & bottom. This page is luckily ok because the many bottom links appear daily
http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap981010.html
A general way to stop repeated trips to page bottom will be much appreciated!

Regards,
Bryan
