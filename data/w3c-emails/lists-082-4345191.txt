(Note for UA people - the discussion comes from page authoring and which 
events should and should not be used - the initial premise was that all 
device-dependent events should not, although hopefully some could be 
replaced by 'logical events - ones which can be activated by keyboard, 
voice input, etc)

If onKeyPress passes no information about which key was pressed, then it 
could be mapped, along with onClick, to a new onActivate by UAs, 
providing a pathway for transition to the 'logical event' which we could ask 
for in future HTML.

There may be equivalents to onMouseDown, onMouseUp which should be 
considered at first in the context of making selections - I don't know 
how to do this using the keyboard in any browsers although I understand 
that mapping a mouse to the keyboard is offered by Windows systems. How 
this would translate to voice systems (or mobile phone systems, with 
voice and a limited number of keys) I am not sure.

But I do think that until we have some ide of how to proceed with this 
the page-authoring guidelines should recommend against it. I know that 
people will ignore that where they feel they need a rollover highlight 
for their client, but they can decide that this will not compromise 
accessibility without throwing out the whole guidelines. (Have some faith 
in the audience)
