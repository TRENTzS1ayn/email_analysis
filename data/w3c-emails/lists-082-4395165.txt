The discussion on PAGL was about logical events (those which specified a 
function) as opposed to device-dependent events.

The division below was the list as it stands. It occurred to me that we
could easily enough add onActivate - corresponding in a mouse interface to
onClick, and to pressing return to activate the item with focus in a
keyboard interface. 

I'm not sure about the rest, but I suspect that onMouseDown, onMouseUp,
onKeyDown, onKeyUp and onMouseMove are related to selecting a part of the
document. In determining how to do that we are likely to sort out the
relationship between the current device-dependent attributes and new
'logical' event triggers that can be triggered from various interfaces (eg
voice)

Which seems to me to leave onMouseOut and onDblClick out in the cold. One 
of the consequences of this is that we should recommend against using 
those events which we are likely to lose (except for providing 'eye-candy' 
- stuff that has no functional importance) and make suggestions about how 
the rest might be used in the page authoring guidelines. (have i said 
this before on this group? if so, sorry)

Chris is right, so for the sake of completeness I looked up all the event
attributes again.  Those which I think are device-dependent, and we should
recommend not be used are: 

onMousedown, onMouseup, onMouseover, onMousemove, onMouseout, onKeydown, 
onKeyup, onKeypress, onClick, onDblclick

Those which seem to be logical events are:

onFocus, onBlur, onSelect, onChange, onSubmit, onReset, onLoad, onUnload.

It should also be possible to define something like 'onActivate' - which 
would be equivalent to onClick for a link, but I guess this belongs to 
other groups.
