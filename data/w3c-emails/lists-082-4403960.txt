I came up with an illustration:

in IE and Navigator, a single click corresponds to onActivate (my 
hypothetical - a wish-list item) and a double click has no normal behaviour.

in Amaya, where browser and editor are together, a single click moves the 
insertion point (and the focus?) and a double click activates. In which 
case a double click should fire an onActivate event, and a single click 
an onFocus event.
