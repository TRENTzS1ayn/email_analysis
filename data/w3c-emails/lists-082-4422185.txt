This illustrates that what is stable across different UIs is the 
relative ordering of the event triggers, not exactly what they
are triggered by.

Something that is kicked off by waving the mouse by something is
the lightest touch.

Something that is kicked off by a single click is the next 
heaviest touch -- more like you mean it, can be used for more
serious consequences.

Something that is kicked off by a double-click is the heaviest
touch of all in this progression.  It is used for things that
you really think about before doing.
