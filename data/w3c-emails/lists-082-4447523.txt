Scripts and embedded objects are really new user interfaces that need to
follow the UA guidelines.  It would be difficult, if not impossible, to
have a browser user agent smart enough to figure out what a script or
embedded application is doing and how to create an accessible user
interface.  Therefore people doing scripting or writing embedded
applications need to follow UA and GL guidelines for making there part of
the interface accessible (providing keyboard events for all functions, for
example).  

This said many people would probably raise the complance flag.  many script
writers will not consider accessibility guidelines (or even know about
them).  So the user agent may be able to provide simple repair techniques,
for example providing keyboard navigation and synthesis of certain keyboard
events bound explicitly to a particular element (i.e ignore bubbling of
events).  This may repair many simple scripts to provide some level of
accessibility.
