I think that we should have guidelines that say develop accessible user
interfaces.  Mouse based input is not inherently bad.  It is only "bad"
when the author (programmer) does not also have keyboard equivalents that
are visible to the user.   Therefore the guidelines I think should talk
aboutcreating an accessible user interface, not a mouseless one.
