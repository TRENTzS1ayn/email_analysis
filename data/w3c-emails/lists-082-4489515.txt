Isn't the issue of GIF animations applicable to shockwave (or any other
animation object)?  I am familiar with a website that had the same
animation, done both as a shockwave plugin and as a GIF (for non-shockwave
euquipped browsers). The user could not tell the difference.

Does the IE "Show Animations" option apply to plug-ins, too? From the user
perspective, there needs to be a consistent UI for controlling media,
irrespective of the type. The user should not be expected to differentiate
the underlying media type (a GIF, SMIL, RealVideo, WinMediaPlayer,
Shockwave, etc.).
