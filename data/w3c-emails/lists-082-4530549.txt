Provide a global setting that media players can query via DOM?

Subject:RE: Put a time limit on animated gifs

Isn't the issue of GIF animations applicable to shockwave
(or any other
animation object)?  I am familiar with a website that had
the same
animation, done both as a shockwave plugin and as a GIF (for
non-shockwave
euquipped browsers). The user could not tell the difference.

Does the IE "Show Animations" option apply to plug-ins, too?
From the user
perspective, there needs to be a consistent UI for
controlling media,
irrespective of the type. The user should not be expected to
differentiate
the underlying media type (a GIF, SMIL, RealVideo,
WinMediaPlayer,
Shockwave, etc.).
