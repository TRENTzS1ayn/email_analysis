to follow up on what Greg Lowney said:

> Provide a global setting that media players can query via DOM?

Yes, for the right interpretation of "global."

One wants to be able to assert this globally, but no be limited
to making one global choice.  There are multilevel playable
objects to control and multilevel scopes in which to assert
scope-wide policies.  The play action on a temporal-content
object should have timeout as one of its standard options.  The
option is settable at all levels in a hierarchical play
structure, with interdependencies.  Stopping [timing out] a
parent stops all descendents.

The SMIL model is a reasonable place to start in defining this
hierarchical policy of play control.  The DOM should conveniently
support the following negotiation-of-control scenario: the author
program can fully specify a presentation segment and yet a policy
flowing down over the playable structure from the user can adjust
appropriate details.

One possible approach is that user preferences are rolled into an
"accepts-media" policy profile for a virtual device, and
substreams of content are allocated to these devices.  The point
here is that the user wants to treat captions, for example as a
reasonably autonomous subdomain from the bulk of the
presentation.  And the user wants to assert preferences against
classes of behavior (e.g. timeout everything that acts like a
video or animation).

Captions are a subdomain of activity where user overcalls are
more likely than outside that area, and the user is relatively
likely to wants to position or style the caption player as an
entity, apart from the full-presentation context.  So a virtual
device for such a channel is a logical choice of structure in
DOM-izing the play of multimedia.

Are there people who want to participate in the "multimedia UA"
discussions who don't have member access to the W3C site?  I can
out some stuff from <http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/Group/SMIL/> if
need be.
