There does not seem to be a good model for developers to use for adding
keyboard access to their interfaces using scripting languages.  It maybe
that elements with keyboard events need to become active elements, and in
many cases they already are.  For examples filtering the characters that go
into an edit box control.  We just need to extend the list of active
elements to any element with a keyboard even.  I think that if elements
with keyboard events can receive the focus from the UA (again through
keyboard commands), then it might solve some of these problems.  There
would also need to be author indication of what keys are available for that
element or sometype of UA indication.
