Hi Mark,

I don't believe the current version of the techniques document [1]
is different with respect to the above paragraph. The editors
would welcome any effort to:

1) Reduce redundancy in sections (now numbered) 8.1, 8.2, and 8.3. 
   
   Can we abstract the features and describe them one time? Then,
   in subsections dedicated to each platform, we can simply state
   which features are supported and any differences from the
abstractions.
   This would make the document easier to read and reduce the chance
   of error.

2) Establish a definitive and correct list of features.

Please let us know if you want to take a stab at this.

Thanks in advance,

 - Ian
