The above guideline was removed in the 30 October draft. Your
comments that follow will be integrated into the ntext draft.

At the face-to-face meeting there seemed to be consensus that
there should not be a single point-of entry in the interface
(since accessibility should be integrated) but that all accessibility
features should be documented in a chapter dedicated to accessibility.
The 30 Oct draft reflects this.

We need to discuss this further, I think.

Gone from the 30 October draft.

Thanks for the comments Kitch!
