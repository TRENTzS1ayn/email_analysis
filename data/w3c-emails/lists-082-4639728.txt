I would like to remind people about the UA telecon tommorrow to discuss the
reformatted guidelines.  Please let me know if you will or will not be
attending (some already have, thank you).  We need to make a decision about
another face-to-face meeting tommorrow.  So if you cannot attend please send
your comments to the list, and also if you have an opinion on another
face-to-face (for or against) please send that to the list. 

We will also discuss the coordination of submitting content to the
techniques. 
We have an number of volunteers willing to submit materials and hope that we
will get a few more.
