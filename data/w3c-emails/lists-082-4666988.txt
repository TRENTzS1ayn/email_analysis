I think the current guidelines put direct navigation into searching, since
when it is discussed it usuaully refers to bring up a list of elements
(i.e. links) and have the user use a numeric or aphabetic key board
commands to move through the list.  I am not sure there is a big
distinction between this type of direct navigation and the general concept
of searching.  It potentially may be an easier sell, if it is discussed as
searching (since many user agents already have search functions) than as
some new keyboard based technique.  

What do people think about combining direct navigation with search functions?

Jon
