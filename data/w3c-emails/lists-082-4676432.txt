Based on the telecon today I think that we will need another face-to-face
meeting in December to resolve outstanding UA issues.  The proposed date
would probably be Friday, December 11th in Boston, MA, U.S.A with the
possibility of an additional day before or after the 11th.   

To actually schedule the meeting we would need consensus in the group about
waving the 8 week notification rule on Face-To-Face meetings.

Does anybody object to less than 8 weeks of notification?

If the meeting is scheduled around December 11th would you be attending?

Please respond as soon as possible so we can make a final decision by
friday or monday.
Thanks,
Jon
