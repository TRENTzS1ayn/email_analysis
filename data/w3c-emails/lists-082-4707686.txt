I think we need to be clear that this concern mainstream browsers only 
(as you said, kiosk and other specialized agent often do not provide a 
3d-party API, so the issue doesn't exist there).

For mainstream browsers, we can then have 2 bits:
 - things that must be exposed thru an API
 - things that must be implemented directly
