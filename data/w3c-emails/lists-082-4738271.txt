Yes, we should not simply assume that the reader has already
defaulted to the CSS meaning for "property."

On the other hand, it is easier to agree on what properties
are as the user senses and perceives the user interface than
to agree what properties are style and what are not.

The writing in the UA Guidelines document should recognize that a
partner document, CSS, uses "property" in a restricted sense.
The document we are writing has to deal with the fact that there
are two definitions for "property" that are possible the reader
will apply when reading our document.  We should write in a way
which will make clear whether the general English or strict CSS
sense of the term is meant wherever the spelling "property"
appears.
