Coordination call with the page authoring group.  The page authoring group
has invited UA members to participate in a conference call next wednesday
to discuss issues related to compatibility between the two documents.  I

read the page authoring guidelines and if you cannot participate please
send coordination issues to the the UA list for consideration.
