3.1 content should be recognised as an alternative source of information 
for APPLET as well as OBJECT


Sources of blinking text and animation

User Agents which recognise BLINK, MARQUIS, the 'blink' value for the 
CSS property 'display', or other 
sources of moving text must provide the facility to freeze that text. 

in 3.3 - technique 4.3.1

Does linearising necessarily imply text only? I would not ahve thought 
so, although it must (to comply with other provisions) be able to be 
rendered as text only.

4.1 In general this requirement may be met by providing keyboard access 
to all functionality and by exposing that funtionality to third party 
technology.

5.1 Is it intrinsically aproblem to provide redundancy of menu control 
(from a user point of view) ? I would have thought that if it can be done 
then it might be quite useful to have an accessibility menu, for example, 
which simply repeats a number of controls that are also grouped in other 
categories.

in 5.3 - technique 5.3.2 Provide notification of changes in a document 
resulting from the execution of a script. Why is this priority 3?

7.1 Support accessibility features of HTML
LANG is priority 3. I would have thought it was 2 at least.


Some guidelines thoughts to follow...
