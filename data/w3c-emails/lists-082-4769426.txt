Jon,

I think we need to keep in mind the distinction between searching, browsing, 
and actually getting information from the web.

In my doctoral course, Teaching and Learning on the Web, we are doing a lot of 
web based research for focus papers.  We look at resources on the web, 
including on-line journals and the like.  We frequently read this articles (at 
least skim them) on the web.  If our navigation were combined with a list of 
links, we would be able to get to the top of the article, the bottom of the 
article, and perhaps an occasional internal link.  But we might have pages of 
information that was inaccessible to keyboard navigation.

No, I think we need a way to navigate the *content* of the page as well as the 
links off of the page.
