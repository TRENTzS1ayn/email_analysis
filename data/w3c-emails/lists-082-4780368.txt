Indeed. Browsing or page navigating consists of following an existing
'course' laid out by the links on a Web page (This is where 1 keystroke
navigation is vital!). Luckily I can eyeball a page to get a given piece of
information, that is searching as is using Opera's page search function to
highlight 1 or more words. I was very concerned about the idea of combining
navigation & searching into 1 function, but couldn't describe the difference
till Denis noted getting to & using information is 2 different things.
