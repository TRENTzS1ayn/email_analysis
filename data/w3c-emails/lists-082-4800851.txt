In section 3.1 
"Sources of blinking text and animation"

We find:
"In HTML 
* The BLINK element. Note. The BLINK element 
   is not defined by a W3C specification. 
* The MARQUIS element. Note. The BLINK 
   element is not defined by a W3C specification. "

Probably the second item should read:

* The MARQUEE element. Note. The MARQUEE element is not defined by a W3C
   specification. 

It is actually correct that also the MARQUIS and BLINQUE elements 
are not defined. <smile>

A side note:
The BLINK element in Communicator 4.0x can be turned off with
the stylesheet:   BLINK {text-decoration: none;}
(I checked it) But Communicator 4.0x does not allow user 
style sheets.
Also Explorer recognizes BLINK for stylesheets and scripting, but 
does not support  Netscape's default "decoration", thank God.
