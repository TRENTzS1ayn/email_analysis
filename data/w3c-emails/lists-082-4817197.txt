We are an association in France called FIDEV (Formation et Insertion pour D?ficients Visuels) that means Training and Integration for the visually impaired. Our purpose is to improve the professional integration of the blind and visually impaired persons.

Also, the accessibility of the web is our preocupation, that's why we met a few months ago Daniel Dardailler. We are happy today to participate to this kind of work.

About this guideline, we can say several things :
- the document is clear, and the structure of the document works well ;
- clear, but does every user agent manufacturer understand the stake of every recommendation, that means that every user agent manufacturer knows the customized equipment (terminal braille, voice synthetizer...) used by blind people or visually impaired ?
- we have to insist on the very important fact that the navigation must be possible through the keyboard, and only the keyboard ;
- the links : very often, it is possible to navigate from link to link. But, when you read a text, according to the terminal braille or the voice synthetizer used, the link will be not identified as a link. Therefore, it is necessary to precise it in front of the link. Exemple : [LINK]Fidev 
That is also true about a image, when this image is also a link. 

Some remarks important. We still continue our investigation : the state of the art of the customized equipment.
