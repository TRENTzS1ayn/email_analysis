I don't think the answer (especially in a general set of guidelines) to 
interface problems is to allow keyboard control specifically. I think the 
answer is to allow all controls to be exposed to third party technology. 
However, for any UA which has a keyboard interface it seems like a 
priority 1 that the keyboard be able to operate all controls.

(ie it is more important that the controls are exposed in general, but 
only just. Keyboard is the single most important specific device)
