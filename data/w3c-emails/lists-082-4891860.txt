1 Introduction

!!Maybe there could be a bit more explanation stating that the guidelines
give more general reasons and background that hopefully help when
implementing details of the techniques.

1.1. General principles ...

...

The user agent's interface must be easy to understand regardless of the
user's experience, knowledge, language skills, or current concentration level.

!!Usability does depend on the user group, environment, devices etc.
Maybe it would be better to say something like the user interface of a user
agent should be made as intuitive and efficient to use as possible for a
broad group of users having varying experience, knowledge, language skills
and concentration level. Testing with real users including users with
disabilities in reallife like situations help in finding usability defects.

The user agent must facilitate orientation ...

!!Provide also information of the hierarchical navigation bar (actually we
should have some special mark-up for these so it could be even shown in its
own viewport).

page 5 2.3 Views ...

The user The user ...

!!take one out

page 6

... user agents should avoid displacing the viewport away from the user's
point of regard as this can disorient users.

!!Don't understand. Isn't the viewport or several viewports always there?

For paper it is difficult to indentify the point of regard more precisely
than the entire page. ...

!!What about the insertion point? I thought that was point of regard also?

page7 Event and Scripting

When certain events ...

!!Complex with the parenthesis and someting is missing. Should it be "With
certain events..."?

Note ... he Document Object Model ...

!! Note ... the Document Object Model ...

3 The user agent must be ...

Ideally able bodied ...
most ablebodied peers do not know about features that improve accessibility
or do not find them useful their own use ...

!!Really? At least there should be something about how they could be useful
with mobile devices, slow connections etc.

3.2 Ensure ...

!!Would be nice to be able to change configuration profiles with other users
having similar problems. Could these be easily loaded from Blind Users
Association (made this up) and similar sites?

... with disabilities ill find them ...

!! ... with disabilities will find ...

page 13 5 The user agent ...

providing summary information of certain elements

!!Not clear to me of what elements?

page 14

!!Navigating in a site by using a hierarchical navigation bar that gives
feedback of the current selection in the bar.

!! ... and learning disabilities may not be able to access ...


5.1  Provide info...
!!I guess there can also be viewports with list of links, tables, images etc.
