CMcCN:
This was discussed last week in page authors group. There we were talking 
about using DIV and SPAN as markup, so being ble to navigate by those 
elements (as well as headers, links, etc etc) should provide a solution.

CMcCN:
The point is that if the viewport is going to be suddebly moved (for 
example by following a link) the user should be notified. I think that 
the treatment of this is not quite sufficient, since moving the viewport 
by following a link is a natural consequence, and should be expected. 
Moving it becuase of a pop-up window, auto-refresh which redirects after 
some arbitrary time, and such-like are problems.

CMcCN:
The Insertion point may or may not be in the point of regard. Imagine 
using MSWord - the insertion point can be placed somehwere, and then tyhe 
user can scroll through teh document, so that the insertyion pointis not 
in the current point of regard (where that is defined as the visible part 
of the document).
