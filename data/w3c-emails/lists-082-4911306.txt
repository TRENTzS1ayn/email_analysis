I will remove the text only part.

We discussed this at the face-to-face and the point was brought
up that controls should be integrated rather than concentrated
in a specific menu. When asked whether it was possible/a good idea
to synthesize and accessibility menu from other entries, developers

recall correctly).

There could be two reasons:
1) You are the first person to comment on the rating and it needs
   review
2) The browser may not know about all the changes that took place.

As it is priority 2 in the PAGL as well, I will change it
to 2 here if no one protests.
