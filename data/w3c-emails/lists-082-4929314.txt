I think the type of searching Al is talking about is very useful in the
case you know what you are looking for.  But, we also want to help user who
are just trying to explore new pages, so searching just headers by creating
a list of just the headers is very useful.  The user can then sequentially
move though just the headers.  

The question I have is can this be considered a search or should we have a
different label like direct navigation?
