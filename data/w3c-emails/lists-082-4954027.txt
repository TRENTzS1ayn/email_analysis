CMcCN:
The point of regard is the term which covers what the user is looking at 
right this minute. For a graphic browser this is what is in the window at 
the moment. This differs from the Insertion point, selection and user 
focus, which should all be in the same place when they all exist. (Except 
during drag-and-drop editing, where the insertion point is moved first, 
and the others follow.) The Insertion point/focus/selection can all be 
left at a point which is moved out of the point of regard in a browser 
where point of regard is moved by some means such as a scrollbar.

In a browser such as W3+Emacspeak, point of regard follows the cursor 
(which is the insertion point).
