MRK:
For me it is still difficult to understand the wording. Does this mean that
we should avoid displacing the content of a viewport or automatically
generating multiple viewports without a warning when it is not initiated by
the user (normally with activities in the users' point of regard or user
defined settings in the user agent)?

MRK:
I thought the point of regard is still valid even though it might be out of
sight. For instance if I select a sentence and scroll it away from sight I'm
able to replace it with something else. However, in that case I really would
like to return to the place where I can see the point of regard (and this is
actually how MS Word does it).

I guess the paper really means a piece of paper, not an electronic document
paper as I first thought. But is that important as we deal with electronic
documents?
