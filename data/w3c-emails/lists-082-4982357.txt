Lynx deals with them like this:

Frame: (link to the frame, with its TITLE or NAME as the link text)
Frame: (link to the frame, with its TITLE or NAME as the link text)
Frame: (link to the frame, with its TITLE or NAME as the link text)

then the content of the NOFRAMES - you know, that helpful message about 
getting a browser that does frames.

Once inside a frame you ahve to go back to the frameset to get into a 
different one - there is no facility for a seperate window full of 
frames (except in the history) since Lynx does not work in a windowed 
metaphor.
