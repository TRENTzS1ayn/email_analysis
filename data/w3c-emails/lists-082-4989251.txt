No, not quite. Keyboard control is probably the most important feature to 
implement natively. But providing 3rd party technology access to those 
controls (in our hypothetical API - in this case probably via the OS) is 
slightly more important. Both are serious priority 1 items, and in 
practical terms both are crucial. The document as it stands does not 
appear to give that much importance to exposing the controls beyond 
keyboard accessibility. I suspect that in practice, providing keyboard 
access does expose the functions to the OS and therefore 3rd party 
technology, but this relies on assumptions about the OS.
