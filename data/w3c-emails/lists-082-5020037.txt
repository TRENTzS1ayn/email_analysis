Hello,

This evening, I plan to publish the UA Guidelines
to the W3C public Web site, to replace the
current public draft (dated 3 July 1998).

The new public draft will be the 10 October 1998
WG draft [2] with some editorial changes based
on email, an updated list of acknowledgments,
and the changes listed below. You may consult
the documents that will be published at [3] and [4].

[Technique: 3.1.1] [Priority 1]        (Formerly 3.6.1)
      Ensure that all functionalities offered by the   
      user agent (for the user agent itself or for access 
      to the document) are available through redundant input
      and output mechanisms (e.g. not mouse-only). 

[Technique: 3.1.2] [Priority 1] 
      Implement user agent all windows, menus, controls and
      toolbars using the general principles of accessible design. 

[Technique: 3.1.3] [Priority 1] 
      Ensure that the application installation procedure, 
      including the interface, is accessible. 

[Technique: 3.6.1] [Priority 1] 
      All functionalities offered by the user agent 
     (for the user agent itself or for access to the document)
     must be available through means other than a pointing devices. 

[Technique: 4.1.15] [Priority 1] 
      When new windows or user interface components are 
      spawned, allow the user to override author-designated 
      changes to window size. 

[Technique: 4.1.16] [Priority 1] 
      When new windows or user interface components are 
      spawned, allow the user to override author-designated 
      changes to window position. 

[Technique: 5.1.4] [Priority 2] 
      Provide the user with information about the
      number of viewports and how they may be distinguished. 

[Technique: 6.2.3] [Priority 2] 
      Otherwise, if an accessible application programming 
      interface (API) is available for the exchange, 
      user agents should implement that interface agents 
      should implement that specification. 

In the techniques documents, the following changes were made:

A paragraph in the status section:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
        Although the organization of this document has begun to
stabilize,
        the Working Group has not yet filled in the details of all the
        techniques. This draft does not distinguish those techniques
        that mainstream user agents are expected to implement
        natively from those that may be satisfied by providing
        information through an interface.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

3.1: Added content of APPLET for technique of alt content
3.1: Added "alt", "title", "longdesc", and "abstract" attributes
     for SMIL
3.1: Change in language around blinking text and corrected
     "MARQUIS" bug.
5.3, feature control: Addition of META technique for page forwarding
7.1 * Changed priority of HTML "lang"  attribute to 2.
