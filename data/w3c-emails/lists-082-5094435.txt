OK, I object.  What is the rationale for how it rates a 2?

Seems to me LANG doesn't vary that often and if the user has to
tell the Braille software manually what language to expect, for
example, that it is not a real show-stopper.

Not that I don't think browsers should support LANG.  Just that
the argument from disability access is weak.
