Auto-generating a table of contents by collecting the headers and
find/find-next stepping through the hits for a match pattern
could both be viewed as _sifting_ the document to create a
navigation infrastructure for the document.  But in the common
parlance, I think people will only recognize the second one as
"searching."
 
The left-margin Table of Contents display reduces _structure
navigation_ for the document to _link following_, a more 
primitive class of method.

I think that to communicate with people from outside the working
group we will need to distinguish at least three classes of
transactions:

Structure navigation (e.g. go-to-next-H2)
(compare: go to start page in immediately enclosing directory)
Direct navigation (e.g. go-to-clickable-number-47)
(compare: go to URL)
Content searching (e.g. go-to-first-occurrence-of(match-pattern))
(compare: do you Yahoo?)
