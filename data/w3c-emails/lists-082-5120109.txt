navigating and searching imply two different reasoning approaches.  if I
want to go to something that is already there and I know where it is, I
need an easy way to do it. That is navigate for go.  if I don't know
where something is, I can 't go/navigate till I know/search for it and
find out where it is.  if that search takes me there then it is good but
the search and navigation behaviors are distinct.  Using lynx as a
model, we note that it is possible to turn on and use fine navigation
controls and also just as importantly to easily traverse to the top and
bottom of a well designed page.
direct navigation means to do something which takes me directly there
like previous/next line, top/bottom, fourth link, next or previous
heading/element. it seems that navigation versus search can be regarded
as a focus issue.
I regret that I cannot participate in current telecoms but have been
stockpiling and reading with interest the good work being done.
Thanks.
