I object again.  I strongly believe it SHOULD be implemented.

Have a look at Japanese press release of UA Guidelines.

Here you'll see that LANG varies frequently.  I sometimes hear Web
pages with IBM's Home Page Reader (Japanese version), and have
difficulties to understand its poor English pronunciation (its
Japanese pronunciation is pretty good, though).  I very much want
future version of Home Page Reader (and other voice browsers) support
better multilingual speech output, but it will be difficult without
appropriate language information.
