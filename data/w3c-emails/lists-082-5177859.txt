Me too. Since most every element type in HTML 4.0 allows a lang=".."
attribute, we need to anticipate that these will be used. Some also
languages require writing direction change using the attribute: 
    dir (ltr | rtl) #IMPLIED

Certainly materials that teach a "foreign" language will have a mixture.
Canadian government pages need to be bi-lingual. Many web pages have 
natural language other than english, and many more are likely to have such.
The automated translation programs need to indicate the source and target
languages. 

Some of the authoring tools and user agents will need to know the language.
Text-to-speech user agents need to know the natural language in order to 
get the proper dictionaries and pronunciation aids.
