OK, I can understand that this issue is more important on a World
Wide basis than in my gut because I operate in a mostly-English,
all-ASCII ghetto.

But I am still concerned on a slightly different, related issue:
What do the guidelines say a User Agent should _do_ with the LANG
information?  What is meant by "implement LANG per HTML 4.0" in
the present context?  It seems to me that LANG is purely
informative as defined by HTML 4.0.  There is no defined behavior
associated with it.  Or is there?

PS: one of the reasons the English pronunciation is worse is not
that the program is written by Japanese speakers but that
Japanese writers write much more phonetically than English
writers do.  Japanese is the "most phonetic" major language so
far as I know.  "Most phonetic" in the sense of "what you write
is what you hear."  Is that true?
