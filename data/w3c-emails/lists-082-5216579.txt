Point of reguard is the element or collection of elements the user is
currently focusing on.

The viewport is the current portion of the document that is "visible" to
the user whether they are using speech, Braille or a video display.

The view is the rendering format of a document.  Therefore a document can
have different views of the content based on user requirements.
