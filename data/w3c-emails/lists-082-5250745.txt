Harvey,

In principle yes, anything that the browser is going to act on
should be open to inspection by the user even if it is not
trumpeted by default.

The closest thing I can think of to an application that would
lever off the META KEYWORDS information for a page is the "more
like this" query for a follow-up search.  This "like this" could
indeed include the keywords from the HEAD.META data for the
previously-found page.

The hack I thought of that you might want to play with is to find
a search engine that supports a "more like this" button and use
it, then follow up by using the "refine your search" button on
the resulting search report to learn what it had used as the
technical definition of "like this."  Beats parsing search URLs.

We are possibly over the line into ER IG territory, here, but a
little experimentation with what works today never hurt.

Regards,

Al
