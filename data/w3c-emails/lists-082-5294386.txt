To implement it woudl mean to expose it in all cases to 3rd party 
technology, and in cases where there is linguistic information used by 
the UA (such as direction of text, dictionary, punctuation rules, 
pronunciation, contraction methods for brille, etc) to allow 
configuration of those processes based on the LANG attribute.

Another one that I would like to see is  the ability to recognise the 
value alternate in the REL attribute of LINK as referring to  version of 
a document which may be in a different language, enabling client-side 
language negotiation. This is based on the fct that many content 
developers are not in a posiiton to control the server side negotiation, 
which can often be woefully inadequate.

And there is no WAI group for webservers (unless it is this one. It seems 
out of scope though.)
