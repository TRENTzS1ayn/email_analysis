True table navigation would allow the user to find out where they are in 
the table, and would apply either the algorithm specified in HTML 4 or 
use the TABLE attributes and elements to provide additional context, such 
as headers which apply ot the current cell.

It would then enable movement to the next cell in a row or column, or 
along an arbitrarily defined AXIS.

This is the kind of implementation that would be ideal.

A User Agent which allowed the user to navigate within a page by 
element, traversing or ascending/descending the document tree, would 
provide some of these functions. It would be possible to move across a 
row, cell by cell, or to move up and down rows. This provides no context 
information, and requires the user to remember where they are. This 
strikes me as the minimum acceptable native implementation, assuming that 
all the information is exposed for a 3rd party product which actually 
does the job properly.
