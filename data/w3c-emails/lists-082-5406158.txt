Both Scott and Al have suggesteed that being able to navigate the 
document tree does not provide sufficient table navigation. I was 
proposing it as a bare minimum solution. I also asssumed that User Agents 
would allow some sensible context-sensitive methods of identifying the 
shape of the tree (rather than 'next element across or next element 
up/down' it would suggest 'next cell, or next row, or ...')

However I agree that it would not provide anything much better than bare
access - perhaps half a step above providing the view source option for
people to work out what is going on. So I would like to see a better
solution (like those outlined by Scott and Al) implemented in browsers
themselves. The question then becomes 'is your User Agent a
medium-specific tool, of no real value outside a small set of
hardware/software combinations, or is it a full browser engine which
supports medium-independent browsing (either natively or via plug-ins,
which is the consequent question)?'. The Real-Video player seems to fall
into the former category, although their SMIL player (G2?) could, for SMIL
content, be in the latter. Where do MSIE, pwWebSpeak, etc, see themselves?
