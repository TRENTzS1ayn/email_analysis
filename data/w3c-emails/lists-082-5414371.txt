Assuming that the user has turned image display off, and that the
browser does indeed display the MAP contents as an ALTernative to
the image, how does the audio visitor skip the group of links?
Or in a legacy browser, how does the audio visitor having been
told that there are links at the foot of the page, move to the
head of that link group?

For a truly elegant solution what we are missing is the 
<pseudo-css:display="minimize"> ability for a client-side policy
to direct that the map image be replaced with a link to
where the MAP content is already occurring in the text flow.
