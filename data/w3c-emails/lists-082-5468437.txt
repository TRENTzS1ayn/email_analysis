I don't the see why that has to be a priority 1.  If a browser doesn't have
this option, does it make it inaccessible?

Hi,
I was wondering if there are any objections to the guidelines assigning
first priority level to visual browsers' providing the option of
tables being directly rendered by the browsers in serialized format
with the table cell identification approach?
