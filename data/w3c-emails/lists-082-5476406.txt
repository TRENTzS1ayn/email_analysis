I agree with Kathy - some folks should try working with the technology
available.  For over a year now, WinVision 97 has made tables highly
accessible through Active Accessibility.  They even have a bunch of tables
in their web site to prove their point.  JFW uses a technique to manipulate
the document to unroll the table horizonatally.

Tell me why this absolutely must be in the browser code.

I don't the see why that has to be a priority 1.  If a browser doesn't have
this option, does it make it inaccessible?

Hi,
I was wondering if there are any objections to the guidelines assigning
first priority level to visual browsers' providing the option of
tables being directly rendered by the browsers in serialized format
with the table cell identification approach?
