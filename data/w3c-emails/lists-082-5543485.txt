While it would be nice to the solve the problem for *all* screen readers,
this wish list item is not a priority 1 item when your top screen reader
companies already provide good access.  Let's keep these guidelines
realistic and useful, please.

Hi,
Please forgive my midwest tendency of under-stating.  In general, blind
people cannot use tables unless an accomodation like table serialization
is provided.  Some screen reader technology can make tables accessible,
but that is not true of all screen reader technologies working with most
browsers.  The use of serializing tables makes tables accessible
regardless of the access technology being used, in general.
Therefore, it should be a priority 1 item.

With regards to the issue of "3rd party assistive technology making
money off their implementation", a browser's providing table
serialization does not prohibit these developers from enhancing the
table navigation if they desire.  They are free to develop better
approaches.  However, the browser's option of serialized table rendering
does not force them to also develop table navigation when they would
prefer to do their product differentiation in some other area.
