Hi, Chuck

I don't disagree with your point, that they are universal issues.  However,
why not try to fix the problems when possible?

You asked whether all browser would support table serialization.  It depends
on whether each browser wants to follow the guidelines.  (I've been told
by at least one browser developer that it would probably be fairly easy
to implement table serialization.)

Actually, unrolling a table isn't that hard.  I did my version in 2 days.
It is easier than the more general version of a "text only" view.
I believe that writing a guideline for unrolling a table to be quite
readily achievable.  (I've been working on one.)
