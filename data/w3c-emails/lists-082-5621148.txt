Hi, Daniel
I would agree with what you about the need for a more precise definition of
table linearization.

With regards to your example, a solution that I found helpful was to
"normalize" by replacing a spanned cell with smaller cells which are
duplicates of the spanned cell.  (Duplicate cells have a note that they
are span.)  The duplication of the spanned cells helped to
simplify table navigation.


Your example would look like:
                                  Month    Month(span)   Month(span)  Month(span)  
                                  January  February      March      April  
Ville         South         Nice      13        14          15           16  
Ville (span)  South (span)  Cannes    14        15          16           17  
Ville (span)  North         Paris      5         6           7            8  
Ville (span)  North (span)  Lille     -3        -2          -1            0  

Another approach is just to fill the added cells with a note that it is
a spanned cell and indicate which cell was spanned.

Rendering options can control what labels to include in a cell, e.g.
most restrictive ("Nice"), total ("Ville  South  Nice").  Allowing
this type of control for both row headers and column headers
gives you most of the variations you mentioned, except for mark-up.
However, the span notation could help blind users to understand about the
mark-up.
