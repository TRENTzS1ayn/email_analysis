If WAI-UA would be willing to add an note to its HTML4.0 implementation
guidance, then WAI-GL can drop an ugly note in the "deprecated example"
subclause dealing with the case where ALT=" " is appropriate.

Well, I don't think that the null ALT is only used for images
which emulate <BR> but also for those which are used for
positioning left-to-right in the visual layout.  Any image whose
description would be "spacer-image" may be annotated with ALT=""
as I read the technique.  This sits across a rift in preferences
between GUI implementation of non-loaded images and non-GUI
users.

That is what I get from the examples and [just my reading] a
telecon that discussed this point.  

By the way, the author guidelines go to far in noting that
attribute-reading may ignore leading and trailing whitespace.
This does not imply that a single space character may be ignored.
A single space character does not satisfy the definition of
"leading or trailing whitespace" in the terms of this warning.
There is nothing that it is leading or trailing.  It would be
entirely appropriate for the UA guidelines to clarify this in its
section on how to implement HTML4.0.  The point of what the HTML
document says is that it is reasonable for browsers to treat ("
token ") as synonymous with ("token").  When the attribute is
entirely composed of linear whitespace characters, some linear
whitespace must survive any approximation.

A formal style rule could be something like "if the ALT value
contains only linear whitespace, and the element appears in an
inline flow, then the rendering agent shall ensure that linear
whitespace occurs between the two surrounding flow objects."  But
real browsers will just copy the ALT string into the text flow
and be done.  Consider how BR has been handled in practice.
