For resolution of the linearization I think we need to have good arguements.

I think the discussioin needs to look at the dimensions of the issue.

In the case of mainstream browsers I think the issues are the following:
1. Number of people impacted.
The feature was original targeted for the visually impaired and blind.  But
at the face to face meeting it was also mentioned that people with certain
types of learning disabilities would also benefit.

2. Senario of use
People who are blind would be using screen readers, so the third party
assistive technology could manipulate the DOM to linearize.
People with visual impairments may not be using assistive technology and
therefore if the feature was not directly implemented it would not be
available to them.
People with learning disabilities probably will also not be using
assisitive technology so if it is not built-in it would not be available

3. Ideas for implementation
Built-in configuration option to linearize all pages in a dialog box
Built-in keyboard command
Add on power tool right click

Let's talk about ideas to get a better picture of how this feature may
benefit users with disabilities and how it maybe implemented to benefit users.

Thanks,
Jon
