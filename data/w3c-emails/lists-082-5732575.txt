I disagree with the wording of:
[Direct or Compatible]
This technique can be implemented directly or through compatibility with
assistive technology when assistive technology is commonly available to
provide access to the user agent.  If assistive technology is not commonly
available this feature should be directly implmented.

What does it mean for an assistive technology to be commonly availabe and
who decides if it is commonly available?

If it is going to be listed as [Direct or Compatible] then it should remain
an either/or listing and not this ambiguous "can be done directly or through
compatibility, but if not compatible, then it must be direct".

Subject: categorization of techniques


The current model for categorization of techniques, requires two levels.

1. Priority Level (need from the users perspective)
[Priority 1] 
This technique must be implemented otherwise one or more groups of users
with
disabilities will find it impossible to access information. Implementing
this
technique is a basic requirement for some individuals to be able to use the
Web. 
[Priority 2] 
This technique should be implemented, otherwise one or more groups of users
will
find it difficult to access information. Implementing this technique will
significantly improve access to the Web for some individuals. 
[Priority 3] 
This technique may be implemented, to make it easier for one or more groups
of
users to access information. Implementing this technique will improve
access to
the Web for some individuals. 

2. Implementation Recommendation (
[Direct]
This technique must be implemented directly by the user agent and provide
comaptibility for third party assistive technology

[Direct or Compatible]
This technique can be implemented directly or through compatibility with
assistive technology when assistive technology is commonly available to
provide
access to the user agent.  If assistive technology is not commonly available
this feature should be directly implmented.

How does this model work for people?
