There needs to be consensus on issues.  Votes are helpful in determining
the current consensus (or lack of consensus) of the group, but may not be
good for final decisions.  I think we need to look at issues from a number
of different angles and not continue to rehash the same territory.  

I think the table linearization issue has been to narrowly defined for just
screen readers.  Please see other messages I have send today, I have tried
to offer a broader picture of the issue.
