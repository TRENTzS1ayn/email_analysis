I think we always want to promote compatibility with assistive technology,
since there will always be some users that will need to assistive
technology for the user interface.  For examples a person who is deaf and
blind.

I think when we look at like a Kiosk or a palmtop (?) portable user agent.
There maybe no assistive technology available or included.  In this case we
would want to promote direct accessibility by the user agent. 

We can work with the language and if you have any suggestions please send
them to the list.

Do you think the two tiered system would work for your needs?
