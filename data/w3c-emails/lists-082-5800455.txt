Hi, Jon

A couple of weeks ago there was a discussion on a telecom call about
exposing information for third party access developers and providing
direct access by the browser.  My recollection was that there seemed to
be an agreement that a combination of exposing the information and
providing direct access when fairly readily achievable was the general
preferred approach.  I believe the thought was asking something like
audible menus directly from visual browsers was too much to ask of
browser developers.  Asking that visual browsers to present information
in alternate renderings was a reasonable expectation of visual browsers.

Was that your recollection of the discussion?
