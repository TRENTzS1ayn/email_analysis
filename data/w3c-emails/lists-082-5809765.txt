Hi,
Actually, I found that the linearization of tables often helped visually
impaired to understand the relationships better.  On several occasions,
blind users said that finally the layout and the purpose made
sense.  An option for changing type of annotation depending
on a heuristic which attempted to figure out if the table was for
layout seems to be helpful too.
