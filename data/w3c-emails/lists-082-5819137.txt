Hi,
I believe there should be effort to always make the information
available.  Different disabilities may have unique needs where
a direct implementation may not be reasonable to expect.

When a group of users can benefit from the access being built
directly into the browser and implementation of direct access is
not an unreasonable burden on the browser developer, then direct
access should also be included.  This avoids the issue of "commonly
available", but does introduce the need for browser developers
to give technical reasons why the expectation may be too much
a burden.
