There is a new document on the UA WWW site:

http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/wai-ua-wd-priorities-list.html

I developed this document to see where the group can all agree on the
categories for a technique and where we still need to work on consensus.  This
document lists the current techniques by priority and implementation.  Please
review and comment on the priorities and implmentation strategies for the
current techniques.  Some items we are currently discussing or I felt have
not 
been discussed enough were put in a section the indicates the lack of
consensus
by the group.  Technique priorities and implementation can change based on the
comments from working group members.

The following is a summary of the sections in the document and the number of
techniques associated with each section.
Priority 1 and Direct Implementation (currently 69 techniques)
Priority 1 and Direct or Compatibility (currently 1 techniques)
Priority 1 and no current consensus on implementation (currently 13
techniques)
Priority 2 (currently 19 techniques)
Priority 3 (currently 10 techniques)
