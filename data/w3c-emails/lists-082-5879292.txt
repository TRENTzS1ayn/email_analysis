Probably over 90% of all table markup on the WWW is for layout and not
data.  So one of the primary uses of linearization would be to reduce
visual complexity.  For data tables the linearization needs to be more
complex to allow header information to be a part of the cell rendering.
Most of the discussion on the list and in the telecons have focused on the
blind and I think other types of disabilities should be included in the
discussion.  We have also been lacking any significant discussion of how
this may be implemented in browser other than it can be done through third
party assistive technology manipulating the DOM.
