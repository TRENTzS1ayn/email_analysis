I'd say that the guidelines should specify a way to retrieve information one
cell at a time, and to provide for navigation between cells that maintains
the context of the cell.  That might be in terms of row/column headers, or
it might be some other method not yet defined.

Retrieving information a cell at a time is needed for low/no vision, as well
as those with visual perception limitations.

However, table serialization is a technique, and is not necessarily the best
or only way to provide cell retrieval and context information.

Subject: Re: Table linearization (was: A table navigation technique)

Probably over 90% of all table markup on the WWW is for layout and not
data.  So one of the primary uses of linearization would be to reduce
visual complexity.  For data tables the linearization needs to be more
complex to allow header information to be a part of the cell rendering.
Most of the discussion on the list and in the telecons have focused on the
blind and I think other types of disabilities should be included in the
discussion.  We have also been lacking any significant discussion of how
this may be implemented in browser other than it can be done through third
party assistive technology manipulating the DOM.
