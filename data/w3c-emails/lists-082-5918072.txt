Comments on :
Priority 1 and no current consensus on implementation (currently 13
techniques)

[Technique: 3.6.3] Allow the user to trigger events in a
device-independent manner.

     Weak vote for native. If someone provides a clear example in favor
     of Compatibility I might change opinions.


[Technique: 4.1.15] When new windows or user interface components are
spawned, allow the user to override author-designated changes to window
size.

     Strong vote for native. Much easier to implement natively than
     through a third party. Can lead to sever loss of accessibility when
     a spawned window covers a needed accessibility aid on the screen,
     or moves some interface objects off the screen because the window
     is larger than the screen, for someone using a headwand, for
     instance.


[Technique: 4.1.16] When new windows or user interface components are
spawned, allow the user to override author-designated changes to window
position.

     Strong vote for native. Much easier to implement natively than
     through a third party. Can lead to sever loss of accessibility when
     a spawned window covers a needed accessibility aid on the screen,
     for instance.


Technique: 4.3.1] Allow users to specify that a page be formatted
linearly.

     No strong opinion


[Technique: 4.3.2] Allow users to specify that a table be formatted
linearly.

     No strong opinion.


[Technique: 5.2.5] Keep track of the user's point of regard in each view
and put it within the viewport when the user returns to the view.

     Native.


[Technique: 5.3.1] Alert the user when scripts are executed.

     How about: Give the user the option of being notified when scripts
     are executed. [Native]


[Technique: 5.3.2] Provide information about document changes resulting
from the execution of a script.

     I'm not clear on what the implications of this are, or how this
     could be done. Should it say "Provide notification when a document
     changes due to script execution"? Or is it supposed to give
     specific info on what kind of change has taken place? If the
     latter, there needs to be some clearer definition of what is
     expected. Also, isn't this listed as Priority 3 in the Nov 12 doc?


[Technique: 5.3.3] Allow users to be prompted before spawning a new
window.

     Native.

[Technique: 5.5.3] Provide a mechanism for designating the current table
of a document.

     To be honest, I'm not sure what is meant by 'designate' in this
     context.

[Technique: 5.5.4] Provide a mechanism for designating the current cell
of a table.

     Not sure of meaning of 'designate' in this instance either.


[Technique: 5.5.5] Allow the user to navigate among tables in a
document.

     Native.


[Technique: 5.5.6] Allow the user to navigate among table cells of the
current table (notably left/right within a row and up/down within a
column).

     Native.
