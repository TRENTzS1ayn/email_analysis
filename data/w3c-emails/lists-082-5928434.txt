I got cut off. Maybe the Leonid shower I have been looking out my window 
for (this is 4am to 5am for me) fially did something. If so I heard it 
but didn't see it!

I am not really clear on what we mean by lineraisation - to me it means 
various ways of stringing tables out in a line. One of those, funnily 
enough, is provided by HTML, which is after all a serial medium (as 
unrendered code). I am hoping that Scott (I'm picking on you because you 
seem to be the biggest proponent at the moment) can give a more concise 
definition, or that we can start talking about smaller pieces of the process.

I would also like to refloat Al Gilman's suggestion from last week about 
providing a way to walk the document tree. (navigate the DOM). Mostly 
because it sems an important part of a bunch of different things we want 
to do. Is it a difficult thing to implement?
