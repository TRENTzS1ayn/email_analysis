This technique requires a handshake.  The browser cannot do it
without some cooperation from the AT and vice versa.

How about: Give the user {quiet, alert, confirm} options
governing script execution

This blends into the above technique.  What matters is the
impact of the script.  If the user wants to review/confirm
prior to letting the script execute, it has to be caught
prior to execution.  How to communicate what will happen
is tougher.  On alert to offer the option of communicating
what changed is easier.  There are plenty of tricks of the
trade such as a transient select on the least document
subtree enclosing the change.

This is extending the "confirm" meta-control to all
new-window transactions.

This has to do with the assumed state model.  Is there a
cross-platform definition of select, focus, etc. that we can
build on?

"Current table" probably combines some of the characteristics
of "select" and "system caret."  Need to worry about whether
the state of the tabbing cycle moves, too.  Likewise for
table cells.  Need to define the "current" state operationally.
