I would also like to refloat Al Gilman's suggestion from last week about 
providing a way to walk the document tree. (navigate the DOM). Mostly 
because it sems an important part of a bunch of different things we want 
to do. Is it a difficult thing to implement?
>>

Extremely easy to do.  Here's a sample JavaScript to do display the name of
the HTML tag for each element:

for (var i = 0, i < document.all.length, i++)
alert(document.all.item(i).tagName);

This is taken from page 169 of the book "Dynamic HTML" by Scott Issacs.
