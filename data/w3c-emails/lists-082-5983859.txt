Good. So here is the sort of low-hanging fruit we are looking for, right?
I suspect (and hope) that it is a fairly trivial extension of the approach
to test for attributes, in the same way as CSS2 requires What I am
thinking is that this approach can be applied to the very simplistic sort
of table navigation (cell by cell or row by row, without context) that I
discussed earlier. It could also solve (for example) the problem of the
PAGL group about skipping over links which are in blocks. 

The nature of the element, and such attributes as TITLE or ALT could be 
used to provide some meaningful feedback about the structure which is 
being walked. It does not solve the problem of where the heck am I - for 
tables you need a special beastie to run the algorithm that is used by 
people looking at a table to provide that information, which is (I think) 
also important to navigating a table.

Then I get into idler speculation - is this a technique for building 
configurable outlines, or does the process go the other way around? And 
so forth.
