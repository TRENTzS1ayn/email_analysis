If you are making reservations for the F2F meeting at Cambridge Marriott
Hotel 
ask for the MIT rate of $199.  
There are a couple of groups listed under the MIT rate and the W3C is one
of them.

There is a better rate though of $119 if you stay thursday (10th) and
friday (11th) night, called a weekend rate for that weekend.  I am not sure
how this impacts the reserved block of rooms for MIT-W3C block.  

Judy could you or another W3C staff person clear up the rate confusion?
