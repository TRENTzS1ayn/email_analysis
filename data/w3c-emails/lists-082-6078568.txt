The new version of Opera (version 3.5) will linearize TABLEs by  ignoring
TABLE markup.  You can select this option in the Perferences menu in the
Document Appearance option.  In the Document Appearance disalog box you can
un-check the "Enable Tables"  option.  

While this is a simple method of linearizing tables it can be used to test
how ignoring TABLE markup does or does not improve accessibility of a
document. 

Opera has other accessibility features like ignoring author fonts, colors
and CSS.  It also allows users to specify their own CSS style sheets for
overriding author style features.

It also has extenisve keyboard support for navigating the structure of a
document.  

You can download a 30 day trial version from:
