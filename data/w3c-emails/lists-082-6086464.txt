Yes add-ons do make keyboards much more useful. Of course, that requires
redefining basic needs repeatedly: closely placed keys for those with ok
motor control & largely isolated while not too spread out (any area is large
when using 1 digit) for those with poor motor control, me. In WWW we're
talking the World where it isn't always easy to get the finishing touches.
By placing clear examples in the Guildlines most computers will be somewhat
usable by everyone (just Windows 98 has Magnifier for emergency or limited
use http://www.microsoft.com/enable/news/status9810.htm ) & some people will
not need any extras as with Opera: This opportunity is to be relished.
Charles Oppermann <chuckop@microsoft.com> closes email with an inspirational
& liberating idea, "A computer on every desk and in every home, usable by
everyone!" (almost like telephones). 21 years ago the advice given to me was
not to buy a dedicated word processing box, but to get a computer because it
is easy to improve it with new software, that is truer today. With multiple
layouts in software Denis & all therapists will have more time to aid people
with more taxing disabilities.

Agreed. Nevertheless it is possible to give software designers insight so
they can provide a firm foundation for Accessibility.

An Appendix could say something like this:
