User Agent Guidelines WG:

We have been able to obtain a more discounted rate, $119, for the Cambridge
Marriott, as well as an extension on hotel reservations till this Friday,
November 27. 

The room block is under MIT-W3C and the hotel reservation staff has been
reminded of this. Our apologies for any previous confusion on this. 

If you already reserved a room at the higher rate, please contact the
hotel, or let Susan Hardy (susan@w3.org) know that you need your room
transferred to the lower rate.

If you were/are unable to access the MIT-W3C block when making your
reservation, or if you have any other questions about the hotel
arrangements, please ask Susan for assistance.

Please be sure to register as soon as possible with WAI for the meeting
itself. All information on the meeting, including registration links, is
available at <http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/1998/12/wai-ua-f2f-19981211.html>.

See you soon.

Regards,

Judy
