onClick="location=history.goback(-1)" (Or sometihng like that. I forget 
off the top of my head.)

The back function is one of the most popular things in a browser, as it
ought to be. I am not sure that putting it into pages is all that great -
I prefer to tell the user to go back themselves. But I suppose people who
charge lots of money for websites won't want to do that, so they will use
the thing. Of course the likely result is some goose will work out how to
make a site rely on it, and thus not work for non-Jscript browsers.
