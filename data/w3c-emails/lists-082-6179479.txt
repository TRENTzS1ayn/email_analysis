The on-line registration form for the December 11th and 12th F2F meeting
closed early for some reason.  It should be back on line later today or
tommorrow and we will leave it open until the end of the week.   So if you
have been locked out, please try again tommorrow.

So far we have about 15 people signed up for the F2F meeting.

I encourage all who can attend to come.

Thanks,
Jon
