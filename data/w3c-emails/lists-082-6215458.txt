WAI UA Telecon for December 2nd, 1998 

Chair: Jon Gunderson 
Date: Wednesday, December 2nd
Time: 12:00 noon to1:00 pm Eastern Standard Time 
Call-in: (+1) 617/258-7910

Agenda
12:00-12:10 Update on scheduling of events with UA group 
12:10-1:00 Discussion of table access issues and techniques 

Chairs observation of five current table access techniques:
1. Simple linearization by removing table markup

2. Linearization based on table markup (i.e. if header information is
available
use it as a prefix to the data)

3. Linearization based on table markup with a "Point of Regard" to indicate a
table and cell "focus". Point of regard would be maintained by the user agent
and changed with through keyboard commands. Point of Regard would be used for
cell navigation and can be used for inidcation to third party assistive
technology on users focus. User would have a repair strategy of being able to
select different types of rendering for poorly marked up tables based on the
table with the current point of regaurd.

4. Explosing table information through the DOM and providing third party
assistive technology with the ability to create their own point of reguard or
manipulate the visual presentation based on the needs of their target
population.

5. Propose future CSS and HTML standards that would allow for the
generation of
the table linearization and point of regaurd through these technologies

Six issues to consider when evaluating techniques:
1. Complexity of programming (3rd party and UA)
2. Table nesting 
3. Impact on disability populations 
4. Use of W3C standards 
5. Difficulty of developing a concise recommendation 
6. Added complexity to current user interface (UA)
