You are correct that either the user agent or the aid can do the work, or
both.  It's much harder to motivate our developers to do work that they feel
can be better done by 3rd party aids however.  That would be the downside.

Nothing precludes the aid to do a better job at Table linearization
when the UA does a poor job at it.

It's not a either/or UA/Aid situation, so I see no disadvantage for
the end-user in having the UA giving it a try in the first place.

Is there a down side ?
(like promoting poor linearization done by UA ?)
