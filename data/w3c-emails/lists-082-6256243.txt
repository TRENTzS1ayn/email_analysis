It's (almost) never too late.

Yours are important comments and I agree that there should be more
context for readers new to the subject. Since there are three sets
of guidelines, we plan on providing separate resources (e.g., 
descriptions of assistive technologies) that may be referenced
by all three sets. 

Of course, we welcome more detailed suggestions about how to
introduce these topics to new readers. Also, any suggested text
(without going so far as to ask for your internal guidelines
document...) would be appreciated.

By "who", do you mean "native implementation" vs. "third-party
implementation" or do you have further distinctions in mind?
 
Thanks for you input,
