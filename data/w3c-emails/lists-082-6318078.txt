I'm wondering if their might be several points within view
simultaneously that might be considered point of regard.  I believe
though that the focus of this topic bears on the active point for want
of a better term. what and where is it going to happen. each action
takes place somewhere.  this is why good keyboard support is essential
since with a mouse, you can go almost anywhere and that can defy
definition.   "let me retrace my steps exactly in reverse of how I took
them", is not rocket science but inhabits a number of software
populations.
