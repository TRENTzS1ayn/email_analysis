Braille is NOT a one-dimensional display. In most cases it
is only one line, but we must not forget that two or four-line
displays (or any other number) are possible. Moreover,
even one line is to be considered two-dimensional. 

One line of braille displays a part of the information on the
screen (we still think screen oriented, don't we), but this
information can be a whole column or two lines put in row. 

Also: the information is solid. This information my contain the
point of regard (like a blinking cursor or the selection with
dots 7 and 8 added) but must not seen as the point of regard
itself.

I like to see audio and braille (and even the screen itself) a
way to present the user information. This presentation is
often part of a bigger whole. The point of regard is a
perception of the user. The UA helps the user to regard this
point (by means of focus, caret, highlight, dots 7 and 8 or any
other means).

When we think along lines described above (in my humble
opinion) we open the road to be independent of the way
things are presented to the user and thus allow for multi
ways of accessing it.
