I have published a new issues list for the UA working group.  This document
is very important tool for the group to move towards proposed
recommendation.  I have brought the document up to date.  Issues are
divided in Open and Closed issues.  Open issues are issues that I feel we
are still actively discussing or if it is an old issue we never came to
resolution.  Closed issues are issues i feel we have come to some
resolution, athough some may still need editorial tweeking.  

I would like to get feedback as soon as possible on whether people agree
with the issues list in terms of:

1. Issue is open or closed
2. Are there missing issues that you or others have brought up, but are not
on the list.
3. The issues descriptions reflect the problem to be solved
4. The solution options reflect our current knowledge.

I know that this will take time and may seem to be an admistrative task,
but if we can come to agreement on this document it will be our road alot
straighter to a proposed recommendation.  

I will interpret silence as agreement on the closed issues, so please read
the whole document.  We will be discussing the document on the list,
telecons and the F2F meeting.  All F2F participants should be familar with
this document for the F2F meeting.
