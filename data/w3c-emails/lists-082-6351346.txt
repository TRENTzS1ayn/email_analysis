Hi, John
I'm not sure if this is on the list, but I think we should talk about
what additional information is needed to be presented on rendering
of web pages to help people navigate forms.

Recently I was asked to evaluate why a blind user was having problems
using a web page.  Well, it turns out there were two forms on the
page next to each other.  To make matters more confusing, each
form consisted of a combo box with no submit buttons.  The user
couldn't figure out that there were actually two forms and no
submit buttons.

My suggestion is that a browser has the option of rendering additional
information for each form.  I believe it would be extremely helpful
if the beginning and end of each form is marked.  The beginning
part should include a brief analysis of the form like number of
radio button groups, number of submit buttons, etc.  Also, it
would be extremely useful if the tab key stopped on the beginning
and end of each form so that the blind user can get a sense
of the extent of each form.

Could you please add this to the list of open suggestions?

Thanks,
Scott
