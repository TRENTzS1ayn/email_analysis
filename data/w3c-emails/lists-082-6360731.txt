Here my reaction on the issues document. Many
compliments to the authors for its completeness.
Here is my only comment, that I feel is important.

Point of Regard

Possible techniques:

Always provide a point of regard. This relates to
[technique 5.2.5]: Keep track of POR in each view)

[Technique x.x.x]: Let the point of regard link back to
the DOM. This was mentioned in the discussion
about DOM in the F2F after CTG'98. This migth not
be possible because rendered information does not
link back to DOM, but POR might.

Take care,

Hans Riesebos
