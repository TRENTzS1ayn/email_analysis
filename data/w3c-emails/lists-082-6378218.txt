Response to Scott Luebking: 
It sounds like this problem fits into two or more current categories.  

Sections:

Orientation: Document summary information should include information about
the number and composition of forms in a document.

Table rendering: It sounds like the side by side layour of the forms was
probably done with tables.

Scripting: Since this form did not have a submit button, it may have been
using scripting methods to process the form input.

But we may still want to have a section on form controls that they be
rendered in an accessible way for third party assistive technology.
