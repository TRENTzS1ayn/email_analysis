Hi,

While the issues seem well outlined on this page
http://www.w3.org/wai/ua/wai-ua-wd-issues.html
that clarity doesn't appear clearly on the techniques page. If we explain to
developers why something is needed & how it will help people developers will
much more likely to readily apply great Accessibility. I dare say we should
play cheerleader here

Regards,
Bryan
