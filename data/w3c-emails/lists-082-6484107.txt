Hi,
I was going over the issues list and didn't see the issues I've been bringing
up about frames.

> I have published a new issues list for the UA working group.  This document
> is very important tool for the group to move towards proposed
> recommendation.  I have brought the document up to date.  Issues are
> divided in Open and Closed issues.  Open issues are issues that I feel we
> are still actively discussing or if it is an old issue we never came to
> resolution.  Closed issues are issues i feel we have come to some
> resolution, athough some may still need editorial tweeking.  
> 
> I would like to get feedback as soon as possible on whether people agree
> with the issues list in terms of:
> 
> 1. Issue is open or closed
> 2. Are there missing issues that you or others have brought up, but are not
> on the list.
> 3. The issues descriptions reflect the problem to be solved
> 4. The solution options reflect our current knowledge.
> 
> I know that this will take time and may seem to be an admistrative task,
> but if we can come to agreement on this document it will be our road alot
> straighter to a proposed recommendation.  
> 
> I will interpret silence as agreement on the closed issues, so please read
> the whole document.  We will be discussing the document on the list,
> telecons and the F2F meeting.  All F2F participants should be familar with
> this document for the F2F meeting.
