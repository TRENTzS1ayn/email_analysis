Hi, Jon
Probably the key issue is providing a summary/index page feature for frames.
The page would have two formats which could be toggled.  One format
would be similar to what Lynx presents.  The other format has more detail
for each frame including such things as:

      number of links
      number of forms
      number of tables
      number of images
      number of significant words
      any description
      title

I also had a list of user actions for frames including:

    1.  display summary web page for current frameset

    2.  go to web page in next frame area in list of web pages / frame areas
for the current frameset

    3.  go to web page in previous frame area in list of web pages / frame
areas for the current frameset

    4.  return to page for previous frame area

    5.  go back in web pages for the same frame area as the current
        web page

    6.  go forward in web pages for the same frame area as the current
        web page

    7.  bookmark web page for current frame (rather than web page
        for all the frames)

(I think some of these might already have been included in the guidelines.)
