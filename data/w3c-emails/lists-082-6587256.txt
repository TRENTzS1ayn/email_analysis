Did we agree to take this issue back to the CG?  It seems to me
that this area is one where

- the WAI would probably like to make a statement
- it seems to fall in a crack between the scopes of
the content and browser guidelines.

The WAI would like to make a statement concerning
nondiscrimination in the service of information.  We can work
with W3C and WSG on this, because I think Tim is quite unhappy
with the commercial forays into defeating the universal meeting
ground qualities of the WWW.  Maybe it goes in the author guidelines
as a not under alternative pages.
