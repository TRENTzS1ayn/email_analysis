I think we should ask for a informational note to be added in the HTTP
spec saying it's bad to do browser sniffing in general and really bad
to be discriminatory about it.

Exact wording to be proposed by PF.

I am personally not in favor adding profile like things to HTTP to
allow for "clean" browser sniffing (e.g. my screen is this res, I
don't have a mouse, etc) 

It think HTTP has enough content negociation and the architecture
already in place is flexible enough (where you first get the HTML/XML,
then the attached pieces - if you need them) to do the job right
(which should not preclude us to improve css categorization by media,
but this is not HTTP related)
