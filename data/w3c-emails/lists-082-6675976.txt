As I see it this would normally rely on a javascript to submit it, which
means that running Lynx (as I mostly do at the moment) it is a complete
waste of time. Problem one.

The other problem probably requires chunking to be resolved. There are a
bunch of pages around that have multiple forms on them. Usually context is
provided by what is written around them (in some cases including the value
of the SUBMIT button). In that sense it is theoretically possible to use
the system, just fiendishly difficult. I guess it is on the border between
P1 and P2 that a browser offers a direct solution. Certainly one which
wanted to be classed as a good accessible browser would, of course.

  my proposesd solution for browsers' annotating forms for blind users.
