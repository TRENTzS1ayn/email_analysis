Hello,

The news on 9 Dec 1998 provides insight for the UA Guildlines. Someone
speaking for a major software firm said computer buyers don't want a built
it yourself OS. & 'Assembling The International Space Station' continued
http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap981210.html
Astronauts are highly trained & rehearsed, computer buyers mostly wish to
get things done. Guildlines Section 3 says people with disabilities will
likely have to find Accessibility information on their own, from easy to use
formats recognizing this is a new & unrehearsed task! Sub-section 3.2,
however seems to expect people with disabilities to configure many details
on their own, in stark contrast to the idea that software shouldn't be do it
yourself & that complex tasks demand much training. It is unthinkable to
leave people that need more time to get things done to finish building
programs. Good default settings & extensive templates &/or profiles are the
only way to simplify configuration in context of each OS specifics; this is
a vital necessity!

While keyboard matters are 2nd nature to me CSS is a mystery that might help
with the new problem of the keyboard Up command highlighting the last link
on a page. If CSS can turn off DHTML the link highlight might goto the last
visible link on the screen at the lower right. Yet I've no wish to become
conversant in CSS to build a style sheet, someone else knows what to do for
CSS along with other things & that knowledge should lie with these
Guildlines. The Techniques page could give examples, or as a 2nd best the
W3C could have a tips section for people with disabilities. The PC industry
prides itself on providing total solutions. Please let us not leave this
matter to be solved over & over again by each newcomer to computers.

Regards,
Bryan
