In response to Charles McCathieNevile:

interfaces to their products. <<<

Rather than expecting / hoping developers will do what we think they should,
we should provide clear guidelines. For the conscientious developers much of
this will be 'low hanging fruit', but for others it will be a wake-up call.

The group has discussed CSS for alternative table rendering and other complex
processes that go well beyond fonts / colors. If we state that enabling CSS
support for an alternate rendering style is what a UA needs to do, we are
_not_ making a clear statement that the user shouldn't need to research and
reinvent arcane stylesheet code if they want to implement that alternative.

An extreme example: can a vendor who makes their source code available claim
that their product is therefore 100% accessible and 100% flexible, because all
it takes to meet specific needs is writing your own code? A developer once
made a similar claim to me (that his product was compatible with all
peripherals and major operating systems because you could buy the source code
and re-write it however you wanted.)
