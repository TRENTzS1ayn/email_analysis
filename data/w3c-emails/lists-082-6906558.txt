Agree - I don't believe the group actually decided it was too vague.

However, it became clear to me that by trying to apply the technique to the
HTML document area, 3.1.1 became too vague.  3.1.1 was in a section talking
about the the browser user interface (menus and toolbars) rather than the
HTML document area.  While you may want to lump it all together as part of
the user interface, these are two distinctly different beasts and it was my
understanding that the reason this group formed was to help solve problems
in the HTML document area and that the browser UI/setup/documentation got
lumped into peripheral items/techniques (like 3.1.1).

I very much agree with Charles here.
