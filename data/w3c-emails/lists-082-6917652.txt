There was discusion that it may be to vague during the meeting.  Ian said
that this item was being referenced to much by other techniques and
therefore may need to be refined.  When I read it now I think that it is
difficult to interpret.  The way it is written now I don't know when I
satisfy it.  

Do I need to provide Braille input and a Braille keyboard device?
Do I need speech recognition and speech output?
Do I need a single switch scanning system?

How much redundency satisfies this requirement?

Please submit your view and your interpretation to the list for discussion.  

In my view this technique does not fly with the current wording.

Jon
