Actually I think the part where it may be a little vague is with respect
to the browser-specific controls, since some of those are only relevant to
the browser in certain configurations, and it may not be very important to
provide access to them.

The User Interface includes the means by which the HTML document area is
navigated, and parts of it selected or activated, etc. Perhaps we should
split 3.1.1 into two parts, one dealing with the browser-specific controls
and one with the controls specific to the rendered content, in the same
way as we have currently split techniques for dealing with the font
colours and the font size, but I don't think so.

  However, it became clear to me that by trying to apply the technique to the
  HTML document area, 3.1.1 became too vague.  3.1.1 was in a section talking
  about the the browser user interface (menus and toolbars) rather than the
  HTML document area.  While you may want to lump it all together as part of
  the user interface, these are two distinctly different beasts and it was my
  understanding that the reason this group formed was to help solve problems
  in the HTML document area and that the browser UI/setup/documentation got
  lumped into peripheral items/techniques (like 3.1.1).
