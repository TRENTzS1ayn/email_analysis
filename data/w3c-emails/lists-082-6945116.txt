I was basing my statements on the revsed wording which I proposed - device
independent control mechanism, rather than redundant means, since I don't
see that there is a need for much redundancy, which simply adds bloat to
the progams.

This would mean that you don't need any of the things Jon listed, you
simply need some kind of API (or to take advantage of one that the OS can
be relied on to have provided already) which allows access to the
controls.

A simple solution would be a menu somewhere which gave access to each
command/function which could be carried out by the UA, and to which there
was some reconfigurable access mechanism. Such a menu used to be part of
MS Word - I think it was a precursor to the process of customising
toolbars. But most functions (mouse-based ones may be more difficult) can
be readily provided in this way, and the problem is solved. The makers of
a single switch interface can then provide, using whatever User Interface
they see fit, access to the functions of this browser by means of that
interface.

  satisfy it.  
  
  Do I need to provide Braille input and a Braille keyboard device?
  Do I need speech recognition and speech output?
  Do I need a single switch scanning system?
  
  How much redundency satisfies this requirement?
  
  Please submit your view and your interpretation to the list for discussion.  
  
  In my view this technique does not fly with the current wording.
