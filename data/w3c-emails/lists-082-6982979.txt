What if an operating system that you are developing a user agent for does
not support device independence?  

Does that mean the user agent must create new APIs to handle device
independence?

How does this impact touch screen Kiosks?  

How would this guidelines help them understand Kiosk developers what they
need to provide for accessibility?

Please provide revised working for review.

Jon
