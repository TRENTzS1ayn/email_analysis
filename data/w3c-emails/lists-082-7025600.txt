We don't know that we have identified sufficient techniques for such a User
Agent.
If there is a User Agent that operates in an environment (UI profile) that
we didn't anticipate and analyze, we are not prepared to say what
techniques are required in that environment.  They can study the
techniques, but we haven't done the necessary homework to make a
prescription for that case.

I think that what we are wrestling with is the following: this positive
statement is not the correct test.  Keyboard access to on-mouse-over events
is not so much required for User Agents where the keyboard is enabled.  It
is required where the mouse is disabled.  The correlation between UI
capabilities and techniques is negative; lacking one, one requires the other.

We need alternate paths for those user dialog strategies which assume
device capabilities which are not supported in the user's selected UI
profile or use pattern.

Well, you could be onto something we all missed.

Does this reasoning make sense to you?
