I would like to propose the following types of user agent types, with the
following definitiions:

Proposed User Agent Type:
Visual Standard (VS): Rendering of document text content on displays
greater 640x480 resolution with default font sizes less than 48 point.
Examples include mass market browsers like Microsoft Internet Explorer,
Opera and Netscape navigator.

Visual Restricted (VR): Rendering of document text content on displays that
a smaller than 640x480 or with default font sizes greater than 48 point
font.  Examples include screen magnifiers like Zoomtext from AISquared and
Magic from Henter-Joyce for people with visual impairments, and portable
user agent technologies for the mass market.  

Multi-Media (MM): Rendering of audio, video or animations from file formats
that contain sampled or compressed sound, bit mapped video or image
information.  Examples include wave, mpeg and avi files.  

Aural (A): Rendering of document text and alternative rendering of non-text
content using text-to-speech synthesis technology.  Examples include screen
reader like Jaws from Henter-Joyce and Outspoken from Alva when used with a
mass market browser and browsers developed for the visually impiared like
pwWebSpeak, IBM Homereader and VPInfoNet.

Braille (B): Rendering of document text and alternative rendering of
non-text content using dynamic Braille display technology.  Examples
include screen readers like Jaws from Henter-Joyce and Outspoken from Alva
when used with a mass market browser.
