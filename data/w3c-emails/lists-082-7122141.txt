Do you think these are the user agent types that we should be using?

Example of one user agent types with the my understanding of a checklist.
Is this what you had in mind?

TYPE: Visual Standard (VS) 
DESCRIPTION: Rendering of document text content and graphical images on bit 
mapped visual displays with 640x480 pixels or greater resolution with 
default font sizes less than 48 point(the font size is only an initial 
guess). 
CHECKLIST:
__ Graphical display of at least 640x480 pixels
__ Allows for the rendering of text in multiple font sizes
__ Allows for the rendering of document information in more than 2 colors
__ Allows the rendering of images
__ Provides support for both a full size keyboard and a pointer (mouse) to
control nd adjust the user agent
EXAMPLES: Mass market user agents like Microsoft Internet Explorer, 
Opera and Netscape navigator.
