I think the UA group needs to make a shift from developing a guidelines of
techniques and "tricks" to make assistive technology that doesn't know
anything about the user agent, to assistive technology that does know about
the user agent to make user agents accessible.   While current assistive
technology does not know about the user agent, this group or other WAI
groups can help educate them about WWW technolgies and the resources that
are available.  

I feel this is important because for too main reasons.  If assistive
technology knows about things like DOM they can make assistive technology
much more user friendly than if they just try to translate the visual
display to some other format.  Remember making user agents more accessible
is our primary goal.  The other issue is tha many of the tricks that can be
used by assistive technology maybe very difficult or take a long time to be
built into main stream browsers.  

I think if we want to make a big step forward in accessibility we need to
take a big step forward in what we want to see in the relationship between
assistive technology and "main stream" browser technology.
