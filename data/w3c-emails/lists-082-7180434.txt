JRG: I think if we are vague on defining types, then it will be difficult
for developers to know which guidelines apply to them and which do not.
Developers may think they need to do everything to be compliant and see it
as too big a job and ignore the guidelines.  

I think we want to focus on how information is being rendered in the user
agent types.

JRG: During auditory rendering I think it should be structural markup like
headers and emphasis that should be used to change speech and not
necessarily changes in font which may be only for visual effect.  

I am not sure we need to worry about monochrome displays in the guidelines.
 But we may want to have a User Agent named KIOSK, that could be a catch
all for all sorts of strange combinations of input and output technologies.
