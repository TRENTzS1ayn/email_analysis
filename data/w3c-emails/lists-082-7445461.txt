The object model that extends the DOM should contain UI component
informaiton such as keyboard bindings, etc. This would include position
information. I agree with CMN that position information does not belong int
he DOM.

MN:
  The things Rich is referring to here, are proposed in DOM Level 2.  I'd
prefer
  to not call this new object model anything using the word "accessible",
since
  I believe the potential scope is much larger (e.g., automated testing
tools,
  validation tools, search engines, etc.).
CMcCN:
I agree with Mark here.

MN:
  If individual nodes maps to individual elements (??), then we may also
need
  a grouping and un-grouping semantic mapping as well.
CMcCN:
It would be helpful to have a method for selecting a range, across element
boundaries. I believe this is provided by DOM 2.

CMN:
Position information is only relevant to a particular architecture which
is intrinsically visual. Within that architecture it is important, as Rich
explains, but I am not sure that it is of particular relevance to the DOM,
which should not presuppose a particular rendering architecture.

MN:
  I think these would also be in the ??? object model that extends DOM,
  not DOM itself?

CMcCN:
If the standard control mechanism for a system is to provide a particular
API (as with accessible Java) then the requirement has been met to a large
degree. (there is still the issue of consistency, but that is usability
rather than being inaccessible to assistive technology.)
