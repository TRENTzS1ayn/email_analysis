I have developed a WWW based issue management system for the WAI UA group.
If other people want to use it let me know.  You can try it at:

http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/cgi-bin/issue.cgi

I think most of the bugs are worked out, but if you have a problem please
let me know ASAP.
Thanks,
Jon Gunderson
