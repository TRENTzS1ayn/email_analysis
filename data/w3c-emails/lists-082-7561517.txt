>5.5.3 [Priority 1]
>Allow the user to search for a form control based on its text content.
>Because a form control does not have a standard label, it can be important
>to allow a person with a disability to locate controls based on the text

>Allow the user to search for a form control based on its attribute values.

Per our teleconf. call earlier today, I agree with Denis that these should
be priority 2
