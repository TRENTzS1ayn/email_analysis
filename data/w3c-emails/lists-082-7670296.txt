There is always a tension in this - if we specify too closely the nwe risk
getting to implementation-specific, or missing something that is hard to
verify but is nevertheless important.

My general preference is to be more general where that is likely to cover
our needs better and not impose undue burdens on manufacturers.

  One potential advantage of making the current checkpoint a guideline and
  adding new checkpoints is that the checkpoints can be more specific for
  conformance verification.  A general checkpoint will be much more difficult
  to verify.
