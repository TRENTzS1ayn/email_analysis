My responses in CMN:

OJG:
  Provide programmatic access for dependent user agents to read and
  manipulate the content in the currently rendered HTML content (or document
  tree).
  
IJ:  
  Can we say "document tree" if that'swhat we mean?
  
  JRG: Is the document tree also apart of multi-media players?  
  Why I said content instead of the document tree is that I want to include
  in this checkpoint mult-media players and other plugins like Adobe Acobat
  that may not be HTML.   Maybe we could have 2 checkpoints one for HTML
  content (or W3C recommended content) which could use the term document tree
  and another for proprietary content (non-W3C recommend content).  Document
  Tree sounds more technical to me than just content, but as long as it is
  interpreted as the same thing I guess it is alright.

CMN:
I don't think we need two checkpoints. I think we should use document
tree, (or a similar term - we are trying to get at the thing which is
modelled by the DOM in certain languages) and define it. The document tree
includes all the elements within a document - for a GIF that might be a
single image (but it might be several images, a title, some
animation looping controls, etc).

IJ:  
  What does the last clause: "that are used to direct andcontrol" mean? 

  JRG: It is just my attempt to be inclusive of all types of user interface
  controls.  I think it would be also good to add the phrase "and indicate
  status or other orientation information".

CMN:
I don't think the clause in question is necessary - this is a list of some
examples of user agent controls. I also think that this should not be
restricted to desktop user agents - access to controls should be available
in both directions.

IJ:  
  This sounds too vague. We were asked to break out checkpointsin Guideline
  5.1. Why not here?
  JRG: This could be removed if 7.2.a is changed to include manipulation.
CMN:
Seems like a good idea to me.

IJ:  
  The specificity of this one strikes me when compared to the other ones. I
  agree with it, but it could be part of several ofthe previous checkpoint.
  
  JRG: This was a topic of discussion in the last telecon and some people
  felt it was important.  It is not available through DOM and probablt never
  will do to privacy issues.  So I included it as a low priority checkpoint.
  IE already exposes this information through Active Accessibility.  

CMN:
I don't think this is a DOM issue. I think the information should be
available, along with other information of the same nature, in section 6.1
