IJ:
  The specificity of this one strikes me when compared to the other ones. I
  agree with it, but it could be part of several ofthe previous checkpoint.

  JRG: This was a topic of discussion in the last telecon and some people
  felt it was important.  It is not available through DOM and probablt never
  will do to privacy issues.  So I included it as a low priority checkpoint.
  IE already exposes this information through Active Accessibility.

CMN:
I don't think this is a DOM issue. I think the information should be
available, along with other information of the same nature, in section 6.1

MN:
Agree with Charles, this is not a DOM issue.

Please keep in mind, that the security issue as I understand it, is the
security around reading what a user has in their "cache of visited places".
The
UA "can" determine which links on the page in "view" have been visited and
which have not.  At least the IE UA can, and I suspect I could do the same with
Navigator.  Thus if a user doesn't erase their own "cache", and visits or
revisits
a page, a powertoy or other such script, or external executable program
could now
be written to inform them, not only how many links are on that page, but also
which if any of those links have been previously visited (within the history
of their own cache time limit).

(note:  I use a style sheet to enhance [color] this information for myself
along with enhancing the link with focus, as I tab thru a page.)
