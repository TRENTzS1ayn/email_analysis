I would like to present a revised proposal for Desktop Graphical User Agnet
compatibility with AT:
 
Checkpoint 7.2.a [Priority 1]
Provide programmatic access for dependent user agents to content rendered
on graphical displays.

Technique
This is designed for current screen reader technology and other assistive
technology that is using display rendering to gather information about WWW
content.  Current techniques include:
1. Active Accessibility
2. Java Swing Classes
3, Selective use of operating system techniques for rendering graphical
information


Checkpoint 7.2.b [Priority 1]
Provide programmatic access for dependent user agents to the document
object model (DOM).

Technique
This is designed for specialized user agents and other assistive
technologies that can use the DOM to access information about WWW content
directly.  This includes the ability to both read and manipulate the
contents of the document object model.  The main issue here is providing
guidiance in exporting the DOM to the dependent user agents.


Checkpoint 7.2.c [Priority 1]
Provide programmatic access for dependent user agents to desktop user agent
controls: including 
menus, toolbars, help systems and other user interface elements of the
desktop graphical user agent.

Technique
This is designed for screen readers and other assistive technology that is
using display rendering to gather information about content.  Current
techniques include:
1. Active Accessibility
2. Java Swing Classes
3, Selective use of operating system techniques for rendering menus,
controls, help systems and toolbars


Checkpoint 7.2.d [Priority 1]
Provide a programmatic interface for dependent user agents to be informed
of changes to the focus and selection.

Technique
Dependent user agents should be able to know what elements are selected and
which control has the focus.

Checkpoint 7.2.e [Priority 1]
Provide a programmatic interface for dependent user agents to simulate user
interface and WWW content control events and to change the user agent focus
and selection.

Technique
Assistive technologies should be able to simulate user interface events to
provide alternative activations of user interface and WWW content controls.

Checkpoint 7.2.f [Priority 1]
Fully implement DOM Level 1 and other DOM spefications that improve
accessibility.

Technique
This allows specialized browsers to full access to the WWW content.  All
elements and attributes should be represented in the model, even if the
graphical user agent does not use them in its own graphical rendering of
the content.
