Guideline 7.2 Use and provide accessible interfaces to other technologies

A user agent must communicate with other software (dependent user agents, the
operating system, plug-ins) using accessible interfaces. To promote
interoperability, open standards should be used wherever possible. 

Some operating systems have operating system-level flags and settings that are
pertinent to accessibility, such as high-contrast colors and "show" sounds for
people with hearing impairments. User agents should take these global settings
into account for their own settings. 

-----------------------------------------------

Checkpoint 7.2.1 
Provide programatic access for dependent user agents to the user interface by
using operating system and development language accessibility resources and
conventions.

Technique

This is designed for current screen reader technology and other assistive
technology that is using display rendering to gather information about WWW
content.  Current techniques include:

1. Active Accessibility
2. Java accessibility API
3. Java Swing Classes
4. Selective use of operating system techniques for rendering graphical
information
Other techniques...

This section would provide references to OS and language specific
accessibility
resources and techniques for various OS and programming languages.

-----------------------------------------------

Checkpoint 7.2.2 [Priority 1] 
Provide programmatic access for dependent user agents to the document object
model (DOM).

Technique
This is designed for specialized user agents and other assistive technologies
that can use the DOM to access information about WWW content directly.  This
includes the ability to both read and manipulate the contents of the document
object model.  The main issue here is providing guidiance in exporting the DOM
to the dependent user agents.

-----------------------------------------------

Checkpoint 7.2.3 [Priority 1] 
Provide a programmatic interface for dependent user agents to be informed of
changes to the document object, focus, selection and editing caret position.

Technique
OS and proposed DOM techniques to provide some or all of this information

-----------------------------------------------

Checkpoint 7.2.4 [Priority 1] 
Provide a programmatic interface for dependent user agents to change the
document object, focus, selection and editing caret position.

Techniques
OS and DOM techniques to provide some or all of this information

-----------------------------------------------

Checkpoint 7.2.5 [Priority 1] 
Provide a programmatic interface for dependent user agents to simulate user
interface and WWW content control events. 

Technique
Assistive technologies should be able to simulate user interface events to
provide alternative activations of user interface and WWW content controls.

-----------------------------------------------

Checkpoint 7.2.6 [Priority 1] 
Fully implement DOM Level 1 and other DOM spefications that improve
accessibility.

Technique
This allows specialized browsers full access to the WWW content.  All elements
and attributes should be represented in the model, even if the graphical user
agent does not use them in its own graphical rendering of the content.

-----------------------------------------------

Checkpoint 7.2.7 [Priority 1] 
Provide programatic exchange of information to dependent user agents in a
timely manner for synchronous alternative renderings and simulation of events.
 
Technique
Techniques which facilitate the synchronize events and renderings in the
graphical user agent with the dependent user agent.
1. Shared memory space
2. Registration of assistive technology with UA
others.... 

-----------------------------------------------

Checkpoint 7.2.4 [Priority 2]
Follow operating system conventions and accessibility settings in user
interface design, configuration (including configuration profiles), product
installation, and documentation. 

Techniques
OS and language flags that can be used in configuring user agents for
accessibility
