Here's what I understood to be the essence of the checkpoints:

The User Agent must

  1) Broadcast changes in the document tree.
  2) Broadcast changes in the selection, focus, caret.
  3) Provide read (and write?) access to the document tree.
  4) Use standard interfaces (OS, java, etc.) for rendering information
     and handling events.
  5) Provide read (and write?) access to user interface controls.
  6) Provide a means to synthesize document events.
  7) Use accessibility interfaces of the platform.
  8) Use OS flags and other conventions of the platform.
  9) Implement the DOM.
 10) Ensure that information is made available in a timely manner
