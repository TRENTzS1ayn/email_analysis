If we are trying to round out the picture, two possible other
techniques which should be added would be:

1 - out-of-process access to the DOM
   yes it can be done, it is not necessarily slower, and in many cases it
may be the only option available

2 - write your own UA
  a.k.a. pwWebSpeak


Can people think of any other solutions, or does that cover the
spectrum?  I believe #3 and #4 would be as already described....

3 - launch the entire AT inside the address space of the (UA) browser
[see Rich's prior email]

4 - launch some part of the AT, a piece of stub code, a DLL, a Browser
Helper Object [special DLL] as Rob suggested, etc., inside the address space
of the (UA) browser [see Rob's prior email]

I've asked the same question regarding IE's support of the W3C document
object model, more specifically, their level of support for the HTML Level
1 DOM.
