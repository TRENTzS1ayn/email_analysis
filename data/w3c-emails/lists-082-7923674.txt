I agree Harvey the wording should be "choose one among available tracks"

Allow the user to specify that sign language video track (if  available) be
rendered at the same time as the video. </new
<note>this was not specified before. it is possible with in the SMIL spec to
provide this capability

I suppose one could envision/contrive a situation where a user might want
the sign-language video track and some other media simultaneously. How
about - using a SMIL presentation with a classroom of students who are
hearing impaired where some prefer sign and others prefer captions.
