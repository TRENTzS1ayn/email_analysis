HB: is that change only for the dependent user agent's use, or also
to affect the independent user agent? I hope the latter, which should
be made clear. 

[anecdote: working with George Kerscher reviewing a document I had
prepared, his screen showed highlighted where he was currently using 
his text-to-speech reader, so I could know what he was hearing, and 
respond to his questions in context.]
