Hi,

I'm an editor of "HTML 4.0 Guidelines for Mobile Access".  Thank you
for paying attention to this Note.

Yes, we find WAI Guidelines useful, and we do reference User Agent
Accessibility Guidelines.  Our references to UA Guidelines are based
on WD-WAI-USERAGENT-19981112, so we are checking WAI-USERAGENT-19990331
now and will try to update references appropriately.  Our basic idea
is to make our "mobile guidelines" compatible with WAI Guidelines
whenever appropriate.  When WAI Guidelines become mature, we will
simply refer to relevant sections of WAI Guidelines and will focus
on differences (if any).

I prefix my comments with "MI". In my comments, "we" means members
of Mobile Access IG or at least editors of the mobile guidelines.

MI: Yes, for example, `content' property in CSS2 allows you to
generate content with `:before' and `:after' pseudo-elements [1].
We realize that, but we can't ask too much because of hardware
restrictions of mobile devices [2].

Unfortunately, some older user agents show contents of SYTLE elements
as garbage.  That's too bad, as typically screens are very small in
mobile devices, so such garbage can easily fill the whole screen.
That's worse than not rendering some contents supposed to be
generated by style info.  That's why we advise to hide the contents
of STYLE elements when user agents don't support style sheets.  This
is in line with the minimum requirement in HTML 3.2 [3].

We understand that generated content is useful for accessibility, but
basically, we think the important information should be described in
the document itself, and should not be generated by style info.
Generated content should be used to "improve" accessibility.  If
the document is not understandable without such generated content,
we think it's the "abuse" of style sheets.  So we state as follows
in section 3.1 [4].

 "Contents should be readable without style sheets so that devices which 
  don't support style sheets can still render contents reasonably."

In the future, we might use better content negotiation mechanism,
such as CC/PP [5], but it's out of scope of this Note. "Modularization
of XHTML" [6] will address this issue.

MI: The same reason for styles.  We can't ask too much to user agents.
Content developers should check "2.13 Scripts" of "Techniques for Web
Content Accessibility Guidelines" [7] so that alternative presentation
of scripts can be available.

MI: This section only addresses the issue of "image maps", not the general
issue on images. That should be addressed in section 3.7.

MI: Yes, and we think the general guidelines for table rendering should be
better addressed in User Agent Accessibility Guidelines, not the mobile
guidelines.  At the time of writing the mobile guidelines, we were
referring to WD-WAI-USERAGENT-19981112, which didn't have much
guidelines for table rendering, but now that WAI-USERAGENT-19990331
has more detailed guidelines [8], so I think we can just refer to
the relevant section of UA Guidelines in the next version.

MI: Yes, maybe we should have mentioned about it for clarification.  In
section 3.7 [9], we state:

 "... alternative description via "alt" attribute, which is required
  in [HTML40], should be provided for user agents which cannot or do
  not render images."

It assumes that the user agents will handle alt attribute.

MI: We hope UA Guidelines will address this issue.  Just FYI, some
Web-enabled mobile phones only allow `0-9', `#' and `*' for access
keys, and they indicate the existence of these access keys with
specialized images.

Thanks again for your useful comments.
