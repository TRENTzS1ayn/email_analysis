I have not seen much response on the list of revised checkpoints on the
assistive technology compatibility PROPOSAL from March 9th:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999AprJun/0041.html

The chair is taking this lack of discussion as an indication that this
message captures the consensus of the group.  Please review the proposal,
if there are no additional comments before the telecon Wednesday I am only
going to schedule more time for other issues to be discussed (navigation
issues) at the wednesday telecon.
