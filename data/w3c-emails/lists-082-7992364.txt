Jon,

I still think that 7.2.6 has the guideline and the technique backwards.  In
all other aspects of the guidelines, we eschew direct reference to any
particular method of providing access, and state what access or function
should be provided.  The techniques document should describe ways to do
that.

Following this model, 7.2.6 should read, "Provide full access to the content
of the WWW to AT devices and dependent user agents."  The techniques would
include fully implementing DOM Level 1 and other DOM specifications that
enhance access by people with disabilities.

DOM is one specification for making content accessible.  Other
specifications could be developed that would be equally effective.
(Although, being non-standard, they would be harder to develop for.)  If the
*guidelines* document specifies the DOM, we are saying that all other
implementations are not valid.  I don't think we want to do that.

Subject: PROPOSAL: Assistive Technology Compatibility


I have not seen much response on the list of revised checkpoints on the
assistive technology compatibility PROPOSAL from March 9th:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999AprJun/0041.html

The chair is taking this lack of discussion as an indication that this
message captures the consensus of the group.  Please review the proposal,
if there are no additional comments before the telecon Wednesday I am only
going to schedule more time for other issues to be discussed (navigation
issues) at the wednesday telecon.
