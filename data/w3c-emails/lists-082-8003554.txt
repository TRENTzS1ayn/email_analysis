DOM is especially important to developers like pwWebSpeak who will be using
the DOM to assist in there own rendering.  The lack of full implementation
of DOM makes it difficult to use DOM to render all of the WWW content.  For
example in our own project here at UIUC we are using the Microsoft DOM for
IE 4.0 and the current API to the DOM doesn't allow access to the text
content of the CAPTIONS element.  You can detect that the TABLE has a
caption, and adjust formatting.  But you cannot access the text content of
the element.  Clearly we want to make sure that these types of problems do
not limit AT developers.

Your concern probably rests with the use of accessibility APIs for use by
technologies like screen readersc and that is required under under
checkpoint 7.2.1.
Checkpoint 7.2.1 could state this more clearly by adding the phrase "and
rendered content" after the words "user interface".  The new guideline
would read:

Checkpoint 7.2.1
Provide programatic access for dependent user agents to the user interface
and rendered content by using operating system and development language
accessibility resources and conventions.
