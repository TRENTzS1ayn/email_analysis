Jon's original marked JRG:
my comments CMN:
brief summary: I think Jon's proposed 7.2.3, 7.2.4 (the first of two) and
7.2.5 are redundant, and that there could be some things more carefully
defined, but overall I think the proposal is good.

  Guideline 7.2 Use and provide accessible interfaces to other technologies
  
  A user agent must communicate with other software (dependent user agents, the
  operating system, plug-ins) using accessible interfaces. To promote
  interoperability, open standards should be used wherever possible. 
  
  Some operating systems have operating system-level flags and settings that are
  pertinent to accessibility, such as high-contrast colors and "show" sounds for
  people with hearing impairments. User agents should take these global settings
  into account for their own settings. 

CMN:
It should be made clear that access must be two-way
JRG:  
  -----------------------------------------------
  
  Checkpoint 7.2.1 
  Provide programatic access for dependent user agents to the user interface by
  using operating system and development language accessibility resources and
  conventions.
  
  Technique
  
  This is designed for current screen reader technology and other assistive
  technology that is using display rendering to gather information about WWW
  content.  Current techniques include:
  
  1. Active Accessibility
  2. Java accessibility API
  3. Java Swing Classes
  4. Selective use of operating system techniques for rendering graphical
  information
  Other techniques...
  
  This section would provide references to OS and language specific
  accessibility
  resources and techniques for various OS and programming languages.
  
  -----------------------------------------------
  
  Checkpoint 7.2.2 [Priority 1] 
  Provide programmatic access for dependent user agents to the document object
  model (DOM).
  
  Technique
  This is designed for specialized user agents and other assistive technologies
  that can use the DOM to access information about WWW content directly.  This
  includes the ability to both read and manipulate the contents of the document
  object model.  The main issue here is providing guidiance in exporting the DOM
  to the dependent user agents.
CMN: 
This ought to specifically name information which must be exposed, and
which is not covered by the W3C DOM
JRG: 
  -----------------------------------------------
  
  Checkpoint 7.2.3 [Priority 1] 
  Provide a programmatic interface for dependent user agents to be informed of
  changes to the document object, focus, selection and editing caret position.
  
  Technique
  OS and proposed DOM techniques to provide some or all of this information
  
  -----------------------------------------------
  
  Checkpoint 7.2.4 [Priority 1] 
  Provide a programmatic interface for dependent user agents to change the
  document object, focus, selection and editing caret position.
  
  Techniques
  OS and DOM techniques to provide some or all of this information

  -----------------------------------------------
  
  Checkpoint 7.2.5 [Priority 1] 
  Provide a programmatic interface for dependent user agents to simulate user
  interface and WWW content control events. 
  
  Technique
  Assistive technologies should be able to simulate user interface events to
  provide alternative activations of user interface and WWW content controls.
CMN:
These are covered already by the proposal.  
JRG:
  
  -----------------------------------------------
  
  Checkpoint 7.2.6 [Priority 1] 
  Fully implement DOM Level 1 and other DOM spefications that improve
  accessibility.
  
  Technique
  This allows specialized browsers full access to the WWW content.  All elements
  and attributes should be represented in the model, even if the graphical user
  agent does not use them in its own graphical rendering of the content.
  
  -----------------------------------------------
  
  Checkpoint 7.2.7 [Priority 1] 
  Provide programatic exchange of information to dependent user agents in a
  timely manner for synchronous alternative renderings and simulation of events.
   
  Technique
  Techniques which facilitate the synchronize events and renderings in the
  graphical user agent with the dependent user agent.
  1. Shared memory space
  2. Registration of assistive technology with UA
  others.... 
  
  -----------------------------------------------
  
  Checkpoint 7.2.4 [Priority 2]
  Follow operating system conventions and accessibility settings in user
  interface design, configuration (including configuration profiles), product
  installation, and documentation. 
  
  Techniques
  OS and language flags that can be used in configuring user agents for
  accessibility
