I have been developing a more detailed issues list on the topics that we need
to resolve for the next working draft to be used as the basis of a proposed
recommendation.  The new issues list can be found at:

Linear version
http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html
Table version
http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-table.html

The issues are indexed by category and the issues related to navigation
include:

Navigation 
#3: Should user agents be able recognize markup for navigation bars (Open) 
#11: Move to the next element with the same attributes and element type
(Open) 
#15: Sequentially navigate between active elements (Resolved) 
#16: Sequentially navigate to only link elements (Open) 
#17: Sequentially navigate to only form controls in a document (Open) 
#18: Sequentailly navigate to only elements with long descriptions (longdesc
attribute or OBJECT content) (Open) 
#20: Sequentially navigate header elements (Open) 
#21: Search for link based on its text content (Open) 
#22: Sequentially navigate between forms in a document (Open) 
#23: Search for a form control based on text content (Open) 
#24: Search for a form control based on its attribute values (i.e. label or

#25: Sequentially navigate all block level elements (Open) 
#26: Search for an element based on its text content (Open) 
#27: Move to the next element in the document tree as defined by DOM (Open)

tree (Open)

(Open) 
#30: Move to the parent element of the current element in the document tree
(Open) 
#38: Search for a link based on its attribute value (Open)


Please try to review the issues list before today telecon.  We will be
discussing navigation after we resolve the AT compatibility issues.

The issues list will be the basis of our telecons for the remainder of our
working group.  So if there are important issues you do not think the working
group has resolved please send them to the list or to me for possible
placement
on the issues list.
