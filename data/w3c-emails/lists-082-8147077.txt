Checkpoint: Sequential access to active elements
Sub-groups: Both
Priority: 1

Technique
Allow the user to sequentially move the focus of the user agent to the
active elements of a document.   The active elements include links, form
controls and long descriptions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Checkpoint: Search for an element based on its text content
Sub groups: Both
Priority: 1

Techniques

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Checkpoint: Sequential access to block (paragraph) level elements
Sub groups: Dependent user agents
Priority: 1

Techniques:
Allow the user to sequentially move through block (paragraph) level
elements in a document.  The current element is selected as the user
navigates between blocks (paragraphs).  A initial list of block (paragraph)
level elements:

DDDefinition 
DIVDivision
DTDefinition term
H1-H6Headers
LIList elements
PParagraphs
PREPreformatted text
THTable header
TDTable data
INPUTForm controls
TEXTAREAForm control

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Checkpoint: Allow the user to access the text of an element
Sub groups: Dependent user agents
Priority: 1

Technique
Allow the user to view the text content of an element including the viewing
of single characters, words and sentences with in the element.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Checkpoint: Search for a link based on its text content
Sub groups: Dependent user agents
Priority: 2

Techniques
Allow the user to search for a link based on the text contents of the links
in a document.  If the text is found in a link the focus is moved to that
link.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Checkpoint: Direct access to a link from a list containing only link elements 
Sub groups: Dependent user agents
Priority: 2

Techniques
The user can access a list of links move through the links sequentially or
by typing the first letter to move to next occurrence of a link starting
with that letter

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Checkpoint: Direct access to a form control from a list of only form
controls based on the control label or control type
Sub groups: Dependent user agents
Priority: 2

Techniques
A list of form controls would be presented to the user. The user could
sequentially move through the list or type the first letter of a label to
move to the next item in the list with a label that starts with that
letter. Selecting one of the items in the list of form controls moves the
user agent focus to that control.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Checkpoint: Direct access to a long description from a list of only long
descriptions
Sub groups: Dependent user agents
Priority: 2

Techniques
A list of elements with long descriptions would be presented to the user.
The user could sequentially move through the list or type the first letter
of a alternative content (ALT or Title or enclosed text(object element)) to
move to the next long description in the list that starts with the letter.
Selecting one of the items in the list of  long descriptions opens the long
descriptions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Checkpoint: Search for the next element with the same attributes as the
current element
Sub groups: Dependent user agents
Priority: 2

Techniques
Allow the user to move to the next element of the same element type and
attributes.  If an author used poor formatting methods this provides a
means to navigate the structures of a document.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Checkpoint: Direct access to a table element from a list of only tables
based on the table caption or document position
Sub groups: Dependent user agents
Priority: 2

Techniques
A list of tables would be presented to the user. The item text in the list
would be based on the CAPTION element or document position of the table
with the dimensions of the table.  The user could sequentially move through
the list or type the first letter of a CAPTION to move to the next item in
the list starting with that letter. Selecting one of the items in the list
of tables moves the user agent selection to that table.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Checkpoint: Sequential access to a form element from a list of only forms
based on the form position
Sub groups: Dependent user agents
Priority: 2

Techniques
A list of forms would be presented to the user. The item text in the list
would be based on the document position of the table with the number of
controls in the form.  The user could sequentially move through the list.
Selecting one of the items in the list of forms moves the user agent
selection to that form and the focus to the first element in the form.
