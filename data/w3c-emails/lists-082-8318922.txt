Attempting to discharge my task...

Have been thinking about the navigation issues. The only way I can make
sense is to separate the moving aspect from the searching aspect of
navigation.

Navigation by movement
Using DOM navigation as a starting point, I think we could have 4 or 5
checkpoint (0, I, II, III, IV(?)), the rest of the outline elements would be
techniques.

0. Sequential access to all elements (all below are a subset of this)
I. Sequential access to active elements (below are subsets or specific types
of active elements)
A. Links
1. Graphic links
2. unvisited links (need some indication to user of status of links, I
assume this comes from the DOM)
3. visited links
4. long desc links
B. Events (this needs more work)
1. activate event ( tab to link, pulldown menu appears)
2. navigate the resulting information
C. Form Controls
1. Input
2. text area
3. option
4. button
5. select
6. optgroup
D. Other - i.e. active elements within objects?
II. Sequential access to text elements (separate from active elements)
A. Headings
B. Block elements (p, li, etc. )
III. Sequential access within and between 'large structures'
A. Forms
 Form Controls
1. Input
2. text area
3. option
4. button
5. select
6. optgroup
Form elements
1. Field set(s)
2. Legend
B. Frames
C. Tables
1. Caption
2. summary
3. cells (rows & columns)
IV. Generic
A. move to next same element or attribute
