Checkpoint: Allow the user to sequentially access elements with the
ACCESSKEY attribute defined
Sub-group: Both
Priority: 1 or 2

Technique
The ACCESSKEY attribute allows authors to provide keyboard support for
directly moving the focus to a link or form control.  When the access key
combination is activated by the user, the focus moves to the next element
in tab order with that ACCESSKEY.  Therefore multiple elements can use the
same ACCESSKEY without conflicit.

Please comment on this proposal
