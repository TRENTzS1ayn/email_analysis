There are two things at work here. The first is to allow access to the
attributes (propoerties) of a given element. The second is to search for an
element with a given property (attribute value).

I think both are of value, and if available together would satisfy the 'allow
a user to find the next thing like this' checkpoint.

I am using 'properties' here as information pertaining to an object, rather
than the more restricted definition used in the document, which only refers
to style properties. I suggest that the definition in general be expanded,
and the term 'style properties' be used when that is what is meant.

  Thanks for the quick posting Harvey.  
  
  Could we change the name of the checkpoint to:
  Checkpoint: Allow the user to search for an element by its attribute values
  Subgroup: dependent user agents
  Priority: 3
