I don't think this is a good idea. ACCESSKEY should indentify a unique
shortcut in the context of a page. If you want a special tabbing order there
is TABINDEX, although it seems counterintuitive to me. If it is only being
used for links or form controls we already have checkpoints to give access to
just those kinds of elements.

  Checkpoint: Allow the user to sequentially access elements with the
  ACCESSKEY attribute defined
  Sub-group: Both
  Priority: 1 or 2
  
  Technique
  The ACCESSKEY attribute allows authors to provide keyboard support for
  directly moving the focus to a link or form control.  When the access key
  combination is activated by the user, the focus moves to the next element
  in tab order with that ACCESSKEY.  Therefore multiple elements can use the
  same ACCESSKEY without conflicit.
  
  Please comment on this proposal
