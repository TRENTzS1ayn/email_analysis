I don't think that we should not have a checkpoint for ACCESSKEY. I do think
that a checkpoint requiring sequential access to elements which have an
ACCESSKEY is inappropriate - the purpose of the element is to provide access
to certain elements in a non-sequential manner.

  ACCESSKEY is defined for the following HTML elements:
  A
  AREA
  BUTTON
  INPUT
  LABEL
  LEGEND
  TEXTAREA
  
  It is designed to move the focus to the next focusable element associated
  with the ACCESSKEY.  
  
  ACCESSKEY is not related to INDEXTAB except we could specify following
  INDEXTAB order if the author has defined an explicit order.
  
  The ACCESSKEY attribute is recommended for use in improving access to Web
  Content in the Web Content guidelines.
  
  IE already supports the ACCESSKEY feature.
  
  I think we need a checkpoint for navigating to items containing this
  attribute.
  
  Are there other people who think a checkpoint relating to using ACCESSKEY
  should not be part of the guidelines?
  
  It would be a priority 3 item, just like in the Web Content guidelines.
