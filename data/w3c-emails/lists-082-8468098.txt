In response to CMN:
The sequential statement is due to the potential multiple definitions of
the same accesskey in a document.  If more than one control, link, label,
... uses the same accesskey we want people to be able to navigate to each
one.  In the case of single definitions of an accesskey in a document then
the sequential part is a mute point, the focus would move directly to that
associated focusable element.
