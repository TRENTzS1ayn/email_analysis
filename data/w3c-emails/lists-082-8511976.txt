Actually I would propose it be for all user agents. But yes.

techniques:
1. in exposing the DOM, include attribute information
2. provide access to the properties via a context menu for the focussed or
selected element
3. Allow the user to view the source of a document, or of a relevant fragment
(this gets interesting and useful in the context of XML fragments, a current
area of W3C activity)

  Checkpoint: Allow the user to view the attributes of an element
  Subgroup: Depedent user agents
  Priority: 3
  
  in addition to the searching checkpoint?
