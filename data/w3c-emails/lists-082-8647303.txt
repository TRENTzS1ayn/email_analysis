So you just want the guidelines to say the the attibute ACCESSKEY is good
for accessibility in the current section 7 and I am assuming that you want
the features needed for accessible implementation be be in the techniques
document?

I think it would make it clearer to developers if they saw the access key
implementation information as part of other navigation commands.  If it is
only in the compatibility section, it will not have the weight or the
visibility of a checkpoint.
