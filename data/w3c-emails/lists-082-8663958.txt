I don't want the guidelines document to say "ACCESSKEY". I want the
guidelines to make reference to a defined set of elements and attributes
which should be implemented in HTML. There is currently a priority 1
checkpoint which does precisely that, and I think that is sufficient.

I think that referenced document should say Accessky is one of the attributes
which must be implemented by a User Agent which claims to render HTML and
be accessible. 

I might even expect to see some simple information there about how Accesskey
should be used - unfortunately the HTML specification does not make it very
clear what the constraints are.

  I think it would make it clearer to developers if they saw the access key
  implementation information as part of other navigation commands.  If it is
  only in the compatibility section, it will not have the weight or the
  visibility of a checkpoint.
