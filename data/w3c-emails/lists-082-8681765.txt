I think I am being misunderstood here.  The checkpoint is designed to do
things:

1. Indication of implmentation of a navigation command to elements with
ACCESSKEY based on the specified key

i.e ALT-A or Command-A for ACCESSKEY=A

2. If multiple element use the same key for the ACCESSKEY attribute the
command would need to allow each element defined with that ATTRIBUTE to be
accessed.  This is where the word sequential comes from, it would only move
between elements with the same ACCESSKEY definition.  This is currently how
IE implements access key function.

If this is an important navigation scheme, then I think it needs a
checkpoint.  If it something nice it can stay buried in the compatibility
section.

Is this something important or not?

Jon
