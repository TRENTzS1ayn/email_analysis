So you are saying that we don't need to say much at all about the
funcationality of  how the user interface would support the use of
ACCESSKEY attribute.  Just say to implment the ACCESSKEY as per the HTML
specification?

JRG: It already does.

JRG: I think what we want to make sure is that people understand what it
means to implement the accesskey attribute.  There are two issues:
navigation and visibility.

Some may think just including the attribute in the document object model is
sufficient, others may wonder what to do with multiple definitions of the
same accesskey and not provide access to any element but the first element
of the collection of elements with the same accesskey. 

Do we want the user agent to do something to make elements with the
accesskey defined more visible.  Right now only the author can do that with
proper markup.  A recommendatino could be included to have user agents
render the element with the accesskey differently than other elements?
