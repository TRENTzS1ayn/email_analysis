I think that Alan Cantor's message shows how crucial it is that the
AccessKey be implemented in a way that makes sense to the user.

While the author can install markup to indicate the AccessKey, it should
also be possible for the user agent to indicate that the key exists.  User
Agents provide a default indication of links, which may be over-ridden by
the author with markup.  That default indication should include a default
indication of the existence of an AccessKey, which also may be overridden by
the author.  (It might also be overridden by the user, with a User Style
sheet.)

I don't think that we should specify what the markup should be, or what the
navigation procedure should be, since there probably isn't one, best method.
But there must be some way to reach multiple links with the same AccessKey
definition, and you must have some clue about what the definition is.

So you are saying that we don't need to say much at all about the
funcationality of  how the user interface would support the use of
ACCESSKEY attribute.  Just say to implment the ACCESSKEY as per the HTML
specification?

JRG: It already does.

JRG: I think what we want to make sure is that people understand what it
means to implement the accesskey attribute.  There are two issues:
navigation and visibility.

Some may think just including the attribute in the document object model is
sufficient, others may wonder what to do with multiple definitions of the
same accesskey and not provide access to any element but the first element
of the collection of elements with the same accesskey.

Do we want the user agent to do something to make elements with the
accesskey defined more visible.  Right now only the author can do that with
proper markup.  A recommendatino could be included to have user agents
render the element with the accesskey differently than other elements?
