Jon,

Here is a question about AccessKey behavior.  The theory of AccessKeys is
that you would be able to directly select a link by a keyboard command,
independent of the location of the focus.  Correct?

Now, suppose I am designing a page, and using AccessKeys for my links.  I
would want the user to be able to access all of the important links on the
page, wherever they were.  Since I can access the link directly, why would I
need to search for it?  Or navigate to it?  I just hit the AccessKey, and
I'm through the link.

Now, suppose I have a page with more important links that characters.  (This
is, I'll admit, bad design.)  Do I still have a way to know what pressing
Alt-A will do?  Presumably, I will pass through the next link from my
current position.  But if I don't know where the keys are located, I don't
know which of the ACCESSKEY=A links I'm before or after!  It seems to me
that this is a more complex issue that it at first appears.  How will the
user know what behavior they will get with any access key, and, if the link
navigation via Focus works correctly, are AccessKeys redundant?

So you just want the guidelines to say the the attibute ACCESSKEY is good
for accessibility in the current section 7 and I am assuming that you want
the features needed for accessible implementation be be in the techniques
document?

I think it would make it clearer to developers if they saw the access key
implementation information as part of other navigation commands.  If it is
only in the compatibility section, it will not have the weight or the
visibility of a checkpoint.

Jon
