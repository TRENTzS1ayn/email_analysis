Sorry I'm going through these in the reverse order, but there may be a
behavior there that would make my previous missive on ACCESSKEY make sense.

I had always assumed that activating an ACCESSKEY would activate the link.
But if activating an ACCESSKEY simply moves the focus to the "next" element
with that ACCESSKEY, and a separate keystroke (presumably ENTER) takes you
through the key, then you have a way of navigating links with the ACCESSKEY,
and a way of activating them directly.  An unfortunate side affect is that
passing through the link requires two keystrokes rather than one.

MN2:  I think we are getting hung up on semantics, what i was trying to
say is that I agreed with Charles, in that I don't believe we should have a
checkpoint "requiring sequential navigation to the ACCESSKEY", thats all.

MN2:  where ever you feel it best to reference is fine with me.
