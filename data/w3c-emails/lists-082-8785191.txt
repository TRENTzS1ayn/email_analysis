ACCESSKEY is not well defined functionally, but is available for a number
of different elements.
Microsoft already has an implementation of the ACCESSKEY attribute.   In
discussions on UA there was suggestions by Mark Novak, Charles
McCathieNevile and Jim Allan, that this was not a critical issue for
accessibility.  They have suggested that it only be mentioned in the HTML
compatibility section, with no further references in either the navigation
or orientation sections of the guidelines.  There can be discussion of
implementation issues in the techniques document on the issues from the IG,
but it would be informative only.  Developers would not be required to do
something a particular way.

 Do you disagree with the analysis of Mark, Charles and Jim analysis?

I will put it on our issues list for discussion and resolution.
