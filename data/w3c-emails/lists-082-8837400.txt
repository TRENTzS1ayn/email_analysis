I would like to propose that we accept the recommendations of the MathML
subgroup to:

1. Require full implementation of MathML
2. Require integration of MathML elements into the DOM

On the issue of navigation I propose:
Place navigation of mathematical equations in the techniques document under
the appropriate checkpoints (i.e. DOM navigation and sequential access to
elements)
