I would like to recommend the following to address math issues:

1. If a user agent or plug in renders mathematical equations it should use
mathml for the representation

2. Specify that XML document models are exposed to assistive technologies,
just like HTML model.  This would make MathML element available to
assistive technologies.

3. Integrated navigation od mathematical equations into the checkpoints on
access every element sequentially and navigating the DOM.

Please comment.
Jon
