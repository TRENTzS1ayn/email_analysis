Hi,

I have been away from the list since the middle of October, but now I am
back again. The work on mathml is very interesting, especially for blind
people and even more for institutions working with blind students in higher
education. Myquestion is if there is anybody who in the real world have
worked with or are working with a browser that can make mathml into speech
or braille, if so I would really like to know aboutit. Normally when we work
with the UA guidelines we know how it is to use UAs and the problems we
incounter, but for myself at least it is hard to discuss accessability in
mathml because I have never worked with a mathml UA if such a program ixists
at all.
