I believe that in the discussion of the WCAG there was mention that LaTeX
has existing support (conversion to sound and Braille) that MathML lacks at
this time.
So an image with LaTeX in the markup is a better solution right now than
MathML.

Did Chris Weaver have anything to say about current LaTeX support and
transition strategies?
