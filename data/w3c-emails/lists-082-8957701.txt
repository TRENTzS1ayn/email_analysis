Hello,

In light of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines [1] use
of different levels to describe conformance (Levels A, Double-A
and Triple-A), I think the UA GL should use the same terminology.

Today, the conformance statement only talks about Level A (all
Priority 1 checkpoints) for either desktop graphical user
agents OR assistive technologies that depend on them. 

Is there any reason not to describe the other levels?
Today we say in essence "You either conform to Level A or
not at all". We could allow user agents to conform
"even more" to Levels Double- and Triple-A.

 -Ian
