Hello,

In the Authoring Tools Working Group meeting today (minutes [1])
we discussed creating a W3C Note that would document
(by inclusion or reference) vendor/platform-specific accessibility
guidelines for applications. Charles McCathieNevile and I have
proposed to gather information from vendors and create a W3C
Note that could be referenced (as a source of Techniques) 
from both the User Agent and Authoring Tool Accessibility 
Guidelines. 

For UA, this relates directly to checkpoint 7.2.4 of [2], which reads:

      "Follow operating system conventions and accessibility 
       settings in user interface design, configuration 
      (including configuration profiles), product installation,
      and documentation."

After putting together a draft of the Note, Charles and I intend
to bring it to each of the AU and UA Working Groups for review.

Comments on this proposal are encouraged.

 - Ian

P.S. For a preview of what type of information would be included,
refer to Charles' emails (Ibm Guidelines[3], 
MS Guidelines [4]) to the AU list on this subject.
