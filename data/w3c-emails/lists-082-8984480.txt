material for my task
 Check guidelines for information about ToolTip control.

ToolTips (sometimes called popup descriptions)are the little popup windows
of additional information about an element. In IE and NC (Netscape
communicator) the ToolTips popup when the mouse pointer is over an image and
the ALT text is displayed in the ToolTip. In Opera the URL of a link  is
displayed in the ToolTip. ToolTips (by whatever name) are also provided in
the Window 95/98 and Mac operating systems. ToolTips and other popup
information (spawn windows) are distracting/disorienting to people with some
types of learning and attention related disabilities. I am currently
searching for how to control ToolTips.

I have found no information in the guidelines specifically regarding ToolTip
or control.  However, I think a checkpoint is needed under guideline 4.4

"Guideline 4.4 Ensure that users can disable features that might interfere
with accessibility

Users must be able to turn on and off support for features that may
interfere with accessibility. User agents are only expected to provide this
control for content that it recognizes."

4.4.15 Allow the user to turn on and off the rendering of "ToolTips"
