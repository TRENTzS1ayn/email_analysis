There is now software available that will provide an auditory
rendering of images and this can be done on the fly from the web
provided that the browser sends a construct to activate the software
when an image is downloaded.  The software currently employed to
handle the image to sound conversion in the form of a wav file from a
bmp is called the vOICe which some of you may have heard of.  Peter
meeger and I and others have veen discussing this on the ig list and
It was my thought that we could ask him to work with this if it is
felt to be viable?  This would have to be a user choice and would of
course not be renderable by something like lynx, possibly pwweb speak
and hpr as well, but could provide a level of functionality regarding
images that is currently lacking.  The user would also have to undergo
some training but we are working on that part of it to comprehend the
audio.
Thanks!
