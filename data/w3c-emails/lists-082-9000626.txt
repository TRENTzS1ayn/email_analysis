At the meeting on wednesday it was noted tht Chris Weaver had asked about the
Authoring Tools group and their approach to MathML and W3C specifications.

In the draft of May 6 - http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/WAI-AUTOOLS-19990506
checkpoint 2.1 (the first checkpoint) is "use applicable W3C specifications".

So where a w3c recommendation exists such as MathML it is a P2 requirement
that it be used rather than another method. Also, things like namespaces are
included in this, which will make life a lot easier. If User Agent does the
same, it will not only provide consistency which is not a bad thing, but
provide a general mechanism for dealing with a number of problems. For
example, the MathML one largely seems to be resolved - MathML, DOM,
namespaces, XHTML (especially modularised) allows the incoporation of MathML
and the required navigation information in a simple manner. (or so it seems
to me on a cursory glance)
