Hello,

I've gone through the WCAG checklist and tried to figure
out which ones are/are not/should be/should not be addressed
in the UAGL. The results are at [1]. It's pretty sketchy, so
all comments are welcome. There are a couple of proposals
embedded in it:

PROPOSALS:

1) Add a checkpoint that says that UAs should allow users to
   turn off flicker. This is not the same as blinking (already
   covered by 4.4.6 and 4.4.7 

2) Modify Guideline 7.1 to include these checkpoints: 
   a)  Implement W3C specifications when they are 
       available and appropriate for a task and
       implement the latest versions when supported. 
       Note. Some W3C specifications are
       cumulative (e.g., HTML 4.0, CSS, DOM). 

   b)  Implement accessibility features defined by supoprted 
       W3C Recommendations. [The techniques would provide 
       links to documents where these are defined.] 

   c)  Support deprecated features of W3C Recommendations. 

3) Allow users to configure UA support for preferred 
   language/list of languages. [Techniques: HTTP Content-Language
   and "lang" in HTML, "xml:lang" in HTML for document root]
