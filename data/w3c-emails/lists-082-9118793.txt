  PROPOSALS:
  
  2) Modify Guideline 7.1 to include these checkpoints: 
     a)  Implement W3C specifications when they are 
         available and appropriate for a task and
         implement the latest versions when supported. 
         Note. Some W3C specifications are
         cumulative (e.g., HTML 4.0, CSS, DOM). 

CMN:
I would remove the "when supported" qualifier - the implementation of them by
User Agents is probably the most intuitive definition of that.
