A request came up on the er-eg list to have configurable buttons on
browsers. This is really a UA issue so I'm forwarding it to you-all.

Personally, I think this feature would particularly help people with
learning disabilities, although, as with most accommodations, it would help
everyone. The most recent message as of this email is at

I copied here the thread so far

Subject: the back button and toolbars.


It would be most helpful if toolbars 'had to be' editable.
Personally I find many buttons do not get used.
Others I would group together.
macro buttons, could be great.

More specifically in an educational context it is helpful to be able to
isolate the aspect of  interest, from the background of the terrifying
unknown, and unknowable.

I imagine that amaya or another has this but again I am not addressing that
point, rather that all should perform.

Internet Explorer 5.0 has an interface to choose what buttons
appear, in what order etc.

Opera 3.5 also can do that but you'll have to edit the .ini file.
(check in tips and tricks of Opera's documentation)

Opera (at least 3.6) also allows to use your own drawings as
buttons.
