this is covered I believe in the guidelines but it might not be
specific enough but we have lots of self configureable stuff in
there.  also, I'm not exactly sure what he is getting at.  you can
already make your own icons for just about anything you want in
windows and if you edit the registry do all sorts of things like he
seems to want.
