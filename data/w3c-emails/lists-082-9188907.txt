I am not certain any more what checkpoints 7.2.2 and 7.2.6 are (since I
believe they are not the ones currently in the document). I assume that they
are to do with DOM, and perhaps navigation, but if there is to be a new Draft
soon (i.e in about the next week) I would like to defer my action item until
I can write in relation to that
