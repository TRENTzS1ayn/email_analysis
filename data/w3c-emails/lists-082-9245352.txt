Hello,

The UA Guidelines say the following:

   This document is organized according to 
   several principles that will improve the 
   design of any type of user agent...

However, some of our guidelines are not really principles
as stated, including:
 
                 7. Ensure that links are accessible 
                 8. Ensure that tables are accessible 
                 9. Ensure that forms are accessible 
                 10. Provide information about the document view 
                 11. Provide information about document structure 
                 12. Provide information about events 

Some of these guidelines took this form because it's easy to
organize along those HTML themes (links, tables, etc.). 

ISSUE: Should we only include real principles of design, or should
the definition "guideline" be enlarged to allow this type of
(convenient) organization?

 - Ian
