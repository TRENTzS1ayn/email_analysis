Hello,

Since I was out of the UAGL loop during the final 
phases of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
Recommendation, I have been catching up on email and minutes, 
and retracing a lot of the discussions, proposals,
and resolutions. I wrote the attached summary as a way to 
keep track of what's been going on. 

The only proposals in this summary have to do with
restructuring current content. There are no proposed
checkpoints or checkpoint changes. I may turn this
summary into some proposals once the WG has commented.
There are a few open questions in the summary.

Please let me know whether you think this indeed
sums up where we are,

 - Ian
