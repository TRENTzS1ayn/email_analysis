Ian, 
Thank you for your summary and proposals related to restructuring the 
guidelines.

Over the weekend I was thinking about some of Ian's ideas related to 
navigation techniques versus checkpoints. Here are some of my thoughts on 
what I think he is proposing. Let me know if these are the types of 
changes you were proposing.

Potential changes to current checkpoints: 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Current checkpoint: Sequential access to active elements 
Current checkpoint: Search for a link based on its text content 
Current checkpoint: Allow the user to select a link from a list

would be combined into something like:

New checkpoint: Allow user to navigate only to active elements

The new checkpoint would reference different types of techniques related to 
all the ways to navigate to active elements: sequential, direct and searching
---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Current checkpoint: Search for an element based on its text content 
Current checkpoint: Sequential access to all elements 
Current checkpoint: Search for content based on attribute value [metadata 
information) 
Current checkpoint: Search for the next element with the same attributes as 
the current element 
Current checkpoint: Allow the user to navigate the Document Object Model 

would be combined into a new checkpoint:

New checkpoint: Allow user to navigate to all elements

The technique for the new checkpoint would cover the different ways to 
navigate to a particular element.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Current checkpoint: Allow the user to move the focus to a frame from a list

New checkpoint: Allow user to navigate between frames

The technique for the new checkpoint would cover the different ways to 
navigate between frames
---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Current checkpoint: Allow the user to move to a header from a list

New checkpoint: Allow user to navigate to only headers

The technique for the new checkpoint would cover the different ways to 
navigate between headers: sequential, direct and searching
---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Current checkpoint: Allow the user to move the focus to the first control
of a form from a list

New checkpoint: Allow the user to navigate between forms
---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Current checkpoint: Allow the user to move the focus to a form control from 
a list
New checkpoint: Allow the user to navigate between form controls
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Current checkpoint: Allow the user to select a alternative content from a 
list of alternative content, P2, subgroup: DUA
New checkpoint: Allow the user to select alternative content
---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Current checkpoint: Allow the user to move the selection to a table from a
list
New checkpoint: Allow the user to navigate between tables
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
