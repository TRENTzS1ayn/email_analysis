There are actual guidelines for apple (as opposed to promotional material,
which is all I could find at the site listed) at

  Checkpoint 7.2.1
  Provide programatic access for dependent user agents to the user interface by
  using operating system and development language accessibility resources and
  conventions.
  
  Technique
  
  Most of the current assistive technology available to improve the access to
  computer based technologies for people with disabilities is designed to
  provide
  access to non-specific software applications with in an operating system.
  User
  agents rendering WWW content is just one type of application the assistive
  technology is providing access.  For software applications to be compatible
  with these types of assistive technologies they need to follow standard
  operating system conventions for accessibility and in the case of some
  types of
  operating systems use accessibility APIs to provide additional information to
  assistive technologies.  Operating systems with accessibility APIs include
  this
  functionality in standard controls and display rendering APIs.  User agents
  which use standard controls and rendering APIs will have a basic level of
  compatibility with existing assistive technologies.  The complexity of visual
  rendering of WWW content though often requires additional information about
  the
  content rendered which means making more information about the content
  available through the accessibility API.
  
  Current operating system accessible design guidelines:
  1.      Microsoft Windows (http://www.microsoft.com/enable/dev/)
  2.      Java (http://www.sun.com/access/ and
  http://www.austin.ibm.com/sns/snsjavag.htm)
  3.      Apple Macintosh (http://www.apple.com/education/k12/disability/)
  
  Current accessibility application programming interfaces:
  1. Active Accessibility  (http://www.microsoft.com/enable/msaa/)
  2. Java accessibility API (provide URL later)
  3. Java Swing Classes (provide URL later)
