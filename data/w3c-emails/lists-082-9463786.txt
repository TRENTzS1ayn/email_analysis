REFERENCE DOCUMENT:

I would offer that this scenario is covered by checkpoint
4.2.1 [Priority 1]:
              Ensure that all functionalities offered by 
              the user agent interface are available through all
              supported input devices. These include the installation 
              procedure, access to documentation,
              and software configuration. 

Activating a menu (be it in the document or in the tool) I think
is part of the user interface functionality.

I think your example illustrates one particular need well and
would be useful as an example.

I therefore propose that we don't add a checkpoint but that
we add the example to the document.
