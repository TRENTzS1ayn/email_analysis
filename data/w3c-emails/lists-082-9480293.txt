Hi Jon,

My summary was not a clear proposal because I hadn't finished
reflecting. Here are some more thoughts, though still incomplete. 

I would like to remove navigation from the semantics where possible,
and instead use checkpoints to identify the accessibility goal.
Treat navigation as a technique where possible, then introduce
a couple of navigation checkpoints to ensure compatibility.

Please note that we've already done this for table cells. Navigation
and lineary rendering were both considered techniques for the
real goal: access to the information of an individual cell. I think
we can use the same logic in other places to reduce the number
of navigation checkpoints.

Therefore....

ON AVAILABILITY OF CONTENT:

1) Make element content available to the user. Priority 1, Both.
  (Technique: use a viewport, allow different types of navigation.)

2) Make individual element content available to the user. Priority 1,
AT.
   (Technique: e.g., use selection/focus for identification 
    of the element, use the DOM.).

ON AVAILABILITY OF METADATA:

I'm not sure how detailed these checkpoints should be. I think
to be verifiable, the checkpoints should be specific:
"Make available the following metadata for links: number of link, etc."
I'm not entirely convinced of these checkpoints yet.

ON ACTIVATION OF ACTIVE ELEMENTS:

3) Allow the user to activate any
   active element -- links, form controls, elements with explicitly
   associated event handlers. Priority 1, both.
   (Technique: Navigate to elements, then activate. Or, activate
   through keyboard shortcuts, menu interface, etc.)

4) Allow device-independent/keyboard activation. Priority 1, Both.

5) Allow the user to turn on/off
   support for types of active elements (e.g., don't navigate
   elements with event handlers). Priority 2, Both.

ON NAVIGATION and SEARCHING


6) Allow the user to sequentially navigate selected element types.
   NOTE: This includes frames, tables, block elements, etc. P2

7) Allow the user to configure sets for sequential navigation. P2

8) Allow the user to navigate the document tree. P2
   (Technique: Use the DOM)

9) The user agent should allow the user to search for elements based
   on text content. P2

10) The user agent should allow the user to search for attributes
   based on their values. (Which ones?) P2
