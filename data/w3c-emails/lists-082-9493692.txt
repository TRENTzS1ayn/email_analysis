Hello,

In the 31 March document [1], checkpoint 4.1.1 reads:

       Ensure that the software may be installed in a 
       device-independent manner using any supported input 
       and output devices. 

And checkpoint 4.2.1 reads

       Ensure that all functionalities offered by the user 
       agent interface are available through all supported 
       input devices. These include the installation
       procedure, access to documentation, and software 
       configuration. 

The only reason 4.2.1 doesn't entirely subsume
4.1.1 is that 4.1.1 refers to output devices (covered
partially by 4.2.2). I propose deleting 4.1.1.

 - Ian
