At the checkpoint level, I think it is better to separate installation from
repeat use.  You can have a common guideline about all user actions
required to install, use and maintain... (check EITAAC report for sample
language and cite at least in draft) <http://trace.wisc.edu/docs/eitaac/>.

In the dominant pattern of commercial practice the installer is a separate
program, not one of the functions of the program.  This colors public
perceptions, and we should talk in publicly-understood concepts where we can.

This was a point where at least one vendor spokesperson drew a line: making
a distinction between repeat use where access support was obvious to them
and install transactions which are a "one time thing" and were perceived as
less meritorious of the necessary investment.  If we wish overcome that
perception, we will have to spell it out in two checks; not throw a blanket
over them.
