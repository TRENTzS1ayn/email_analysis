Hi Al,

One way to avoid the blanket is to enumerate the important
cases in the general checkpoint. Something like the 
following:

  Ensure that all functionalities offered by the user agent
  interface are available through all supported input devices.
  This includes installation, access to documentation, 
  and software configuration.

Then, to repeat the discussion in the rationale section and
techniques document.
