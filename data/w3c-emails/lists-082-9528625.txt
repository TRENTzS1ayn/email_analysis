In the following archived message you make reference to:

Under checkpoints for audio

- do you want to suggest that audio tracks be "text" searchable ?
- do you want to provide some audio feedback as to audio length, either
before it plays, or when paused, etc. ?

From: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999JanMar/0230.html

Could you clarify your comments?
Are you questioning intended funcationality or proposing additional
functionality?

Thanks,
Jon
