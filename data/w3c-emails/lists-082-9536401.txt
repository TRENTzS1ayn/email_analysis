Don't get me wrong.  For my own use, I distinctly prefer a short (Occam's
razor) list of powerful principles that generate all the necessary cases.
I spend a lot of my life railing againsf over-atomization that destroys the
gestalt.

But this document has to communicate to lots of people and not just me.
The popular definition of a checklist item is something you can or would
normally observe by itself.  On balance I think it is better to show the
unity in a theory section and split these particular two in the checklist
for the reasons I stated.  This is just an indication of my individual
opinion on something I regard as a "better" not a "showstopper" distinction.
