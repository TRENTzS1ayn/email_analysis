W3C staff and myself are planning on organizing a face-to-face meeting for
the User Agent working group for late September or Early October.  The
primary purpose of the meeting would be to respond to comments made by the
public and W3C members to public working drafts as a part of the
recommendation process.  More information on proposed dates and locations
will be released when it is available.
