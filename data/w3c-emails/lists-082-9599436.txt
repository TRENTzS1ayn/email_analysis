A. I think configuration is an important component at this point since we
do not have alot of good information on what will work in actual practice 

Checkpoint proposal: Allow the user to configure the types of document
changes they would like to be alerted too
Priority: 1 or 2
Compatibility: Dependent user agents

Potential configuration parameters:
1. Changes to text content in a document
2. Changes in position in a document
3. Changes in images in a document
4. Changes in color in a document
5. Changes in font face or style in a document
6. Changes in rendered text (changes in DISPLAY property of CSS) in document
7. Changes in form controls in the document
8. Changes in hidden information (probably not of any use though, since
information is not normally rendered) in the document

These items could be more roughly be broken down into the two categories
defined by CMN in his initial mail on this issue: content and style

B. Potential techniques/checkpoints related to informing the user about
changes

Checkpoint proposal: Inform the user of changes in the document due to
scripting events
Priority: 1
Compatibility: Dependent user agents

Techniques:
The user is informed of a change in the document and can access a list of
document changes.  Selecting an item from the list moves the users focus
(point-of-reguard) to the changed information.  The list is limited to the
changes the user identified in the configuration section on document
changes.  The list would indicate the type of change that occured in the
document, the element type that changed and some type of positional
information about the element.  The user would be able to return to the
oringal focus before searching for the document changes at any time.
 
C. Desktop Graphical User agents need to export information related to
changes in the document

This would be part of the section on compatibility.  We already have a
checkpoint for document change information being exported.
