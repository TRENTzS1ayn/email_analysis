I think that both these checkpoints also apply to desktop graphical user
agents.

I think the priority of configuration is 2

And I think that the further explanation about the types of configuration can
be happily left in the techniques.

  Checkpoint proposal: Allow the user to configure the types of document
  changes they would like to be alerted too
  Priority: 1 or 2
  Compatibility: Dependent user agents
  
  Potential configuration parameters:
  1. Changes to text content in a document
  2. Changes in position in a document
  3. Changes in images in a document
  4. Changes in color in a document
  5. Changes in font face or style in a document
  6. Changes in rendered text (changes in DISPLAY property of CSS) in document
  7. Changes in form controls in the document
  8. Changes in hidden information (probably not of any use though, since
  information is not normally rendered) in the document
  
  These items could be more roughly be broken down into the two categories
  defined by CMN in his initial mail on this issue: content and style
  
  B. Potential techniques/checkpoints related to informing the user about
  changes
  
  Checkpoint proposal: Inform the user of changes in the document due to
  scripting events
  Priority: 1
  Compatibility: Dependent user agents
  
  Techniques:
  The user is informed of a change in the document and can access a list of
  document changes.  Selecting an item from the list moves the users focus
  (point-of-reguard) to the changed information.  The list is limited to the
  changes the user identified in the configuration section on document
  changes.  The list would indicate the type of change that occured in the
  document, the element type that changed and some type of positional
  information about the element.  The user would be able to return to the
  oringal focus before searching for the document changes at any time.
   
  C. Desktop Graphical User agents need to export information related to
  changes in the document
  
  This would be part of the section on compatibility.  We already have a
  checkpoint for document change information being exported.
