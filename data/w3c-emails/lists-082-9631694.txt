Hello,

The 11 June UA guidelines [1] and techniques [2] documents
are now available. The lists of changes for the guidelines
[3] and for the techniques [4] since the 31 March draft
are available on the Web.

Both documents have been restructured significantly and
are aligned with the structure and formatting of the
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.

Please note that the guidelines document now comes with
a checklist of all checkpoints, organized by theme and
priority. The checklist is available in tabular or list format.

All comments on these drafts are welcome,

 - Ian
