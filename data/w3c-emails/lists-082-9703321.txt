Ian,

In the techniques document,
http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WAI-USERAGENT-TECHS/#tech-dom-compatible-api, in
Appendix 9: Loading assistive technologies for DOM access would you please
modify the paragraph below to correct the wording in the first sentence:

In Java 2, the existence of an "accessibility.properties" file causes the system
event queue to examine the file for assistive technologies required for loading.
         If the file contains a property called "assistive_technologies", it
will load all registered assistive technologies and start them on there own
thread in the
         Java Virtual Machine that is a single process. An example entry for
Java is as follows:


I believe this was actually commented on via the listserve.

Thanks,

Rich
