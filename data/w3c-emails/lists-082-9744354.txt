I think that we need in the introduction to this section information on the
following navigation concepts:

Sequential
Direct
Searching
Tree navigation

The introduction would summarize the adavantages and disadvantages for
different types of users and task situations.  This would high light the
major techniques that we have discussed during the past year without
necessarily burying the concepts in the techniques document or creating
long lists of checkpoints.

JRG: I think that the navigation of the document tree is just one
techniques and that it we should just have one checkpoint stating:
"Allow the user to navigate all elements in the document."
Priority: 1

The tree navigation would be described as one way to acheive this.

JRG: I think we say the text content of elements.  With scripting some text
content may not be rendered unless the user takes acton or turns off
support for style sheets.

JRG: I think this just a more advanced searching function.  The highest
priority would be attributes like: ALT, SUMMARY, TITLE.  When you get past
those your talking about a very small number of people who would understand
the concept of what they were doing.  

The only other major technique that I think fits here, is Denis Ansons
proposal of move to next thing like this.
