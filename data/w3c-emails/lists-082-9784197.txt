An introduction to those topics seems appropriate.

Would this be for dependent user agents only? I don't think
it's a Priority 1 since you can get at content through other means.
I think perhaps Priority 2. 

My question remains on this point: what accessibility barriers
fall by being able to navigate all elements? Or is this for the
techniques document?

I guess we should ask these questions:

 a) Are we talking about all user agents or dependent only?
 b) Should users be able to search text hidden by style sheets?
 c) Should users be able to search text in attribute values if not
    rendered?

I could see search functionalities changing depending on whether
the dependent UA or browser is offering the functionality. So if the
dependent UA has access to the DOM, it could allow searching, say
on attribute values. This would surprise me from a browser, however.

I had hoped that that proposal would be subsumed by the checkpoint
to allow users to configure search schemes.
