JRG: I think it is one of the biggest and most fundamental problems the
guidelines need to address, especially for visually impaired user to
navigate (and identify) elements with in a document.  Try using a screen
reader to read a document.  I think this should be a priority one for
dependent user agents.  Since this would include navigation to active
elements as well.

JRG: I think we should have three checkpoints related to searching and use
the techniques document to highlight all of the possible choices and
combinations related to functional searching.  

Checkpoint 1: Allow the user to search the text content of a document
(both, P1)

Checkpoint 2: Allow the user to search the alternative content of a
document (both, P2)

Checkpoint 3: Allow the user to search the element attributes of a document
(Dependent user agents only, P3)

In the TECHNIQUES document related to searching this would be the major
techniques that I would like to see (others could add to this list):
1. Text content of elements (maybe I don't understand the technical jargon
for this, but I mean the text between the element<element>XXX YYY
ZZZZ</element>.  The basic type of search does not need to include
searching attribute information.

2. Text associated with alternative content or summary information with is
mainly in attributes: TITLE, ALT, SUMMARY attributes

3. A function that could look at the current attributes and element and
look for the additional text content with the same type of element and
attribute.  The scope of samness could be configurable by the user.

4. Users could also configure what type of elements and attribute
information they would like to have as a part of the "standard" search.
