In general I agree with Ian's proposals for guideline 7.

I think we should only have a single checkpoint - provide a search function,
and allow that search function to be configurable in the relevant guideline
(I will post some stuff on this in a minute).

Checkpoint 7.8: I think this should be "allow the user to navigate the
document structure". To minimally satisfy it, make it possible to move from
element to element. Techniques "for further credit" are to allow the user to
navigate the formal tree structure of the document (in the case of an XML
document, or well-formed HTML document) or to navigate an "outline" or table
of contents, generated according to some other algorithm. For example in HTML
it is possible to generate a table of contents based on the headings, and
assuming that the levels H1 - H6 are used to specify the appropriate nesting
level.

(Yippee - my action item discharged at last!)

I agree with Jon about the necessity of structure navigation in some form.
Other strong cases are for people limited mobility, and screen magnification.

  JRG: I think it is one of the biggest and most fundamental problems the
  guidelines need to address, especially for visually impaired user to
  navigate (and identify) elements with in a document.  Try using a screen
  reader to read a document.  I think this should be a priority one for
  dependent user agents.  Since this would include navigation to active
  elements as well.

  JRG: I think we should have three checkpoints related to searching and use
  the techniques document to highlight all of the possible choices and
  combinations related to functional searching.  
  
  Checkpoint 1: Allow the user to search the text content of a document
  (both, P1)
  
  Checkpoint 2: Allow the user to search the alternative content of a
  document (both, P2)
  
  Checkpoint 3: Allow the user to search the element attributes of a document
  (Dependent user agents only, P3)
  
  In the TECHNIQUES document related to searching this would be the major
  techniques that I would like to see (others could add to this list):
  1. Text content of elements (maybe I don't understand the technical jargon
  for this, but I mean the text between the element<element>XXX YYY
  ZZZZ</element>.  The basic type of search does not need to include
  searching attribute information.
  
  2. Text associated with alternative content or summary information with is
  mainly in attributes: TITLE, ALT, SUMMARY attributes
  
  3. A function that could look at the current attributes and element and
  look for the additional text content with the same type of element and
  attribute.  The scope of samness could be configurable by the user.
  
  4. Users could also configure what type of elements and attribute
  information they would like to have as a part of the "standard" search.
