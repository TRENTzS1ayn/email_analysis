Write output to and take input from standard system APIs rather than direct
from hardware controls where possible. This will enable the I/O to be
redirected from or to assistive technology devices - for example, screen
readers and braille devices often redirect output (or copy it) to a serial
port, while many devices provide character input, or mimic mouse
functionality. The use of generic APIs makes this feasible in a way which
allows for interoperability of the assistive technology with a range of
applications.
