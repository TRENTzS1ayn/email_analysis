I propose allowing the user to configure the arrangement of user interface
controls (visually) as a P3. I agree with Ian that we should allow
configuration of navigation schemes in here, as a P2 or P3.
  
Guideline 5 seems to me all about configuration, as is guideline 2, and I am
not sure why they are separated. There is a lot of overlap - for example,
allowing the user to control the timing of time-dependent presentations, the
volume of audio, and the colours used for rendering.
