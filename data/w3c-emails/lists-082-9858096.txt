Checkpoint 3.1 - ensure that all product documentation confroms to WCAG. I
think that this should only require that all documentation is available in a
form which conforms. (A book can't conform. But it can still be good
documentation.)
   
checkpoints for guideline 3, about documentation, should be P1. having to
guess these things makes it effectively impossible. I think the checkpoints
3.3 and 3.4 only need to be a single checkpoint: "enable the user to find out
about the current configuration", since being able to configure the tool, if
it is an option, is covered under 3.2
