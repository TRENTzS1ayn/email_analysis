Guideline 4. The first 5 checkpoints cover medium-specific information, and
it would seem possible to combine them and the rendering of alternative
content. Given that a user will have access to alternative content, (which
has to be a P1 requirement), I'm not sure why there is a need to turn off
images, although I can understand the need to turn them on. (4.6, 4.7, and
4.8 deal with particular problems which should probably remain separated
out).
     
Again, I am not sure of the value of being able to urn off the rendering of
frames, although I can see value in being able to configure the way in which
they are rendered (It is possible to deal with them as separate windows in
some browsers, for example)
