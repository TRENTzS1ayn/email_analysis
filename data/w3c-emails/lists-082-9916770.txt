I think that we should highlight Keyboard accessibility as a requirement, but
as Jon says there are situations for which it is insufficient, and perhaps in
certain cases inappropriate. So I propose instead that following the first
guideline for device independence there be a guideline along the lines
prpopsed by Ian, but that the checkpoints be references to checkpoints in
other guidelines.

  >>At the 16 June WG teleconf [1], the WG expressed a
  >>desire to create a guideline specific to keyboard
  >>accessibility. The idea is that keyboard accessibility
  >>is important for ensuring compatibility between desktop
  >>browsers and dependent user agents. 
  >>
  >>The 11 June draft of the guidelines distributes keyboard-related
  >>checkpoints to guidelines about device-independence, documentation,
  >>configurability, and following system conventions. In this proposal,
  >>those checkpoints would be regrouped under a single guideline,
  >>with cross references back and forth from other guidelines.

  >>GUIDELINE: Ensure accessible keyboard access to user agent
  >>functionalities
  >>
  >>RATIONALE: Some text here about keyboard access
  >>           being important to ensure compatibility.
  >>
  >>CHECKPOINTS:
  >>
  >> - By default and without additional customization, ensure that
  >>all                   functionalities offered by the user agent are
  >>accessible using the 
  >>   keyboard. [Priority 1]  Cross-ref to device-independence guideline.
  >>
  >> - Allow the user to configure the keystrokes used to activate 
  >>   user agent functionalities. Wherever possible,
  >>   allow single key activation of functions. [Priority 2] 
  >>   Cross-ref to configuration guideline.
  >>
  >> - Indicate the keyboard access method to activate a user agent 
  >>   function using platform conventions. [Priority 2] Cross-ref
  >>   to guideline about system conventions. E.g., underlined letters
  >>   in menu entries.
  >>
  >> - Provide documentation on default keyboard commands and 
  >>   include with user agent documentation and/or user help 
  >>   system. [Priority 2] Cross-ref to guideline on documentation
  >>
  >> - Provide information to the user about the current keyboard 
  >>   configuration. [Priority 2] Cross-ref to guideline about
  >>documentation.
  >>
  >>PROPOSED ADDITIONAL CHECKPOINTS:
  >>
  >> - Provide default keyboard configuration for frequently performed
  >>   operations [Pri 3]
  >>
  >> - Others?
  >>
  >>There are two checkpoints that should probably remain in other
  >>guidelines since they are more general (and cross references
  >>used):
  >>
  >>a) 11.6 Follow operating system conventions and accessibility 
  >>        settings. In particular, follow conventions for user
  >>        interface design, default keyboard configuration, 
  >>        product installation, and documentation. [Priority 2] 
  >>
  >>b) PROPOSED: "Define default keyboard configurations consistently
  >>             between software versions. Changes should not be
  >>             made arbitrarily and should improve accessibility 
  >>             or consistency with platform conventions." 
  >>             Perhaps Priority 3?
  >>
  >>   This second checkpoint will appear in a separate proposal
  >>   for a guideline about software consistency. If the Working
  >>   Group elects to include a single checkpoint about keyboard
  >>   configuration consistency, that checkpoint would naturally
  >>   fall under the keyboard accessibility guideline.
  >>
  >>I do not think we need to have checkpoints specifically for
  >>keyboard navigation and activation of active elements. They
  >>can be listed in prose or as examples to emphasize their
  >>importance, but are covered by the first checkpoint.
