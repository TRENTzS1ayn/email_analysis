Guideline 6 seems a candidate for a few mergers:
     
6.1, 6.3 and 6.6 are "allow the user to access all content, including
alternative content.
     
6.7, 6.9 and 6.10 Where multiple alternatives exist, allow the user to choose
which are rendered.
     
6.8, 6.11, 6.12 Allow the user control over the snchronisation content where
one or more forms are time-dependent (eg video, audio)
     
I also suspect all this really belongs in guideline 4
