Hello,

The following proposal addresses software consistency. The
proposal fulfills an action item that I received at the
16 June teleconference. 

<begin proposal>

Proposed Guideline: Ensure consistent user agent behavior from
                    release to release.

Rationale: Consistency promotes orientation across software versions.

Changes to user agent behavior across releases of the 
user agent should not be arbitrary. Changes that
promote consistency (e.g., with operating system conventions
or other software) and accessibility are encouraged.

Proposed Checkpoints:

- Organize user interface controls in a manner
  consistent with previous versions and self-consistent with
  the user agent's conventions.

- Deliver software with a consistent default keyboard 
  configuration.

- Ensure that profiles may be reused (directly
  or through easy conversion) between versions.

- Clearly document significant changes to the software, notably
  those known to affect accessibility.

<end proposal>

The following ideas relate to consistency as well, and
I jot them down here as part of my consistency brain dump.

- Allow user to run in compatibility mode.

- Allow several versions of the software to run on the
  same machine (to allow testing).

- Don't convert user data (e.g., profiles) without
  the user's approval.

- Allow the user to uninstall the software and find
  the previous version intact.

 - Ian
