I don't think this is about being able to make a selection - that is covered
in the guideline on input-device independence. I think the idea of the
checkpoint is that a user can can access all the content of a given element.

In most cases the strict technical meaning of element content in XML and HTML
is the same as the broader natural languages meaning. There are cases where
this isn't so - for example, the value of the alt attribute can be
understoood to be part of the content of the element in natural language
terms, although it is not in the technical sense.

We want something like ensuring that the user can make all the
information provided for an element which is intended to be human-readable be
rendered. (for example there is not much necessity to render the width of a
frame, but it should be possible to get access to a title.

In addition, there are complex elements like object which can have several
different pieces of renderable information which is intended to be
human-readable.

I hope that someone can come up with some simpler wording which conveys the
idea.

  Hi Ian,
  
  All of my comments appear at the top of this message.  Now that I am trying to
  match up the checkpoints with users and technology, I too am a bit confused
  by 
  checkpoint 7.2. 
  
  7.2 For dependent user agents. Ensure that the user has access to the content
  of an element selected by the user.???? [Priority 1]
  
  Is providing "access to the content of an element" different than allowing the
  user to select the content of an element? Is this related to the current
  problem that keyboard users face when they want to select an element (e.g.
  text) with the keyboard. Most, if not all, mainstream user agents only allow
  selection of a portion of a page with a pointing device.  If so, why is this
  only for dependent user agents? Should the checkpoint be something like  
  "Ensure that the user has can select  the content of an element using any
  input
  device."  Can someone select and element and still not have "access" to it?
  
  Thanks,
  Kitch
