JRG: Natural language means that if the user agent can identify the
langauge of
the element content (primarily markup of the element) that the user agent
should render through speech, visual or braille that appropriate language.  It
seems to me that this should apply to all user agents, I am not sure why it is
just for dependent user agents.

The document outline feature was thought most important for accessibility and
could be given a higher priority for dependent user agents.

JRG: 12. Observe system conventions and standard interfaces is the place fo
desktop graphical user agents to expose information that is needed by depedent
user agents to full fill a checkpopint.

JRG: If nothing is said then they are for both.  If one or the other is
mentioned it is for the one mentioned.
