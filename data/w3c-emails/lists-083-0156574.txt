Subject:  IMPORTANT: Need techniques for User Agent Accessibility Guidelines





Hello,

We are nearing "last call" for the User Agent Guidelines.
A Working Group issues a last call for a document that it
considers done (or close to done). Last call involves
review by other working groups (and possibly requests
for implementation experience, for example). After last call,
a document may become a Proposed Recommendation, then a
Recommendation (I'm skipping the details of the W3C Process,
but people may consult [1] for more information).

[1] http:/www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/

In order for the User Agent Guidelines to enter last call,
we need to fill out the Techniques Document. Note that the
Techniques Document is not on the track to Recommendation
(like its cousin the Techniques Document for WCAG 1.0,
it is expected to end up being a W3C Note). However,
a strong Techniques Document will indicate the stability
of the Guidelines document in at least two ways:

1) It will indicate that we have considered the implications
   of each checkpoint on implementations. Gaps in the techniques
   document will suggest that some checkpoints may not
   be sufficiently cooked.

2) It will show that we have found a balance between the
   "checkpoint" level and the "technique" level. At times,
   we debate whether a requirement should be represented by
   a checkpoint or a technique. If the techniques document
   has been developed, this should indicate that we are
   comfortable with the distribution of requirements.

Working Group participants are encouraged to review the Techniques
Document and identify portions that they would like to
develop (in outline form, with prose, or technical details, etc.).
If possible, ask developers to contribute ideas that will
help us complete this document.


Thank you,

 - Ian
