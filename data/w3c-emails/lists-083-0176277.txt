sounds fine to me. As I understand it, order is not significant, but people
will probably read something into it anyway.

  Hello,
  
  I received an action item to review the order of the guidelines
  and propose a new order based on importance. Here are  some
  of the criteria I used for sorting:
  
    i) Number of high priority checkpoints in the guideline
   ii) Semantic grouping of related guidelines
  iii) Rough division in two groups:
          a) Reduce inaccessibility
          b) Promote accessibility
       Perhaps the (a) group is more important than the (b) group. 
       Note that this is only a rough notion.
  
  Here's the proposal:
  
  1) Support input and output device-independence 
    [All priority 1 checkpoints]
  
  2) Ensure keyboard access to user agent functionalities 
    [This one is related to device-independence and so the first two
  should
     be close.]
  
  3) Ensure user access to document content 
    [This one might follow the next two, but seems very
     important since it's about availability of content.]
  
  4) Allow the user to turn off features that may reduce accessibility 
    [Lots of Priority 1, but this is because the ideas are finely
     grained.]
  
  5) Ensure user control over document styles 
    [The previous two should be close]
  
  6) Observe system conventions and standard interfaces 
  
  7) Support applicable W3C technologies and guidelines 
    [Should be close to previous one]
  
  8) Provide navigation mechanisms 
  
  9) Help orient the user 
    [The previous two should be close]
  
  10) Notify the user of document and view changes 
  
  11) Allow the user to configure the user agent 
  
  12) Provide accessible product documentation and help 
     [Still important, but someone has to be number twelve!]
