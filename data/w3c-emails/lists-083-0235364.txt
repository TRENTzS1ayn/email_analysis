I think there should be some slight rewording:

8.5 allow the user to search for renderable content

and I am not sure if it is a P1 or not so lone as the ability to find it
manually by reading the document is already provided elsewhere.

8.4 Allow the user to navigate among only the active elements in the document

If it is already possible to navigate each element individually, and know
what type of element it is (or at least whether it is an active type of
element) then I think this is a P2 requirement. It seems to be well
established that it is a P2 requirement for blind users and for people with
limited mobility (which could go into a user impact matrix)

  Just to quote them from the 9 August draft [1]:
  
  8.4 Allow the user to navigate among all active elements
      in the document. [Priority 2] 
  
  8.5 Allow the user to search for rendered text content, 
      including alternative text content. [Priority 2]
