Proposed change to checkpoint 6.2 (from [1]):

6.2 Allow the user to control font size. [Priority 1] 

In the SYMM Working Group meeting I attended a couple of weeks
ago one of the WG participants asked whether checkpoint 6.2 could
be satisfied via a zoom function. I believe it can be,
and I would like to propose changing checkpoint 6.2 to read:

   Allow the user to control the rendered size of text. [Priority 1]
       For example, by allowing the user to change the font
       size or to magnify text.
