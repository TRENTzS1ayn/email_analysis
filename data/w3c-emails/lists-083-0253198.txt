I would include the technique in the techniques section as a general
principle. But I have no problem with the proposal - I think the question is
largely editorial.

  Proposed change to checkpoint 6.2 (from [1]):
  
  6.2 Allow the user to control font size. [Priority 1] 
  
  In the SYMM Working Group meeting I attended a couple of weeks
  ago one of the WG participants asked whether checkpoint 6.2 could
  be satisfied via a zoom function. I believe it can be,
  and I would like to propose changing checkpoint 6.2 to read:
  
     Allow the user to control the rendered size of text. [Priority 1]
         For example, by allowing the user to change the font
         size or to magnify text.
