For what it's worth, except for links to stylesheets, which Lynx knows about
but doesn't use, it shows up things specified with link as a link.

  Let me hasten to add that I am not against _using_ LINK to point to these
  points.  What I am concerned about is _relying on_ LINK to make sure the
  user has a clear and convenient path to the meat of the page.
  
  I wouldn't be quite so pessimistic as what you said about the future of the
  LINK functionality.  It is too soon to know how this will shake out in
  practice, but the functional capabilities for X-link appear to make apt
  expression of 'secondary' or informative and cross relationships easier to
  express and to roll up into authoring methods.
  
  I think we are stuck with "what you don't see is what you don't get" until
  authors  view what they are doing from multiple views as they write/paste.
  At least search engines have them using META.
