In general the guidelines seem to work well for the design of Amaya. I have
included individual commetns through the text on how each checkpoint seemed
when trying to determine if it was satisifed - there were some that didn't
seem to work for me. But then I spent about three quarters of an hour on it -
if a developer expected to do a full check in that tmie I would imagine they
were not giving the task their fullest attention, or they had already done
everything.

Anyway, I thought I would refrain from summarising my comments until a few
more people had done the exercise, in order to let them do it from as clean
a slate as possible.

  Were there checkpoints that were ambigious or difficult to interpret for
  Amaya features?
