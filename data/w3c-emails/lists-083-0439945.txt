Magnification is less desirable than page relayout, since the user needs to
now horizontally scroll to read information.  It is an extra step,
resulting in increased task performance time and in some cases missed
information if scrolling is not done to the completion of a line (i.e. the
user doesn't know to scroll or doesn't know how to use the scroll controls).
