For group members to understand the difficulties encountered by outsiders trying
to determine compliance, please evaluate with "yes , no, n/a." Of course
comments are good! Answers like "mostly" just not don't fly. If you want to
write ? you know there is a problem with the checkpoint. "Not being a developer"
is not relevant, because non-developers of products will be trying to make these
evaluations.
