Oh. I figured mostly meant no, but then provided some idea of how far away
you might be. I'll re-check my comments and try to make it clear. (this is
the problem with a table - I built all my data in one, which I can publish if

  For group members to understand the difficulties encountered by outsiders trying
  to determine compliance, please evaluate with "yes , no, n/a." Of course
  comments are good! Answers like "mostly" just not don't fly. If you want to
  write ? you know there is a problem with the checkpoint. "Not being a developer"
  is not relevant, because non-developers of products will be trying to make these
  evaluations.
