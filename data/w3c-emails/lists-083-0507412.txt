Hmmm. I don't think longdesc is implemented in the 2.1 relase *sigh*.
Anything that is in an attribute is available to the user through the
structure view.

How it works:
I place the cursor at the element I am interested in, open/swap to the
structure view, and it gives me a list of attributes and values. Alternative
technique 1, select the element (press escape in linux), then the attributes
are all available from the attributes menu. For alt, I can also look at the
alternate view, which renders alt text instead of images - a lynx-like view.

All the views are synchronised for navigation (and for editing).

  Charles,
  
  Can you  please elaborate on how you decided that Amaya meets checkpoint 7.2.
  Does Amaya provide access to alt text, titles, long desc and all other "human
  readable" content?
  
  Thanks,
  Kitch
