Hmm. I do it in emacs, which means that I have to explicitly look to remember
what is there - keeping more than one thing running at a time is not visually
viable (although I guess it would work if you didn't care what it looks lke -
I remember when Jason and I would work together his speech synthesiser was
always reading from the bottom of the page for another page, so we were
permanentyl a page out of sync. It meant we had to concrentrate pretty hard
to figure out what we were working on. (At Jason's working speech rate I
mights we well be deaf...)

If I get stuck in a window-opening frenzy I go behind the scenes and kill the
process - I can't manage it visually.

Having a lot of things open is a hassle for keeping up - it is probably a big
hassle for people with cognitive disabilities.

Hmmm.

So I think I'm close to agreeing that the user needs to be able to say "no,
don't open a new window. Does this mean "force the new window content into
this window instead"? Or "forget it"? which is what happens in lynx when I am
reading a page written by some clown who thinks
javascript:popout_window('some_uri') is a URI. (Should we specify an answer
to that question at all?)

  Living with a littered desktop is easy in a GUI world.  I do it in hardcopy
