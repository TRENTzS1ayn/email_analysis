I think that the ideal answer is that the structure for indexing currently
open processes is part of the desktop, not the kernel.  Then the user has a
prayer of recalling how it works.  Emacs and screen are close what one
would do in speech; I have not read Raman's book to see how much he
develops this topic.

One option in the above scenario is "pop it on the stack" a_la what has
been considered in SMIL: current process suspends and resumes when added
process terminates, all if the user OKs.
