What is the difference between checkpoint 11.1 and 11.2, which are both under
the guideline "User agents should support applicable W3C technologies and in
particular the accessibility features defined for the technology."  


11.1 Implement the accessibility features defined for supported technologies.
[Priority 1] 

 11.2 Support appropriate W3C Recommendations. [Priority 2] For instance, for
document markup, support HTML and XML; for style sheets, support CSS; for
mathematics, support MathML; for multimedia, support SMIL, etc. 


Thanks,
Kitch
