You can implement the accesibility features of HTML 4.0 without implementing
the entire specification, or without. More to the point, while PDF is not a
W3C Recommendation, a user agent which renders PDF documents should support
all the accessibility features of PDF.

  What is the difference between checkpoint 11.1 and 11.2, which are both under
  the guideline "User agents should support applicable W3C technologies and in
  particular the accessibility features defined for the technology."  
  
  
  11.1 Implement the accessibility features defined for supported technologies.
  [Priority 1] 
  
   11.2 Support appropriate W3C Recommendations. [Priority 2] For instance, for
  document markup, support HTML and XML; for style sheets, support CSS; for
  mathematics, support MathML; for multimedia, support SMIL, etc. 
  
  
  Thanks,
