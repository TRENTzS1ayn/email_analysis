So checkpoint 11.1 covers your PDF example as well as the accessibility
features of HTML, CSS, and all other W3C or non-W3C technologies. 

And checkpoint 11.2 covers the remaining features of HTML, CSS and other W3C
technologies that are not specifically for accessibility but may be helpful to
people with disabilities. 

I think the word "appropriate" in 11.2 may be confusing if accessibility
features of W3C technologies are covered under checkpoint 11.1

just checking,
