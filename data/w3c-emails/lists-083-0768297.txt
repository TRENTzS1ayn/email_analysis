Al asked: Did I hear there is a screen reader already out there that has
implemented some sort of skip-navigation heuristic algorithm?

Window Eyes has skip to next non-active element. That often helps, but not when
authors put normal "[", "]" and "|" around links! To my knowledge that is the
only skip navigation technque in the screen reader world.
