I think it's possible for a document
to conform to WCAG and not be accessible. Even if WCAG 
were perfect (which it's not), it would still be possible. 
But if WCAG is good, it will be unlikely.

As to your proposal below, I think we don't need to add the
word "accessible". We could say "Ensure that you have
accessible electronic documentation." But to the question
"How do you know it's accessible?" the best we can answer
today with any supporting material is "If it conforms to WCAG."
So we can jump straight to "Ensure you have documentation
that conforms to WCAG."
