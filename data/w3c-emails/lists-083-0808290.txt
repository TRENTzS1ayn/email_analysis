Here's another attempt at revised checkpoint 10.3 text:

  Allow the user to selectively turn on and off notification
  of common types of document and view changes.

[I hate to split the infinitive with the adverb, but it fits
 best between "to" and "turn"]

Then after the checkpoint:

  For example, to choose to be notified (or not) that a
  script has been executed, that a new window has been opened,
  that a pulldown menu has been opened, that a new frame
  has received focus, etc.

The techniques would list important changes, and I invite people
to contribute changes that they consider most important.
