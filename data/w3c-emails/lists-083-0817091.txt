I'm cc'ing H&kon on this message.

The change already appears in the 9 August draft; there is now mention
of both HTML accesskey and tabindex.

I don't believe we should have a checkpoint specific to style sheets,
even though they would enable user agents to satisfy many of the
checkpoints. In fact, we went from a checkpoint about style sheets
to one more generally about supporting W3C specs.

On the other hand, a note in the Techniques (or even the Guidelines)
about how an implementation of CSS1 (or CSS2) would satisfy
many checkpoints (and which ones) would be helpful.

Hakon, do you still have a list of checkpoints you feel would be
satisfied? Can you make that available to the WG?

You might want to look at the latest version [2] from 9 August.

I will include that in the Techniques document, but I'm not sure
how it addresses the checkpoint.

How about "audio captions" with a link to the definition of "caption".

This is being debated now on the list. I proposed deleting
this checkpoint [3] in favor of other solutions.

Please explain this, I'm not sure I understand.

That's mentioned in the Techniques. Actually, by reference
since the Techniques point to the CSS accessibility Features
Note [4], which says to implement the CSS2 !important semantics

Hakon, please let us know when you can join the teleconference
and we will schedule a review of this Guidelien and invite
other developers.

Thank you for the comments Hakon and Charles,
