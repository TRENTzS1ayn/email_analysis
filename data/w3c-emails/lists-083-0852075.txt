Sure, I can do it in Netscape Navigator (4.x) in Linux. In my
"app-defaults" file for Navigator, I say:

*selectForeground*selectForeground:     #000000
*selectBackground:                      #D15FEE

This gives me a purplish selection background color that works for
both gray and white backgrounds. In fact, that's why I changed
the colors for myself from the defaults: the default selection
color does not render well against white on my laptop's LCD screen.

There are other ways that the user may control 
focus highlighting by using CSS2 dynamic outlines [1].

In my particular case, since highlighting is done by
color, I need to ensure adequate color contrast to meet
my needs. If highlight were done using another technique,
I might not need as much control.
