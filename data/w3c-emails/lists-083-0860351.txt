I agree.

I think it should still be priority one. In particular if I am
using the selection to identify content for rendering but I cannot
tell where the selection is, I cannot access the content (refer to
checkpoint 7.2).

Here's a proposal for softening the wording from "control" to
"adjust":

 Old:  Allow the user to control selection 
       highlighting (e.g., foreground and background color).

 New: Allow the user to adjust selection highlighting.

  Note: 
      For example, if colors are used to distinguish
      the selection from the background, allow the user
      to set preferred highlight colors. If the selection
      is being rendered as audio, allow the user to 
      adjust the audio presentation of the selection.
      

ALSO:

 Proposed: We have combined selection and focus in other checkpoints.
   I propose we merge checkpoints 6.5 and 6.6 as numbered in [1].
