Perhaps this is merely a question of language then: highlight is
supposed to mean "a mechanism used to distinguish A from B." It
may be a dotted box, reverse video, underlining, marching red ants,
or a higher-pitched voice. How is highlighting done by
braille displays?

It looks like we should define the term highlight in the guidelines.
Or, use a better term. Can you suggest one?
