I'll fix it.

I'll add one.

Indeed, the whole idea of "return to the view" implies a history.
So, I propose the following simplification (I hope simplification):

   For user agents that offer history mechanisms, when the user
   returns to a previous view, restore the point of regard in the
   viewport.

And this note:

   For example, when users navigate "back" and "forth" 
   among views, for each view they should find the
   viewport position where they left it.

So change the note to:

   For example, when users navigate "back" and "forth" 
   among views, for each view they should find the
   viewport position where they left it.

Let me know if this helps.
