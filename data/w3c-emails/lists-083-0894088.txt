to boil this down, I want the browser to behave like an edit screen so
I can make notes in, copy from, and move through all the content in a
<device independant mannor> I want this because I may need to delete
something that is destroying my ability to navigate or add a note...
this is what I think this checkpoint is getting at, I want, chars,
words, sentences, paras and pages The way things are done now in most
browsers, the web feels like something from outer space.  take the
approach that some email clients take with messages that are being
read.  you can add notes, delete portions and so on and save the
results for later.
or forward them or reply without ever having gon to a compose screen.
Sorry, I didn't intend for this to be so long but it would if made a
priority 1 item make things much more accessible and put all on a high
par.
