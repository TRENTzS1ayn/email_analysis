I agree that this is the goal. However, if we ask how this is ensured,
the UA has to do something. Hence we immediately fall back on "The
user agent has to provide a mechanism..." The goal is user access,
but where possible, we're trying to tell UA developers what to do
to achieve that goal.

There  is only one checkpoint with the verb "ensure" in it
("ensure that all functionalities are accessible through the keyboard").
"Ensure" is used in guideline text, where the goal can be emphasized
more than the means.

This is already covered explicitly in checkpoint 12.2:

   Provide programmatic read and write access to user 
   agent functionalities and user interface controls 
  (including selection and focus) by using operating
   system and development language accessibility 
   resources and conventions.

That works for me (as long as the color can be set by the user).
