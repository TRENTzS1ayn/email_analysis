I'm  sending this reply to the UAGL list.

That is, I believe, inevitable. The challenge for the Working Group
is to convey a requirement that is precise enough to be understood
and verifiable, but flexible enough to allow developer interpretation
and alternative techniques that still allow one to satisfy the
requirement.

These and other questions might be the basis of a FAQ for the
UA GL when they approach Recommendation.

Right, and we should rank them, even if we don't use a formal
system for doing so.

Today, our only options for conformance to a checkpoint
are "yes", "no", "n/a". I don't know whether we need more levels:
"yes, significantly"; "yes, a little", etc. I think that we cannot
eliminate all subjectivity. In the end, people should be able
to say "Yes, but not very much" and still count that as a Yes.

However, if there are checkpoints where you feel that conformance
is easy but no accessibility issues are addressed, please let us know.

Testing, review, and experience with the guidelines will show what
is important, superfluous, under-specified, and misunderstood. 
In part, these reviews are bringing weaknesses and unclear points
to light and thus are invaluable before we go to Recommendation.

No. The goal of the current conformance statement was to allow a piece
of software to conform without depending on another piece of software.

Which checkpoints do you think suggest that software in tandem
might conform but not individually?

Already received [1]. I have not reviewed the report yet, but I'll
respond to it on the list.

Thank you Cathy,
