I don't agree. What's renderable? Text in comments? Text
hidden by style sheets? Attribute values - if so which
ones in XML?

My browser doesn't let me search for what I don't know is there.
A browser could offer another search mechanism for say, attributes
alone that aren't rendered, but we opted not to include
attribute-specific search checkpoints.

I think according to the definition of Priority 1, this one
doesn't qualify. Information is available, even if it's not convenient.
So in that sense it's priority 2.

I see your point, although I would propose "just among" instead.
