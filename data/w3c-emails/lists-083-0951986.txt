I think you're right and it should be for all user agents.

BACKGROUND: We have mostly been thinking about how speech
and braille devices can switch dictionaries automatically
when there's a marked up change in language.

However, the checkpoint applies to graphical desktop browsers
that support HTML as well. From the HTML 4.0 spec, section 8.2 [1]:

In other words, user agents are supposed to handle bidi
text correctly (although they may not have a font handy
to display the text). 

Furthermore, HTML user agents are meant to support "lang", 
presumably on screen as well as on other devices. From
HTML 4.0, section 8.1 [2]:

Presumably, this would involve choosing a suitable glyph
for rendering a gamma.
