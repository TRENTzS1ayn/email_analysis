Ian, Point of information. Below you said: quote We have mostly been thinking
about how speech and braille devices can switch dictionaries automatically when
there's a marked up change in language. endquote. Which braille and speech
devices do this?

I continue to contend that this is not a priority 1 accessibility issue. For
example, though I cannot understand Japanese, I can understand English when it
is spoken by a Japanese tts engine - with difficulty. The same is true for a
Japanese speaker; in fact it is probably easier fro them to understand the
poorly pronounced English. Though I don't think anybody is doing it, I suspect a
similar statement can be made for braille.

I think you're right and it should be for all user agents.

BACKGROUND: We have mostly been thinking about how speech
and braille devices can switch dictionaries automatically
when there's a marked up change in language.

However, the checkpoint applies to graphical desktop browsers
that support HTML as well. From the HTML 4.0 spec, section 8.2 [1]:

   > If a document contains right-to-left characters,
   > and if the user agent displays these characters,

In other words, user agents are supposed to handle bidi
text correctly (although they may not have a font handy
to display the text).

Furthermore, HTML user agents are meant to support "lang",
presumably on screen as well as on other devices. From
HTML 4.0, section 8.1 [2]:

Presumably, this would involve choosing a suitable glyph
for rendering a gamma.
