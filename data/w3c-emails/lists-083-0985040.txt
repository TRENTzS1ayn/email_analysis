I do want to control rendering of the focus rectangle if it's
not accessible. For example, I may not be able to see a thin
rectangle but I could see a thicker rectangle (e.g., line width
5pt rather than 1pt). 

We can reduce the scope to colors, but I don't think that
will cover all the cases.

Gak, unfortunately I don't know how to do that.
