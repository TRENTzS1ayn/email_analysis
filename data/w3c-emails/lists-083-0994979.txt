I looked for information about this in the GL list and
found you and Jason White addressing the same issues in April ([1],
[2]).

[1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/1999AprJun/0112.html

This is where the background information comes from. But I confess,
I don't know which braille and speech devices do this. Perhaps
Jason, or Gregory, or someone more familiar with the technology
can answer this.

I'll add this to the issues list.
