Because this is an undo burden on application developers. There is a great
number of requirements in our user agent guidelines. My concern is that if
we place an unrealistic burden on developers that we have difficulty
gaining compliance. Also, if we are too demanding then we will be ignored.
I would prefer to have this first round of User Agent guidelines accepted
and implemented ASAP and to have the developers feel good about having done
it.

If nobody has done this particular requirement at all there is obviously a
reason for not doing it. My guess is that it was too difficult to implement
and that the payback was inadequate.

i'm unclear why we should wait for a reference implementation
and i'd also vote to leave the priority as is (e.g. P1)
