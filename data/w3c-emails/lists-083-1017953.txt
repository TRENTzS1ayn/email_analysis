I wold have thought that whatever totoal solution you used was what covered
the claim. For example "MyBrowser, and Theirbrowser, and ThisScreenReader,
and ThatScreenReader, and TheOtherBrailleDevice, as a collection of tools"
conform at level ....

(Assuming that none of the tools comply by themselves. To take a more
concrete example, I believe that Jaws for Windows will produce different
compliance levels when used with different pieces of software).

  No. The goal of the current conformance statement was to allow a piece
  of software to conform without depending on another piece of software.
  
  Which checkpoints do you think suggest that software in tandem
  might conform but not individually?
