picking up on Gregory's thread.  I avoided the install pitfall by installing
the whole thing.  The smart download went smoothly and the install was done
with little prompting and was successful first time out.  The software out
of the box however is not screen reader friendly.  I had to use mousing
techniques to get anywhere and even then, it was touch and go.  I am going
to try doing some adapting of the screen reader to see if anything can be
cleared up at this level but I have my doubts.  Also, there does not seem to
be a way to uninstall the thing.
