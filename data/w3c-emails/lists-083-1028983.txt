From the 9 August draft [1]:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  In order to conform as a graphical desktop browser, 
  the user agent must satisfy all the checkpoints (for a
  chosen conformance level) that apply to graphical desktop 
  browsers and do so natively. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

That's the only way to conform as a desktop graphical browser 
(according to the spec). The same applies to dependent UAs.

In January we considered this (refer to Option 3 of [1]):

<BLOCKQUOTE>
       b.ii) UAs must also satisfy the applicable Priority 1 
             checkpoints natively or be able to demonstrate
             that, in conjunction with readily available 
             products, the checkpoints are satisfied. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

The Working Group did not elect to pursue this option.
