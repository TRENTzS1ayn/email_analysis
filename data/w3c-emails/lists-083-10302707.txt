I would just like to thank all the working group members who participated
in the FTF meeting this week.  The group processed approximately 70 issues
and came to resolution on all but 5 or 6.  

I would just like to remind ALL the working group members of the importance
of your continued participation during proposed recommendation.  We are
fine tuning the document and resolving the remaining outstanding issues.
The document really benefits from everyone's comments and the more comments
we have typically the more precisely and clearly we define the requirements
for accessibility.   Basically I want to say is your participation is a
critical as ever!

Hope to hear you on the call tommorrow.
