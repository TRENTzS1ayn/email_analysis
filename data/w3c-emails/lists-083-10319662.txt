This message is in response to a action item I took at the FTF meeting at
RFBD.  I still need to do 5-11.  The working group felt it was useful to the
document and developers to have minimal requirements for each of the
checkpoints for WIMP based grapical user interfaces.  I propose the following
minimal specifications and ask people to coment or make counter proposals.

1.1 Ensure that every functionality available through the user interface  is
also available through every input device API 
supported by the user agent. Excluded from this requirement are functionalities
that are part of the input device API itself (e.g., text input for the keyboard
API, pointer motion for the pointer API, etc.) [Priority 1] 

Minimum functionality required for WIMP (Windows, Icons, Menu, Pointer) based
environment for all of the following options:

1. Menus: Users select command options from the menus using either only the
keyboard or the pointer; or all of the functions located in the menus have a
keybord short cut for activation.

2. Dialog boxes: User is able to move the application focus to every control in
a dialog box using only the keyboard or only the mouse.

3. User interface controls (buttons, checkboxes, radio buttons, text edit
conrols, list boxes...): User is able to change the state of the user
interfaces controls using only the keyboard or only the mouse.  The only
exception is when a control accepts text as an input. In this case a mouse
pointer is not required to generate text for the control.  It is sufficent for
the text input for a text control to come only from the keyboard API. 
Assistive tecnologies may provide an on-screen keyboard to generate text from
the use of the pointer for some users in this case.

4. Window positioning and sizing controls: User is able to use only the
keyboard or only the pointer to change the size and position of the 

5. Toolbars: User is able to select command options from a toolbar using only
the keyboard or only the pointer; or all the command options on the toolbard
are available through other keyboard commands

6. Selecting content in a viewport (a common use of selection is for copying
content to another application)

7. Drag and drop operations: The user is ablet accomplish the same task using
only keyboard commands.
7.a Navigate and select the source object 
7.b Navigate and select the target object
7.c User invokes "drop" functionality of the source object to the target object

Note: It is not sufficient to claim that built-in accessibility features for
pointer emulation functionality (i.e. mouse keys ) can be used to provide
keyboard access, since mouse keys cannot identify to the user the source and
target objects of the intended functions

==========================================================

1.2 Use the standard input and output device APIs of the operating system.
[Priority 1] 

Minimum functionality required for WIMP (Windows, Icons, Menu, Pointer) based
environment for all of the following options:

In general, the highest level API should be used to recieve input from the user
or to render information to the user.  This improves accessibility since it
allows assistive technology to monitor user actions and information rendered to
the user in the highest sematic form of the information. It also allows
assistive technologies to not 

1. Keyboard: Use standard keyboard or character APIs or process keyboard
messages from the standard event  cue
2. Pointer: Use the standard pointer APIs or process pointer message
information from the standard event cue
3. Windows: Use standard window APIs for drawing information to the screen.  Do
not draw or directly manipulate hardware for visual rendering
4. Dialog boxes: Use standard dialog APIs so that assistive technology can
identify the new window as a dialog box
5. Text information (Prose, numbers, numerial tables, text within charts): 
Text is drawn to the screen using standard text drawing APIs
6. Graphic information (icons, images, pictures, graphs, charts): Bit mapped
images are drawn using standard bit map APIs
7. Lines, circles and other geometric objects: Geomatric objects are drawn
using standard geometric drawing APIs
7.Audio sounds: Non-speech sounds or sampled speech is rendered through
standard audio APIs.    
8. Synthesized speech: Speech generated from text should use standard speech
APIs to reduce conflicts with other audio events or generated speech.  

Minimum functionality required for devices that do not support assistive
technologies natively, the user interface must provide an external interface to
exchange information with a remote device.  See guideline 5 for the information
that must be exchanged.  

==========================================================

1.3 Ensure that the user can interact with all active elements in a
device-independent manner. [Priority 1] 

Minimum functionality required for WIMP (Windows, Icons, Menu, Pointer) based
environment for all of the following options:

Already covered in 1.1

Form controls defined in HTML and other specifications are considered user
interface controls for the purpose of device independent access.  See guideline
5.

==========================================================

1.4 Ensure that every functionality available through the user interface is
also available through the standard keyboard API. [Priority 1] 

Minimum functionality required for WIMP (Windows, Icons, Menu, Pointer) based
environment for all of the following options:

Already covered in 1.1

For technologies that do not provide a keyboard or do not support a keyboard
API (Kiosks, mobile devices) the user agent must support an external interface
for controlling the user agent from a remote device.

==========================================================

1.5 Ensure every non-text message (e.g., prompt, alert, etc.) available through
the user interface also has a text equivalent in the user interface. [Priority
1] 

Minimum functionality required for WIMP (Windows, Icons, Menu, Pointer) based
environment includes all the following items:

1. Audio sounds or speech use to provide information to the user also has a
text equivalant of the information avalable in the user interface (i.e in the
status bar or through a message box)

2. Icons: Icons that convey information also have a text equivalent of the
information.  For example, when an icon indicates the severity of a warning to
the user should also have a text equivaent of the severity

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

2.1 Ensure that the user has access to all content, including equivalent
alternatives for content. [Priority 1] 

Minimum functionality required for WIMP (Windows, Icons, Menu, Pointer) based
environment for all of the following options:
1.      The user must be able to configure the user agent to render alternative
content through the supported output devices.  For graphical displays
alternative text must be rendered in its entirety as text on the graphical
display in the same relative location as the primary content would have been
rendered.   The user agent can also render primary content if is chooses to do
so.

2.      As users adjust the rendering of content through the supported output
devices all content should remain available.  For example, as the user adjusts
the default font size the user agent should appropriately wrap text within the
current view port.  If the user adjusts the font size through changing the
scale through a zoom function and the rendered information does not fit within
the view port the user agent sould provide a scrolling function so the user can
move the view port to examine all the content.

==========================================================

2.2 For presentations that require user input within a specified time interval,
allow the user to configure the time interval (e.g., to extend it or to cause
the user agent to pause the presentation automatically and await user input
before proceeding). [Priority 1] 

Minimum functionality required for WIMP (Windows, Icons, Menu, Pointer) based
environment when the user agent can recognize markup that indicates an author
specified time interval for a user response allow the user the option of at
least one of the following options:
1.      Allow the user to adjust the time scale to at least 5 times the time
interval specified by the author.

2.      At the end of the author supplied time interval. Automatically
pause the
presentation until the user explicitly restarts the presentation.  While the
presentation is pauses the user needs to interact with the current user
interface controls.

==========================================================

2.3 When the author has not supplied a text equivalent for content as required
by the markup language, make available other author-supplied information about
the content (e.g., object type, file name, etc.). [Priority 2] 

Minimum functionality required for WIMP (Windows, Icons, Menu, Pointer) based
environment when a text equivalent is not supplied is to render the source or
target the target information for the resource.


==========================================================

2.4 When a text equivalent for content is explicitly empty (i.e., an empty
string), render nothing. [Priority 3] 

Minimum functionality required for WIMP (Windows, Icons, Menu, Pointer) based
environment requires all the following items:

1. The user agent ignores the element (i.e. display equals none in CSS).  This
is for compatibility with the WCAG.


==========================================================

2.5 If more than one equivalent alternative is available for content, allow the
user to choose from among the alternatives. This includes the choice of viewing
no alternatives. [Priority 1] 

Minimum functionality required for WIMP (Windows, Icons, Menu, Pointer) based
environment is that the user agent ignore the element (i.e. display equals none
in CSS).  This is explicitly include for compatibility with the WCAG.
1.      Allow the user to configure the user agent for their preference of the
type of alternative equivalents they would like rendered (i.e. language
preference for an audio description of a video presentation) .

2.      When there is no user information on which alternative equivalent they
prefer, prompt the user with the choice of alternative equivalents available



==========================================================

2.6 Allow the user to specify that text transcripts, collated text transcripts,
captions, and auditory descriptions be rendered at the same time as the
associated auditory and visual tracks. Respect author-supplied synchronization
cues during rendering. [Priority 1] 

Minimum functionality required for WIMP (Windows, Icons, Menu, Pointer) based
environment includes all the following items:
1.      The user agent renders alternative equivalents for synchronized
multi-media presentations at the same time as primary content. 

2.      The user agent gives the user an option to view the alternative
equivalents in a separate view port from the primary content.

==========================================================

2.7 For author-identified but unsupported natural languages, allow the user to
request 
notification of language changes in content. [Priority 3] 

Minimum functionality required includes:
1.      Insert a text message before and after the language change indicating
the start or end of the language change and the name of the author specified
language.

the frame rate to the user to at least a ? of the original speed.

2.      Audio: Use signal processing techniques to decrease the speech rate
(with pitch adjustment) to at least a half of the original speed

3.      Respect synchronization cues for multi-media presentation that the user
agent can detect.  Allow the user to listen to audio even if the video rate
requires significant distortion to the audio.  The user in other checkpoints
has the ability to turn the audio off if they wan to.
