  Per my action of the 10 April face-to-face meeting [1], here
  is a proposal to clarify checkpoint 9.2 (issue 208). The Working Group
  felt that this checkpoint was intended to allow configuration of 
  prompting (like all the other checkpoints), but the wording did not
  capture that. Here is a proposed clarification:
  
  <OLD>
  9.2 Prompt the user to confirm any form submission triggered indirectly, 
  that is by any means other than the user activating an explicit form 
  submit control.
  </OLD>
  
  <NEW>
  When configured to do so, prompt the user to confirm any form
  submission triggered indirectly, that is by any means other than the 
  user activating an explicit form submit control.
  </NEW>
