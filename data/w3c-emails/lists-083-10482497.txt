Types of things to think about in WIMP interfaces for conformance:
1.Frames with in a windows
2.Multiple document windows
3.Split windows
4.History list windows
5.Favorites list windows
6.Full keyboard support (see checkpoint 1.4)

==========================================================

7.2 For user agents that offer a browsing history mechanism, when the user
returns to a previous viewport, restore the point of regard in the
viewport. [Priority 1] 

Types of things to think about in WIMP interfaces for conformance:

1.Information displayed in view port
2.Selected elements of the resource
3.User interface control with the current focus
4.States of form controls
5.State variables of a script
6.Position in a audio, video or other multi-media resource 
7.User styles sheets applied
8.States of rendering variables in a audio, video or other multi-media
resource 

==========================================================

7.3 Allow the user to navigate all active elements. [Priority 1] 

Minimum requirement:
1. Allow the user to sequentially navigate all active elements of a
resource (TAB key on popular browsers such as IE and NN)

==========================================================

7.4 Allow the user to choose to navigate only active elements. [Priority 2] 

Minimum requirement:
1. Allow the user to sequentially navigate all active elements of a
resource (TAB key on popular browsers such as IE and NN)

==========================================================

7.5 Allow the user to search for rendered text content, including rendered
text equivalents. [Priority 2] 

Things to think about:
1.Are alternative equivalents currently being rendered?
2.Are contents of longdesc reference part of content

==========================================================

7.6 Allow the user to navigate according to structure. [Priority 2] 

Minimum requirement:
1.Allow the user to sequentially navigate (through rendering in the
current view port) the human recognizable structure defined by the
resourced specifications the user agent supports.  For example in HTML
there are header elements and other definitions defined for human
consumption understanding.

2.If there are no structural conventions defined or implied in the
resourced for human understanding, use the programmatic structure defined
by the resource specifications.

==========================================================

7.7 Allow the user to configure structured navigation. [Priority 3] 

Minimum requirement:
1.Allow the user to choose which elements of a resource they would like to
navigate in 7.6.
