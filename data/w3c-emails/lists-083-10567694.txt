I cannot make the teleconference on the 25th - that is in conflict with the
regular Authoring Tools teleconference, which has been moved to that time

  I would like to hold an additional telecons on:
  
  Wednesday, April 19th 2:00-3:30 EST
  
  Tuesday, April 25th  2:00-3:30 EST
  
  How many people could make one or both of these telecons?
  
  I am hoping we do not need to use the 25th, but I am scheduling it just in
  case.
  
  Thanks,
  Jon
