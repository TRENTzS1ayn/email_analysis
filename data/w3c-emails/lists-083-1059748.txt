Hello,

The 27 August drafts of the UA Guidelines [1] and Techniques [2]
are available. Comments are welcome. 

For those who have not yet conducted their reviews of software
with the guidelines, I recommend using the latest draft.
However this means that all reviews must contain the following
data:

a) Which draft of guidelines used?
b) Which version of software tested?
c) Which os tested on?

Note that the guidelines were reordered in this draft. All
comments on this draft (and others) should include the
dated URL of the draft (and NOT the undated, latest version
URL).

The changes [3] from the previous draft are available online.
The issues list [4] has been augmented, but resolved issues
have not yet been checked off.

Thank you,

 - Ian
