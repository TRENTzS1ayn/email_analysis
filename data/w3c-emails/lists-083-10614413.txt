Harvey,
I think the ideas are good, but I have a few concerns abouting adding these
requirements at this time:

1. The suggestions expand the scope of current checkpoints and so there are
new requirements on user agents.  We are already wrestling with a number of
potential changes to scope of the different checkpoints in the document.
These changes turn out to be significant we may need to take a step back in
the process.  To avoid taking a step back we want to minimize the number of
changes in scope and keep the document is moving foreward.

2. I don't think the group has the time or the resources at this time to
carefully understand the impact of the proposed changes.  We already have
enough on our plate and we need to stop somewhere.

Jon
