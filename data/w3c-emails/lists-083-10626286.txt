Do to the number of open issues remaining from proposed recommendation
comments, I have scheduled an extra telecon for Wednesday, April 19th.  

The telecon information is:

WAI UA Telecon for April 19th, 2000 

Chair: Jon Gunderson 
Date: Wednesday, April 19th
Time: 2:00 pm to 3:30 pm Eastern Standard Time, USA
Call-in:Longfellow Bridge (+1) (617) 252-1038

Please let me know if you can attend.  It is EXTREMELY important for group
members to participate so that we can get consensus on the remaining
working group issues.

We will also be having our regularly scheduled telecon on the 20th.
If we still have outstanding issues, we will have an additional telecon on
April 25th.
