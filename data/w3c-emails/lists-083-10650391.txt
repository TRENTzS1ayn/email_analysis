As per my action item and so as not to prolong my fulfilling of it over
long, I have studied the techniques for guidelies one and two and found
nothing to report at this time but as much editing is ocurring as we hurtle
toward rec, I will continue to monitor tthem.  I am still reviewing the
document as a whole and will have one or two things to report at least.
