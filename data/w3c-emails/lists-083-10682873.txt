Hello,

Per my action item of 10 April [1], here is a proposed
change to clarify the wording of checkpoint 4.15:

<OLD>
 4.15 Allow the user to configure how the focus changes.
</OLD>

<NEW>
 4.15 Allow the user to configure whether the focus 
      moves automatically to a viewport that opens without 
      an explicit request from the user.
</NEW>

Notes:

 1) I think the minimal requirement is to prevent focus from moving
    or to allow it to move.

 2) I've added the "explicit request from the user" from 4.16.
    This might be removed, but I understand the real accessibility
    problem to be that the user is unaware of the new viewport.

 3) Checkpoint 4.16 talks about user interface controls other
    than viewports. Should this checkpoint be generalized to
    prompts, alerts, etc.? Refer also to the minutes of 10 April 
    for the proposal to delete 4.16.[2]. The larger requirement
    of 4.16 could be moved thusly to the revised 4.15.

 4) Should this checkpoint be expressed in the negative
    instead? "Allow the user to configure the focus behavior so that
    it does not automatically move to a viewport that opens without 
    an explicit request from the user."
