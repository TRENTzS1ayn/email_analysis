Hello,

As part of resolving issue 235 [1], I'd like to propose
the following note after checkpoint 8.1 and the following
addition to the techniques document.

Checkpoint and note:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
8.1 Make available to the user the author-specified purpose of each
table and the relationships among the table cells and headers.

For example, provide information about table headers, 
how headers relate to cells, table summary 
information, cell position information, table dimensions, etc.
Graphical user agents may satisfy this checkpoint by 
rendering a table as a two dimensional grid and ensuring that
users can find headers associated with cells.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Technique:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In HTML, beyond the TR, TH, and TD elements, the table attributes
"summary", "abbr", "headers", "scope", and "axis" provide information
about relationships among cells and headers.  For 
more information, refer to the section on table techniques.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
