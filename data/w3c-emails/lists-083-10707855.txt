"whether" dangles without an alternative. I prefer the following with
qualification. [I believe the default should not be to move focus
automatically (and without alerter) as that is disorienting, without
means to get back.]

I think that should be reversed, so the default is don't move. Also the
user configuration then would need to substitute some alternative means to
alert the user of the new viewport. Do we need/have a means to step through
multiple viewports? Is notice provided whenever viewport change is made?
