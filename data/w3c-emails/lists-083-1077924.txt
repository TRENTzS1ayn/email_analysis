aloha, ian!

checkpoint 10.6, as prosed by me [1], amended by Len Kasday [2], and adopted by
the WG during the 25 August telecon [3], should read:

10.6 Prompt the user to confirm any form submission not explicitly activated by
the user. [Priority 2] 

and not, as it appears in the 27 August draft [4] 

10.6 Prompt the user to confirm any form submission not explicitly initiated by
the user. [Priority 2] 

a one word difference, admittedly, but a significant one, i believe...

i also am uncertain about the status of the second proposed checkpoint, which
addresses event handled forms, contained in the post archived at (long URI
warning!)
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999JulSep/0139.html

has it been dropped, or merely subsumed into 10.6?

could, therefore,  discussion of (or at least a vote on) the second proposed
checkpoint for GL10

If the submission of a form is achieved via a script or an event handler,
prompt the user for confirmation before submitting the form content. [Priority
1]
* NOTE: This checkpoint is intended to extend the user's control over automated
submission mechanisms, such as the HTML4 event handler "onchange"
* Refer also to Checkpoint 5.8 

be added to the agenda for the 1 September telecon?

thanks,
gregory.

PS: the proposal for the additional checkpoint for GL10 contains proposed
techniques, as well
