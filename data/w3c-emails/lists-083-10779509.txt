I agree with Jon - there is no reason why a voice-based system with
appropriate export through APIs cannot comply, and it certainly should be
able to. The requirement for exporting the interface to Assistive
technologies is of course crucial.

  Ian,
  My main point is that a voice only browser could still comply.  The main 
  complication from AT vendors with this issue are:
  1. My visual interface does not comply
  2. Exporting and supporting the DOM
  3. Targeting one type of disability
  
  My main concern is mentioning that a technology that is primarily speech 
  output as not something that is intended to complying.  Maybe it would be 
  better to say a browser that is targeting one type of disability or 
  something like that.
