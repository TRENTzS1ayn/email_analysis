In Australian english the default for whether is whether or not. I would not
change this, but that might just be becuase of language differences.

English but there is still a way to go)

  "whether" dangles without an alternative. I prefer the following with
  qualification. [I believe the default should not be to move focus
  automatically (and without alerter) as that is disorienting, without
  means to get back.]

  I think that should be reversed, so the default is don't move. Also the
  user configuration then would need to substitute some alternative means to
  alert the user of the new viewport. Do we need/have a means to step through
  multiple viewports? Is notice provided whenever viewport change is made?
