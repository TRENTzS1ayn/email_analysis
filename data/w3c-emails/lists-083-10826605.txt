Hello,

Per my action item of the 11 April face-to-face meeting about
issue 245 [1], I propose the following change to checkpoint 1.5:

<OLD>
1.5 Ensure every non-text message (e.g., prompt, alert, etc.) 
    available through the user interface also has a
    text equivalent in the user interface. [Priority 1] 
        Note. For example, if the user interface provides access to a 
        functionality through a graphical button, ensure that the user 
        interface also provides access to the same functionality through
        a control that includes a text equivalent. If a sound is used to 
        notify the user of an event, announce the event in text on the 
        status bar as well. Refer also to checkpoint
5.7.                     
</OLD>

<PROPOSED>
1.5 Ensure every non-text message (e.g., prompt, alert, notification, 
    etc.) that is part of the user agent's  user interface also 
    has a text equivalent in the user interface.[Priority 1] 
        Note. For example, if the user is notified of an event by
        an auditory cue, provide a text equivalent in the status bar. 
        Use standard interface controls so that text equivalents are 
        available through standard APIs.
</PROPOSED>

Notes:

 1) This checkpoint only applies to those messages provided by
   the user agent's native UI, not those that come from the
   author. I have clarified this above by using "user agent's
   user interface", although this term may change in light
   of other changes.

 2) Please confirm that the second sentence of the note makes
    sense.

Thank you,

  - Ian
