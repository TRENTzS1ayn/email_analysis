I would use the phrase

...a text equivalent could be provided in the status bar...

in place of

...provide a text equivalent in the status bar...

but the whole thing makes sense as is.

  Hello,
  
  Per my action item of the 11 April face-to-face meeting about
  issue 245 [1], I propose the following change to checkpoint 1.5:
  
  <OLD>
  1.5 Ensure every non-text message (e.g., prompt, alert, etc.) 
      available through the user interface also has a
      text equivalent in the user interface. [Priority 1] 
          Note. For example, if the user interface provides access to a 
          functionality through a graphical button, ensure that the user 
          interface also provides access to the same functionality through
          a control that includes a text equivalent. If a sound is used to 
          notify the user of an event, announce the event in text on the 
          status bar as well. Refer also to checkpoint
  5.7.                     
  </OLD>
  
  <PROPOSED>
  1.5 Ensure every non-text message (e.g., prompt, alert, notification, 
      etc.) that is part of the user agent's  user interface also 
      has a text equivalent in the user interface.[Priority 1] 
          Note. For example, if the user is notified of an event by
          an auditory cue, provide a text equivalent in the status bar. 
          Use standard interface controls so that text equivalents are 
          available through standard APIs.
  </PROPOSED>
  
  Notes:
  
   1) This checkpoint only applies to those messages provided by
     the user agent's native UI, not those that come from the
     author. I have clarified this above by using "user agent's
     user interface", although this term may change in light
     of other changes.
  
   2) Please confirm that the second sentence of the note makes
      sense.
  
  Thank you,
  
    - Ian
