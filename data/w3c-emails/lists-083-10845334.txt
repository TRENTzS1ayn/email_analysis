Discussion

    1.Update on proposed recommendation process

    2.Issue #PR207: Interpretation checkpoint 2.1
      http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#207

      Notes:

           A. Consensus on access to all human readible content through the 
user interface

           B. Consensus on access to all alternative equivalents through 
the user interface

           C. Currently the group has identified the primary use for access 
to machine readible
           content through the user interface is for repair purposes. The 
following items
           summarize the chairs view of the issue:
              C.1 We have previously removed other repair related 
checkpoints (linearization
                of tables, etc..). The only one left is Checkpoint 2.3.
              C.2 Examples sited affect people with disabilities the same 
as people without
                disabilities. Markup that does not conform to WCAG.
              C.3 Examples sited require an expert knowledge of markup for 
repair (small
                number of people with skill and motivation)
              C.4 Examples sited do not guarantee access to content only 
potential
              C.5 This would be a new requirement and may require stepping 
back to a
                previous stage in the recommendation process

    3.PR#224: Checkpoint 4.16: Minimal conformance requirement unclear
      http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#224

    4.PR#244: Checkpoint 4.5: Change to P2 since no reference implementation.
      http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#244

    5.PR#257: Difficult to know when a UA has conformed.
      http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#257

    6.PR#262: Checkpoint 5.9: Change Priority since non-standard approaches 
may be
      better.
      http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#262

    7.PR#264: Checkpoint 3.9: Raise priority since may cause CD problems.
      http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#264
