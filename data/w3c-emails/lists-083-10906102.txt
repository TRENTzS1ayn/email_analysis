Hello,

Per my action item of the 11 April face-to-face [1], please
consider this editorial clarification to checkpoint 10.9:

<OLD>
  Allow the user to configure the arrangement of graphical user
  agent user interface controls.
</OLD>

<NEW>
  For graphical user interfaces, allow the user to configure 
  the arrangement of user interface controls. 
</NEW>

I would note that the minimal requirement of this
checkpoint is unclear.

 - Ian
