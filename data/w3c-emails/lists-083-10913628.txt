In the following URI I have outlined the minimum requirements for 
checkpoints that are open ended or ambigous.  To do this I went through 
each checkpoint from a GUI user interface standpoint and tried to scope the 
minimum requirements or the things to think about in satisfying a 
checkpoint.  The things to think about maybe the start of a FAQ for 
developers.  The minimum requirements may be integrated into the 
checkpoints in the UAAG.  The group needs to go through these to make sure 
there is consensus on minimum requirements.

Please review and comment to the list.  We will be discussing minimum 
requirements at a telecon in the near future.
