Who decides what views are available? I don't think the user
has the freedom to view content any way he or she chooses. Won't there
be a limited set of views (e.g., one pre-programmed source view,
the set of views possible with CSS 1 style sheets, etc.)?

IJ: So to what extent do users determine what content is meant for
humans? This is the essence of issue 207. It's obvious to me that
the stuff that is designed by specification to be made available to
users must be available through the UI. It's less obvious to me that
the rest must be made available directly (i.e., other than through
the effect caused by processing according to specification).

IJ: Amaya's "Show structure" view does not give you the syntax
of the markup language. But you still get a view of all the elements
(indented, formatted, etc.). Does this count?

IJ: Yes. I started to describe it that way, but pulled back.

IJ: Does this work:
     A view of content is a particular presentation of 
     a subset of that content. For instance, an "outline view"
     of an HTML document might be created by filtering out
     everything but the document's headings.

IJ: I agree. I think it's best for the WG to reach consensus on what
it wants/means, and then to decide how to proceed in the process.

Thanks Al,
