Hello,

Per my action item from the 11 April face-to-face [1], please
consider this restatement of checkpoint 4.7.

<OLD>
4.7 Allow the user to configure the position of text 
transcripts, collated text transcripts, and captions on 
graphical displays. 
</OLD>

The two issues related to this checkpoint that we
discussed at the face-to-face meeting were:

1) This text content must not obscure or be obscured by other content.
2) Users must be able to view them simultaneously (e.g., within a narrow
   field of vision).

I propose that checkpoint 2.6 already covers the second requirement:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
2.6 Allow the user to specify that text transcripts, 
collated text transcripts, captions, and auditory descriptions
be rendered at the same time as the associated auditory and 
visual tracks. Respect author-specified synchronization cues 
during rendering.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Therefore, I propose that the scope of checkpoint 4.7 be clearly
about issue 1. The checkpoint could be expressed in more
functional terms, with repositioning being one technique:

<NEW>
4.7 For graphical viewports, allow the user to configure the 
user agent so that text transcripts, collated text transcripts, 
and captions do not obscure other content and are not obscured 
by other content.
</NEW>

NOTES:

 - The UA doesn't have to allow for reconfiguring if the
   information is not obscured.

 - The user may allow overlap if that's preferred.

 - As one technique, the UA could implement whatever positioning
   capabilities are offered by the markup specification.

 - Ian
