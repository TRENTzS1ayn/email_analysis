That's the point of the wording of 2.1.  The UA is _not_ required to
construct _arbitrary views_ per user whim.  But no part of the content may
remain inaccessible from all the supported views.  The UA is required to
provide a repertory of views which gets to all properties of all nodes in
the InfoSet.  This is a coverage requirement which is easily met by simple
property lists for the current node.  There is already the requirement to
be able to make any DOM [InfoSet] node current.  The UA can offer fancier
ways to do this.  But it has at least to cover the content.

This is the same issue as the user style sheets.  The user should have
ultimate control over all such decisions.  The User Agent should taper the
ease of access so that views that are less likely to be needed or more
likely to be confusing are not so near at hand as the others.  But all
content should be exposable by some feasible view.

Nobody else is qualified to make the decision for the user, ultimately.  It
is helpful for the User Agent to employ default views, and layer things so
some things are easier to surface than others.  The unusual cases should
not be the ones that come up by default.  But although the easy should be
easy, the hard should be possible.  

Nothing less constitutes justice.

"Most users won't understand it" is not an acceptable argument.  The
history with HTML is that many users have climbed the learning curve of
HTML document structure because they had the information crowbars available
in some browser.  The ones who need it need to be able to try.  That's why
this is the Web _Accessibility_ Initiative and not the "97% Usability
Initiative."

It is not a source view.  It is a better view, for most purposes.  For
those who have used HoTMetaL and not Amaya, the corresponding view there is
called "Tags On."

This works for me.  The example helps.  I would probably like there to be a
few references to CS and/or data engineering sources, too.

I may be a little overly hung up on "MVC is _the name of the game_," but
that statement is not too far off base.
