Strange that I never saw this before, but isn't this a repair strategy for a badly designed UI of the UA!?

And if it isn't, there is probably a disability that needs rearrangement in a special way (conflicting with other accessibility needs). This might give a clue as to what the minimum requirement must be.

Hello,

Per my action item of the 11 April face-to-face [1], please
consider this editorial clarification to checkpoint 10.9:

<OLD>
  Allow the user to configure the arrangement of graphical user
  agent user interface controls.
</OLD>

<NEW>
  For graphical user interfaces, allow the user to configure 
  the arrangement of user interface controls. 
</NEW>

I would note that the minimal requirement of this
checkpoint is unclear.

 - Ian
