6) Source view

   <BLOCKQUOTE>
   A source view renders all or part of the document
   object in a way that reveals the document object
   model. Often, a source view presents the document
   object using the syntax of the source markup 
   languages.
   </BLOCKQUOTE>

<Hans>
As I understand, the "source" is unparsed and therefore cannot reveal the document object in any way. Speaking of document object itself is false. If only the source was already parsed (contradiction in terms), a source view might (minimally) satisfy checkpoint 2.1, because in effect it would have become a document object view.
