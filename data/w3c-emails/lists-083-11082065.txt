Jon,

I need a quick clarification.  In your document you refer to "using only 
the keyboard or only the mouse."  Should this be "using only the keyboard 
AND using only the mouse" ?

For example, under checkpoint 1.1, Dialog boxes you have "User is able to 
move the application focus to every control in a dialog using only the 
keyboard or only the mouse."  It sounds like an application can meet this 
checkpoint as long as someone can use the mouse to move through 
controls.  Similar statements show up in several places.

Just confirming your intent,

Kitch
