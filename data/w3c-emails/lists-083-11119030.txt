Never mind the question about support for style sheets. But controlling 
font and color through the UI is still okay isn't it?

Jon,

For several of the checkpoints under guideline 4, Ensure user control of 
styles, one of the minimal functional requirements is basically,  allow the 
user to change the default style sheet or allow the user to specify through 
user style sheets.  However, couldn't a developer meet this requirement by 
allowing the user to configure fonts and colors through the UI?  Is that 
what you meant by "default style sheet"? The use of style sheets, while a 
good idea, is not a requirement, correct?

Kitch
