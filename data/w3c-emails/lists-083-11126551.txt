I think that there are a number of checkpoints that address a
configuration range, and if possible, we should address them uniformly.
I'm still thinking about how to do this. 

In my opinion, in no case should support for style sheets be a minimal
requirement for meeting any checkpoint. However, style sheets may
be sufficient for satisfying many of them.
