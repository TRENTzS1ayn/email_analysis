Ian,

When I use the term "content," I mean the "information" in the page.
Specifically, what the author of the page hoped to convey to the reader of
the page.  Some of that information may be in the form of text, some in the
form of picture, and some in the form of layout.

It will always be impossible for the browser to "know" what the author
intended, but our goal is to make that intended information available to the
user with a disability.  It may well be that the author *intended* some of
the text to be invisible, at some stages of viewing of the page.  The AT
must have some way of knowing this, and presenting the information as it is
appropriate.

Doing a "page dump" (the electronic equivalent of a brain dump) seldom
conveys the intention of the author.  You can't just pile all of the
available information on the user, and expect them to sort it out.  That's
why we have parsing!

Denis

The intent of 2.1 is being debated. I believe that it currently reads
as you say, but that we are going to remove the "or through an API"
part.

What do you mean be "content of the page"? Please refer to the
definition
of content proposed [1] and see if that meets your expectations.
