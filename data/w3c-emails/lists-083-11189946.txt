It is important to do a compare and contrast.  The problem is that people
use 'content' to connote different things.  People say "information
content" when they want to be clear in taking a human-centric view.  That
is to say "information content" refers to "what the user understands after
display, sensation, perception, and comprehension are applied."

The infoset is a small step in that direction but is still mostly
data-centric.  It is an accounting of small collections of data and it
places them in an abstract graph structure instead of a linear syntax with
<> characters separating structured from unstructured content.

Effective communication is to be measured in the cognitive plane, what I am
claiming Denis alludes to.  This is where we observe the breakdown when
there is breakage, i.e. inaccessible information.

The user agent algorithms have to work mechanically off the data plane.  

Between these two planes lives the HCI problem space for information delivery.

The specification provides the code in which the authoring tool encodes the
author's intention.  You are talking about the same thing, just viewing it
in different cross-sections of the process.  Denis before encoding by the
author tool, Ian after.

The basic meta-protocol that we worked into the !important reform was this:
always respect the author indications as defaults; always give the user the
last word.  This includes changing show/hide indications.

The author is not assumed to understand the full range of alternate
presentations that their ideas will be viewed through.  The user deserves a
shot at re-flowing the ideas, selecting among _all actual data sent_ to
make the alternate view more usable.
