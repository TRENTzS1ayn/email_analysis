The problem with this analysis is simply this:  The formats don't give you
a machine-implemetable way to separate case A from case C.  The only way
the user agent can give access to all human-comprehensible information is
to give structured (not all at once) access to the text values of all
attributes.  It's easier to do that than to try to filter on attribute.

I realize that my view is colored by working most intensively with the
talking book and supercomputing applications, but basic tree walking and
property inspection is one small body of code for all nodes in the DOM
tree.  It takes more code to restrict it than to do it all.

In order to minimize the burden on the User Agent, we need to lose the
distinction between A and C which is not supported in the formats.
