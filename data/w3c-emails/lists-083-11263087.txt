I think to minimise the burden we should point out in the techniqeus that in
general it is easier to implement this by making available everything through
the user interface. It does also depend on the languages supported by the
user agent - in some cases the range of information is so strictly tied that
it may be simpler not ot.

  The problem with this analysis is simply this:  The formats don't give you
  a machine-implemetable way to separate case A from case C.  The only way
  the user agent can give access to all human-comprehensible information is
  to give structured (not all at once) access to the text values of all
  attributes.  It's easier to do that than to try to filter on attribute.
  
  I realize that my view is colored by working most intensively with the
  talking book and supercomputing applications, but basic tree walking and
  property inspection is one small body of code for all nodes in the DOM
  tree.  It takes more code to restrict it than to do it all.
  
  In order to minimize the burden on the User Agent, we need to lose the
  distinction between A and C which is not supported in the formats.
