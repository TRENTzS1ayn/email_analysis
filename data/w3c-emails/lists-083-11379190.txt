A "viewport" is the piece of the UI. A "view" is the slice of the data.
What does it mean that a viewport conform to the guidelines?
If you mean that the user agent must meet the user interface
requirements of UAAG 1.0, I agree. But that's no more than conformance
to the document. So I don't see "A" as a minimal requirement.

That seems reasonable as an elaboration of the checkpoint, but it
doesn't suggest a minimal requirement. It says "Whatever you do, all
the content must be available at some point through the UI.".

Perhaps we can resolve the issue by telling developers informally 
what is expected:

 Note. A user agent must make available all content through the
       user interface. A user agent is expected to process and 
       render content according to specification and to make available
       all content intended for the user (including equivalent
       alternatives for content) through viewports and other
       components of the user interface. A user agent is not required to
       render all content in the same viewport. A "source view" does not
       satisfy this checkpoint for content that may be rendered
naturally 
       through an ordinary viewport since users are not expected to 
       understand a markup language in order to use marked up content.
       However, at times (e.g., when the user interface or an assistive
       technology do not provide sufficient access)
       some users may need to view markup, style sheets, scripts, or
other       
       information in "raw form", so a user agent should offer a source
       view (or better) to ensure access to all content.

I would note that the above proposal is very similar to the one 
proposed by Charles [1] on 3 April:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Note: For information intended to be human-readable, (for example
equivalent
alternatives) a source view alone is insufficient, and access must be
provided as part of the normal user browsing interface.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

I would note further that a source view alone would often mean that the
user agent fails checkpoint 6.2 (conform to W3C specs). A source view
of HTML is not an HTML view but an SGML view. Therefore, if the user
agent
provides no other view of the document, it cannot claim to be a
conforming
HTML user agent.

For me, the most difficult part of this issue has been "where to draw
the line" between what MUST be rendered through an "ordinary" viewport
and what must not. Drawing that line has clearly proved
difficult ("process according to specification" does not suffice, it
would seem). I think that technically, a source view would satisfy
this checkpoint minimally, but as many have argued, that's not
really sufficient for ensuring access.

I have been reticent to include a priority 1 requirement that users
have access through the user interface to content not meant to be
viewed.
In part, I don't think that many users will benefit from this
information
(since most users will not know enough about markup to make use of a
source
view). Secondly, all content must be available through and API anyway.
Thirdly, if some content is not available to any user, all users suffer
equally and thus a broken user interface in this case is a general
problem,
not an accessibility problem.

However, Charles and others have argued that the user agent must make
available all content natively. It is very difficult to draw the line
between
content intended for humans and content intended for machines; the line
moves according to user needs and may not be clearly specified anyway.
While in theory a source view is not required by this checkpoint
(a perfect user interface would make it unnecessary), in practice
we are requiring that every user agent implement a source view as a 
basic repair strategy for failures of the user interface. A source 
view does not suffice for general rendering, but without one, 
a user agent might not provide access to all content through the UI.
