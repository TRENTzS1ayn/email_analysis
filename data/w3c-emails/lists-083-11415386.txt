I'm finally getting my comments in for techniques 3, 4 and 11.

Those for 4 look fine.

For 3, the only thing I noticed was an inconsistency:

Most of the techniques included the phrase, "...through the user agent
user interface."

As in, "Allow the user to turn off animated or blinking text through the
user agent
user interface."

But that phrase is missing in 3.8 and 3.9.

As for 11, fine except:

11.4 says, "In a dedicated section of the documentation, describe all
features of the
user agent that promote accessibility."

The technique says, "Integrate information about accessibility features
throughout the
documentation. The dedicated section on accessibility should provide access
to the documentation as a whole rather than standing alone as an independent
section. For instance, in a hypertext-based help system, the section on
accessibility should link to pertinent topics elsewhere in the
documentation."

I think the technique goes too far in specifying that a dedicated section
for Help should actually be a series of links to sections elsewhere in Help.
While that might be good, it also seems sufficient if the section stands
alone, assuming that accessibility information is properly integrated
throughout the rest of the documentation.
