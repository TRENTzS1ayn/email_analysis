Great. My comments on your comments below preceded by IJ:

IJ: Would someone care to propose an example?

What I heard people say at the face-to-face was that in this case,
they should use *both* interfaces, not abandon the higher-level 
interface. Therefore, how about:

   Note. When available, developers should use APIs at a higher level
        of abstraction than the standard device APIs for the operating
        system. If these higher level APIs do not use the
        standard device APIs properly, developers should also
        use the standard device APIs.
