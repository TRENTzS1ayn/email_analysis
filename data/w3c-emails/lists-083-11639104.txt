Hello,

The issue of the normative/informative nature of the notes
after checkpoints was raised in GL [1]. Our spec says that
each checkpoint may be followed by "Optional informative notes, 
clarifying examples and cross references to related guidelines 
or checkpoints." A cursory review of the checkpoints reveals that
in some cases, the text after some checkpoints is normative 
than the text after others. 

I will review the notes this week and send a proposal to the list.

 - Ian
