I would like to register an objection to the resolution of Issue 243. I
believe that checkpoint 9.2 should be a P3 requirement rather than a P2
requirement because this is a content authoring problem that effects
usability. User Agents should not be required to correct poor content as a
disability requirement. This creates an undue burden on user agents. I do
not feel this recommendation should go forward with this as a P2
requirement.

Does anyone else agree with this.
