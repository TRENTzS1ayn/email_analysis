aloha, jon!

i have an addition to your review of IE5 and the UAGL, based upon my recent
experiences upgrading from IE 4.01SP2 to IE5.  I hope that the following
addresses Checkpoint 1.3, which reads:

Ensure that the user can install the user agent software in a device
independent manner. [Priority 1] 

Please note that, although I am not responsible for evaluating JFW and MSIE, I
am forwarding this info to the WG as it was necessary for me to upgrade my
version of MSIE in order to test HAL95 and Window-Eyes against the AUGL, and,
since I am most comfortable and adept using JFW, I decided to use it to install
IE5, so as to prevent any sort of installation SNAFU.  Moreover, it is my
impression that Dave Poehlman already has IE5 installed on his machine, so I
decided to document the installation process, in order that this checkpoint be
reviewed.

A) MATERIALS USED IN EVALUATION

1. Assistive Technology: JFW (build 3.30.26/desktop keyboard layout)

2. Speech Synthesizer: Eloquence for JAWS (running on a NeoMagic MagicWave 3DX
Sound System (driver: NMA255.VXD version 4.03.2420

3. OS: Windows95 (version 4.01.0.971.B)

4. Computer: Gateway Solo 2500 (laptop; using Micron Windows95 keyboard) with
96MB RAM and a Pentium II processor running at 366MHz

5. Source of Installation files: Office2000 Update CD-ROM (disk 1)

B) COMMENTS & OBSERVATIONS

1. Application (dialog) boxes did not fully voice, although checkboxes and edit
areas did self-voice when TABed-to; Needed to use screen review (JAWS cursor)
to hear complete content of application (dialog) boxes. the "Read Box in TAB
order" screen review command (INSERT+B) spoke only the window title, the
topmost text, and the row of buttons (Back, Next, Cancel, Help), and NOT the
box's complete contents.  In order to listen to explanatory text, it was
necessary to use the JAWS (screen review) cursor to move around within
application (dialog) boxes.

2. Chose "Install Minimal, or customize your browser" option.

2A. When scrolling through the options contained in the type of installation
list (a field which was not titled), the "Description" of the installation
type, which is supposed to change as the selected option changes, did not
self-voice.

2B. Media specific/visual only cues utilized: "Components appearing in bold
text do not need updating".  Ramifications: Without having explored every
portion of this dialog box with the JAWS (screen review) cursor, I would not
have been aware that (a) items that did not need updating were in bold face,
and (b) that in order to discern which items did not need to be updated, I
would need to use JAWS' "say font" hotkey (INSERT+F), which (at least on my
system) does not always accurately report the font weight when used within a
list box; bottom line: no independent indication that a component did not need
updating

3.The installation progress window (title: "Windows Update: Internet Explorer
and Internet Tools") did not completely self-voice, and did not provide any
useful information.  Only the top 2 (unchanging) lines of text in the window
were auto-announced. They were also repeated 9 times before JFW announced
"Cancel Button". Thus, in order to monitor the installation progress, I needed
to use the JAWS (screen review) cursor, and -- due to the time-sensitive nature
of the information displayed, I am not sure that I heard all of the information
that was painted .to the screen.

4. Restart computer dialog box voiced very well, but despite shutting down any
open applications and issuing the shut-down sound, the computer did not
reboot.  Eventually, any attempt at keyboard input yielded only a system error
bell, so I was forced to shut down manually and reboot. On reboot, ScanDisk
ran, but did not find any problems or errors.

5. AFTER REBOOT

5A. JFW (which I have set to "Run JAWS First") loaded without incident.

5B. Windows Update and Personalized Settings windows did not voice completely.
Window title and introductory text spoken, but enumeration of items only
available by using JAWS (screen review) cursor.
