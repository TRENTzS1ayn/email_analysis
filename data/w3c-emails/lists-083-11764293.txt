Hello everyone:

Sorry this review was so late.  Will be working on guideline 10 on Wednesday.

******* MQ *******


Here are my comments about checkpoint 9.
9.2 
 
 9.2 Prompt the user to confirm any form submission triggered
          indirectly, that is by any means other than the user activating
          an explicit form submit control. [Priority 2] (Checkpoint 9.2)
  
remove item 
<quote>               3. Allow script-based submission without confirmation from
                 the user.
<quote> as it is a duplication of item 2.

9.3 add the reference link for section on frame techniques 

9.4  see changed item below

<quote>
+ Indicate when loading has finished, for example with a
            percentage indication or a special message.
  <quote>
change to
+ Indicate progress of loading, and when loading has finished, for example with a
            percentage indication or a special message.
