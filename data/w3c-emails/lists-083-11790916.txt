aloha, ian!

at today's teleconference, dave poehlman mentioned that a good example for 
the preservation of focus when invoking a new viewport was the JFW (JAWS 
for Windows) List of Links, which displays the current slash closest 
hyperlink when the audio rendering of a page parsed by MSIE 4x or 5x is 
stopped (i.e. when speech output is squelched using the CONTROL 
key)...  this behavior is noted and documented in the full text of the long 
description and explanation of the functionality illustrated by the 
snapshots of the JFW List of Links, and the associated HTML Options 
property sheet, which i submitted to the working group in january...  the 
description and illustrations can be accessed via the UA mail archive at:

i believe that this implementation illustrates that it would not be 
unreasonable to expect that focus be retained (even if only at a gross 
level of granularity) when a user invokes a structured slash outline 
(over)view...
