Hello Working Group,

As starting points for discussion at tomorrow's teleconference, 
please consider the following comments and proposals.

>     1.PR#278: Definition of "content", etc
>       http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#278

Please read Eric Hansen's latest version of the definitions. 
I propose that we adopt them, and add a note that some people
use the term "content" to mean "information" (not data). However,
in the document, we should (if possible) only use content in
one sense. I will have to review how it is used in the document
to confirm that usage.

Eric's proposal:

>     2.PR#271: Checkpoint 4.7: Change to P2 since arbitrary 
                repositioning not a requirement.
>       http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#271

I have an action item to get Madeleine's take on the priority
for this checkpoint, which I will do separately. We don't need
to discuss it tomorrow.
 
>     3.PR#257: Difficult to know when a UA has conformed.
>       http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#257

I propose we discuss this last and that we first discuss two things:

 1) How are we going to indicate our results in the document?
    I propose that information about what needs to be done
    for conformance appear clearly at each checkpoint (i.e., in
    the guidelines).

 2) What are the pieces of the framework we are using to 
    identify what it takes to conform? I have heard at least two
    ways to consider answering the question, and I think both
    will be useful and necessary:

   a) In some cases, the minimal requirement may be identified
      easiliy (e.g., all the checkpoints that require the
      UA to allow the user to turn off some feature).

   b) In other cases, it is easier to provide a reference
      implementation and say "This would satisfy the checkpoint,
      but we can't easily express a minimal requirement."
      Refer to Al's comments on "Minimum v. Reference Implementation"

>     4.PR#233: Checkpoint 7.6: What does "structure" mean here?
>       http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#233

   Refer to Al's email:
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0188.html

   Proposal:

      1) We leave the word "structure" in the checkpoint text
         (Allow the user to navigate according to structure.)
      2) Explain that structure is based on the document object
         model (in the generic sense) but may have more
         semantic information when known for the markup language.
      2) Therefore, the minimal requirement (since the goals are
         orientation and rapid navigation) is to allow navigation
         according to the semantic model known for the markup language,
         paying particular attention to block and grouping mechanisms.
      3) Add Al's comments to techniques document.

>     5.PR#207: Interpretation checkpoint 2.1
>       http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#207
 
   Proposal:

   1) Leave 2.1 checkpoint text the same.
      ("Make available all content, including equivalent 
        alternatives for content.")
   2) Require that for content known by specification to
      be for users (including information in style sheets),
      that a document source view does not suffice.
   3) A document source view (or better) satisfies the requirement 
      of making content available when otherwise difficult
      (e.g., style sheets, script source) or when it is not
      possible to know from the markup language specification
      which content is meant for users.
   4) The "document source" view is not a view of the
      document object (the structured navigation view). The
      user should find for example, raw script and style
      sheet data in the source view.
