While this may feel good as a principle, I have a problem with the "which
content is meant for users" concept.  Let me correct that.  I think the WAI
and the W3C should have a problem with that distinction, as it creates
fatal flaws in e-commerce, not just disability access.  It is just the
users of minority views [such as people with disabilities] who suffer the
consequences first.  [Canary in mineshaft...Universal Design...]

There should be no markup, ever, that is completely beyond the user's
discovery.  It can take N steps to expose and explain it, but it should be
reachable somehow.  This is a key element of the information architecture.
If it isn't self explanatory, the explanation should be discoverable by an
obvious process.  With the Web at our disposal as a way to wire in layers
of backup, there is no excuse for less.

I would like to check this with the PF WG for a formal position.  May I
register a dependency and promise a report on this?

The tactical problem with this split is that it points at a body of
literature which is simply not clear on this point.  To put this language
in the guidelines invites a large rathole of deferred argument.  The
strategic problem is that the distinction should not exist in the ideal
case, so why insert it now?

"What is for display" is view-specific.  Not document-information-generic.

"What is for the user" is not a valid concept in the Universal Access
architecture.  It is a residue of "view chauvenism;" someone's assumption
as to what view the user is using.  All the properties are informative, and
may be exposed in the over-the-wire encoding as text or (where available)
in a friendlier transform of that encoding.
