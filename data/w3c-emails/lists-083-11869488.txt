CMcCN:: "But there is no reason why this should typically be presented
to the user."

WL: "typically...presented" may not be as important as "entirely
available/accessible". If a "discovery tool" can't find out what the
author "had in mind" then neither can a "user". The important thing IMHO
is that whatever means is used to convey semantics not be only available
to Sherlock Holmes.
