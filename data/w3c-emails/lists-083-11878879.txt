Well, there are cases (such as reverse-engineering scripts) where it is only
useful to sherlock holmes - particularly in cases of author error that is
beyond the capability of a User Agent to repair.

  WL: "typically...presented" may not be as important as "entirely
  available/accessible". If a "discovery tool" can't find out what the
  author "had in mind" then neither can a "user". The important thing IMHO
  is that whatever means is used to convey semantics not be only available
  to Sherlock Holmes.
