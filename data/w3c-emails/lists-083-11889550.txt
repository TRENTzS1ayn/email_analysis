AG:: "How do we see if there are any proper exceptions to this rule?
Do others see that this is a general policy that we as PF should be
driving the Web toward?  Other comments?

WL: Don't know that there can be *any* exceptions, let alone *proper*
ones.

Yes.

Although separate maintenance of structure/presentation/content matters,
availability of *all* those is absolutely mandatory. They all contain
(at least potentially) semantics. <H1> isn't just to make a pretty
document, even if that's all the designer used it for.
