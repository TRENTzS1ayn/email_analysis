I agree this is not so hot but is much more workable and better than
nothing. I am still concerned as to this being a P2 or P3 but this would
eliminate the burden  and reliability issue. I would like to hear from
Microsoft regarding this, since they would also need to implement this. A
quick glance at IE indicates to me that given their advanced settings
already in place your suggestion would be reasonable.

If Microsoft also agrees that your suggestion is acceptable we could
address this issue by indicating in the techniques document that this
guideline could be met by "implementing an option to confirm all FORM
submissions, period" and leave this as a P2.

AG::

Maybe you don't need to know if the actual SUBMIT was from a script
activated by an even on the SUBMIT element.  In the sense that a compliant
User Agent would allow the user to defend herself from that by leaving
scripts off, period.  Also see next...

But I understand that without the Views and Events reform in the DOM, it
could get sticky to figure out where the 'submit now' message came from
when you are down in the bowels of the HTTP implementation.  In this case I
would volunteer to start considering that the option might be to "confirm
all FORM submissions, period."  Then the check could be in the deep layer
and not mess with backtracking through the rest.  Not so hot, but (what do
others think?) still a whole lot better than nothing.
