no problem, just expressing my disagreement as to the

i don't have the cycles to discuss this point any longer, suffice it to say
i don't agree that this is a technology-limited problem.

as I read checkpoint 9.2, it asks the UA to "prompt the user to confirm
any form submission triggered indirectly....."which I feel is a reasonable
P2 request.


you're very orginal formal objection post asked:

>"Does anyone else agree with this."

and i'm just stating that I disagree, both allowed in the context of this
discussion.
