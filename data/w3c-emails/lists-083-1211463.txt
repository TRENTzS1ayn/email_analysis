Aloha, Jon!

In my response to Ian's announcement of a new draft, i noted that I am
uncertain about the status slash fate of the second checkpoint for Guideline 10
which I proposed in the post archived at (long URI warning!)
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999JulSep/0139.html

From a review of the minutes of past meetings, it is unclear (at least to me)
whether this proposed checkpoint, which 
explicitly addresses event handled forms and forms that lack a user-addressable
SUBMIT mechanism,  has been dropped, or merely subsumed into Checkpoint10.6

Could, therefore, discussion of (or at least a vote on) the second proposed
checkpoint for GL10 be added to the agenda for the 1 September telecon?

For convenience's sake, the text of the proposed checkpoint follows:

If the submission of a form is achieved via a script or an event handler,
prompt the user for confirmation before submitting the form content. [Priority
1]
        * NOTE: This checkpoint is intended to extend the user's control 
        over automated submission mechanisms, such as the HTML4 
        event handler "onchange", as well as over forms which lack a 
        user-addressable SUBMIT mechanism
        * Refer also to Checkpoint 5.8 

Please note that the archived post referred to above contains proposed
techniques for this checkpoint.

thanks,
        gregory.
