I know you are working hard to make this clear, but I don't really
understand, yet.

What is the objective that you are working toward?  

I am wondering if this objective fits under Guideline 2.  I see Guideline
2. as addressing coverage requirements, the accessibility of information
not as avoiding interface failure modes, but more primitively in terms of
"there has to be some state of the view configuration which gets to
everything in the document."  This requirement is intentionally vague about
what the various views are.

While Guideline 2. could be considered to come under the topic of view
control, it does not contain the general view control topic in itself.  I
am wondering if 2.1.a as you have stated it doesn't constitute "topic
creep" as regards Guideline 2.

The concerns with equivalents may be better considered as specific
constraints on what kinds of views must be available.  For  example, one
could discuss the candidate requirement 

Views orthogonal to equivalents:

For each view presenting one from a group of equivalents, there must be an
equivalent view available with each of the equivalent alternatives
substituted in what is otherwise the same collection of information as in
the original view.
