Yes.  That statement I can readily agree with.

My chief concern as regards the UAAG is that nothing be said in the
checkpoints which gives readers the impression that the scope of Guideline
2 is somehow narrower than what you state as point 1. in the above
recapitulation.

There are multiple requirements affecting the view repertory:

[P1] You gotta give access to everything.  

[P2] You gotta take all readily achievable measures to make it usable.  

[P2/P3] Where there are multiple readily achievable presentations that have
different usable/unusable characteristics for different groups, you have to
give the user a choice.  [priority level per view-alternative-choice
depends on the worst case usability rating for all groups]

Only the first of these fits under Guideline 2, so far as I can see.  The
way we state the second should not be allowed to create the appearance of
watering down the first.
