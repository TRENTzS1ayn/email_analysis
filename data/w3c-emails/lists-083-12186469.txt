Some thoughts.
1> It seems that there are three types of information.  Let's call them
data, instructions and rendered content or something like that.  I think
there should be a way to state that a source view is not sufficient without
saying so if we employ the types of information being discussed
appropriately.  I am not certain as to what the propper positive way is but
know that there is one.  Just taking the sentence:
"a source view is not sufficient." and turning it inside out can yeild:
"the minimum requirement is that which results in all content being rendered
in an intellegible way.
I know.  we have to define intellegible but I have done a lot of reading of
this thread and will follow it to its conclusion and I am at this point now.

If things become clearer for me, I will be happy to make them known.  
Thanks!
