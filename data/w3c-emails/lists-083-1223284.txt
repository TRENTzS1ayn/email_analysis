Interesting one on Opera. There is a configurable option about what
is presented as a tol tip for links - nothing, the URI, or the title (I
think). I imagine that is what JFW vocalises, but I don't know if there are
multiple ways of doing it.

Haakon might be able to tell us...

  one example can be drawn from the amount of information that JFW makes
  available when the user tabs from link to link...  using JFW and MSIE (4 or 5),
  if a TITLE has been defined for a hyperlink, one hears the TITLE text
  announced, whereas in Netscape, the hyperlink text is spoken, even when a TITLE
  has been defined for a hyperlink...  moving from link to link using Opera's
  native keyboard support -- that is, by using the Q or CONTROL+UpArrow keys to
  move to the next link and A or CONTROL+DownArrow to move to the next link -- 
  neither the hyperlink text nor the TITLE, if present, is spoken...  moreover,
  as one moves from link to link, only the content of the first non-active
  element in the current viewport is announced ...  even when using a customized
  script for Opera 3.6 (such as that available from the JFW mailing list's
  hyperarchive) -- so that one can TAB from link to link (a keystroke which is
  second nature to most web surfers), and so that the current viewport is
  automatically spoken -- moving from link to link does NOT cause any aural
  output to be issued by JFW...
  
  as for how this refers to the UAGL, (a) knowing where one is as one moves from
  link to link is the basis of web navigation, and (b) i believe that exposing
  the information contained within a hyperlink is covered by (amongst others)
