aloha, rich!

i may well have, due to the connectivity problems that delayed the 
transmission of the message which was recently posted to the UA mailing 
list, but which was composed immediately following receipt of your first 
iteration of your formal objection...

i will use the mail archive to peruse the thread, and comment if i deem 
that i have anything further to contribute to the discussion...

gregory.
