The best I could do for Tuesday May 2nd is move the start time from 2:00 
EST to 1:30 EST.  This will give members of the AU group an hour on the 
call before the AU meeting.

New telecon information:

Date: Tuesday, May 2, 2000
Time: 1:30 - 3:00 pm EST USA
Phone: Longfellow Bridge at +1-617-252-1038.
