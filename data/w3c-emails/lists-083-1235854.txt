I prefer "initiate" since that is a concept that applies more
widely: changes that the user does not initiate may be disorienting.
Also, the expression "activate a form submission" didn't ring well
to me. "Submit a form" is the best - any way to rephrase it that way?

Please let me know why you prefer "activate" to "initiate".

If not, let's put it on the agenda for Weds.
