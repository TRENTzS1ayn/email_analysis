Yes.

I don't think this is true. Some views could not be accessible,
as long as the user can get equivalent functionality in other views.
Just like for the documentation: some documentation may be inaccessible
as long as at least one version is.

This is a comment on 2.

This is a special case of 2.

Yes, that seems ok.

I don't understand this now. Why is it only necessary to provide a
scrolling mechanism when the default config has been changed?

I think "substitute" is too strong. Is it sufficient to provide
alternative content in addition to (e.g., in a tool tip) primary
content? Can we just say "Ensure that alternatives are available"?

Checkpoint 4.7 gives very precise instructions for graphical
positioning. The proposed 2.1c, makes a larger requirement.
Hos is 2.1c different from 2.6?

  "Allow the user to specify that text transcripts, 
   collated text transcripts, captions, and auditory
   descriptions be rendered at the same time as the 
   associated auditory and visual tracks. Respect
   author-specified synchronization cues during rendering."

I don't think we should add this checkpoint to the 
guidelines at this time. Synchronized views are undoubtedly useful, but 
this is a brand-new requirement. I'm pretty sure this is covered
in the techniques document. Can we just consider it a technique?

I don't think this will be useful to many people in practice. How
many users know that an attribute is, let alone attributes of an XML
application they've never used before? This is a special case of
checkpoint 2.1a that I don't think needs its own checkpoint. I propose
instead that we suggest techniques that ensure that this is done.
