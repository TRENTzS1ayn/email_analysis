I am concerned about the possible result of the following where the source
view is actually used?
begin quoted portion:

end of quoted portion

with each if there must be an else and even tough a source view would be
something if there were nothing else hence the else, I wouldn't call it
meeting any requirement under any circumstances.  I know we are trying hard
to isolate it out here and I am aware of some of the possible benefits of a
source view but for me it has no place in accessability.  I am also aware
that we don't want not to be able to get at the source view if for some
reason we want or need to access it and that the rule of not hiding anything
that should not be hidden should be followed.  I just get the sense here
that if one wishes, they can feel comfortable providing a source view
because they don't feel like providing other views or alternatives.  a
source view is one view it does not stand alone and cannot stand alone as an
accessable one.
