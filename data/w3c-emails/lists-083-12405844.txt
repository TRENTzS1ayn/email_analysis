JRG: I think saying that all views do not need to be accessible is 
problematic.  A developer could say that the source view is the accessible 
view for their application and I don't need to make any other views 
accessible.  I think we need to have a requirement that all views are 
accessible.

JRG: AG and JW think this is a critical need.  Others on telecons have said 
this is important too.  I agree though that most people will not know what 
to use it for.

JRG: I should have said maybe.  For example, in a graphical user agent this 
may require
the ability of the user to scroll the contents of a view in a view port so 
that information rendered in larger fonts can still be viewed.

The example is just a technique.  In general we would want to encourage 
implementations the minimize horizontal and vertical scrolling.

JRG: I used the word substitute to emphasize that the alternative must be 
in the same view as the primary content.  Substitute may not be the best 
word, I would encourage other suggestions that make clear the requirement 
of rendering the alternative equivalents in the same view as primary content.

JRG: This is the same as 2.6 and I with draw the proposed 2.1c.

JRG: This seems to be a requirement from the group.  But if the group 
doesn't want it, we can move it to the techniques document.

JRG: I agree, but many people have said this information is very valuable 
to the few users with disabilities that understand it.
