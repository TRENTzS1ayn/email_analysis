David,

I think your concern is that some developers may provide a source view and 
say that it is the accessible view of the document, especially for making 
alternative equivalents available to the user.  We have a requirement that 
all viewports be accessible and that alternative equivalents be available 
through any view that shows primary content.  So even through they may 
provide a source view, they need to make other views accessible to conform 
to the UAAG.

Jon
