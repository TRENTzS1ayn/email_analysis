JRG: Quesions:
1. Is it views or view ports that make alternative equivalents available?

2. Do users make configuration adjustments on view ports or views?

2.a For example, if I change a font size, an I changing the view port or 
the view?

2.b For example, if I change the display property of a user style sheet 
from block to none.  Have I changed the view or the view port?

Thanks,
Jon
