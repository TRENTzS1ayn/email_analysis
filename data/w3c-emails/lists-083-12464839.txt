I would agree that all views need to be accessible in the sense that the
content rendered in the view must also be made available to outside AT.
Obviously, a graphic is not going to be accessible to a person who is blind,
but the alt text of the graphic must always be available through the API to
the AT.

Just imagine the case where the user of an AT interface changes the browser
to a view that is not accessible, and can't get back!

I don't think I agree. Maybe part of the problem is whether we're
talking about "view" or "viewport".

I think this is covered by access to content. Just indicate as a
technique
that people could select an element and query attributes.

Ensure that all equivalents are available in the same view.

I hadn't heard a requirement for two or more synchronized views.

I still think this should only be a technique.
