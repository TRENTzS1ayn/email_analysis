I'm not fussed by either word. I think that the checkpoint actually expresses
the requirement of the further proposed checkpoint, which I therefore suggest
is redundant and can be dropped.

  I prefer "initiate" since that is a concept that applies more
  widely: changes that the user does not initiate may be disorienting.
  Also, the expression "activate a form submission" didn't ring well
  to me. "Submit a form" is the best - any way to rephrase it that way?
  
  Please let me know why you prefer "activate" to "initiate".

  I may simply have missed it. Did we discuss it at the teleconf?
  If not, let's put it on the agenda for Weds.
