If we define content to include attributes, then the statement:

would also mean "alternative equivalents to attributes should be available
through the User Interface in place of or in conjunction with the primary
attributes" - which no longer makes sense.   I was just substituting the
word "attribute" for the word "content", since attribute is currently part
of the definition of content.  If attribute we NOT part of the definition,
then I couldn't substitute the words.  My point being that when I
substitute the word "attribute" for the word "content", many of our
statements no longer make sense - hence my request to delete attributes
from the definition of content.
