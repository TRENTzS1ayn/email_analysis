I don't think the straightforward substitution works because it
necessarily excludes other pieces of the puzzle. Access to equivalents
means equivalents however they are specified: by attribute values (alt),
by reference (longdesc), in content (OBJECT), in HTTP headers, etc.
Choosing one piece without the others is likely to lead to some
incomplete statements.
