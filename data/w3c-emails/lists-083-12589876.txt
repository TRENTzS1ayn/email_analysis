IJ: We have said "content, including equivalent alternatives" in the
past to ensure that people pay attention to this. While I agree that
technically it's not necessary, I think that it's helpful.

IJ: I agree.

IJ: I have problems with this if 2.1 is supposed to be through
    the user interface only. If we are talking about users with
    assistive technologies primarily, then access through the DOM
    is the preferred solution. Therefore, 2.1 is not primarily for users
    who rely on speech or braille. It is for users with disabilities
    of the UA's user interface.

IJ: There's a little editorial glitch (s/content all content/all
content/).
    Otherwise, I'm ok with the change.

IJ: We may be dropping the "human consumption" part, since apparently
    it does not make much of a difference.

IJ: I would say that "are not needed" is too strong a statement. I think
that it's one of the key pieces, though perhaps neither sufficient nor
necessarily, stricly speaking.
