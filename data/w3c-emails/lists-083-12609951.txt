I have some comments on Ian's comments.

I hadn't thought of checkpoint 2.1 as being specifically related to access
through the user interface, but with checkpoint 1.1 covering the APIs, I
suppose that might be implied. 

Wouldn't the applicability provisions kick in so that developers of user
agents would know what applied?

IJ: I have problems with this if 2.1 is supposed to be through
    the user interface only. If we are talking about users with
    assistive technologies primarily, then access through the DOM
    is the preferred solution. Therefore, 2.1 is not primarily for users
    who rely on speech or braille. It is for users with disabilities
    of the UA's user interface.
