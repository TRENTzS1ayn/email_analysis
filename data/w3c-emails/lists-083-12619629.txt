How is this different from Guideline 2?

I am coming around to the view that we should separate out the content of
the markup from the content marked by the markup in the checkpoints.  Let
the Guideline address the information content as a whole, and the
checkpoints address separately the classes of content that people may think
of as different.

So:

Checkpoint:  Ensure that the user has access to all properties encoded in
the markup.
Note: the entity type name in XML or HTML is included, along with
attributes, in the scope of such properties.

Checkpoint:  Ensure that the user has access to all data contained within
or referenced from the markup.

[Guideline: Present content appropriately.  Note: text view of inline .AU
or .GIF does not satisfy the above checkpoint.]

Consider moving this to the navigation section.  There is a generic
requirement to provide navigation functions when the rendered content of a
view exceeds the concurrent display capability of the viewport.  Add a note
that this is almost always the case in a variety of adaptive modes.  The
fact that this includes when the user has adjusted the rendering rules
should be a note, not a checkpoint.  There can be a note with a cross
reference under Guideline 2.

AG::

It is hard to imagine justifying even a Priority 2 for this strong a rule.
Clearly if each alternative equivalent is available in some usable view,
then there are no Priority 1 failures.

Consider the following alternate development:

Guideline: Stay as close to the author's presentation concept as you can.

Checkpoint: Present alternative equivalents in the same context as what
they are alternatives for.  Note: see 2.6 for a corollary for temporal media.]


Checkpoint: Make it possible to present multiple equivalents at the same time.

Note: Usually equivalents substitute, but there are access-required use
cases where they are presented in addition to the prior alternative.

AG::

Checkpoint.  At least P3, possibly P2.

Technique: support navigating to "here, in view X."  Equivalently, view
selection from context menu would move to synchronized location in another
view.

AG::

What does the script write to?  Doesn't it write into the document object,
and it gets rendered from there?  Therefore there is the basic DOM-dumper
procedure that give you a source view of whatever the script has changed
the virtual source to.

AG::

Yes (too specific), and yes (solves accessibility problem).

This is a technique.  Does not belong as a checkpoint.

This technique should be described in the UAAG in conjunction with
Guideline 2.  It demonstrates that Guideline 2. is readily achievable, does
not impose undue burden.  It is a generic strategy that is applicable to
XML documents and is expected [current estimate of PF WG, at least.] to be
necessary as part of the XML accessibility-support system.

It does not deliver the very best in usability, but for many pieces of
information it is better than a raw source view.  It is expected to be
needed frequently when neither the user agent nor the author has
anticipated the combination of user needs and content structure that
happens in practice.

Sample of discussion from PF call:

<quote>

AG: generic UA doesn't need to provide look up tables [friendly
translations] for
all media for all dialects of XML, but since text in XML,
ought to give you original text as one of your choices

JW: basically agree, but only a minimal requirement;
sometimes the markup is all you have--especially if you
don't have a stylesheet!

AG: UA should be providing a minimal requirement, and not
assume that there is a stylesheet, let alone a good one;
access to attribute information provides basis for overlay
of client stylesheet

RS: agree; good target for developers; if want to render
more, go for it!

<end quote>

It is something that is easy for the User Agent to do that puts a floor
under the usability level of the practically-available presentation styles.

This is a rough summary of our discussion on the PF call yesterday, where
there was general agreement.  No formal vote has been taken or documeted
position taken.

Related recommendation:

Move all discussion of source view and property inspection to techniques
discussion in the guidelines document.   This section should say the
following things:

Property inspection is expected to be significantly more usable than source
view for many properties.  

Source view may be the most usable readily-achievable view for some content
such as embedded fragments of style and script languages.
