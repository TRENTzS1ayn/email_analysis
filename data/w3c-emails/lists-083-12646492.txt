Because it suggests that the Techniques document is part of the
Guidelines document, which it is not. That is why we removed it
from the WCAG 1.0 navbar.

As an appendix sounds good.

Yes, that can be changed.

Same reason for not having links back to the guidelines.

Yes.

Appendix.

There is only a backlink to the guidelines since the checklist
is an appendix to the guidelines.

I don't consider the ideas in this case to be dogfood.  Thank you
for suggesting them. I do not think we should include Guidelines / 
Techniques links from the tops of those documents, however.  They
refer to each other mutually, and thus appear in the references
section.
