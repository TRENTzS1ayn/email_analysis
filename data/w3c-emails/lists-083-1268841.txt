Rich,
It is possible to discuss another category at the meeting wednesday and I
am sure it will be discussed.  But I would really like to have only two
right.  I was wondering how many other checkpoints besides the ones in
Guideline 6 "Observe system conventions and standard interfaces" would be
of concern for HPR if you were trying to comply with the dependent user
agent sub-grouping.
Thanks,
Jon
