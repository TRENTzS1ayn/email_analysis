Some of the questions I would like to see explored on the joint UA/WC 
telecon today include:

Problem: Many web sites have similar beginnings to their pages so when 
people using speech go to a new web page in that site they often think they 
have not anywhere because the beginning of the page is all the same.

Questions:
1. How can markup be used to allow authors to skip to new content in a web 
site?

2. Can blocks (or chunks) of a page (other than lists of links which can be 
contained in a MAP element) be marked up to indicate the type of 
information and scope of the relationship (i.e. advertisements on a page, 
or the article in a newspaper, or information on a services, a stock quote).

3. What markup can be used to allow the user to move to those items quickly?

4. What is the user agents responsibility to provide within document 
navigation based on markup and what is the authors responsibility to 
provide links for within document navigation?

One Idea

1. A normally hidden MAP element could be used to provide links to "chunks" 
of information on a web page.  For user agents that support style sheets 
the user, could know the class of the hidden MAP block and use a user style 
sheet to expose the links.
