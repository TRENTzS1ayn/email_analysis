I can see it being used to change the grouping of controls, so I can put the
three controls I use in a group that suits me, and remove the ones I don't
use, and so I can make the controls big enough to easily identify. Think of
Netscape, which has big or little pictures and/or text for the major control
buttons, as an example.

  Charles,
  
  I'm trying to finish up a draft of the impact matrix.  Could you explain how
  you seen this feature being utilized? Would this include things like moving
  the
  toolbar from the top of the window to the side of the window? Or are we
  talking
  about moving individual controls (e.g. place the back button in the lower left
  hand corner?)
