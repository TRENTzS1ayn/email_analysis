This is not an unusual response and one I hear quite frequently from
clients. There appear to be several reasons for the viewpoint -- some which
are valid, some are invalid, and some philosophical.

The WAI is an invaluable organization/resource and the central repository
for web accessibility. All those who work for the program office or within
the various working groups have worked diligently for the past 3 years to
deliver the right "goods" as it were.

No one has made the claim that the WAI guidelines and tools are THE absolute
answer. No one has made the claim that these guidelines/tools are perfect.
On the other hand, the WAI program office has continually put out requests
to its member organizations for support at every level, including the
quality and legitimacy of their current recommendations.

I doubt there's a single person within the WAI framework who doesn't believe
that things can be inproved -- it's a natural part of the standards
evolutionary process. Given time, I believe most of the kinks will be worked
out. Until then, it's up to the rest of us to support and mediate.
