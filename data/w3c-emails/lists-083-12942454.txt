JRG: In agree that the use of standard APIs for identifying which active 
elements has focus is covered in other checkpoints.  This checkpoint is 
about how focus is indicated to the user through the user interface.  Like 
on a graphical display using borders with adjustable colors and line 
widths.  I think the trick for this checkpoint is what are the minimum 
requirements.  Certainly using APIs to expose focus information is part of 
the minimum, but what else?  A border? Use of system conventions for 
indicating focus?
