Hi Gregory,

What you propose below is that user agents bypass
the standard Windows task control mechanism (which is apparently
buggy). I have problems with this technique since it seems
to contract the checkpoint that requires user agents to
use standard controls of the operating system. If the Windows
mechanism is buggy, it should be fixed. I don't think we
should ask Windows UAs to reimplement something as basic
as the task navigation tool. Furthermore, this seems to
be out of scope for user agents - we should not require them
to track all Windows of the operating system.
