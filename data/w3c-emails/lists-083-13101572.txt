Hello,

I've published the 7 May UA Guidelines [1] and Techniques [2]
documents, incorporating resolutions to Proposed Recommendation
issues. These are both Working Drafts for Working Group review
to determine whether the resolutions of the Working Group
have been accurately recorded. 

I have begun to edit the list of changes [3] but have
only finished about 75% of the changes; I'll finish the list
tonight.

I have spent more effort on the Guidelines this round than
the Techniques, so there are a handful of Techniques that
have not yet been integrated.

Also, I did not add a checkpoint about synchronized views.
Please refer to my email on this topic [4]. The document
does contain two proposals that have not yet been approved
by the Working Group ([5], [6], [7]).

I think this draft incorporates almost all of the other
issue resolutions. I does not address the issue of minimal conformance
(issue 257), which is still open.

I will send more comments as they occur to me.

 - Ian
