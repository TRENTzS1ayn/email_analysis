Ian,
My initial suggestions is that the UA could render "Japanese Phrase" XXXX 
"end Japanese Phrase", where XXX is some characters, or if Japanese is 
unsupported XXXX is nothing and the "end Japanese phrase" would probably 
not be needed.  I am assuming the user agent is doing this because it 
cannot render the Japanese.

Jon
