JRG: The main context of the issue of synchronization came up in was in 
source or dom views. The need was to have a way to orient the user to the 
source or dom view of what had generated the selected content in their 
primary view.

JRG: Probably the minimum requirement would be synchronizing a source or 
dom view with the primary view.   I

JRG: I am not sure that two primary views of the same resources should be 
synchronized.  I think if we want to do this the synchronized view needs to 
be some type of view-only view or something the user doesn't interact with 
directly.  The main purpose of the synchronized view was to allow access to 
"machine" content in a way that was easy for the user.  In our discussions 
these were view only views.  The user did not interact with them.

JRG: I think the outline view right now would be a good place to require 
the synchronization.

JRG: I think it would be wise for the group to drop the synchronization 
checkpoint and consider synchronization as part of the minimum requirement 
for 7.6 and/or 8.5.
