Hello,

I've published a document that proposes a framework for 
determining conformance requirements for the checkpoints 
of the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0. I estimate
that the checkpoints in sections 1 and 2 can be readily
addressed and that the WG should focus on section 3.
Comments on all are welcome (e.g., whether 
you agree with the categorization, whether you think a 
different categorization would be better for thinking 
about the checkpoints, etc.).

 - Ian
