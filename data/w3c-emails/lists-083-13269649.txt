Ian,
I think that the user agent should allow for configuration of the following 
options.  But option one in each case should be used if the user agent does 
not support configuration.

When the author specified language is supported:

1. Announce that a language change is taking place and speak the 
word/phrase in the supported language

2. Do not announce that a language change is taking place and speak the 
word/phrase in the supported language

When the author specified language is non supported:

1. Announce that a language change has taken place and that it is not supported

2. Allow the user to get the numerical character information of the 
unsupported language

Note: Language change announcements are in the users default language for 
the synthesizer


Jon
