Hmm ... if language change doesn't occur frequently, that would make
sense, but when it occurs frequently, I think announcing language
changes would be rather annoying than helpful.

Suppose that a user's primary language is Japanese, and a speech user
agent supports Japanese and English.  These days many English words
appear in Japanese documents, especially in technical documents.
For example, when I'm reading a guidebook for HTML, I don't want to
hear "English Phrase" "HTML" "end English Phrase" each time a word
"HTML" appears if a UA doesn't support configuration - in that case
I have no way to stop it!  Anyway, I strongly recommend that UAs
should allow configuration so that users can choose not to announce
language changes.

BTW, I'm wondering what a UA should do when most part of a document
is written in unsupported language(s).  I tried IBM's Home Page
Reader 2.5 (English version), and it does change speech engine
when a document's language is specified via the `lang' attribute
of the `html' element.  It speaks languages like French and German
pretty well, in addition to English.

However, when it encountered a Japanese document, which is not
supported by the English version of HPR, the result was quite
terrible.  It got all Japanese characters as garbage (i.e.
misinterpreted them as Latin-1 characters), and just read those
garbage literally.  Just too bad.
(Note: the Japanese version of HPR speaks Japanese pretty well, though.)

In this case, is it appropriate that just announcing the document's
language is not supported and don't read the document?
