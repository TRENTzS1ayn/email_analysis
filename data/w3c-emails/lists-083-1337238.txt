aloha, dave!

thanks for your valuable additions to my notes on installing IE5 using JFW 3.3

you are quite correct by summing up my verbosity, thus:

The impression is given here that this is precarious at best but
although bothersom, it is doable.

there is definite room for improvement, but installation of MSIE by a blind
user using a screen reader is quite doable, especially if that user doesn't
choose "custom install"...  and, of course, the reason most users choose
automatic  installation when it is offered to them is that they trust the
installation software to do what it is supposed to do -- install a new
browser...  unfortunately, when you leave the installation of a UA to the
automated installation process, you may find that, once you exit the
installation program, configurations have changed on your computer without
either your knowledge or consent....

take for example, the installation of IE5 or the G2 edition of RealPlayer --
when they install themselves automatically, they can (depending upon the
content of the executable being used, and users don't always have control over
the executable available to them) seize control over the playback of all audio
formats from the media players whose commands you know, which work well with
your screen reader, and seamlessly with your software synthesizer -- none of
which can be said to be true for their replacements, Windows Media Player 6.4
and RealPlayer6... 

and developers wonder why people aren't more quote conscientious unquote about
upgrading their browsers...
