I would like to try to use our teleconference time more efficiently so I 
would like to try to resolve some issues using the list.

Ian has proposed rewording for checkpoint 7.6 [1] to resolve proposed 
recommendation issue 233 [2] and included the proposal in the 7 May working 
draft[3].  The following is his proposal:

<PROPOSED>
7.6 Allow the user to navigate efficiently to and among important 
structural elements identified by the author. [Priority 2]

Note after checkpoint: Structured navigation of headings, tables, forms, 
lists, etc. is most effective when available in conjunction with a 
configurable view (checkpoint 8.4 and checkpoint 8.5). Users should be able 
to navigate to  important pieces of content within a configurable view, 
identify the type of object they have navigated to, interact with that 
object easily (if its an active element), and recall the surrounding 
context (orient themselves). Use operating system conventions to indicate 
navigation progress (e.g., selection or content focus).
</PROPOSED>

Please respond to this e-mail as soon as possible if you think that we need 
further discussion of the wording of this checkpoint. If there are no 
responses I will assume that people are satisfied with the rewording of 
this checkpoint and I will remove the issue from the issue list.  If there 
is a request for further discussion I will add discussion of the proposal 
to the next available telecon.

Thanks,
Jon
