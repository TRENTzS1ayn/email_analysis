I would like to try to use our teleconference time more efficiently so I 
would like to try to resolve some issues using the list.

Ian has proposed moving checkpoint 5.6 to guideline 8 and for changing the 
wording of checkpoint 8.7 [1] and included the proposal in the 7 May 
working draft [2].  The following is his proposal:

<OLD>
5.6 Implement selection, content focus, and user interface focus 
mechanisms. [Priority 1]
      Note: Refer also to checkpoint 7.1 and checkpoint 5.5. Note. This 
checkpoint is an important special case of checkpoint 5.5.
</OLD>

<PROPOSED>
8.8 Implement selection, content focus, and user interface focus 
mechanisms. [Priority 1]
      Note: Follow system conventions for these mechanisms, per checkpoint 
5.8. Refer also to checkpoint 7.1.
<PROPOSED>

<OLD>
8.7 Provide a mechanism for highlighting and identifying active elements 
(through a standard interface where available). [Priority 2]
      Note. User agents may satisfy this checkpoint by implementing the 
appropriate style sheet mechanisms, such as link highlighting.
</OLD>

<PROPOSED>
8.10 Provide a mechanism for highlighting and identifying active elements. 
[Priority 2]
      Note: On most systems, the focus is used to identify and highlight 
active elements.
</PROPOSED>

Please respond to this e-mail as soon as possible if you think that we need 
further discussion of the movement and/or the wording of checkpoint 5.6. If 
there are no responses I will assume that people are satisfied with the 
rewording of this checkpoint.  If there is a request for further discussion 
I will add discussion of the proposal to the next available telecon.

Thanks,
Jon
