Based on Ian's analysis [1] of the problems of including a synchronization 
checkpoint I recommend that we reverse our decision to include a checkpoint 
on synchronization.  I base this on the following reasons:

1. The group has identified a couple situations where synchronization is 
useful, but there are other situations where a user may not want 
synchronization of views or synchronized views may impede 
accessibility.  This requirement therefore needs to be further developed to 
determine when synchronization is or is not appropriate.  My feeling is 
that these would be in situations covered by current checkpoints (i.e. 
outline views, source views...)

2. This is a new requirement and it may trigger the document to return to a 
previous stage in the process, delaying publication as a recommendation and 
taking time from resolving other issues.

3. We have and can include in additional techniques for the situations the 
group has identified where synchronized views make sense.  The techniques 
will encourage developers to use synchronization in satisfying the 
associated checkpoints.  Therefore we are not abandoning the need for 
synchronization of some views, but making them part of satisfying other 
checkpoints.

Please respond to this e-mail either in favor or in opposition to this 
resolution.  If there is opposition to the proposal I will include this 
issue in the next available telecon.  No response to this issue will result 
in my assuming that you support the proposal.  But I would rather have 
members explicitly state their support or opposition to this proposal to 
the list.

Thanks,
Jon
