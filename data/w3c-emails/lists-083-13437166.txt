Re: Adopt proposed revision of checkpoint 7.6

Following are a few minor edits.

Old (From 7 May 2000 UA Guidelines):

7.6 Allow the user to navigate efficiently to and among important structural
elements identified by the author. [Priority 2]

Note after checkpoint: Structured navigation of headings, tables, forms,
lists, etc. is most effective when available in conjunction with a
configurable view (checkpoint 8.4 and checkpoint 8.5). Users should be able
to navigate to important pieces of content within a configurable view,
identify the type of object they have navigated to, interact with that
object easily (if its an active element), and recall the surrounding context
(orient themselves). Use operating system conventions to indicate navigation
progress (e.g., selection or content focus).

New:

7.6 Allow the user to navigate efficiently to and among important structural

conjunction with a configurable view (checkpoint 8.4 and checkpoint 8.5).
Users should be able to navigate to important pieces of content within a
configurable view, identify the type of object they have navigated to,
interact with that object easily (if <CHANGE>it is</CHANGE> an active
element), and recall the surrounding context (<CHANGE> to</CHANGE>orient
themselves). Use operating system conventions to indicate navigation
progress (e.g., selection or content focus).


New Techniques:
...
User agents should construct the navigation view with the goal of breaking
content into sensible pieces according to the author's design. In most
cases, user agents should not break down content into individual elements
for navigation; <CHANGE>element-by-element</CHANGE> navigation of the
document object does not meet the goal of facilitating navigation to
important pieces of content.
...
Allow users to navigate synchronized multimedia presentations<DELETE>in
time</DELETE>. Refer also to checkpoint 4.6.
