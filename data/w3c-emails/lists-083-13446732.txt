I would like to try to use our teleconference time more efficiently so I 
would like to try to resolve some issues using the list.

Ian has proposed rewording for checkpoint 9.4 [1] to change the word 
loading to transferring and included the proposal in the 7 May working 
draft [2]. The following is his proposal:

<OLD>
9.4 When loading content (e.g., document, image, audio, video, etc.) 
indicate what proportion of the content has loaded and whether loading has 
stalled. [Priority 3]
</OLD>

<PROPOSED>
9.4 When transferring content (e.g., a document, image, audio, video, etc.) 
indicate what proportion of the content has been transferred and whether 
the transfer has stalled. [Priority 3]
</PROPOSED>

Please respond to this e-mail as soon as possible if you think that we need 
further discussion of the wording of this checkpoint. If there are no 
responses I will assume that people are satisfied with the rewording of 
this checkpoint. If there is a request for further discussion I will add 
discussion of the proposal to the next available telecon.

Thanks,
Jon
