The addition is large enough so that perhaps it should be included in the
techniques and as a minimal requirement.

7.6 Allow the user to navigate efficiently to and among important
structural elements identified by the author. [Priority 2]

Note after checkpoint: Structured navigation of frames, headings, tables,
forms,
lists, etc. is most effective when available in conjunction with a
configurable view (checkpoint 8.4 and checkpoint 8.5). Users should be able
to navigate to  important pieces of content within a configurable view,
identify the type of object they have navigated to, interact with that
object easily (if its an active element), and recall the surrounding
context (orient themselves). Use operating system conventions to indicate
navigation progress (e.g., selection or content focus).
</PROPOSED>

Comments:

I don't think that identifying the element navigated to should be in this
checkpoint. I believe this is handled by another checkpoint.

Also, navigation to these elements should be along the DOM Tree path
following a depth-first order where the first node is the leftmost leaf.
This is the same as a postorder traversal.

Subject:  IMPORTANT: Adopt proposed revision of checkpoint 7.6 (response
      requested)



I would like to try to use our teleconference time more efficiently so I
would like to try to resolve some issues using the list.

Ian has proposed rewording for checkpoint 7.6 [1] to resolve proposed
recommendation issue 233 [2] and included the proposal in the 7 May working
draft[3].  The following is his proposal:

<PROPOSED>
7.6 Allow the user to navigate efficiently to and among important
structural elements identified by the author. [Priority 2]

Note after checkpoint: Structured navigation of headings, tables, forms,
lists, etc. is most effective when available in conjunction with a
configurable view (checkpoint 8.4 and checkpoint 8.5). Users should be able
to navigate to  important pieces of content within a configurable view,
identify the type of object they have navigated to, interact with that
object easily (if its an active element), and recall the surrounding
context (orient themselves). Use operating system conventions to indicate
navigation progress (e.g., selection or content focus).
</PROPOSED>

Please respond to this e-mail as soon as possible if you think that we need
further discussion of the wording of this checkpoint. If there are no
responses I will assume that people are satisfied with the rewording of
this checkpoint and I will remove the issue from the issue list.  If there
is a request for further discussion I will add discussion of the proposal
to the next available telecon.

Thanks,
Jon
