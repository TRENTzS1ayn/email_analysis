aloha, charles!

i certainly hope haakon -- and glenn gordon -- is slash are able to help us,
because, right now, no matter what i set the tool tip to display, JFW isn't
echoing anything, nor is it reliably tracking the focus as it moves from link
to link

by the way, it took me quite some time to discover that the tool tip display
menu isn't in the "Link Presentation" sub-menu of Opera's "Preferences" menu,
where i expected to find it, but in the "Button and Statusbar" sub-menu, which
i further learned (by going into screen review and listening to things
character by character, isn't merely the button and statusbar sub-menu, but the
b u t t o n dash space a n d space S t a t u s b a r sub-menu, all of which, i
suppose, makes as much sense as this sentence...

the upshot is that there is a status-bar type display of the link tip text on
the screen, for which, i suppose i could set a JAWS monitoring frame
(automatically voice when content contained within 2 predefined points
changes), but to do that properly, i'd have to know how long the link title bar
is, where it is, whether or not it can ever be obscured by something else on
the screen, etc. -- and then, like as not, my monitoring frame would only
function with anything approaching true reliability if i always ran Opera (or,
rather, Opera was always spawned) in whatever window size i set the frame in,
and i don't know what would happen if the TITLE was longer than the available
screen-display space (i suppose i should have said "viewport"), and, well, you
get the point...

it'd be much simpler (in theory, at least) to get the necessary info (in this
case, the TITLE of a hyperlink) from a DOM call, but how i myself would get
that voiced from within Opera using JFW, i know not... 

anyway, no matter how i set Opera to display tool tips for links, they aren't
being voiced by either JFW or Window-Eyes, which, i, admittedly, am running
without a customized set file for Opera...

HAL, on the other hand, simply reads the hyperlink text, regardless of the tool
tip setting, so it is with HAL that i usually use Opera -- which isn't bad if
the point of the exercise is to keep up one's proficiency at using multiple
screen readers...
