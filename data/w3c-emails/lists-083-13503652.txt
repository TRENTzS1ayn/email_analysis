I am not sure the synchronization should be a requirement for satisfying a 
checkpoint, since there may be techniques that do not require 
synchronization that satisfy a particular checkpoint.  For example if a 
user is typing to find out attribute information for a particular element, 
based on the requirements of checkpoint 2.1.  A source view would provide 
the information, a source view that is synchronized with an element a user 
has selected would be probably be better, but a view of only the current 
attributes for a particular element would be the best solution in this 
case.  So the best technique to satisfy this user need would not require 
synchronization of a source view.

The group felt that synchronization is a priority 2 issue [1] and I think 
we should strongly encourage its use in the places it makes sense.  But I 
don't think we have any situations where if there is not synchronizations, 
somebody can't access information.
