7.6  Allow the user to navigate efficiently to and among important 
structural elements identified by the author. [Priority 2]

Minimum functional requirement:

1.Allow the user to sequentially navigate (through rendering in the current 
view port) the human recognizable structure defined by the resource 
specifications the user agent supports. For example in HTML there are 
header elements and other definitions defined for human understanding. Use 
system highlighting and focus to indicate to the user the current element 
in the navigation sequence.

2.If there are no structural conventions defined or implied in the resource 
for human understanding, use the programmatic structure defined by the 
resource specifications.

7.7 Allow the user to configure structured navigation. [Priority 3]

Minimum requirement:

1.Allow the user to choose which elements of a resource they would like to 
navigate in 7.6. The configuration would allow some elements to be skipped.
