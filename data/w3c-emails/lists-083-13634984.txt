Checkpoint 8.4  Make available to the user an "outline" view of content, 
built from structural elements (e.g., frames, headings, lists, forms, 
tables, etc.).

1.Allow the user to view an outline of the human recognizable structure 
defined of a resource based on the specifications the user agent supports. 
For example in HTML there are header elements and other definitions defined 
for human understanding.

2. If there are no structural conventions defined or implied in the 
resource for human understanding, use the programmatic structure defined by 
the resource specifications to create the outline.


Checkpoint 8.5  Allow the user to configure the outline view.

1. Allow the user to choose which elements of a resource they would like to 
view in 8.4. The configuration would allow some elements to not be rendered.
