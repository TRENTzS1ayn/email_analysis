Hello, 

Per my action item of 11 May [1], please consider this
clarification to checkpoint 8.4. From the 7 May Working
Draft [2]:

<OLD>
8.4 Make available to the user an "outline" view of content, 
    built from structural elements (e.g., frames, headings, 
    lists, forms, tables, etc.).
</OLD>

First some comments:

1) A navigable outline view is very useful (related to 7.6 and 7.7)
2) A non-navigable outline view is still useful, since it can 
   help users understand the organization of content. Thus,
   one important feature of an outline view is that content be
   hidden.
3) Is the outline view supposed to be text only? We may
   not have to specify this and it should be understood that
   if there is non-text content, the user agent needs to
   provide a text equivalent.
4) The outline view is probably supposed to be composed
   of (text) labels for important structural elements.
   In some cases, the content of the elements will not
   appear in the outline view. 

<NEW>
8.4 Make available to the user an "outline" view of content
    composed of labels for important structural
    elements (e.g., heading text, table titles, 
    form titles, etc.).
</NEW>

At the 11 May teleconference, we discussed the link between
checkpoint 7.6 (structured navigation) and 8.4. One possibility
for the minimal requirement of the outline view was that
it be composed of the set of elements navigable according to 7.6.
If checkpoint 7.6 is augmented (refer to proposal [3])
to include dynamic control over the set of navigable elements, 
then it makes sense for 8.4 to be dynamic as well. And 8.5 
(configuration of the outline view), like 7.7, would just be 
about static configuration and could remain a P3.

Please comment,

 - Ian
