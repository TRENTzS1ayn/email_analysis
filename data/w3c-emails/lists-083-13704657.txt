I've some answers to the questions below.  I will await further discussion
on the checkpoints and their priorities though.

dp both unless we have a different checkpoint for one or the other.

dp this is tough and should be applied sensably especially when
configuration gets down to a fine level.  at what point does the element
structure become the actual page?  We have some examples out in the wind of
how this can work.  we can already navigate among links so filling in and
allowing gradients top down say headings down to the specifics of a table
are in order but I again caution to the sensable approach.  I may not be
adding any thing new or terribly insightful here but this is my reaction to
the question.  What I think w ewant to accomplish here is to provide
unimpeeded navigation among elements that one can go into and also among
elements that have contant that can be stepped through below them.  so for
instance, if I am navigating among headings, I can expand that part of the
page below the heading to its ajacent table or set of links.  I see a user
agent that complies with this allowing the tab key to accomplish the
requested navigation or perhaps the arrows or both.  I'd like for instance
to be able to tab through headings bidirectionally especially if the
headings are mused in the proper way by the author.

dp wouldn't applicability apply to xml in this case?

I'd say controll as p2 and configure as p3.

dp the datta is there.  we need to make it work is all.  My thought here is
that we can run into problems when we start asking questions about impropper
use of html for the elements we are trying to configure?

again, when using jfw I encounter situations where I must tweek the
rendering of certain content because it doesn't make sense ie: I have to
turn off the speaking of certain elements because they actually hinder my
use of the page.  For instance, if there is a large graphic on a page and I
ask for a list of links and the graphic is one of the links, I'll hear the
same link name untill I get past that link which may be several to 10
times.  turning off rendering/speaking of graphical links prevents this
behaviour.  similarly, if frame rendering or speaking is giving me trouble
while traversing a page, I can have the frame tags not spoken.

one more note with thanks.  a skip feature is good and jfw uses this in
several ways in ie.
one way is that you can define the size of the first text block to look for
in a page and the other that I know of is that you can be positioned on the
first new link of a page when each page has the navigation or all the same
links at the top.
