JRG: If a user agent only implements the minimum requirement of serial 
access (forward and backward), then the configuration is only the elements 
that the user is navigating to.  If there are more navigation options than 
the user agent could allow for configuration of more items, including 
turning navigation off I suppose.

JRG: The user should be able to pick and subset.  For XML the device should 
enumerate the XML defined elements and let the user select which one the 
user wants to navigate too.  Ideally there should be some information about 
the elements too.  For example whether the element is a child node or can 
have siblings.

JRG: I am not sure what this means.  What is an example of a dynamic control?
Ideally people will use style sheets to define rendered elements and that 
there will be an easy way to switch between style sheets.

JRG: This new checkpoint seems to imply implementation of only the minimum 
requirement for 7.6
