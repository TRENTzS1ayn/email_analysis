JRG: I think the use of important structural elements makes this checkpoint 
clearer.  I think it should provide an outline of all "block" level 
elements.  But I don't know if there is any common understanding of block 
level.  It should be more of a summary of the document, than a tree view of 
the document.  Although a tree view that is confgurable would be the ideal 
I think in this case.  In the case of configuration for XML the user agent 
would need to enumerate the elements to the user for them to select which 
ones should be part of the outline view.  There may also be a need to 
provide additional information on the rendered elements, like what is the 
size of the content for a particular element.
