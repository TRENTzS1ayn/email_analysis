I would like to clarify my view of conformance:

1. The two current sub groups came out of a need seen by the group to
develop minimum standards for commercial mainstream browsers and plug-ins
like Netscape Navigator, Microsft Explorer, Opera and multi-media
technologies for accessibility. A second need seen by the group is to
indicate the types of additional features for technologies like specialized
browsers and other types of "assistive technology" that provide advanced
features to access to web content to persons with severe disabilities that
is currently beyond the scope of current browser technology (i.e. speech,
refreshable Braille).  

2. Part of what the priorities of the checkpoints need to indicate which
checkpoints are currently more important and therefore should be developed
first.  The priorities of checkpoints for the different sub-groups are not
normative and could change over time as technology changes.  Some
checkpoints could even have different priorities in each sub-group
(currently there are none).

3. Part of the work of testing the guidelines is to determine what
chekpoints work for which technologies.  What we want is more usable
interfaces for people with disabilities and that should be our focus.  So
while assistive technology being compatible with other assistive technology
is a great goal and would help people with mulitple disabilities is it the
first thing we want AT developers to consider right now, or are other
checkpoints more important.
