Subject: Suggested Revision to Definitions of Control and Configure - A
correction

This memo is to correct my last memo. I accidentally deleted the second
definition of control. By the way, I can't vouch for the correctness of that
second definition but it seems OK.

<NEW-UNFIXED>
Control (and Configuration)

The term "control" is used in two major contexts in this document. 
(1) governance, such as a user may exercise over interface layout, user
agent behavior, rendering style, and other parameters required by this
document. Such control may be exercised through the user agent's user
interface, through profiles, style sheets, by scripts, etc. The degree and
kind of control that is possible (e.g., colors, font families and sizes,
sound quality, etc.) may depend on system or hardware limitations. Control
that persists, especially across user sessions, may be termed
<bold>configuration</bold>. A users may be able to save configurations
across user agent settings in a <bold>profile</bold>.
