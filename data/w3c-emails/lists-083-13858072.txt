Marco,

This mailing list is used by the User Agent Guidelines Working
Group for discussions about Web accessibility. I recommend that
for future questions about rendering, you consult the HTML [1] 
and CSS [2] home pages for information about markup and styling.

In CSS, you control active link rendering with the ':visited'
pseudo-class [3]. There is an example in the specification.

Thank you,

 - Ian
