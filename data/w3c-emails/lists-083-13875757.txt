David,
I am a little concerned about trying to make individual checkpoint point 
level more complicated and using them to tell developers what needs 
persistence along with another functionality.  I think if we use the word 
control and put our persistence requirements in the configuration section 
we will make the document much easier for developers to understand.  If we 
start to talk about persistence in individual checkpoints then we might as 
well get rid of checkpoint 10.7, since it would be duplicating the 
requirements in other checkpoints.  I would rather see the emphasis on 
control in other checkpoints and then use 10.7 determine what should be 
persistent and use the minimum requirements in 10.7 as the means to define 
persistent features required.

10.7 For the configuration requirements of this document, allow the user to 
save user preferences in a profile. [Priority 2]

Jon
