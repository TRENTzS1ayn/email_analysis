The working group discussed the minimum requirements for Checkpoint 10.4 
Allow the user to change the input configuration. [Priority 2].  After 
reviewing the techniques document the minimum requirements seemed to be 
already covered in other checkpoints, notably 10.5, 10.7, 10.9 and 5.8.

Is there anything that is not in these other checkpoints that could be used 
as the minimum requirement for conforming to 10.4?  If not then I think we 
should delete the checkpoint.
