I object.

1) 10.5 talks about single-key access, not general configuration.
2) 10.7 talks about saving configurations persistently
3) 10.9 talks about graphical UI configuration
4) 5.8 talks about following conventions

While 10.5 comes closest to ensuring configurability of the 
keyboard, it is specifically for single-key access.

Therefore, while I haven't participated in the discussions on
this topic since I'm on the road, I don't agree that the requirement
of 10.4 is covered in other checkpoints.
