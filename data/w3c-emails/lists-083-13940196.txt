Ian,
Can you give an example of any other input configuration that is useful for 
accessibility except changing single command access?

1. We already have a requirement that all functions be accessible through 
the keyboard (1.3)
2. We say to use system conventions (5.8)
3. Allow single key or command configuration (10.5)
4. Configuration of graphical controls (10.9)
5. Saving custom and restoring default configuration information (including 
keyboard bindings) are in checkpoint 10.7

What additional functionality does checkpoint 10.4 add that can be put in a 
minimal requirement for satisfying the checkpoint?

We need just one requirement of a minimal specification to satisfy the 
checkpoint that is not covered somewhere else.

NOTE: I would modify the minimum requirement of 10.5 to include either 
single key or modifier + single key for configuration of systems with 
keyboards.  This would generalize 10.5, but still provide the single key 
functionality for those that want just a single key.

Jon
