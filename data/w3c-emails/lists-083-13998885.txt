| In theory I think the limit for the size of an element including all
| attribute content is 32k (i.e. very big) but in practise I would
suggest
| keeping it shorter. Given that the summary attribute isn't available
on many
| of the current generation of browsers, you might also consider using a
| caption element instead - that is rendered by nearly everything.

The Mozilla browser (and therefor Netscape 6) will display the 'summary'
attribute as a tooltip. It the table also includes a 'title' attribute,
this will be displayed in the same tooltip.
