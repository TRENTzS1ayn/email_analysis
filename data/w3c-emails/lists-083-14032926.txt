Some history of the priority changes for volume and splitting of the 
checkpoint into separate audio and speech synthesis components.

1. The November 11 1998 working draft [1] had a priority one checkpoint 
"Allow the user to override author styles and user agent defaults for audio 
volume"

2. The audio volume issue was discussed at the December 1998 Face-to-Face 
meeting [2] in Boston.

3. There didn't seem to be any further discussion of audio volume during 
the telecons for December 1998, January 1999 and February 1999

4. The February 10th 1999 working draft [3] has the checkpoints for audio 
volume split and set at a priority 2 level.  The priority 2 level was 
justified in the changes document[4], since assistive listening devices 
could be used to make the audio more accessible to people who are hard of 
hearing.  Other discussions referenced the limited control software 
developers have over the particular hardware available to users.

5. The raising of synthesized speech to priority one occurred in the 
October 4th 1999 version of the guidelines document as the result of a 
discussion at the September 22nd, 1999 telecon.  This was part of the 
resolution of issue 83 [7].
