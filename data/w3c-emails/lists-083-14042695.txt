Checkpoint 2.3 If content available in a viewport has equivalent 
alternatives, provide easy access in context to the alternatives. [Priority 1]

Minimum requirement:
Alternative equivalents should be rendered as additional content.  The user 
agent can render both the primary and alternative equivalent together or 
can substitute the alternative equivalent for the primary content and 
therefore only rendering the alternative equivalent to satisfy the minimum 
requirement.  Note: The exception to this minimum requirement is for 
multi-media checkpoints that require the option for simultaneous rendering 
of primary and alternative equivalent content.
