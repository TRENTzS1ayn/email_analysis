David, could you please explain your assertion, quote hpr is setting its self in
the browser/ua arena thereby taking its self out of the umbrella which would
allow it to fall comfortably into an assistive slot. endquote.

In particular, I can't find the "assistive slot."

I  looked for the definitions of the two categories, "graphical desktop user
agent" (GDUA) and "dependent user agent" (DUA) in the current working document.
I realized (I hope correctly) that definitions are not given, but that the terms
are defined by the checkpoints themselves. I.e., you comply as a DUA (at a given
level ...) if you satisfy all checkpoints (of that level ...) that are not
specifically GDUA, and conversely, you comply as a GDUA if you satisfy all
checkpoints not specifically DUA. Is that the intention? What is the assistive
slot in this context.

Jon, Granted your statement that complience of assistives with
assistives should be of lower priority right now.  It will need to be
examined at any rate though and brings up several good points not the
least of which is that hpr is setting its self in the browser/ua arena
thereby taking its self out of the umbrella which would allow it to
fall comfortably into an assistive slot.
