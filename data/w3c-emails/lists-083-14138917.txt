Subject: Suggested New Definition for Control and Configure

Regarding my "Suggested New Definition for Control and Configure" [1], Jim
Allan wrote:

"looks good.
"I believe there is an error...the word "control" should be "configure""

whereas the term "control" typically means that the change take more time
and effort (such as via a series of menus leading to a dialog box, via style
sheets or scripts) and that the results of the change may not take effect
immediately (e.g., due to time spent reinitializing the system, initiating a
new session, rebooting the system). Configuration settings may be stored in
_profiles_. The range and granularity of the changes that can be controlled
or configured by the user depend on system or hardware limitations.

My response:

I accidentally switched terms. The fixed version corrects the two errors.
Note that I have also made a change in the last sentence of the long
paragraph.

Control and Configure

In the context of this document both the terms "control" and "configure"
share in common the idea of governance such as a user may exercise over
interface layout, user agent behavior, rendering style, and other parameters
required by this document. Generally, the difference in the terms centers on
the idea of "persistence". When a user makes a change by "controlling" a
setting, that change usually does not persist beyond that user session. On
the other hand, when a user "configures" a setting, that setting typically
persists into later user sessions. Furthermore, the term
<CHANGE>"control"</CHANGE> typically means that the change can be made
easily (such as via a "hot-key" combination) and that the results of the
change occur immediately, whereas the term <CHANGE>"configure"</CHANGE>
typically means that the change take more time and effort (such as via a
series of menus leading to a dialog box, via style sheets or scripts) and
that the results of the change may not take effect immediately (e.g., due to
time spent reinitializing the system, initiating a new session, rebooting
the system). Configuration settings may be stored in _profiles_. The range
and granularity of the changes that can be controlled or configured by the
user <NEW>may</NEW>depend on system or hardware limitations.

The term "control" may also refer to a "user interface component" or "form
component".
