At the last telecon we were discussing the minimum requirements for 10.4 
and 10.5.  We resolved that 10.4 should be at least about turning on and 
off user interface features like menus and tool bars.  We began discussing 
the ability to configure the controls in user interface objects, like 
deleting and restoring menu items and selecting which functions would be 
part of tool bars.   This to me seems to be more like the minimum 
requirements for the current checkpoint 10.5 and therefore I propose that 
these requirements be a part of 10.5.
