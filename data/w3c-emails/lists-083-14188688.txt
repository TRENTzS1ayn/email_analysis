Denis,

I took an action item to ask for your opinion on the minimal requirements 
for checkpoints 10.4 and 10.5.  Many of the benefits are designed for 
people with cognitive disabilities and I think your experience in this area 
would help the working group resolve these issues.  Could you review and 
comment on my proposal for the minimum requirements for 10.4 and 10.5:
