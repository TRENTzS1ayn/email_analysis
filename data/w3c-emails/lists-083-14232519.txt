I encourage people to present arguments on changing checkpoint 4.8 from P2

aloha, jon!

the argument is quite simple...   there are many instances when i need 
synthesized speech at a certain level--which i can control on-the-fly 
thanks to the P1 requirement, if the wording of 4.10 is restored from 
"configure" to "control"--and the audio to play at a different level, in 
order that i can clearly and distinctly hear the 2 simultaneously...

if i can't hear the synthesized speech because i can't adjust the volume of 
the audio source as it is playing, save by recourse to the OS' native 
volume control interface, i may have already missed out on what i needed to 
hear -- the synthesized content in conjunction with the audio -- especially 
if the audio is being streamed...  it's akin to reading a page while 
looking at the illustrations with your peripheral vision, or the type of 
integration of textual and non-textual content one's brain makes to give 
one the gestalt view of the page when it is perceived in screenfulls, so i 
vote to raise 4.8 from P2 to P1

gregory.
