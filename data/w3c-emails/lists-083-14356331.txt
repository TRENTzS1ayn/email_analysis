I cannot attend tomorrow's call and regret this fact especially in light of
this interesting but sugnificant development.  we discussed at length what a
user agent is for purposes of this document and have based many of our
guidelines on that deffinition.  at this late point, if we change the
deffinition, it could throw the guidelines into such dissarray that we'd
possibly have to go fairly far back in the process because of the high
impact.  I think this is a good idea in lots of ways but would like to see
it encorporated as we move forward beyond 1.0.
