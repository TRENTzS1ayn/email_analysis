I will publish a new document tomorrow with whatever has
changed since 7 May. That may not be much. In particular,
none of the minimal requirements discussions will be captured

Yes, I agree. If you don't indicate the version of the document
and the checkpoint numbers change, it's very hard to look back
at the record and understand what the context is.
