Re: Suggestions for the new working draft

Welcome back, Ian! Yes, the memo was just from me!

Suggestions for the new draft:

1. Ensure that resolutions involving the words control and configure are 
implemented. See telecon notes.
2. Include revised definition of Control and Configure per [1]. Reviews on 
the list seemed positive. It would be an editorial decision, I think.
3. Include the definition of synchronization per [2]. I suggest that Ian 
implement/edit as an editorial change.
4. Add/revise definitions of visual track, auditory track, etc., per Part 1 
of [3]. I suggest Ian implement as editorial changes.
5. Ensure that terms related to audio and multimedia are used precisely. For 
example, review the wording of checkpoints 4.5 through 4.11, especially 4.5 
through 4.8. This relates to suggestion 4. One of the key points is that if 
one means ?non-synthesized audio? then perhaps one should use that language 
or something similar. We need to keep in mind that synthesized speech is 
audio. Part 2 of [3] represents my first crack at trying to resolve this. I 
suggest that Ian take a turn.
