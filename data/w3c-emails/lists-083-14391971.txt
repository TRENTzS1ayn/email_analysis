Regrettably, this week has left me with a deadline I cannot escape at 3:00
today, so I won't be able to attend today's telecon.

Discussion

    1.Next FTF meeting scheduling and hosting

    2.PR#285: Raise checkpoint 4.8 "Allow the user to configure the audio 
volume" to priority 1
      http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#283

    3.PR#257: Difficult to know when a UA has conformed.
      http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#257
      See Ian's analysis of the checkpoints that need minimum requirements:
      http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2000/05/ua-minreqs.html

      Remaining Checkpoints to determine minimum conformance

         1.Checkpoint 2.3 If content available in a viewport has equivalent 
alternatives, provide easy access in context to
           the alternatives. [Priority 1]

           Proposal: 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0394.html

         2. Checkpoint 10.4 Allow the user to change the input 
configuration. [Priority 2]

           Resolved: At least be able to turn on/off user interface control 
objects (i.e. menu bars, tool bars,
           etc... ), but may want to include additional minimum requirements

         3. Checkpoint 10.9 For graphical user interfaces, allow the user 
to configure the arrangement of user agent user
           interface controls. [Priority 3]

           Proposal: 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0403.html

         4. Checkpoint 10.5 Allow the user to configure the user agent so 
that the user's preferred one-step operations may
           be activated with a single input command (e.g., key stroke, 
voice command, etc.). [Priority 2]

           Action: KB will develop a list of a minimum set of functions for 
consideration by the group

           Proposal: Include in part of the minimum requirement to also 
allow for key modifier key
           combinations in addition to single (un modified) combinations. 
Unmodified key combinations would
           still be a requirement.

         5. Checkpoint 10.8 Ensure that frequently used functionalities are 
easily activated in the default input configuration.
           [Priority 3]

    8.GR: Look into which checkpoints would benefit from audio examples in 
the techniques document.

available to single command
      configuration
