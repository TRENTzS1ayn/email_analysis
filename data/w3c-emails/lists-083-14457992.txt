Hello,

Charles and I propose the following requirements for 
these checkpoints (from "Determining Conformance to the User 
Agent Guidelines 1.0" [1]): 

  Checkpoint 4.1  Allow the user to configure the size of text. 
  Checkpoint 4.2  Allow the user to configure font family. 
  Checkpoint 4.3  Allow the user to configure foreground color. 
  Checkpoint 4.4  Allow the user to configure background color. 

Since fonts and colors are generally managed at the OS
level, we propose stating that the user agent is expected
to provide access to system colors and fonts. It's hard
to specify a lower or upper bound for colors and fonts,
so we would rather set expectations than firm
requirements. One million colors is more than ample choice, 
but 16 or 256 probably suffice to provide access. 

For fonts, font family and text size go together
except for vectorial fonts. For vectorial fonts
or other magnification techniques, how do we establish
acceptable limits?

  -Ian
