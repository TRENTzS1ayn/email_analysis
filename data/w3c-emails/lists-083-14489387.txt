Hello,

Please consider the following editorial clarification to
checkpoints 3.3, 3.5, and 3.6 (of the 7 May draft [1]):

 3.3 Allow the user to turn on and off rendering of video. 
     [Priority 1] 

 3.5 Allow the user to turn on and off animated or 
     blinking text. [Priority 1] 

 3.6 Allow the user to turn on and off animations and 
     blinking images. [Priority 1] 

After discussion with Charles and Eric Hansen about
these checkpoints, we concluded that the requirement
was to "freeze" video and animations. The term 
"turn on and off" may be construed to mean "do not
render at all" but I don't believe that is the requirement
expressed by these checkpoints. The accessibility problem
in these cases (unless I am mistaken) arises from the 
distraction of the motion, not the mere rendering of 
the visual information. We do have a P2 checkpoint 
about turning off the rendering of images (checkpoint 3.9).
Therefore, I propose using the term "freeze" instead
of "turn on and off" for these three checkpoints.

 - Ian
