Hello,

I've published the 10 June 2000 version of the UA Guidelines [1]
and Techniques [2]. The full list of changes [3] is online
and quoted below. I believe that this draft includes all of the
resolutions of the Working Group since the previous draft of
7 May 2000.

I think the document is shaping up very well, and although we're
not done yet (see todo list below), we are making very good
progress thanks to this very diligent Working Group!

Eric had suggested [4] that certain changes be in this draft,
and I accommodated 3 of his 5 suggestions (the ones related to
control/configuration and synchronization). For the other
two about usage of terms relating to presentations, Eric and 
Charles and I had a lengthy conversation today out of which
came two proposed changes to the document:

  - One to delete 3.2 and expand 4.0 [5]. This one does not
    appear in the draft.

  - One to clarify 3.3, 3.5, and 3.6 [6]. This one, which 
    I believe to be editorial, does appear in the draft, and
    is subject to review there by the Working Group.

I will take into account Eric's proposed definitions 
concerning multimedia terms [8], his request to ensure
consistent usage, and our discussion today in the next
draft, which I hope to publish as early as next week.

I also updated "Determining Conformance to the User Agent 
Guidelines 1.0" [7] with some more information about
minimal requirements. Not all proposals sent by the
Working Group have been included yet, however.

For the curious, here's a list of things that 
still need to be done (presumably before going to
last call if that is our next step):

1) Once we have resolved all the issues, we need 
   reviewers to sign off on the WG's resolutions. I will
   be sending email to the reviewers to ask them whether they
   think we've addressed their concerns.

2) We need to integrate the minimal conformance information
   into the checkpoints. I'm still not sure of the best
   way to do this, since adding information after each checkpoint
   may lead to an unsightly document (in some cases, 
   the requirements are obvious). The WG already discussed this and  
   preferred the after-each-checkpoint
   approach, but I'm still thinking there's a better solution. 

   The WG also needs to clarify the normative or informative 
   nature of each note after each checkpoint. Is all of that 
   information just commentary, or is some of it key to 
   satisfying the checkpoint?

   Finally, in "How this document is organized", once we have
   established conformance criteria for all the checkpoints, we
   can delete the sentence that reads "Each checkpoint is 
   intended to be specific enough so that someone reviewing 
   a user agent may verify that the checkpoint has been satisfied."
   Instead, we can say that the document states what is expected
   for each checkpoint. In a future draft of the techniques
   document, we can clarify what information is purely descriptive,
   what information concerns minimal conformance, what information
   is reference material, etc.

3)  A few proposed techniques not yet integrated. EH has
    also asked for better descriptions of visuals in the
    techniques document. Here, WG contributions would be
    extremely welcome!!

4) We should begin re-reviewing the implementation report
   in light of changes to the document. That report needs to 
   be updated after last call.

 - Ian
