Ian, Thanks for your work and to Erick and Charles as well.  I know of no
software besides windows its self that has independant controll over several
types of volume controll and I agree that if we have a checkpoint such as
that which you proppose below which allows for independant controll of
different audio volumes that this might fill the need.  I question however
in light of the above and your question that we might be adding something to
the requirement ie that this fascility be made available.  as written in
separate form, the synthesized speech volume could be specifically applied. 
I guess the priority of audio over all was settled but I still have
reservations about making it a p1 since synthesized speach is geared to
alternative content and it is possible to get at over all volume in other
ways in every system I know of.  of course, if this is a native thing than
the question might come into play.
