As I was not able to be present at the call, I will respond to some points
raised in the minutes.  This was a busy meeting.

   JG: Yes, end of September, early October?
   DB: Sounds good.
   DA: Mid-semester for me, but not a busy semester.   
DP: fine.   
I guess it ends after raising the priority of 4.8 to p1 I shall have to
further examine this but the explanation seems to make it work.  I was
thinking as I was stubbornly clinging to keeping 4.8 a p2 which is a
deviation from my usualy tendancy to want to make everything a p1 that what
if the over all audio were set higher than the synth volume and there was no
way to get the synth volume high enough so I am shifting to p1 on this.

I missed you all but hopefully will be on calls soon.
