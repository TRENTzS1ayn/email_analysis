In my evaluation I said that HPR conformed to  6.14 quote Allow the user to
control speech playback rate. endquote. I also commented that I was probably
wrong in applying that answer because these checkponts didn't apply to us.
Charles wondered why! My statement is wrong. Problem is, I don't think HPR
supports speech quote playback endquote. So really this checkpoint doesn't apply
to HPR.
