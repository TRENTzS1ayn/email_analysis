It sounds like there are a couple of requirements:
1) Stop things from moving
2) Stop things from being too busy (e.g., don't open
   too many viewports).

But is "don't render content" a requirement? If so, then
why (still) video content and not graphically rendered
text? Or graphics? I don't think we have a requirement
for "make this page less busy" - the closest we get is
"don't open too many viewports". 

So what are the accessibility requirements surrounding
video and animation that freezing does not address?
