Hello,

Please consider for discussion the following proposed
minimal requirements for these checkpoints (from the 10 
June 2000 draft [1]):


1) Checkpoint 6.1  Implement the accessibility features of supported 
                specifications (markup languages, style sheet
                languages, metadata languages, graphics formats, etc.). 

   Note: In UAAG 1.0, this is not a relative priority checkpoint.
         Therefore, it is P1 to implement all accessibility features. 

   Proposed Minimum:  If the specification or another document 
     indicates what features benefit accessibility, be sure to implement
     those. Implement those features that satisfy the requirements of 
     the three WAI guidelines. [Note that this is almost circular since
     checkpoint 6.1 is a requirement of UAAG 1.0. This means: if the
     spec refers to something that is addressed as an accessibility
feature
     of a UA, implement it.]

2) Checkpoint 8.1  Make available to the user the author-specified
purpose 
   of each table and the relationships among
   the table cells and headers. 

   Proposed Minimum: For graphical user agents, it is sufficient 
     to render a table as a two-dimensional grid with header
information,
     and to make available all content per checkpoint 2.1. 

3) Checkpoint 2.7  For author-identified but unsupported natural
languages, 
    allow the user to request notification of language changes in
content. 

   Proposed minimum: Indicate the language change in content. 

4) Checkpoint 8.2  Indicate to the user whether a link has been visited.

    Proposed minimum: Graphically, at least one
      option that is not based on color. The user must also have 
      this information available programmatically. For CSS user
      agents, implement CSS pseudo-elements, which allows user styling. 

5) Checkpoint 8.3  Indicate to the user whether a link has been 
   marked up to indicate that following it will involve a
   fee. 

    Proposed minimum: Graphically, at least one option that is not 
      based on color.
