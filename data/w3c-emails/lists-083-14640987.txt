aloha, ian!

i agree with your proposal, save for your caveat:

quote
IMPORTANT: I propose that we delete "and other articulation
characteristics" from checkpoint 4.11 since that makes it
much harder to specify minimal requirements.
unquote

it wouldn't be much harder to specify minimal requirements for "other 
articulation characteristics" if you simply applied the same implementation 
example to that phrase that you used for volume -- the aural media rules of 
CSS2...  the minimal requirements for "other articulation characteristics" 
should be those listed as "speech characteristics" [1] in chapter 19 of the 
CSS2 recommendation that aren't already highlighted by separate UAAG 
checkpoints -- namely:

         voice-family;
         stress;
         and richness

the minimal requirements should also list equivalents for CSS2's 
"speak-properties" [2]:

         speak-punctuation and speak-number

and for CSS2's "speaking-properties"  [3]

         normal, none, and spell-out

as well as the "pause" properties [4]

         pause-before and pause-after

all of which are elemental aspects of a speech synthesis engine...  cueing 
is pretty damn important, as well, but i think that i'd settle for the 
above as "minimal", although i'd prefer a self-voicing UA to also implement 
some sort of cue-before and cue-after configuration option, as well as a 
play-during configuration and control
