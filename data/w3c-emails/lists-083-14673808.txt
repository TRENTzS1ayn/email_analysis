The "turn images off" checkpoint covers this case (admittedly at P2).

Is that enough?

  It sounds like there are a couple of requirements:
  1) Stop things from moving
  2) Stop things from being too busy (e.g., don't open
     too many viewports).
  
  But is "don't render content" a requirement? If so, then
  why (still) video content and not graphically rendered
  text? Or graphics? I don't think we have a requirement
  for "make this page less busy" - the closest we get is
  "don't open too many viewports". 
  
  So what are the accessibility requirements surrounding
  video and animation that freezing does not address?
