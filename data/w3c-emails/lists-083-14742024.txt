Ian,
1. We already have pause in another checkpoint, as you pointed out so we do 
not need a checkpoint just for pause.  So is your proposal to really delete 
the checkpoint since it is already covered somewhere else, if what you say 
is true I don't think it is a noteworthy special case.

2. We have turn on and off other multi-media objects and video was in there 
for potential:
a. Flicker problems (freezing would solve)
b. Distractions for people with cognitive disabilities (freezing does not 
resolve, this is the reason to turn off images)
c. It could be confusing to some types of assistive technologies to have 
the video player running (we would need to discuss this with AT developers 
to get their view on the subject and this would require probably adding 
candidate recommendation to the process since our goal of CR was to get AT 
developer input).

3.  I am not sure why this is even an issue.  I don't remember it coming up 
in any of the reviewers comments, which is what we are responding to right 
now.

My vote is to leave it the same unless there is some compelling evidence to 
change it.

Jon
