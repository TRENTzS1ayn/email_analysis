I note that the "author" for the sound source may well be a professional
narrator, reading what the traditional author wrote, as is used with
digital talking books. That is quite different from synthesized speech.
I trust you do not mean to exclude such narrations. It does raise issues
of synchronization and navigation, as addressed by SMIL. Does that come
under:

3.4 allow the user to turn on and off the rendering of audio.

How about another:

3.x allow the user to select audio source of text: synthesized
speech or pre-recorded.
