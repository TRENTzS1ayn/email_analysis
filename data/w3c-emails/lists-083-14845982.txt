I appreciate your finding the way to include speech rate speed-up,
by any means, in spite of your recently expressed feeling that that
is a change of scope, so could not be included.

By analogy to how Netscape Navigator allows font "larger  Ctrl-]",
and "smaller  Ctrl-[" that I find much more useful than the five font size
choices that Microsoft IE5 allows, I would encourage allowing the
"faster" and "slower" relative values be made available for the user.

I also note that the speed changes should be done without pitch shift,
using the technique of stretching or shrinking silences between words,
and generally the vowel sounds within words.

4.11 That leaves pitch and gender. I question that they are independent.
Most are unable to distinguish a countertenor from a soprano, or a
tenor from a low alto. I am uncertain which of the other articulation
characteristics help to make such distinctions, so agree that they
are hard to specify minimal requirements. I'd go so far as to assert
that only pitch is appropriate.

I refer to my other comment on SMIL use for narrated speech, for which
speech speedup or slowdown (without pitch shift) is appropriate.
