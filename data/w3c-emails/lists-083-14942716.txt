Hello,

Checkpoint 5.8 of the 10 June guidelines reads:

    5.8 Follow operating system conventions that affect 
        accessibility. In particular, follow conventions 
        for user interface design, keyboard configuration, 
        product installation, and documentation. 

I propose changing the word "affect" to "benefit". I would
like to avoid this scenario: "I followed OS conventions
as required by checkpoint 5.8; I'm sorry that those conventions
are not accesible." In short, developers should only adopt
the conventions that affect accessibility positively.

 - Ian
