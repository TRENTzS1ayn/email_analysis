I believe I said (at least I meant) Speech pitch, rather than rate.
By rate, I suggest the adjustment to the words/minute. By pitch,
I refer to the fundamental voice pitch, approximately the lowest
a particular voice can sing (though thick vocal chords from a cold
once dropped my lowest note by 60%--G down to B-flat.) One may have
trouble distinguishing a countertenor from an alto. A boy soprano
from a girl soprano can be hard. Either may be distinguished
from a mature woman's soprano by the other articulation aspects,
including vibrato.

I find the "cute names" mentioned on the call acceptable, once heard
and association made. The names by themselves don't give me much clue
what they should sound like.

Gregory, I'd like that list of uses included, in the note, as recognizably
useful distinctions that voice characteristics can provide. Is there any
consensus on how these should be voice-distinguishable? or is that a
user preference? Does each of the applications providing voice synthesis
do it their own way? Do some have no user choice?
