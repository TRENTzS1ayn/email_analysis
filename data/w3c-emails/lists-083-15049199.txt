On control over speech rate and other characteristics all of our 
implementation experience is based not on CSS principles, but on 
enumeration of the ranges of speech technologies and providing controls 
that reflect the enumerated values.  I think this approach should be the 
first priority, since we can show that it can be implemented.  The 
secondary consideration if information can not be enumerated.
