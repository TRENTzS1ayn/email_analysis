Eric's work suggests to me several important issues for user agent
adaption to captured user preferences into profiles. Eric, have you
looked at the WAI User Agent work, in particular the latest draft
guidelines?

Abstract: The aim of this study was to specify a testmodule (with visual 
function tests), of which the results can be used to adjust software to 
individual visual perception. The test results of the module will be stored 
in a user-profile. Software can then use this information to automatically 
adjust its user-interface and content to the individual user-profile, thus 
making it more easily possible for partially sighted to work with the same 
software as their sighted counterparts. The module (including a spectacular 
fine-tuning possibility) as well as the research results will be shown on 
the conference.
