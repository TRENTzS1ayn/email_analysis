Hello,

In the WAI - Education and Outreach Working Group I proposed to put a page up with keyboard shortcuts for three different browsers. This could make people aware of problems and possibilities of not using a mouse (for blind people). The thought was that the shortcuts would differ from country to country. I think the only way is to know that for sure is to try it. So I took the liberty of just translating our Dutch page 'surfing without a mouse' into English. Now Would like to ask you if people from different countries could have a look at it and see if the named shortcuts work of not. Please send your comments to me and if you agree I will send a resume of the reactions back.

The page is: www.bartimeus.nl/access/week252000eng.html

For people who like to read Dutch, the address of the Dutch page is:

Kindest regards

Eric Velleman
