Simpletext (for the Macintosh) has a speak command (has had for years). That
does provide tone inflection for quotes (and such things).

the Microsoft Windows logo program testing is available apparently - Heather
Swayne posted the following URI to the AU list, but I have not yet had time
to check it out...

[some reflections on alerts and messaging]  
  I am sure this is all spelled out as dialogistics in the HCI literature
  somewhere -- aside from that literature not covering the screen reader case.
  
  Does the Microsoft Logo Program literature get this analytic about a
  reference model for UI design?  Is anyone else aware of HCI literature that
  covers the concepts I am groping toward?
  
  PS:  Does EmacSpeak or any screen reader do anything as far as prosodic
  inflection for quotes and parenthetical remarks buried in a text?  Or is
  this just covered in your tuning of "punctuation verbosity"?
