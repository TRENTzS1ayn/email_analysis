I agree with Jon that we should find out what we can about
existing speech technologies and the ranges that are offered
(as Gregory examined for speech rate [1]). 

Gregory, would you take an action to report back ranges of values
for the various speech characteristic properties (excluding emacspeak,
which I guess conforms to CSS2's properties in this case, but is
not a browser)?
