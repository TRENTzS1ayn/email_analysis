Hello, 

Per my action of the 15 June teleconference [1], please
consider the following proposal. In the 10 June guidelines,
we have the following checkpoints:

3.3 Allow the user to freeze video.
3.5 Allow the user to freeze animated or blinking text.
3.6 Allow the user to freeze animations and blinking images.
4.6 Allow the user to start, stop, pause, advance, and rewind audio,
    video, and animations. 

All of these checkpoints are Priority 1. Recall that in previous
versions of the document, checkopints 3.3, 3.5, and 3.6 read
"turn on and off" instead of "freeze", but I believe that the
accessibility
issue in cases of animated text, animated images, and video is the
motion
(and not the mere visual information). 

For the purposes of this email, I consider that "freeze" is a
subset of "pause". With "pause" the user agent is required to allow
"play" again; with "freeze", there is no requirement to play again.

Therefore, since checkpoint 4.6 already includes video and animations
(which I interpret to be animated images and text), and it requires
a pause functionality that is more powerful than a simple freeze, and
the checkpoints are all priority 1, I propose that checkpoints 3.3, 3.5
and 3.6 all be deleted in favor of the following two checkpoints:

<NEW 1>
   Allow the user to start, stop, and pause audio, video, and
graphically
   animated and blinking content.
</NEW 1>

<NEW 2>
   Allow the user to advance and rewind audio, video, and graphically
   animated content.
</NEW 2>

I have opted for two checkpoints since I'm not sure that it's necessary
to advance and rewind blinking content. While this could be considered
a degenerate case of animated content, it may confuse people.
