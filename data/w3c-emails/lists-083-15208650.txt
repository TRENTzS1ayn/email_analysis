I promised the Content group I would send the User Agent group this
question:

------------------- 
Do user agents generate a 0,0 to the server if an area on a server-side
image map is not selected?

We would like to know if redundant text links could be returned if a server
receives 0,0 but are not sure if 
all browsers generate it.
