To belabor what you said: restart is implied by pause, but not necessarily
implied by stop. As this wasn't clear to me, I propose instead:

     Allow the user to start, stop, pause, and restart content that is
     audio, video, blinking or graphically animated.

     This checkpoint makes no attempt to consider maintaining
synchronization where content uses more than one modality.

?I'm not sure if you meant that blinking always is associated with
graphically animated? That was my reason for changing the ending text.

?Rewind (to the beginning), or stoppable? I suggest instead:

     Allow the user to advance or reverse, and to rewind to the beginning
     content that is audio, video, or graphically animated.
