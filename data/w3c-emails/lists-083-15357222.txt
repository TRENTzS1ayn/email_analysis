I think that I agree with virutally all of what Charles has said. I 
certainly agree that the efforts to establish minimal requirements is 
extremely useful. I am merely suggesting how act upon what we are learning.

My point about "padding" is that it is confusing to first say that failure 
to do 1.0 times Z will make access impossible and then come along and 
indicate that we can correct the accessibility gap by doing 0.7 times Z 
(i.e., the minimal requirement). It begs the question: "Why was 1.0 times Z 
required in the first place?"
