Subdivide.  Recognize different classes of animations based on how
dependent they are to a) self-synchronization, i.e. presentation on a
continuous and steady timebase, and b) external synchronization, how
dependent is the composite on synchronization relationships touching this
component?

Animation is to video as drawn graphics are to image.  They interpolate
between very simple structures right up to fooling you into believing that
it is real.  The playback options for animation are not graded by the fact
that it is animation but based on the classification of the message encoded
in the animation and the interdependencies between this content and the
content of peer presentation components.

Some animations require continuous time rendering; these are like animated
feature films, they are synthetic video as far as their "perception to
cognition processing" is concerned.

Others are mere stylistic flourishes.  For example transition effects in
Power Point.  If the bullet twirls as a new list item emerges onto the
screen, this is expendable and need not be sped up in proportion as the
text reading is sped up.

This last can be handled by subcases of synchronization constraints.

Once again, it needs to be subdivided.

Many people in the authoring community say "dynamic content" when they are
referring to Active Server Pages or Cold Fusion generated pages.

One needs to distinguish time-dependent display from interactivity where
the display changes in response to what the user does, or what the system
thinks the user did as when the mouse moves.  Then one needs to look at
subdividing or grading how tightly the time-evolution of the display has to
be controlled for the message to be comprehensible.  Audio is not
comprehensible in freeze-frame; video has some comprehensibility when
perturbed that way.  Animations are split as to whether you can single-step
them and understand the result or not.

Yes, you want to relate this category to some inclusive super-category.
But that super-category may not be ready for prime time, i.e. it may be
something that we as technologists understand but the person in the street
only sees the subcases as wholly different things.

Even here I would distinguish a range of cases.  The appropriate user
control options are different if the sound is truly wallpaper, as compared
with a film-strip-equivalent presentation where the audio is the primary
content and the visual display is secondary.


This is a content judgement which you cannot tell from the type of data in
which the content has been encoded, by the way.  [compare with animation;
do you see a trend?]

If you want to align your usage with common parlance, use all these terms
as follows.  Use 'audio' when your center of focus in on the computer side
of the physical human/computer interface.  This focuses on the data
resources and how they get rendered as audible signals.  Correspondingly,
use 'auditory' when your center of focus is on the message, the perceptual
and cognitive effect of the happenings at the physical human/computer
interface.  Audio files let you present auditory content.  The auditory
content is what you hear.  The audio is what the sound card plays into the
speakers.  I think that is more or less how the public perception splits.
[How to do a web search to check this???]  If you say 'audio' you will have
lots of readers who read "file format."  If you say 'auditory' most people
will read "perception."

Summary:

The user needs to be able to control things about how multimedia resources
are delivered.  What kinds of user control are appropriate depends on the
content structure of the composite resource.  In particular, it is
sensitive to a) how the messages delivered by the several chunks targeted
to different channels and media relate to one another and b) how much you
can change the presentation of a given data resource before it breaks up,
i.e. loses comprehensibility.


This is all expressible as a web of assertions about "the content/message
of A, the content of B, the content of C, etc."  At times you will have to
specialize this to "the conceptual content of A, the perceptual content of
B, the 'screen cross time' content of C," etc.

Throughout all this the following image is running through my mind:

Compare the respective content of media objects A and B.

Is there any overlap?  Is there anything that one can learn from A that one
could also learn from B?  Repeat the question in reverse.

Does either of them dominate the other?  Is most of what you can learn from
A also learnable from B?  Or vice Versa?

If there is overlap, but neither dominates the other, how about the
respective amounts of information in the content?  Is there just more that
you can learn from A or from B?

[Note that in parallel with these 'benefit' based comparisons, one is doing
parallel comparisons on 'cost' that is how long it takes to get to the
point where media object A or B is understood.  And one is also looking at
system dependencies.  A given resource may only be presentable in visible
form.  Or it may only be comprehensible if synchronized with a given other
resource.  And so forth.]

In many cases there is the simple relationship that A is a short version of
B.  A and B are about the same general topic, but B tells you in more
detail.  This applies to header and section, to Legend and figure, to audio
description and video.  Sometimes this relationship is between objects in
different media, sometimes the same.

Although the 'content' of the message cannot be computed from the data by
an algorithm, these relationships and characteristics of the content of a
specific media object can be correctly assessed by a journeyman editor.  It
doesn't take a whiz.
