Yes. In particular because UA is not member-private, which PF is, so we can

  As part of moving forward with some of our UA Guidelines clarifications,
  Ian Jacobs sent some notes [1] on multimedia-related definitions to the

  These fall squarely in the area that has sometimes been called "abstract
  guidelines" by the GL group or "a reference model of the accessible browse
  experience" by PF.
  
  Shall we use the UA list as our venue for discussing these ideas for now?
  And report back to GL and PF when done or stuck?
