Hello,

I urge all of you to familiarize yourselves with the proposals
listed in the agenda so that we can make good progress at the
meeting this week. I feel we have begun to stall and we need
to maintain momentum to get through the rest of the minimal
conformance requirements.

Thank you,

 - Ian

   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0496.html 

   This satisfied my action from last week:
   Action IJ: Propose a new 4.6 with deleted 3.3, 3.5, 3.6.

3) Min / Max requirements for speech synthesis rates. Refer to
   Gregory's proposal:
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0482.html

4) Multimedia definitions.

5) Checkpoint 7.5: Proposed search minreq: case-sensitive forward.

6)  Checkpoints 6.1, 8.1, 2.7, 8.2, and 8.3
    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000AprJun/0448.html

     a) "Easy access": 10.8, 2.3
     b) Checkpoint 10.4: Input configuration
     c) Checkpoints 4.13 and 4.14: selection and focus highlight
     d) Checkpoint 9.3: Configuration of notification.

Open Action Items:

  1) IJ: Draft a preliminary executive summary/mini-FAQ for developers. 
          (No deadline.)

  2) CMN: Propose a technique that explains how serialization plus 
           navigation would suffice for Checkpoint 8.1.

  3) GR: Look into which checkpoints would benefit from audio examples
         in the techniques document.

  4) GR: Pursue speech synth ranges for other properties than 
         speech rate.

  5) GR: Re-examine the orientation checkpoints and
         see whether they can be clarified to account for control
         of rendering of audio (and possibly other content) on load.

Completed Action Items:

  1) IJ: Incorporate changes to volume checkpoints in the next draft.

  2) IJ: Propose multimedia definitions to the list
         to define borders of these proposed checkpoints.
