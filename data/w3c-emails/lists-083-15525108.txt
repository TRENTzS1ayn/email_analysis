The following is a proposed set of configurable single stroke functions. 
For background information read my post of June 9th. I won't be able to 
make the call this week. I'll be at RESNA.

I proposed that we require  a minimum set of single stroke commands but 
that we also include in the techniques other commands that may be useful as 
single stroke commands. I am not convinced that this is the best list but 
it is a starting point.

I propose the following minimum set of commands be accessible with a single 
keystroke or that the user be able to configure those as single stroke 
commands those items on this list.

1. next link
2. previous link
3. next structural element(s) - (Should each structural element, eg. table, 
form, list, get its own keystroke.)
4. back
5. forward
6. refresh
7. page up
8. page down
9. line up (arrows)
10 line down (arrows)
11. next active element
12. stop loading

Other useful commands that may be candidates for single stroke assignment

13. to address bar / open location
14. next viewports
15. load/unload graphics
16. increase font size
17. decrease font size
18. page search
19. add to bookmark
20. go to bookmark list
21. go to history list
22. navigate among all Elements
23. turn on/off colors/style/sheets
24. help - for conventions sake, I think this should stay at F1

Another questions is whether we need a different set of single keystroke 
commands for media players?
(e.g. stop, start, pause, volume)
