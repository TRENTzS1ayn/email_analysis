Hello,

Checkpoint 7.5 in Determining Conformance to UAAG 1.0 [1]
reads:

    Allow the user to search for rendered text content,
    including rendered text equivalents. 

I propose that the minimal search functionality be forward
search with an option for case-insensitivity. I don't think
reverse-search is vital, though it's useful.

 - Ian
