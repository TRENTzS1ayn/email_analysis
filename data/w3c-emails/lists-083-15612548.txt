3. is not a requirement, it is a technique.

An example of a mechanism that does not rely on colour is a border or
underline.

Otherwise, I agree.

  Hello,
  
  Checkpoints 4.13 and 4.14 of "Determining Conformance to the 
  User Agent Guidelines 1.0" are:
  
   Checkpoint 4.13  Allow the user to configure how the selection 
                    is highlighted (e.g., foreground and background 
                    color). 
  
   Checkpoint 4.14  Allow the user to configure how the content focus is 
                    highlighted (e.g., foreground and background color). 
  
  I propose for both of these the following requirements:
  
  1) The UA must allow for at least one highlight mechanism that doesn't
     rely on color alone.
  
  2) The UA should follow applicable system conventions for selection
     and focus rendering.
  
  3) The UA may satisfy this checkpoint by implementing the CSS
     ':focus' pseudo-element. Refer also to CSS 2's dynamic outlines [2].
