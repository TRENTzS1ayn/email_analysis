Hello,

I think the value of search is to be able to find something that is
expected or remembered, when you don't know where it is. So I think that
reverse serach (or "whole document") is fairly important. Since it is
required that a user can establish where they are in a document, it should be
possible to use that and the ability to do all searches from teh beginning to
find out where things are relative to each other.

SO I could live with Ian's minimal requirement, although I would prefer to
have forward/reverse/whole document, or whole document plus knowing whether
the find was behind or in front of the point of regard.

  Checkpoint 7.5 in Determining Conformance to UAAG 1.0 [1]
  reads:
  
      Allow the user to search for rendered text content,
      including rendered text equivalents. 
  
  I propose that the minimal search functionality be forward
  search with an option for case-insensitivity. I don't think
  reverse-search is vital, though it's useful.
