I agree With Chals if the only thing in the min rec is search forward or it
is not speeled out at least to bidirectional it doesn't help a lot.  the
reson for my stipulation of bidirectionality is that with whole document, if
I understand it correctly, I'll find something I may have already found
which may be what I want but if so I'd ask for revers search.  this also may
be an orientation issue.
