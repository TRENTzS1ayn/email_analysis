The Home Page Reader conformance question has the following parts:

(1) Checkpoints address features we do not support. We say n/a. Because HPR only
supports text (supports no multimedia or graphics), we have entered n/a for
priority 1 items like 5.1-5.11, etc. If this is not a valid reason for "n/a"
what is?

(2) HPR is an agent targeted for users with disabilities who rely on speech and
keyboard.

(2A) The visual user interface is irrelevant in this product.  Although I wrote
"no" in 6.1-6.6 (low vision items), I should have written n/a.

(2B) Similarly, I entered "no" to 1.1, because there are things you cannot do
with the mouse, in fact you cannot do them without speech. It really is n/a
because keyboard input and speech output are the supported I/O. (You must use
the keyboard and speech output to use the settings menu. )

(2C) All the standards and conventions checkpoints (12.*) are not applicable to
HPR. If an assistive technology is to interact with a user agent, it should not
be interacting with a targeted agent. We are an assistive technology; 12.* is to
accommodate assistive technologies.

(3) We have issues with some priority 1 checkpoints. We can't conform (priority
1) as a DUA because we do not comply with 7.3 (nor support its priority) -
render according to natural language identification.

(4) Finally there are checkpoints that we believe should apply to us and that we
fail. Checkpoints 1.2 (interact with all active elements) and 5.8 (turn on/off
support for scripts) are not met by HPR because HPR does not support active
JavaScript elements, and you cannot turn off JavaScript (our startup process
involves JavaScript). That is an acknowledged weakness of HPR. Interestingly, we
might place this non-conformance into (1) above, and claim we do not support
JavaScript, therefore 5.8 and failure of parts of 1.2 are n/a.

      for conformance section





I would like to clarify my view of conformance:

1. The two current sub groups came out of a need seen by the group to
develop minimum standards for commercial mainstream browsers and plug-ins
like Netscape Navigator, Microsft Explorer, Opera and multi-media
technologies for accessibility. A second need seen by the group is to
indicate the types of additional features for technologies like specialized
browsers and other types of "assistive technology" that provide advanced
features to access to web content to persons with severe disabilities that
is currently beyond the scope of current browser technology (i.e. speech,
refreshable Braille).

2. Part of what the priorities of the checkpoints need to indicate which
checkpoints are currently more important and therefore should be developed
first.  The priorities of checkpoints for the different sub-groups are not
normative and could change over time as technology changes.  Some
checkpoints could even have different priorities in each sub-group
(currently there are none).

3. Part of the work of testing the guidelines is to determine what
chekpoints work for which technologies.  What we want is more usable
interfaces for people with disabilities and that should be our focus.  So
while assistive technology being compatible with other assistive technology
is a great goal and would help people with mulitple disabilities is it the
first thing we want AT developers to consider right now, or are other
checkpoints more important.
