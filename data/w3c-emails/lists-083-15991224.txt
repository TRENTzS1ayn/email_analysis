Checkpoint 2.5 If more than one alternative equivalent is available for 
content, allow the user to choose from among the alternatives. This 
includes the choice of viewing no alternatives.

?why "no alternatives"? If that is appropriate, then how does that apply if 
there are no alternatives to start with? Are you suggesting that the 
alternative equivalents are such as the attributes alt="..." longdesc="..." 
or the "d" convention? If so, so state.

Regards/Harvey Bingham
