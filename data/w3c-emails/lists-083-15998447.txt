Checkpoint 5.1 Provide programmatic read and write ?write -- doesn't this 
require that every user agent become an authoring tool? access to content, 
attribute values, and structure by conforming to W3C Document Object Model 
specifications.

[The DOM, at least for an XML application with a DTD, represents a valid
document. If the AT needn't parse the DOM, that programmatic write can
destroy the DOM structure, or violate XML validity restrictions.

For example, ID values must be unique to a document, so all ID values must
be known or at least found and checked before another unique one could be
generated.]
