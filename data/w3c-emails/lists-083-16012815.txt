To: User Agent Guidelines Emailing List<w3c-wai-ua@w3.org>

Checkpoint 10.6 Allow the user to configure the user agent in named 
profiles that may be shared on systems with distinct user accounts or 
shared by the same user portably across systems with the same operating 
system ?or do we propose such profiles could be made independent of 
operating system?.
