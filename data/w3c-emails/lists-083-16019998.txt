Checkpoint 8.4 Provide a mechanism for highlighting and identifying 
(through a standard interface where available) the current viewport, 
selection, and content focus. ?this seems redundant with the following 4.13 
and 4.14, which add user control. Should they be combined?

[Interesting that in User Agent Responsibilities that the these now come 
under subhead: Inherit OS features.]

Checkpoint 4.13 Allow the user to control how the selection is highlighted 
(e.g., foreground and background color).

Checkpoint 4.14 Allow the user to control how the content focus is 
highlighted (e.g., foreground and background color).
