Checkpoint 11.4 In a dedicated section ?of what: help, installation, 
alternative to paper form of manual?, document in a self-sufficient manner 
all features of the user agent that promote accessibility.

?Presumably 11.1, 11.2, 11.3 apply in context where the common use of a 
feature is described, and 11.4 to a collection of those features, 
adequately described to stand alone?
