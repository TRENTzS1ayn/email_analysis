      I think this should be "Candidate Recommendation" Issues
     (i.e., issues that will arise during CR).
 
Please add to the agenda:

1) Discussion of Bryan Campbell's
   clarification of "single key" access

   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999OctDec/0756.html

2) Discussion of proposal for simplification of checkpoint 1.1
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999OctDec/0757.html

3) Settling issue 158: Priority of font-family control checkpoint.


Thank you,

 _ Ian
