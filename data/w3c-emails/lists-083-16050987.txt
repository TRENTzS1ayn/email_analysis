In response to Harvey related the read/write access to the DOM acting as an
authoring tool:

The limitations of the DOM and UA guidelines related to authoring documents:
1. Current DOM specifications do not represent the entire document, future
versions may
2. DOM currently does not have features to save the document, even if it is
complete representation is available
3. We have no requirements in the UA guidelines to allow the user to change
content, only to configure rendering of content and interact with active
elements.
