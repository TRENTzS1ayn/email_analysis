Th main things that are left out of DOM level 1 are:

1. Comments by the author
2. Style sheet information
3. Scripting information
4. META and other information in the header of the document

CSS is part of DOM level 2, but I don't see any information in the spec on
providing access to the source code for embedded scripts.  Access to the
contents of the TITLE element in the HEAD block is the only thing the DOM
currently models.
