Ian,

A while back we were discussing navigation of tables and there was
considerable discussion of the priority of this as well as how to do it. I
understood (perhaps incorrectly) that this was moved under structured
navigation.

Is this correct?

If so, what was the priority and wording of this checkpoint?

The December 20 guidelines would not reflect this.

Thanks,

Rich
