NOTE: Please continue discussion on w3c-wai-ua only. I would like
for futher discussion to take place on one list only.

Hello,

I received an action item in several different groups (CG [1], AU [2], 
UA [3]) to propose a single conformance mechanism for
all three WAI Guidelines. The text of the proposal [0]
is based on the experience of the WCAG 1.0 Recommendation,
discussions since then in all of the Guidelines WGs, and review
by the WAI Team.

Please note the following excerpt, which addresses the
question of "who validates conformance claims". It says:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Claimants (or relevant assuring parties) are responsible for the 
validity of a claim. As of January 2000, W3C does not act as 
an assuring party, but it may do so in the future, or establish 
recommendations for assuring parties. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Feedback on this proposal is encouraged. I expect to add, in 
a future version of the document, a sample claim using RDF.

Thank you,

 - Ian
