Yes, Kitch, in the "HPR Evaluation" I looked for clarification on this too. If
moving between Win95 windows (I never know whether to say views or viewports!)
with the tab key, f6 key, or Ctrl+tab keys is included, then I suspect "and" is
required. And I believe IE fails on the visual side, but I am not sure.

I have a question about the wording of check point 10.1, Provide information
about document and view changes (to the user and through programming
interfaces).

 Should the word "and" be in the parenthetical comment, (to the user AND
through progrommatic interfaces)? If yes, how does IE satisfy this checkpoint
in terms of providing info directly to the user.  Should the word AND be
removed or changed to OR?
