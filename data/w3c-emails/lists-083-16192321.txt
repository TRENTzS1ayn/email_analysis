This is a thread from IG, but i think it belongs to UA and GL so I have
crossposted it to them.

My personal feeling is that when browsers support CSS it is easy to say

A[target=_new]:before{content:"Open new window"}

or to do any number of other things to give the user the option of opening a
new viewport or replacing the current one. Some browsers such as Amaya and
Lynxdon't give the option, and of course in a voice browser there is no
sensible way to understand the difference - this is a visual rendering
method. In the meantime I would suggest putting "new window" into the text of
the link. (Off the top of my head).

Thoughts?

  I can think of many instances when opening a second browser window would add

  listener would not have to listen to the site's navigation over and over
  again, as pages load for new content sections. It would essentially be
  mimicking a frameset, keeping content separate from navigation.
  
  Opening a second window is risky for accessibility though, as it changes the
  focus or location of the user.
  
  Question: is alerting the listener of a second browser window in the TITLE
  attribute of the Anchor tag sufficient 'warning' that a second browser
  window will be spawned? If not, what would this list suggest?
  
  Thanks!
