I have published an initial draft of the UA Implementation Report[1].
Please review review and comment on the examples I have initially cited in
the document to the list.  Especially review checkpoints that I did not
have an example and if you have one send it to the list for inclusion.

We will discuss it at the telecon next Wednesday 19 January.
