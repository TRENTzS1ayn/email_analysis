Judy,
At the user agent working group meeting some members of the group were
wondering about work related to the accessibility of portable web based
user agents and telephone based system.  They requested I bring this to the
CG group for a review and discussion of current and future plans by the W3C
WAI in this area.  I would bring the results back to the group.

Jon
