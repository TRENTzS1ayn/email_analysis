Peter Korn and Earl Johnson suggest in their las call comments (LC#126) to
change the wording of Checkpoint 5.4 slightly to try to clarify that ATs should
have control over what types of change events that it wants to process from the
user agent.  I suggest the following new wording for the checkpoint based on
their comments:

5.4 Provide programmatic support that enables access to notification of changes
to content and user interface controls (including selection, content focus, and
user interface focus).
