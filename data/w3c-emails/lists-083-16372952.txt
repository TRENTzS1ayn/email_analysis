subject="Issue #178: Drop phrase &quot;and through APIs&quot; for checkpoint 10.1   and 10.2"

In checkpoint #178 I suggest that we drop the phrase "and through APIs" for
checkpoint 10.1 and 10.2 for the following reasons:

1. We have other checkpoints that deal with providing information in
accessible ways in Guideline 1 and Guideline 5

2. Outside of guideline 1 and 5 we only reference API in one other
checkpoint, checkpoint 9.1.  

It is assumed in the guidelines for checkpoints related to providing
information to the user natively that APIs are used that make the same
information available to ATs.  I don't think we need to repeat ourselves on
this issue in checkpoints 10.1 and 10.2.
