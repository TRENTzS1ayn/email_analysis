For the record, the old text is:

      Provide programmatic notification of changes to content and user
      interface controls (including selection, content focus, and
      user interface focus).

I actually don't think the old text suggests that ATs can't control
what they want. The notification is provided, and the recipient can
do whatever they want with the information. 

It sounds like there are two options:

 - Allow (programmatic) configuration of what 
   notifications are made programmatically.

 - Don't allow configuration, but the AT can always ignore any
   notification it doesn't want.

I think I would prefer the latter, but I would welcome input from
AT vendors here!
