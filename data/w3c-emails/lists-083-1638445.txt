The checkpoints for dependent user agents tell mostly what kind of info you
should provide as a next stage of conformance from a graphical UA e.g. 

-Ensure that the user has access to the content of an element selected by the
user. [Priority 1] 

-Provide the user with information about the number of viewports. [Priority 2] 

-Allow the user to view a document outline constructed from its structural
elements (e.g., from header and list elements). [Priority 2] 

-Indicate the row and column dimensions of a selected table. [Priority 3] 

Normally this is information that you can see visually but with other means is
difficult. In addition it might even help you with a graphical UA.
