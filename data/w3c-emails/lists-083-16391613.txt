Checkpoint 1.1 deals with input device APIs, so it doesn't cover
the requirement of 10.1 and 10.2

Checkpoint 5.2  addresses programmatic access to UA user interface
controls. Can the keyboard configuration be considered a user
interface control?

How is that relevant to the required functionality?

Where is that stated in the Guidelines? The checkpoints seem to
cover programmatic access to:

 - content
 - ui controls
 - changes to content and ui
 - activation of ui features

I don't think the assumption is made uniformly. For instance, we
have checkpoint 2.1 (user access to content) and checkpoint 5.1
(programmatic access to content). There is no assumption necessary
since the requirement is explicit in 5.1.

I wouldn't mind deleting the phrase, but I'm not sure that the
requirement is covered by another checkpoint. I don't think
checkpoint 1.5 (messages to the user) covers the requirement.
