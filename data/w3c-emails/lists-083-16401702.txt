Ian,
I know that in Microsoft Active Accessibility and I am assuming in Java
Accessibility APIs that the AT developer is required to configure what
notifications that they want to recieve.  So I am not sure if Earls and
Peters suggestion is based on how current APIs actually work for getting
notification changes or that they think configuration of event notification
should be part of our requirements.

To me this seems to be something that is somewhat plateform dependent.
Some plateforms have little support (like UNIX) for assistive technologies
and others like MS-Windows and Java have extensive APIs.   

I think we can live with the old text and discuss the issue in the
techniques document.  I am not sure AT vendors would be a big help, since
they will probably prefer what they already know and that is configuration
of event notification.  

We currently have no techniques for Checkpoints 5.4 and 5.5 and I think we
need to get some soon.

The configuration of event notification issue is something the DOM working
group may need to address, if they start building in event notification
specifications in to the DOM.

Jon
