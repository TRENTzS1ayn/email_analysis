My action item from 1/13/00 was:
>> DB: Send proposal for single key access wording for checkpoint 10.3 

Here's the new wording, with two asterisks marking the start and end of
proposed new text. Note that for the keyboard, "sequence of single commands"
assumes Sticky Keys or similar functionality.

Proposed:
10.3 Allow the user to change and control <wai-useragent.html> the input
configuration <wai-useragent.html>. Allow the user to configure the user
agent so that **every** functionality may be activated with a single command
(e.g., single key, single voice command, etc.) **or a sequence of single
commands**. [Priority 2] For voice-activated browsers, allow the user to
modify what voice commands activate functionalities. Similarly, allow the
user to modify the graphical user agent user interface for quick **and
convenient** access to commonly used functionalities (e.g., through
**adding, removing and reordering toolbar** buttons).
