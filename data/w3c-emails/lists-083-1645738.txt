aloha, charles!

a quick update on JFW failing to vocalize hyperlink text when using Opera --
acting upon a suggestion offered off-list by Dave Poehlman, I activated the
"Invert Marked Text" option in the "Document Appearance" property sheet, and
JFW now speaks the hyperlink text whenever a hyperlink receives focus...

the larger issue, however, of getting JFW, when voicing content as rendered by
Opera, to recognize the TITLE attribute where it is defined for a hyperlink,
still remains unresolved, for the reasons enumerated in my post of 31 August,
which is archived at (long URI warning!)
