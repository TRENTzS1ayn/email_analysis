Hello,

I propose adding the following clause to the  definition
of applicability:

A checkpoint applies to a user agent unless:

 [other cases]

  - It cannot be satisfied due to hardware or operating 
    system limitations.

This would cover the case, for example, of changes to font family
on a device where there is only one font family available. It
would also, I believe, cover the case of operating
system conventions when no conventions exist on that system.

 - Ian
