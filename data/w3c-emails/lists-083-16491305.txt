Hi Madeleine,

I propose that we remove the Note and push it to the Techniques
as follows:

<quote>
       Some users benefit from simultaneous access to primary
       and alternative content. For instance, users with low 
       vision may want to view images (even imperfectly)
       but require a text equivalent for the image; 
      the text may be rendered with a large font or as speech.
</quote>

My concern with the same note is that it talks about requirements
without really making any. Since it's advisory only, I think it's
better in the techniques.
