I disagree. In the glossary under "Alternative Equivalents
for Content", we say:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In the context of this document, the equivalent 
must fulfill essentially the same function for the person
with a disability (at least insofar as is feasible, 
given the nature of the disability and the state 
of technology), as the "primary" content does for the person 
without any disability. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

I think this explains what we are trying to accomplish.
