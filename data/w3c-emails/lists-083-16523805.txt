This wording came from an ATAG meeting I attended an I proposed
different wording. I agree with you that it's slightly stilted and
propose instead:

   In a dedicated section of the documentation, describe
   all features of the user agent that promote accessibility.

What does "self-sufficient manner" mean? That seems stronger than
"describe". In my ideal scenario (technique?):

  1) Features are documented and accessibility is part of that
     documentation
 
  2) A separate page is an index into those features that promote
     accessibility. This page would satisfy 11.4.
