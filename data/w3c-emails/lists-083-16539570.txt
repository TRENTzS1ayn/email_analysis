Hi Martin,

Some followup on your comments. 

The first comments you make refer to a checkpoint, since deleted,
on rendering according to natural language. At the face-to-face
meeting in December, we decided to delete the checkpoint since
we felt that "proper I18N rendering" was not an accessibility
issue. Refer to issue 140.

http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/1999/12/ftf-19991209#issue-140

In fact a comment you made after some clarifications seems to
suggest the same opinion:

Thank you for your detailed comments about handling I18N
markup and HTTP information. This should be integrated
into a set of I18N guidelines for user agents.

 _ Ian
