Hello,

The 15 January 2000 Guidelines [1] and Techniques [2] documents
are available. The list of changes [3] is inserted below. The
issues list is also updated [4].

Note: Due to a change in the "short name" (W3C parlance"
from "WAI-USERAGENT" to "UAAG", links from old (undated) versions to
new (undated) versions may not work as desired. I will e
pursuing this with the W3C Web Team.

Looking forward to comments,

 - Ian
