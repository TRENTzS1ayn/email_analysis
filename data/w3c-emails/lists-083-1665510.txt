aloha, thatch!

please, don't worry about not answering my questions earlier -- i am simply
glad that you took my note as it was intended: as a nudge, and definitely not a
nose-tweak!

you bring up 2 interesting points: first, that -- as regards its interaction
with HPR -- quote Netscape is closer in concept to the a protocol (HTTP) for
HPR than it is a user interface.unquote

yet, as intriguing as that line of thought may be, i would, however, like to
discuss the second point you raised in a bit more detail...  you noted that, in
HPR's default configuration, synchronization with the Netscape view is set to
OFF...  while i admit that most HPR users may never change the default setting,
there are definitely feasible slash probable scenarios where one can envision a
blind user changing the setting so as to work with sighted colleagues, to teach
sighted colleagues about the web, to illustrate a point to a web or intranet
development team, etc.

but that isn't really the gist of my concern...  what concerns me is that the
"graphical view", which HPR is capable of importing from Netscape is available
to the user...  therefore, it seems only logical that, since the graphical
rendering of a document is available upon demand, the presentation of the
graphical view should be governed by the UI-related checkpoints...

as for the issue of upon whose shoulders the responsibility for ensuring that
the "graphical view" is compliant, i suppose that that is something that needs
to be worked out between IBM SNS and Netscape...

thanks again for helping us work out this issue -- speaking personally, i have
found your insights to be quite valuable in my own evaluation of the UAGL...
