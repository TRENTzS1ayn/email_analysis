Hello,

I published unified conformance schema [1] that's linke from the home
page. In order to resolve issue 136 quickly tomorrow, please
review the proposal. This page would be referenced by all the
Guidelines as an explanation of how to claim conformance. In
the UAGL we would:

a) Link to that (generic) document for explanation
b) Provide the (specific) details of how to claim conformance
   to the UAGL

Thank you,

 - Ian
