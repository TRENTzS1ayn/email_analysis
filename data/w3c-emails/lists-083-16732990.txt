I like it.

I am not sure if I will be able to make the teleconference - I may be in
Seattle, or I may only be on the way.

And woth regards to my action item I hav written to a couple of people but
not yet got a response. Please mark it as continuing for another week.

  Hello,
  
  I published unified conformance schema [1] that's linke from the home
  page. In order to resolve issue 136 quickly tomorrow, please
  review the proposal. This page would be referenced by all the
  Guidelines as an explanation of how to claim conformance. In
  the UAGL we would:
  
  a) Link to that (generic) document for explanation
  b) Provide the (specific) details of how to claim conformance
     to the UAGL
  
  Thank you,
  
   - Ian
