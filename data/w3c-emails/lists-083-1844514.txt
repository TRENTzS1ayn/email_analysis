Include elements which have a mouseover in the tabbing order (I think IE only
recognises the attribute on links anyway, so that isn't very hard) and
provide an option to link onmouseover and onfocus as teh same event.

  One of the things that the CSS working group has produced is test suites - a
  set of pages you can use to check whether you conform.
  
  In reading through the evaluation tests I noticed that there are certain
  clear things that should be checked. A classic example is keyboard
  activation
  - how does a user activate an onMouseover without a mouse?
  
  perhaps we should create some example pages for testing.
  
  This also relates to WCAG - what should we test for in areas where WCAG has
  an "until user agents" requirement? SHould we test pages which conform to
  WCAG, or pages which do not, or both?
  
  Hmm. I feel like I have asked a lot of questions in the last week or so, and
  have not offered much in the way of answers or even suggested answers.
