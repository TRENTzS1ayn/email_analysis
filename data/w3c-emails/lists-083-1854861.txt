This could also be done as a javascript - in PERL the action you want to do
is

s/onmouseover="([^"]+)"/onmouseover="$1" onfocus="$1"/

I used to have a WordBasic script that did something similar. Basically yu
search for onmouseover=", get to the quotation mark, put everything up to the
next quotation mark in a buffer, and then add an onfocus="(whatevris in the
buffer)" attribute. Or you could work through the DOM - for those who have
one, such as IE, that helps interoperability...

This is based on the fact that there are not pages which use onfocus and
onmouseover to do different things. Since that would represent a very wierd
appraoch to user interface design, I think it is a safe assumption.  similar
process can be applied to onmouseout/onblur, which i think is justified for
the same reason.

  Include elements which have a mouseover in the tabbing order (I think IE only
  recognises the attribute on links anyway, so that isn't very hard) and
  provide an option to link onmouseover and onfocus as teh same event.

    I'd be interested in hearing suggestions about how a UA might provide
    mouse-over activation without a mouse.  We haven't thought up any good
    solutions.

    One of the things that the CSS working group has produced is test suites - a
    set of pages you can use to check whether you conform.
    
    In reading through the evaluation tests I noticed that there are certain
    clear things that should be checked. A classic example is keyboard
    activation
    - how does a user activate an onMouseover without a mouse?
    
    perhaps we should create some example pages for testing.
    
    This also relates to WCAG - what should we test for in areas where WCAG has
    an "until user agents" requirement? SHould we test pages which conform to
    WCAG, or pages which do not, or both?
    
    Hmm. I feel like I have asked a lot of questions in the last week or so, and
    have not offered much in the way of answers or even suggested answers.
