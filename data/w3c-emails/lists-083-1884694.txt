aloha, charles!

after ruminating that
>perhaps we should create some example pages for testing.

you asked:

>WCAG, or pages which do not, or both?

i would argue that our (meaning the UA WG's) primary focus should be on pages
that conform to the WCAG and all current specifications -- building, locating,
and / or maintaining pages that illustrate "until user agents..." strategies
should be the responsibility of either the WCAG group or EO...

oh, and one last thing -- i would gladly assist in the construction slash
development of test suites slash example pages...

gregory.
