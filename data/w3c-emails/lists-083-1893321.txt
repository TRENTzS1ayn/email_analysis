aloha, again, charles!

a further update on Opera -- as i noted in my compliance eval of the UAGL with
HAL95, in the comments following checkpoint 1.1 [reference 1], Opera has
difficulty identifying hyperlink text in ordered and unordered lists if any
markup is used in the hyperlink text, in particular, ACRONYM, ABBR, or EM... 

this afternoon, i noticed a further anomaly -- when tabbing sequentially
through links, i traversed a link whose hyperlink text i happen to know
includes a word contained in <em> </em> -- moving forward through the links,
the entire hyperlink text was voiced, but when i backtracked and moved through
the links in reverse sequential order, only the word contained within the EM
container was voiced...

when i noticed this behavior, i was using JFW 3.3.26 -- i unloaded JFW and
loaded HAL, and then tried navigating the ordered list again...  things worked
out similarly -- when i reached the link in which the EM container was used by
navigating forward link-by-link, the entire hyperlink text was spoken, but when
i moved back link-by-link, only the word contained in the EM container was
spoken...

a further anomaly is encountered when the first word in the hyperlink text is
marked up -- such as:in the following example from
<http://www.hicom.net/~oedipus/books/index.html> in which underscores are used
to indicate EM on and EM off:
        _Rebecca and Rowena_, a complete work by W.M .Thackeray

when the link is selected by reverse sequential navigation of links, HAL
repeated the hyperlink text from the previous link (i.e. the link which had
just lost focus) in the following manner:
        "deselect [hyperlink text of previous link]"

switching back to JFW, when traversing the page link-by-link in reverse order,
using the "Q" keystroke, when i reached the link to the Thackeray book, JFW
echoed absolutely nothing...  and, upon screen-review of the hyperlink text,
the entire line is spoken..

gregory.
