My question was in the context of providing access for accessibility tools.
For mechanisms like the CSS :hover pseudoclass, and onmouseover/onmouseout
events in the object model, I don't see a clear solution for providing these
mechanisms.  The OM is particularly difficult, because I've seen lots of
pages developed that use onmouseover to switch the visible content of
another area (a clickless frame-selection, sort of).  Horrendously bad
content-design decision for accessibility, perhaps, but I'd been pondering
whether there was some way we could expose that capability to ATs.

aloha, chris!

is it really necessary to simulate a mouse-over event in the case of
exposing
the TITLE attribute when used, for example, as an attribute in the
definition
of a horizontal rule?  wouldn't it be simpler to offer the user a choice --
i.e. a "Display Horizontal Rules" and "Display Title (where present)"
setting
for horizontal rules?  

and, while i suppose that this may be a suggestion more appropriately
addressed
to AT developers, who could substitute the content of the TITLE attribute
for a
horizontal rule --  provided, of course, that the AT is capable of making a
DOM
call to obtain the necessary information...

which mousover events in particular are you attempting to make available to
the
mouseless user?  knowing that would greatly assist us in assisting you...

gregory.
