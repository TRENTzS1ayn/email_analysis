aloha, chris!

this is something that concerns me greatly as well, but more from the
perspective of obtaining any information derived from javascripted events that
are exposed by on mouseover ...

to take an example close to home, consider the main Microsoft home page
<http://www.microsoft.com>

as i noted in a UA teleconference some time in june or july, the toolbar slash
nav bar at the top of the page offers the following options:

Home  Events/Training  Subscribe  About Microsoft  US/Worldwide  Downloads 
MSN.com

all of which are voiced when one navigates the page sequentially using the tab
key...  however, on mouseover, each of the items in the tool/nav bar spawn a
pop-down submenu of options that are not available to me as a speech user --
even if i traverse the nav/tool bar with JFW's mouse emulation cursor, despite
the fact that a sighted colleague can see the extended options appear on the
screen...  the drop-menus that are spawned on mouseover are not automatically
voiced, nor can they be considered navigatable as:

1. without sighted assistance, there is no way for a blind user to know that
they have been painted to the screen

2. even if one has such foreknowledge, it is difficult to navigate the
drop-down menu using speech, as the entire line of text (i.e. everything on the
screen, including the text which is partially obscured by the drop-down menu)
is read, making it difficult to ascertain what text belongs where -- a
difficulty which is exacerbated by the fact that when one queries JFW for font
and attribute information, it returns the font and attribute information for
the text behind slash beneath the mouseover invoked drop-down menu...
