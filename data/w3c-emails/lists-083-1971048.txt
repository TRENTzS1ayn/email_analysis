I am coming to believe we need to have a different sub grouping for
"targeted" or "specialized" user agnets that are trying to improve access
for a particular disability.  It would have some of the features of both
the DGUA and DUA subgroups.  I think that our guidelines should help people
who are trying to do the thinks HPR, pwWebSpeak and VPInfoNet are trying to
do and I think we have a good sub classing for DGUA and technologies that
depend on them for access.  I will try to write a proposal soon for this class.
