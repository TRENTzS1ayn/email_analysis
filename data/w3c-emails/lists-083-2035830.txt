Meta Information - CSS insertions

css2 can insert text strings in to a document base on the style sheet
selectors.

There are 2 special elements (:before and :after) called "pseudo-elements."
These can be used with the "content" property to add any string of text
before or after a block level (such as body, P, li) element.

for example a style sheet with the following rule
p.note:before { content: "Note:  " }

The style sheet would add the text _Note:  _ at the beginning of every
paragraph with a class of .note.

this text is not in the actual document, it is generated by the style sheet.
There is no limit to the amount of text that can be placed in the "content"
property. No current browser that I tested (IE, Netscape, Opera, Amaya)
supports this feature of CSS2.
