Implementing schemas (correctly) may enable a user agent to do neat things
with them. However at this stage it is a technique for giving access to
content - "implement specifications correctly" is probably the requirement,
and that is hardly unique to schemas or even metadata specifications in
general.

(Although it should be noted that certain metadata concepts are included in
the HTML specification itself)
