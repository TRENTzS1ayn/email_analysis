The W3C WAI authoring tool working group has placed their working draft in
last call status with undefined dependencies on the user agent guidelines.
I would like to recruit several user agent working group memebrs to review
their working draft and generate a list of comments for consideration by
the authoring tools group.  The user agent working group memebrs will have
an opportunity to review and discuss the list before the list is sent to
the authoring tool group for comment.  

As chair of user agent guidelines working group I will coordinate the
comments from user agent working group (unless somebofy else really wants
to).  

Dependencies are very important and we will be asking other W3C groups to
review our document.   If we want other working groups to take time to
review our document, we need to offer them the same courtesy.  I encourage
all working members to review and send comments to AU, but I would like to
get a committment from a few UA members to draft a formal reply to their
request.

If you are interested participating, please contact me.  

Thanks,
Jon
