For the authoring tools group this is useful feedback, but it appears to
document the requirements that the Authoring Tools group might have on the
User Agent Guidelines - what is required in last call is for the User Agent
group to identify what it requires in the Authoring Tool Guidelines (if
anything) and let the AU group know so  that appropriate adjustments can be
made before the document becomes a proposed recommendation.

  3rd version, http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WAI-AUTOOLS-19990903/ ,? of the
  authoring tool guidelines and found the following dependencies with the August
  27th version of the user agent guidelines?
