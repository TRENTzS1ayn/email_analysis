Not quite.  This is a situation-dependent difference in what is acceptable.  

The User agent should attempt repair and tell the user what it can
determine about the undocumented entity.  The authoring tool which can get
better information from the author should not use this repair strategy
automatically -- that would make it too tempting for the author to avoid
providing the right kind of information.  The user agent may and should
apply grosser hacks to work with bad content than the authoring tools
should automate.
