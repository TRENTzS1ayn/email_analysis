Al,
Would you be able to attend the UA telecon next week?

We will be talking about Spawned Windows.  
Issue #78: Review requirements for window spawning
http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#78

You commented to the list on the issue a couple weeks ago and your input
would be helpful.

Thanks,
Jon
