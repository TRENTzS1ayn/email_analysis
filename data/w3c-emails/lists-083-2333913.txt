Mark,
We are just looking for a technique that shows how to correctly render the
MAP element with text links or with ALT text rendered.  Cathy Laws stated
that HPR does this and is going to send an example.  
Do you have another example of how it is being done?
Would you be willing to submit it as a technique?

Jon
