hi jon

if i'm understanding you correctly, that is what the Links Power Toy
that we developed using M'soft model does, it will walk the AREA element
and render ALT Text versus an URL, etc.  This can easily be enhanced
further, and is the basis for HelpDB and my current work on browser
helper opjects, which by the way use COM to get at the browser and are
very, very, very fast ;)

If you want an example, try the Links Power Toy, it works in IE 4, 5,
and is simple to install and test, and since it is an HTML file, the source
is freely available.
