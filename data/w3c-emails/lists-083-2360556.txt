Again, Ian, I much prefer the old 8.3. At least I understand
8.3. The propsoed rewording is, for me abstract and confusing.
I think a big problem I have is the use of "device independence"
as a carry all. The sentence using that phrase doesn't  work for
me.

Previously posted:
PROPOSAL 4) Checkpoint 8.3. The current text:

       Allow the user to navigate just among table cells of
       a table (notably left and right within a row and up
       and down within a column).

    I propose that this checkpoint be for all users agents, with
    the following note afterwards:

       Navigation techniques include keyboard navigation from
       cell to cell (e.g., using the arrow keys) and scrolling.
       Note, however, that users must be able to navigate in
       an input-device independent manner.
