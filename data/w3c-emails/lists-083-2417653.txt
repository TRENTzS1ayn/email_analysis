I attach a file I prepared in anticipation of being able to evaluate
pwWebSpeak. It is modeled after that Jim Thatcher used. Thanks, Jim,
for the design. It seems particularly useful for evaluating a
particular user agent, as it allows comments about individual checkpoints.

I suggest it may be generally useful (undoing the references to pwWebSpeak,
and me as evaluator).
