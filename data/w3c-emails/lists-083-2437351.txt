Here are some techniques related to client-side maps based on IBM Home Page
Reader:

If alternative text (alt or title) is available and not null for the element
(like INPUT or IMG) that points to a client-side map, then render some text
indicating a map (like "Start of map") plus the alternative text and the number
of areas in the map. If alt text is null, do not render the map or its areas.

For each AREA in the map, if alternative text (alt or title) is available and
not null, then render the alternative text as a link. Otherwise,  render some
text like "Map area" plus part or all of the href as a link. If alt text is null
for an AREA, do not render that AREA.

When reading through the whole web page, read the start of map alternative text
with the number of areas,  but skip over the AREA links. To read and activate
the map areas, use keys that read and navigate link by link or element by
element.
