Jim has picked up a significant sloppiness in my discussion
of abbr and acronym: mixing up tag and element. Repairs below,
as usual, using XdeleteX and _insert_. Also here is the
precipitating discussion.

You are right. I should have been careful to distinguish
element content from the start-tag and end-tag that bound
it.

A tag is bracketed by "<" and ">". A start-tag names the
element it starts, and may contain attributename="value"
pairs describing that instance of the named element. The
element content is that between its start-tag and end-tag.
The end-tag commences with "</" followed by the elementname
then ">". For example a target anchor:

     <A name="ibmref">International Business Machines</A>

An element type declared EMPTY in the DTD has the special
combined end-tag form, such as

     <HR title="table definition"/>.

The explanation for an abbr or acronym may either be text
found at and generally before the first occurrence, effectively the 
definition, or possibly the definition is
elsewhere. For example,

     <a name="ibmdef">International Business Machines</a>
     abbreviated (<abbr><a href="#ibmdef">IBM</a></abbr>).

Each subsequent occurrence of the abbreviation IBM can be:
     <abbr title="International Business Machines">IBM</abbr>
with its expansion in the localized value for the title.

If the expansion is more extensive, the author could
enclose each of the abbreviations in a reference:
     <abbr><a href="#ibmdef">IBM</a></abbr>

The first one for consistency can also include that href.

>Is there a different/more general meaning for
>"content" used in w3c/wai? Please believe me, that is a question!

No, I need to be consistent with HTML and XML terminology,
less sloppy than I used it. Below, I clean up that source
of confusion. I mark my original with XdeleteX _insert_

Right. I misread your thought: "with in the tag and end tag".
Your example is correct. Content is between the start-tag and
its corresponding end-tag. What is within a (start-)tag is
element name and possibly attributename="value" pairs.

The title="expansion" attribute of the start-tag for that
