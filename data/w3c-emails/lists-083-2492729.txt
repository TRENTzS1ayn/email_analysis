JRG: They are two different concepts, so I have no problem with splitting them

JRG: I would like to see the word "content" or "content and alternative
content" instead of "structure" in previous sentence.  To me this
checkpoint is about making sure the user gets access to all the content.

JRG: This seems fine with me, since we have the clause related to supported
devices

JRG: I think the term list is more general and allows for more information
than just the number to be provided
