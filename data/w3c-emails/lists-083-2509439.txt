One of the issues in WC and UA has been the specification and use of
natural language (English, Japanese, French.... ) of the document and
support the inclusion of natural language information.  I noticed that is
mentioned in the AU techniques for Checkpoint 3.1 and 4.1, but no
checkpoint that deals with the issue directly.  You may want to consider
adding a checkpoint for compatibility with both user agent and web content,
since web content has an entire guideline on the topic and user agent has
several checkpoints.
