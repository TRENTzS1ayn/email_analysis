KB  Is there any meaning behind the switch in terms from 
"may be operated through" to "available" through? Could
the guideline say "may be operated through standard 
 input devices."  The word operated just seems clearer to me.

KB  I agree with Mark Novak in that I don't think we can
say that users must understand the content. Are we trying
to suggest that the user should be able to move through
a document element by element? When I see the words
"access to the document structure" I think you mean
something like "allow the user to get an overview of the 
structure of the document."  But are what we really 
trying to say is "Ensure the user can access the
document structure one element at a time?" or "Ensure
that the user has access to the content of each element
in a document (e.g table cells, list items)

KB I like the idea of removing the words W3C from guideline 7
to make it more generic since checkpoint 7.1 is not specific to
W3C technologies

KB I am sure we will discuss the implications of
"allowing" developers to not conform to guideline 6 
because as you say Ian, the proposal does "seem to undermine 
the goal of interoperability" and it scares me a bit.

KB  In summary, I would love to remove the
distinction between graphical and dependent
user agents if at all possible as long as we
don't loose leverage with developers.
Easier said that done, right? 

Thanks Ian
