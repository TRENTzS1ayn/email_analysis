Hello, 

As per my action item of [1], here's a proposal for new
wording for checkpoint 4.12 of [2].

Old Text:

   4.12 Allow the user to turn on and off rendering of frames. [Priority

New Text:

   4.12 Allow the user to choose between a frameset or its
        alternative supplied by the author. 

        Note. For example, in HTML, allow the user to
              choose between a frameset or a NOFRAMES
              alternative. The ability to control frames is 
              important for users with screen readers and users 
              with some cognitive impairments. 

Note that in this formulation, there is no reference
to "turning frames on or off". 

At no extra cost, here's a proposed addition to checkpoint 8.1

Current Text:

  8.1 Allow the user to navigate viewports (including frames).
  Note. Navigating into a viewport makes it the current viewport.

Proposed addition to the beginning of the Note: 

For example, when all frames of a frameset are displayed 
side-by-side, allow the user to navigate among them
with the keyboard. Or, when frames are displayed individually
(e.g., by a text browser or speech synthesizer), provide
a list of links to individual frames.
