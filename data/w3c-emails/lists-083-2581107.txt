Hello,

As per my action item of [1], here's a proposed NEW checkpoint
about form orientation based on Gregory Rosmaita's original proposal
[2].
(It resembles checkpoint 9.6 of [3], for links).

Provide information about the structure and navigation mechanisms
specified for a form. [Priority 2].
   For instance, provide information about controls with explicitly
   associated labels, about which keys activate the form controls,
   about the serial navigation order of the form controls, and
   about control groups (e.g., in HTML specified with the FIELDSET
   and OPTGROUP elements). 

We should also include cross-references about device-independent
activation and navigation.

Since checkpoint 9.10 deals with labels, it could be subsumed
by this proposed checkpoint. Checkpoint 9.10 reads:

 Provide the user with access to any label explicitly 
 associated with a form control. [Priority 2] 

 - Ian
