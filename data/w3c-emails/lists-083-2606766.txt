MN:  in theory I agree with alot of what you're saying Marja-Riitta.  One
of the things in favor of access, as defined in terms of keyboard access,
is that
voice, Morse, scanning, switch, etc., input methods all get translated into
keyboard events inside the operating system, thus by "default" if an object
is accessible via the keyboard, it should be accessible via these other methods.

No guarentees for the future, but any such change would break alot of software.
