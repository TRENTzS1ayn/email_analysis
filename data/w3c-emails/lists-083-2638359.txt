Actually, there are those in the world who could use the "keyboard" language
to make things inaccessible.  What we really want is access via character
codes, such as the Control-X code.  So long as the UA uses standard system
hooks to get character codes from the keyboard, all is good.  But if the
author decides to read the keyboard hardware directly, alternative access
technologies would be cut out.  The question is how to phrase the desire for
direct shortcuts via character codes or keyboard events (the Alt key doesn't
have a character code, I don't think, but might be used to control some
types of system events, such as activating the menu bar.) in language that
is unambiguous.

Subject: Re: Guideline 2 & device independence

MN:  in theory I agree with alot of what you're saying Marja-Riitta.  One
of the things in favor of access, as defined in terms of keyboard access,
is that
voice, Morse, scanning, switch, etc., input methods all get translated into
keyboard events inside the operating system, thus by "default" if an object
is accessible via the keyboard, it should be accessible via these other
methods.

No guarentees for the future, but any such change would break alot of
software.
