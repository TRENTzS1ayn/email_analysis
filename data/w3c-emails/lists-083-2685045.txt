Harvey you raised this issue and we discussed in today's teleconference and
came to a tenative resolution.  The following is the minutes of the
discussion and the resolution.  
Is this OK with you?


7) Issue #82 Rendering image in a link when there's no alt.
http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#82 

When images are turned off, how do you indicate the link? 

AG: The "altifier" tool does this. E.g., for a link to the same place on
the same page, it steals the link text. 

Resolved (pending comments from Harvey): Add info to techniques document
about this. 

Action Ian: Link to "altifier" from Techniques document.

Link to ER tools page from techniques.
