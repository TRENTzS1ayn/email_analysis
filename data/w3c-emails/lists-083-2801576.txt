This comment is concerning the third issue dealing with bubbling.

This is not a consensus of PF, DOM or any working group, just some ideas.

What would happen if only the element bearing the event-handler attribute were
treated as active?? Treating all descendants of a script-bearing element as
active elements defeats the purpose of navigating just the active elements
already, it would seem to me.

The fundamental requirement, so far as I know, is to be able to reach all
interactive actions available in the document.? This is satisfied by treating
the element that actually declares the event handler a member of the effective
active-elements set.

To me, the script which checks for what descendant the mouse was in when it is
fired is a violation of the WCAG guideline to use structural markup properly.?
I am afraid that viewing all descendants of a script-bearing element as active
is an over-reaction to a potential abuse.

Is the method (with heredity of 'active' status over subelements of an active
element which handles an event that can bubble) in use in any browser or
assistive technology or combination at present?? Is there any confirmation
with
user testing that it works?
