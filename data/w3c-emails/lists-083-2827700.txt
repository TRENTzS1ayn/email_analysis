JRG: Checkpoint 8.1 refers to making scripts accessible, but I do not
beleive the WC techniques document talks about this issue.

JRG: I do not believe that any assistive technologies are treating
scripting events as active elements.  But this will need to change to make
web based user interfaces more accessible.
