Hi,

I looked back at this text from [3] and I'm not sure I understand.
Why does it belong in the section on device independence? Is this
about user agents *generating* text from audio? Or about ensuring
that author-supplied text is available? 

Or does "audio" mean "speech"?

Before adding to the document, I need some clarification.

Thank you,

 - Ian
