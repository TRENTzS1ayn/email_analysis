JRG: I believe the primary concern is that audio (sampled sounds) files
have text descriptions available of the sound file.  Whether the sound is
speech or any other types of sound.  The text should describe the sounds,
include a transcript of the speech (if any) or lyrics to a song in the wave
file.  I believe that in general we want to have text descriptions of any
document format that is encoding audio.

Madeline is this response address your conerns related to this issue?
