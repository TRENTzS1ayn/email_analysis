User agent group participants,
I  would like to solicite agenda items from the working group for the
face-to-face meeting in Redmond Washington on October 11-12.  You may send
your request to the ua list or to the chair.  The chair will use the
requests to help formulate the final agenda in coordination with the
working group and W3C staff.  You do not need to be attending the meeting
to submit agenda requests.

A tentative agenda for the meeting is available at:

Look forward to hearing from you,
Jon
