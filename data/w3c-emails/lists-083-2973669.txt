Hello,

In the 27 August draft [1], there are two checkpoints related
to style sheets 4.9 and 4.10 (turning on/off user and author styles).

I propose adding a checkpoint to Guideline 5 that reads:

(Priority 2): Allow the user to select from among author and
              user style sheets associated with a document.

This interacts with 4.9 and 4.10 because it implicitly says
"select these and turn off those."
