MN2:  I'm thus still in favor of the original wording, and not splitting
1.1 into two parts.

MN2:  I don't understand. To me "structure" and "content" imply two
different things.  I prefer the original wording using "content" when
refering to an "element", which to me also implies some kind of
markup, otherwise I'm not sure what determined I have an element.  My
first wording change was trying to give the "element" some identity,
by describing a table cell, list item, etc. , which was what I thought
the original checkpoint dealt with versus the proposed change to
structure, that's all.

MN2:  Ahh, certainly, that helps and I agree, that this is indeed one
method to provide easier access to the content, via a structure
related/organized "view".

MN2:  Perhaps I jumped ahead of things here a bit, but my concern
is that navigating a web page, and navigating a web page table, might
in fact be best done using the same keyboard keys, for example.  Thus
the UA or dependent UA must some how distinguish when the user is
in one mode or the other.  Thus my adding "staying within".

Also, what I don't think we address, although I'm not sure we
have to, is how the user gets into a table to start with, prior
to navigating it.

MN2:  I think it depends upon the final wording.  I'd certainly like
all user agent's to provide this capability.

MN2:  I guess if the later, more a table of contents (TOC), then
i'd opt for adding "navigable" as well.

MN2:  As long as the points are covered, I'll  leave the slicing up
to the expert.

MN2: no new comments from me beyond this point of this email
