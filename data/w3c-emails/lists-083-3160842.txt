Kitch,
I think that part of the issue you are concerned about is who responsible
for determining if a particular user agent or assistive technology conforms.  

Is it developer?  
Is it consumers?  
Is it some "expert"?

If there is no defined method for validation of conformance for not only
UA, but other guidelines, then maybe we reallu don't need the conformance
statement at all.  I don't think it should be up to individual developers 

I have already sent a message to the coordination group to discuss this
issue.  I think it is a cross working group issue and one UA and WC
(although it is probably alot easier for WC) to determine conformance.

The other issue is what do consumers know they are getting.  I think any
conformance statement for assistive technology should describe the input
and output technologies they support.

Jon
