Guideline is not a checkpoint, so it is not what people check, it does not
even have priorities. It is put higher up because it is important, still
this guideline does not need to be conformed always. So I'm confuced.

Then I look the actual checkspoint under the guideline, such as

2.1 By default and without additional customization, ensure that all
> functionalities offered by the user agent are accessible using the keyboard.

And I'm even more confused. Here I agree we should mention keyboard, but
when we have mentioned it, it seems not to help. Can I use some of my
keyboard keys (or even my keyboard mouse for pointing) and conform to this?
I don't think this is what we want.

Does everybody else understand this perfectly and agree that the current
wording reflects it? Then I will stop.
