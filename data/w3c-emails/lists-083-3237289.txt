Hi Harvey,

Thank you for the comments. Comments that I've

If we are not to discuss XML at all in the techniques,
I'd rather not mention them. We made the same choice
for WCAG in the end.

I'd rather not go into that much detail. I like the point
about informing the user when a table edge has been reached.

Why would this go under searching? But I'll add to the
section on Navigation of Document Structure.

Right now there's no order. However, it's a good idea to
consider some order. I guess numerical is good enough.

I suppose this is regular keyboard, since the need would be less
pressing on a specialized keyboard.

This is a really interesting question. We haven't (I believe) included
any
non-technical policy resources. I see no harm, and it could be useful,
but I wonder what others think.

HTML defines the value of "accesskey" to be a Unicode character.
Thus, accesskeys are case-sensitive (or rather - case doesn't even
apply).

I would love it if someone let me know how to update this
if necessary.
