Hi Kasper,

We have taken longer than expected to publish these Guidelines,
unfortunately.

I'm surprised that you say that since we have considered software
other than IE and NN and other platforms as well (I'm a Linux user,
for one, and our colleagues use Lynx, Amaya, Opera, Home Page
Reader, PWWebSpeak, Jaws, and other tools.)

Our goal is not at all to give the big browser companies a means for
displaying a token stamp of approval. The goal is to ensure
that functional requirements of people with disabilities are 
are being met by tools and to tell developers what those needs are.

Better now than later.

While you find this obvious (I'm glad), this is not always done in
practice.
There is software that bypasses standard APIs (to improve performance
I believe) and that throws off assistive technology that relies on
standard system calls.

UA developers are not asked to make accessible what is not in their
purview. We wouldn't ask you to make RPMs accessible. However,
developers
can choose formats for their documentation. We ask them to provide
at least one accessible format. 

What specifically do you think we're asking developers to control that
we shouldn't?

To what problems do you refer? I would be very interested to 
hear when access through the keyboard is not a good idea. I do
almost everything I need with my keyboard in emacs.

I guess I should point you to one of the companion guidelines
for Web Content Developers [1]. We don't say "don't use scripts",
but we do say that your pages have to work when scripts are
not supported or turned off.

Yikes! My name is even on the HTML portion of that one!

This is a hot topic at W3C these days and movements to open
up the process further. (Side note: all of the WAI Working
Groups are open and we are always looking for input, such as yours).
Stay tuned for what I hope is an evolution in the direction
of more openness.

I'd be happy to call you and talk if you have the time. I really
appreciate your quick feedback so far.

Thank you,
