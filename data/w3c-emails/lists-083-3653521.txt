IJ: Please don't speak as reps of W3C; instead forward any requests to W3C

JB: Just send them the URL in the invitation to review and cc Jon or Ian. 

5) WCAG is beginning rechartering process. Attend those teleconfs and send
comments if you wish.

6) Techniques Document review.

DEADLINE FOR TECHNIQUES: 17 November (preferable 15 November). 

IJ: If you come upon an issue during a review, please send issues to the
list in individual emails (not as part of a larger techniques document). 

IJ: Please send *specific* techniques. My apologies for current
language/inconsistencies/unreadability. 

1.1: Be more specific to mouse and keyboard. 

IJ: Problems? 

HB: Some table questions not yet resolved. 

JG: Propose that if an accessible API is not available, then implement one. 

IJ: I don't think we should require them to implement additional APIs. 

MR: It sounds like some devices don't have keyboard API. 

IJ: Requirement to use keyboard API in systems where it's standard. 

KB: Does this have to be a checkpoint? Or can it be a technique? 

GR: I can see the utility of such a checkpoint. But at this point in the
process, I don't know whether we know enough to make its own checkpoint. 

KB: So would the checkpoint say "Whatever device you're using, provide an
accessible way to access it." 

IJ: I think hardware requirements are out of scope. We haven't discussed
"devices" before, only software. 

DP: Some systems that have only a user agent (i.e., not a UA on top of an
operating system). 

Action KB: Post information about Easy Access/Infrared technology to list. 

Technique review and expansions:

Jim Allan: Propose CSS Techniques 
(section 3.1 and individual checkpoints, notably of G3 and G4.) 

User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 

     Guideline 1. Support input and output device-independence
     Review by: Rich Schwerdtfeger 

     Guideline 2. Ensure user access to all content

     Guideline 3. Allow the user to turn off rendering or behavior that may
reduce accessibility
     Review by: Jim Allan, Madeliene Rothberg (multi-media) 

     Guideline 4. Ensure user control over styles 
     Reviewer: Jim Allan, Madeleine Rothberg (multi-media) 

     Guideline 5. Observe operating system conventions and standard interfaces 
     Reviewer: Dick Brown 

     Guideline 6. Implement open specifications and their accessibility
features 
     Reviewer: none, see references fo MR SMIL and SAMI techniques, DB will
ask someone from Microsoft Multi-media to review 

     Guideline 7. Provide navigation mechanisms 
     Reviewer: Kitch Barnicle 

     Guideline 8. Help orient the user 
     Reviewer: Jon Gunderson 

     Guideline 9. Notify the user of content and viewport changes 
     Reviewer: Charlese McCathieNevile 

     Guideline 10. Allow the user to configure the user agent 
     Reviewer: Mickey Quenzer 

     Guideline 11. Provide accessible product documentation and help
     Reviewer: Gregory J. Rosmaita, David Poehlman 

Accessibility Topics 

     3.1 User control of style 
     Reviewer: Jim Allan 

     3.2 Link techniques 
     Reviewer: Ian Jacons 

     3.3 Table techniques 
     Reviewer: Harvey Bingham 

     3.4 Frame techniques 
     Reviewer: none 

     3.5 Form techniques
     Reviewer: Gregory J. Rosmaita 

     3.6 Script techniques 
     Reviewer: Charles McCathieNevile 

     3.7 Abbreviations and acronyms 
     Reviewer: none 

IJ: Review Madeleine's techniques (for G2). 

JA: A lot of MR's techniques fall into Guideline on control of style. 

IJ: Goal: 
a) Have a technique for each checkpoint. 
b) Ensure that every checkpoint implemented in some browser. 

Action RS: Send last call document to IBM's Web Team in Austin. 

JG: Any documented accessibility features of SAMI? 

Action DB: Contact Dave Bolnick about SAMI access. 

Note: IJ and CMN will be at MS next week to discuss Guidelines with IE Team. 

JG: Add a new topic: Extensibility of user agent UI. 
(add menu items, add code, etc.) 

GR: Is this using visual basic? 

JG: Not necessarily. You can add menu items and code. 

RS: You can add chrome around browsing window. You can embed the browsing
component in a separate application. 

JG: You can add items to the registry. 

IJ: Seems to me to be covered by the configuration Guideline. 

RS: We haven't discussed embedding browser into other applications 
(e.g., specific look and feel for a particular disability). 

7) On checkpoint 10.2 

DB: Would prefer P3, but can live with P2. Still waiting for review. 

8) RS: "Implement" or "Support" HTML 4.0?

IJ: "Support" for things without specs. "Implement" for things with specs. 

9) No last call comments have come in yet!

10) Bryan Campbell's concern about deletion of keyboard Guideline.

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999OctDec/0254.html 

JG: We'll have this on our list of last call issues. 

JG: Will discuss further at face-to-face based on other input as well. 

GR: I've talked to Bryan a little off-line to reassure him. 

GR supports keyboard, but felt it was logically inconsistent to push for
device independence while emphasizing keyboard. Pointed Bryan to initial
proposal and asked to review last call draft to see if his concerns were
addressed. 

11) Impact matrix

Action KB: Update impact matrix based on 5 November draft. 

12) Current appendix for dependent UA functionalities

IJ: Does anyone have any objections? 

None.
