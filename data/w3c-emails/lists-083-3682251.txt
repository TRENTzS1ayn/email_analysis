Next week is Comdex which will occupy the pc world for awhile, if it seems
last call reviewers are unavailable that could be a reason
http://www5.zdnet.com/zdnn/special/comdexfall99.html

On reviews actually getting here the notice reads as if reviewers must
subscribe to the list to send it to the Group. If that is so the UA Group
should send a note to the list with subscribe & unsubscribe information to
be forwarded to prospective reviewers

Regards
Bryan
