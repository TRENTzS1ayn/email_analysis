Gregg,
Would you like to see the EZAccess techniques referenced in the USer Agent
Guidelines?

Basically it would be a URL reference in the User Agents techniques
document to the Trace Web Site related to the EZAccess techniques.  The US
techniques document would have about one line about what type of user agent
developers may want to visit the EZAccess site.  No details of EZAccess
implmentation would be included in the UA techniques document.

I proposed this to the User Agent working group and most people are not
familar with the EZAccess techniques.  I have seen them demonstrated, but
an not completely familar with the details of the technologies Trace and
others are developing.  The current Trace web pages related to EZAccess
seem to be under construction, so I wanted to get your opinion on whether
you felt it should be included.  

Thanks,
Jon
