Hi Jon,

How many technique or protocol proposals will be in this section? 

Also, how would this category be referenced in the main document?

Finally, how do new strategies get into the doc after it goes out?

My general concerns in asking these questions are that 
- by mentioning only a couple approaches it could be construed as the
  document's recommended approach no matter what the disclaimer

- if it doesn't get updated in internet time, enquiring designers will
  miss out on a whole slew possibilities to consider that are or will
  be emerging from the telecomm, auto, etc. interaction environments.

- if EZAccess or AIIP don't work for the designer they'll think access
  isn't readily acheivable.

Earl
