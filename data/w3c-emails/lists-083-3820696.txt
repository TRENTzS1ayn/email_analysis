I review currently the nov 5 draft and each time I do from the first,
I get a queasy feeling about empty alternatives.  I understand on the
one hand why and agree with the sentament that the word image repeated
<50 11> times is pretty obnoxious.  Consider for a monemt though that
an image that has no alt text is one that is downloadable or is
desired to be.  if Nothing is rendered, it cannot be found by a screen
reader but through digging out the source assuming one knows that it
is there in the first place.  Can we then have a ttoggle for this?  so
that we can have either the url or nothing rendered?
Thanks!
