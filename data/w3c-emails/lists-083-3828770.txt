Techniques for Checkpoint 2.2 If more than one alternative equivalent is
available for content, allow the user to choose from among the
alternatives. This includes the choice of viewing no alternatives. [Priority 1]

2.2.1 Allow the user to select their preferred language when rendering
audio descriptions.  The selection can be based on user preferences in
either the user agent or the operating system.  The preferences made in the
user agent should have higher priority than preferences made in the OS.
