Regarding the December Face to Face Meeting in Austin:

I just received a call from the Renaissance hotel reminding me that the
last day for getting the special room rate for this November 17
(Wednesday). Apparently they have not received many reservations, so I
thought I would remind people that if they are planning to attend to
reserve the room ASAP.
