aloha, thatch!

you spoke sooth when you wrote:

quote
  I think it is very important to give authors the opportunity to be
  constructive. We (IBM) advocate (http://www.austin.ibm.com/sns/guidelines)
  the use of alt="" for images that are redundant or unimportant.
unquote

a picture may be worth a thousand words, but i don't necessarily want to hear
each one of them!

there are definitely places where ALT="" (with no space between the quotes or
with a white space between the quotes) is the only logical way to ensure that
the user doesn't become distracted from the content being presented by an
endless litany of meaningless ALT text, such as:

blank space
        (if it is blank, why tell me about it?)

decorative graphic
        (thanks, but no thanks)

horizontal rule incorporating all of the colors of the rainbow
        (why not quote section separator unquote or quote 
        End First Section / Begin Second Section unquote 
        or something equally semantically sensible?)
