As a precursor to my posting of techniques for guideline 11, I'd like
to get some feedback on dependancy of this issue with regard to wcag
and authoring tools guidelines.  I will look at the Latter but as it
evolves, should not the wcag address page documentation as in the
possibility of providing alternatives so that they can be portably
viewed?

I will fill this in in my fullfillment post.
Thanks!
