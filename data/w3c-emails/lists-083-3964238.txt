Techniques for checkpoint 10.1

current configuration changes 

If the current configuration changes locally (e.g., a search prompt opens
that changes the keyboard mapping for the duration of the prompt), the user
must be able to know about the current configuration. Users may have an
easier time remembering named configurations - "this is the configuration in
this particular mode."
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Tabbing order:

Provide the user with the option to view a list of form controls in TABINDEX
order.

Provide the user with the option to view a list of form controls grouped by
LEGEND and LABEL. This can be accomplished by providing a definition list
(DL),
in which the LEGENDs are defined as terms (DT) and the dependent LABELs and/or
form controls (if LABELs are not present) are defined as definitions
(DD).

Clarification: as a supplement to the clunky parenthetic DL, DT, and DD, I
would advocate linking the term "definition list" to the Lists portion of the
HTML4 Rec

As for the placement of the second proposed configuration checkpoint for GL9,
it would, naturally, be included in the sub-section entitled "Form Control
 Information".

Visibility of.
Documentation of. At a minimum: list in README file that comes with
software.
Some suggestions:

Allow the user to use the find command to jump to a link instead of tabbing
there. It would save a lot of keystrokes, especially if one programs the
keystrokes as macros. 

The current focus should move to the location I.E. the element)
that the find command highlights if that find is successfull.

Allow the user to use the find command to jump to text that is part of the
buttons.

Allow the user to use the find command to jump to image by searching on its
alternative content (e.g., "alt" attribute).

Allow the user to separate setting the focus and activating the control. For
links, first-time users of a page may want to hear link text (focus) before
deciding whether to follow the link (activate). More experienced users of a
page would prefer to follow the link directly, without the intervening focus
step.

Some reserved keyboard shortcuts are listed in the appendix on accessibility
features of some operating systems.

In case of conflicts between author-supplied configuration and
user-supplied, operating system defaults, or user agent default
configurations, here is some possible behavior:

Do not over-ride default system and user agent controls, but alert the user
of author-supplied configuration and provide a pass-through mechanism to
allow author-specified configurations that conflict with default UA or OS
keybindings to be invoked.

Allow author-defined configurations to override user agent and operating
system configurations, but alert the user of the conflicts and provide a
pass-through mechanism so that the conflicting user agent or operating
system configurations can be invoked.

Remap author-supplied configurations to currently unused keystrokes, voice
commands, etc. and alert the user to which configurations have been
remapped.
