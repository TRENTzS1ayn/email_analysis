Techniques for checkpoint 10.2

Distinguish the following classes of user input bindings:

bindings that are in effect and agree with the shipping defaults for the
base browser
bindings that are in effect but differ from the shipping defaults
bindings that are in effect for this document only (subset of previous
class)
bindings no longer in effect because they have been overridden
In association with local (e.g., this page only) and off-default bindings,
provide information about how to work around the override.

Note that user support personnel, particularly remote support personnel,
will need the "departures from shipping defaults" view for orientation.

The above classes may be distinguished by displayed properties in a combined
presentation as well as by filtering to present only a restricted class.
