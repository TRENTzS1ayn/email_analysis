Gregg,
I was not so much concerned with AIIP as the inclusion in the techniques
document of a reference to the EZAccess techniques for built-in
accessibility.  The current Trace web site says that the "Documentation for
EZ Access is currently undergoing major review and update", so there is not
much for members of the group who are not familar with the EZAccess
techniques to review.  This includes most of the working group.

My inclination is NOT to include a reference to the EZAccess materials
right now, but to consider a reference to the work later when more stable
documentation is available for the working group to review.  

Does this sound OK to you?

Jon
