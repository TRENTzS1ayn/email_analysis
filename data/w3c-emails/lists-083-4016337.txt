Techniques for checkpoint 10.6

Configuration profiles 

allow individual users to save their user agent
settings and re-apply them easily. This is particularly valuable in an
environment where several people may use the same machine. Profiles may
include rendering preferences as well as user email address, proxy
information, etc.

The user should be able to easily transfer profiles between installations of
the same user agent. One way to facilitate this is to follow applicable
operating system conventions for profiles.

Users should be able to switch rapidly between profiles (or the default
settings) and to set a new default profile. This is helpful when:
Several people use the same machine.
If One user is being helped by another who may not recognize the information
being displayed using the user's profile.

User agents may apply a profile when the user logs in. They may also allow
users to apply settings interactively, for example by allowing them to
choose from a list of named profiles in a menu.

Sample profiles (based on common usage scenarios) can assist users in the
initial set up of the user agent. These profiles can serve as models and may
be copied and fine-tuned to meet an individual's particular needs.

Cascading Style Sheets may be part of a source document or linked
externally. Stand-alone style sheets are useful for implementing user
profiles in public access computer environments where several people use the
same computer. User profiles allow for convenient customization and may be
shared by a group.
