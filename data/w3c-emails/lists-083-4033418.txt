Jon,

I had a brief meeting with the IBM web browser team and we discussed
Mozilla accessibility. Mozilla is designed as a cross-platform solution
even though it is compiled for each platform. It turns out that all
components including the application chrome can be accessed through their
DOM. Our guidelines state that we need to use the system-provided
accessibility features like MSAA however they also require that we use the
DOM albeit for the actual document.

The conclusion of the meeting was that the User Agent guidelines should
allow for cross-platform accessibility through DOM 2 as a minimum since
this will utimately be a W3C standard providing the solution provider can
clearly define how an assistive technology would interact with the DOM to
provide an accessible solution. I believe that cross-platform accessibility
is a more important issue given that it can enable assistive technology
solutions on other OS platforms and devices. Support for device
independence and standard I/O API and all other requirements would still
apply naturally.

I would like to raise this issue for the next meeting.
