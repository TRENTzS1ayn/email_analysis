aloha, y'all!

on Wednesday 27 October, in a post with the subject line "the checkpoint
formerly known as 11.1", i proposed a clarification of the checkpoint which
was then numbered 11.1, but which has since been renumbered 11.3

whilst reviewing the 5 November Last Call draft of the UAGL, however, i
came across the following:

quote
11.3 Document the default input configuration (e.g., default keyboard
          bindings). [Priority 1]
          For example, documentation of what user agent features may be
          activated with a single keystoke [sic], voice command, or button
          activation is an important part of the user interface to users
          visual impairments, some types of movement impairments, or
          multiple disabilities. Without this documentation,these users
          may not realize they can accomplish a particular task with a
          single gesture and so might unnecessarily avoid that feature of
          the software. Or they might waste time and energy using a very
          inefficient technique to perform a task.
unquote

this sounds -- at least to my ears -- as if it belongs in the Techniques
document's "Accessibility Topics" and not at all like an authoritative
note...  (plus, there is a typo in the note, which i have marked with a
trailing [sic], as the 'r' is missing from the word "keystroke")

therefore, i would like to ask the chair, editor, and fellow WG members to
reconsider my proposed verbiage for the note   for checkpoint 11.3

11.3 Document the default input configuration for the user agent. [Priority 1] 

Note: Readily available information about keyboard access is crucial to the
effective use of a user agent by users with visual impairments and some
types of movement impairments, otherwise a user with a disability (or
multiple disabilities) may not think that a particular task can be
performed or may try to use a very inefficient technique to perform a task,
such as using a pointing device (like a mouse), or by using an assistive
technology's mouse emulation keystrokes.
