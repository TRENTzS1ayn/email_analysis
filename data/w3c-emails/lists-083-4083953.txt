In addition to what Greg says:
It's not entirely clear whether decolumnizing complex tables
in some ad-hock manner 
as done by things like Lynx 
is indeed the road to making table-layout pages accessible.

Though decolumnizing does alleviate the pain of hearing
gibberish--
a significant part of the page's functionality is lost
because things that are meant to be in close physical
proximity 
get spread out far apart.

Also, most layout-oriented sites only manage to turn into a
different form of gibberish when decolumnized in this way 
the issue gets especially bad with nested tables where the
decolumnizing gets even more ad-hock.

As an example, try 
the various yahoo sites e.g. broadcast, loans etc.
