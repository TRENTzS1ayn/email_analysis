Additional techniques for Checkpoints 8.1 Provide a mechanism for
highlighting and identifying (through a standard interface where available)
the current viewport, selection, and focus. [Priority 1]

1 Use operating system conventions to indicate which element has the focus
2. Support pseudo-classes of CSS2: :hover, :active, and :focus.  Allow the
user to change border and font styles and colors.
