aloha, y'all!

it still really bothers me that there is still no mention of the lack of
keyboard accessibility (including the inability to close NetHelp via the
standard Windows95 keybinding for that action) in the Netscape Navigator
Keyboard Shortcuts section of the Techniques document...

http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-USERAGENT-TECHS/tech-document-default-input

please refer to my posts on this topic, archived at:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999OctDec/0231.html
and http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999OctDec/0232.html

i understood, on the basis of jon's post, archived at:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999OctDec/0237.html
that my comments were to be rolled into the Navigator Keyboard Shortcuts
section, and that others would investigate keyboard support for NetHelp
under Unix and on the Mac, but so far, there has (apparently) been no such
action taken...

the lack of keyboard support, labels for graphics, and the inability to
close the NetHelp window from the keyboard is a major problem with the help
system that comes bundled with Navigator, and its current design and lack
of functionality violates several checkpoints, and it should be documented
as such...

please note that this is not an attack on Netscape, but an attempt to
illustrate the fact that many applications which feature robust keyboard
support for the application's UI, fail to provide similar support for the
help system...
