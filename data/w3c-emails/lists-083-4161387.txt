Guideline 3. Allow the user to turn of rendering or behavior that may reduce
accessibility.

Technique for Checkpoint 3.1 Allow the user to turn on and off rendering of
background images.

-browser option to turn off rendering of images (IE - Show pictures - when
disable shows no embedded images or background images)

-In [CSS1], background images and other background properties may be turned
on/off with the 'background' family of properties (for example the
'background-image' property).

Technique for Checkpoint 3.2 Allow the user to turn on and off rendering of
background audio.

-browser option to turn off playing of background audio (IE - play sounds -
when disable plays no sounds or background audio)

Technique for Checkpoint 3.5 Allow the user to turn on and off animated or
blinking text.

- browser option to turn off animation (IE - play animations - when disable
shows no animated images only place holder space. a static image would be
better)

Technique for Checkpoint 3.6 Allow the user to turn on and off animations
and blinking images.

-Render static text or image in its place.

Technique for Checkpoint 3.8 Allow the user to turn on and off rendering of
images.

-this seem very similar to Checkpoint 3.1 (browser option to turn off
rendering of images (IE - Show pictures - when disable shows no embedded
images or background images))
