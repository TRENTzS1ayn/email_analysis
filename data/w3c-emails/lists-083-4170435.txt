I'm not arguing against the points you or Gregory have made.  However, it
has been my personal experience that the majority of sites that use tables
for layout are readable with a variety of browsing strategies used by
people who are blind.  I guess if I have to do a bit of moving up or down a
line to figure context when I'm unfamiliar with a page I don't find that
such a horrific thing.  When combined with the reality that the vast vast
majority of web sites use table commands for layout I think trying to
change such behavior will be a losing battle from the start.

I don't know of any method that is going to quickly tell me the context of
a single word searched for on a web site.  I mean I could bring up any
page, type in a search term and find it.  I'd still have to do a bit of
exploring to discover the context of that word.
