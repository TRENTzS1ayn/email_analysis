jg- wants to withdraw proposal for EZ access pointer, still to early in

jg- new issue by Rich, cross platform accessibility should be DOM level 2,
based on mozilla work and sharing DOM module. Last call issue, it is on
the issue list (issue 114) 

ij - not sure how it changes current check point, "implement DOM" 

jg - rich wants stronger recommendation for DOM2, always provide access to DOM 

ij-will look at proposal 

jg-reference dom2 

ij-dom2 is at last call. difficult to reference in our document 

jg-process-review checkpoints 

ij-review proposals, rather than open questions 

jg- hb 11/14 table tech #286 on the list

only what is in the display window.

rs: techniques for GL 1 , aspects of textdrawing calls for legacy screen
readers, 2 areas for text drawing, standard device api, talk directly to video
buffer, refer back to other sections that relate to this topic.

cross more than one checkpoint should map to Section 3 topical discussions

cooperate, 

jg-this is a p3 in uagl, should this go to html wg 

db-no, just need the information 

gr-will cross post to wcag 

cmn-not for html wg, bad authoring not html 

jg-need good example of this for guideline 8 

2.1.5. Allow the user to view structured and outlined views of the content
to facilitate the identification of topics and structure of the
document

time-dependent active elements or allow the user
to control the timing of changes. [Priority 1] 

2.4.1 Provide a list of static links for time dependent links in a resource 

2.4.2 Allow the user to configure the user agent to pause the rendering of
time dependent content when time dependent active content
changes 

Editor: add reference to multimedia stuff 

maria-do we have information on imagemaps, in smil can have hot spot links
on images videos, need to extract these links for user to activate. 

gr-need a no script option in addition to pause, long list on the cast
site, a gif is linked to hyper link that is only on the page for 5 seconds 

gr-to make an example of this 

jg-if smil doc, with links (map element) on image 

cmn-required to have alt
