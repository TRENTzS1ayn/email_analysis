Hi
UCP not responding is unfortunate. For some reason folks with physical
disabilities aren't making themselves heard to the UA & I'm feeling lonesome
[grin] Would the UA Group please seek a replacement to UCP, the MS Society
comes to mind first. Otherwise that appears to leave me sort of as "it" on
physical disabilities, not a good way to reach broad consensus.

Regards,
Bryan
