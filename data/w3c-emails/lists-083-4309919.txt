As chair of the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative working group on User
Agent Accessibility I would like to invite a representative of UCP to
review the LAST CALL working draft, before the guidelines are submitted for
proposed recommendation.  It is very important to have organizations like
UCP review the guidelines and comment on behalf of the disability group
they serve.  We already have commitments form over 25 individual and
organizations to review the guidelines.  

The guidelines can be found at:
http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WD-WAI-USERAGENT-19991105/

General information on our working group can be found at:
http://www.w3.org/wai/ua

*** Comments must be received by December 1st for full consideration ***

Is there someone at UCP that would be willing to review the guidelines?

If you have any questions please contact me.  

Thank you for your consideration,
