aloha, jon!

i have no problem with using a more simplified version of what i posted to the
list earlier today...  optimally, i'd like an amalgam of my and your
suggestions to be inserted, as i am concerned with the dangers of
over-tersifying techniques, but, i suppose, that at this point, it's up to you
and ian...  whatever the working group agrees conveys the necessary info in the
most efficacious manner is fine with me...

if you and ian would like, i can spin out my more verbose techniques into some
narrative for the Accessibility Topics section of the Techniques document..
