aloha, bryan!

i share your concerns about the lack of participation by significant segments
of the disability community, but i did want to let you know that, as reflected
in the "New Action Items" section of the minutes from today's teleconference, i
asked jon to contact dave clark to discern if he had a contact at UCP with whom
he could put the WG in touch...  jon agreed to do so, and also mentioned that
would ask dave to commit to reviewing the UAGL himself

gregory.
