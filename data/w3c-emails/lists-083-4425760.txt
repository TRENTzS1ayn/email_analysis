Thanks for your comments.  I'm still digesting them but have three
bits of feedback?

1> what is "quick and direct"?
An example and a bit of explanation might help to clarify for user
agent developpers just what might be done by way of implementing such
a property.

2> word 2,000 handles the guideline and techniques documents just
fine.  I wonder if it is something 97 doesn't support?

3> an assistive technology is just a bit more than a prostheses.  this
is changing, but for legacy sake, we cannot justifyiably marry the two
terms <user agent> and <assistive technology just yet.
4> your use of "caps for emphasis" went in my screenreader and out the
other end and sounded flat.  If you wish ---and this is for every
one--- to indicate emphasis, you may do anything visual you like, but
use the word emphasized or some other string that you designate and
inform us of to achieve this effect for screen readers.  Otherwise,
I'd have to hand read each word.  This is where I love braille but
can't afford a braille display.

Thanks for giving us all some good feedback and interesting input to
think about.
