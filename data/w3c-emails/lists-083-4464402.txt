Hi,
For clarity the last line of the above should read:
"perform these tasks using either keyboard or mouse."

Meaning either can do all functions

"Motor impairments" aptly describes the results of many physical
disabilities. Yet the phrase is unlikely to mean much to most programmers.
Somewhere on the Guildlines page 2 or 3 lines should outline how "motor
impairments" or physical disability relates to computer usage: Lack of or
little manual dexterity; increased tendency to push unwanted 
button (say elevator) or key; muscular degeneration means decreased mobility
even in hand movements. Those factors came to mind just as examples to start
from. Similar tiny briefs should be given for other impairments as is
needed. Giving program designers some idea why things are required will
enable them to produce better & perhaps new solutions! Giving background
makes them more like partners in making the Web usable for everyone & the
Guildlines less of another task list to get done.

Bryan
