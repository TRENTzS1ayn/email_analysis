Technique for Checkpoint 10.6 Allow the user to configure the user agent in
named profiles that may be shared (by other users or software).

<from Techniques document> I inserted text see ADD
Techniques:

Configuration profiles allow individual users to save their user agent
settings and re-apply them easily. This is particularly valuable in an
environment where several people may use the same machine. Profiles may
include rendering preferences as well as user email address, proxy
information, [[ADD stylesheet preference/location,]] etc.
