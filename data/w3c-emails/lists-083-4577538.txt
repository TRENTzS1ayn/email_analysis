Techniques for Checkpoint 8.1 Provide a mechanism for highlighting and
identifying (through a standard interface where available) the current
viewport, selection, and focus.

- Implement CSS ":focus" pseudo class, this will allow user in personal
stylesheet to select attributes for selection and focus, such as color,
border width and color, font size, etc.

Techniques for Checkpoint 8.5 Provide information to help the user decide
whether to follow a focused link.

- Implement CSS ":visited" and ":link" pseudo class, with ":before"  class
and the content property to insert text before a link such as "visited" or
"un-visited". Allow user to configure the functioning and text displayed for
this property via a personal stylesheet or through options in the user
agent.

about links to present.

- - Implement CSS ":visited" pseudo class, with ":before" or ":after"
class and the "content" property to insert text before or after a link such
as "visited". Allow user to configure the functioning and text displayed for
this property via a personal stylesheet or through options in the user
agent.
