"Their DOM" is not the same as "The DOM" (meaning the W3C DOM).
Therefore,
despite the good design idea of making the system platform independent,
by not using system conventions or a recognized API, the design causes
assistive technologies to lose. Consistency among the interfaces
offered by the particular user agent across different platforms may
be less important than consistency among different pieces of software
on a given platform.

Perhaps the checkpoints are flawed or behavior in the case of
overlap is underspecified. Consider these three requirements:

  1) Implement system conventions (checkpoint 5.2 of [1])
  2) Implement the W3C DOM (checkpoint 5.6)
  3) Implement your own, accessible and open API (checkpoint 5.1).
      NOTE: I'd like to review what 5.1 means exactly.

Mozilla seems to be doing 3 at the expense of 1. Is there a
way to map Mozilla's API to MSAA on Windows? 

This seems like a real issue where developer and AT input would
be very useful.
