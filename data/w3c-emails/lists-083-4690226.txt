Proposed:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
 To name frames in HTML, use:

1. The "title" attribute on FRAME, or if not present,
2. The "name" attribute on FRAME, or if not present,
3. Title information of the referenced frame source
(e.g., the TITLE element of the source HTML document), or
4. Title information of the referenced long description
(e.g., what "longdesc" refers to in HTML), or
5. Frame context 
(e.g., "Frame 2.1.3" to indicate the path to this frame in
nested framesets). 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
