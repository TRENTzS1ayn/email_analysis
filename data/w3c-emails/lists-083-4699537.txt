Hello,

I've published the 21 November Techniques document [1], which
integrates many of the techniques sent lately by people in the
WG. I have not listed the changes explicitly at [2] since
they are numerous and spread out all over. However techniques
from Jon Gunderson, Rich Schwerdtfeger, David Poehlman, Gregory
Rosmaita, Jim Allan, Mickey Quezner, and Madeleine Rothberg
were incorporated. 

More to come...

 - Ian
