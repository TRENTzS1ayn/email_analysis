MN:  note, neither is "IE's (4/5) DOM" the same as the W3C DOM.

MN:  While I've not looked in detail at Mozilla's latest UI, if they are using
standard windows controls to build it, there is no need to map anything
in their API to MSAA, as MSAA would be able to obtain information in the
UI controls just as it does for any properly developed application
for Windows.  If they are using non-standard controls, then that is another
issue.
