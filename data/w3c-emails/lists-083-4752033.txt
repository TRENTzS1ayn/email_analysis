First off,  Keep up the great work....

I'd like to recommend some edits to the Techniques DOC., in the
area of Appendix 4.

I've noted some changes have been added, which break the consistency of how
the built in access features were origianlly described, or is just plain
incorrect information.


=====

First, I'd suggest that any developer wishing detailed information about
any of the built in access features be directed (URL link or whatever) to
the appropriate operating system or platform guidelines, and that the
Tech DOC., just call attention to them, not try to be the *definitive*
documentation.

Second, with that thought in mind,  when I re-wrote this section several
months ago,  I purposely left out specific
key activation (turn on/off or activate/disable mappings) of the functions per
each operating system or platform [not to mention the fact that in
X land, one can remap some of these, so defining them here is a waste of
time].


Therefore, in the Windows 95, 98, NT section, please edit the functions
and remove all the key mapping/binding info.  This makes all the sections
consistent
(e.g., no key mapping info.).  I've done this below, if you'd like to copy it:


                   StickyKeys: modifier keys include SHIFT, CONTROL, and
ALTERNATE.
                   FilterKeys: grouping term for SlowKeys, RepeatKeys, and
BounceKeys.
                   MouseKeys:
                   ToggleKeys:
                   SoundSentry:
                   ShowSounds:
                   Automatic reset: term used for TimeOut
                   High Contrast:
                   SerialKeys:

The next section below, is not a Windows 95, 98, NT standard.  As I recall
this is a proposed set of reserved-keys, from the Java/Sun access work
which they'd
like to map for future use.  That process is fine, however, to include them
in this section is totally misleading and incorrect. Therefore please remove
the following section.


            Other keyboard shortcuts:

                   6 consecutive clicks of Control key turns on/off screen
reader numeric keypad.
                   6 consecutive clicks of Alt key reserved for future use.



The next section is way TOO much detail about how FilterKeys (e.g., SlowKeys,
BounceKeys, and RepeatKeys) works on the Windows 95, 98, NT platform.  It
is not the way things worked back in Windows 3.x days, nor is this the way
things work on the other platforms (e.g., MacOS, X, etc.).  So, rather than
go into this
level of detail, it should be left out totally.  Please remove
the following:


            The Keyboard Response Group (KRG) contains three functions:
RepeatKeys, SlowKeys, and
            BounceKeys. The KRG can be turned on from the keyboard with the
pre-stored user default
            settings. There should also be an emergency activation scheme
to turn the KRG on in some
            minimal configuration for those times or for those users who
cannot operate the computer
            keyboard without a particular KRG function (e.g., SlowKeys).
Note. SlowKeys and
            BounceKeys are mutually exclusive. In other words, if the
acceptance delay for SlowKeys is
            some value other than "0", then the delay value for BounceKeys
must be "0". SlowKeys and
            BounceKeys can both be "0", or in effect off, while RepeatKeys
is on, or either SlowKeys or
            BounceKeys can be on with RepeatKeys. Therefore the following
KRG combinations can be set
            by the user:

                   RepeatKeys alone,
                   SlowKeys alone,
                   BounceKeys alone,
                   SlowKeys and RepeatKeys,
                   BounceKeys and RepeatKeys

            The common modifier for activation of the KRG is to press and
hold the right VK_SHIFT key
            for 8 seconds (note, emergency activation when the right
VK_SHIFT key is held for 12 or 16
            seconds.


Thanks for your consideration
