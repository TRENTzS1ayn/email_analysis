Do you mean that the URIs are not explicit enough or the techniques?

Are these recommendations appropriate for the UAGL? They seem to
be more appropriate closer to CSS (e.g., in a W3C Note). The UAGL
could then refer to them. I hate to hide important CSS ideas in
the UAGL Techniques Document.

The CSS2 Processing Model is not normative. The CSS cascade is and
should be implemented.

This also suggests that the spec needs fixing and that the CSS WG
is the proper place to push.

Thanks for your comments, Todd. Let me know if you think
the CSS WG is the proper forum for promoting a proper implementation.
