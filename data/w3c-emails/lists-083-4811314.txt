It seems to me that because low-vision users have a particularly strong
interest in this aspect of style usability, this clarification is
appropriate for the UAGL and UAT.

For the purposes of making the situation clear to the CSS community, I
would [without a lot of reflection] tend to prefer that I be able to refer
into the UAT for this discussion, as opposed to some freestanding Note for
which there is no obvious charter or accessibility tie-in.  The UAT
document is not hidden as compared with a freestanding note.  Publishing
this here gives the CSS folks the context and rationale for the correction.

The CSS specification does not presently meet accessibility needs because
it is vague to a debilitating degree as regards the kind of user
abstraction that Todd is explaining.  However, this is style-control
behavior that the user with partial functional impairment in vision
requires, and hence it is properly in scope for the UA group to articulate
in their own planned work products, so far as I can tell.

Furthermore, we should consider adding a checkpoint abstracted from Todd's
techniques to the effect that there should be one control in the UI which
accomplishes a general increase or decrease of the font sizes throughout
the document, while preserving size ordering of different text fragments to
the maximum extent with user directives.
