aloha, ian!

  I don't think we should indicate that there are problems with NN

we are not highlighting NN's problems, merely documenting the keyboard support
of a specific release of NN -- if we fail to address the keyboard support of
NN's help system -- something which is required by the UAGL -- then we have (a)
failed to address keyboard support in a specific version of NN, and (b) have
undermined the integrity of our document...

ian, if you don't want to include any mention of NN's lack of keyboard support
in its help system, then why don't we also junk all of the other categories
where NN fails to support the keyboard?

i don't understand your logic or your unwillingness to include a section on
keyboard support for the NN help system -- if one relies upon the keyboard for
navigational purposes, but can't access the help system, then that should and
must be noted...  otherwise, all our Techniques document will yield us is peace
in our times, and just ask the-country-formerly known as Czechoslovakia how
good an idea that is...
