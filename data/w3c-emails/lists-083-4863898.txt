I think I just understood the problem. You want an entry in the table
that says "Help system" and that there's an asterisk for all versions.
I'm ok with that. I hadn't understood the request that way. I had
understood it to mean: NN has a problem and I want this problem
mentioned -- outside of the table. That's what I was resisting.

However, there may be other functionalities in NN that don't appear
in the table and I don't think we should spend much time trying
to complete it, notably if the table turns out to be sparse.

That's another option. That would make the table smaller, which might
be a good thing.

I hope my misunderstanding was the only source of unwillingness.

You mean the Czech Republic or Slovakia?
