Gregory,

I would agree with Ian on this one.  If the document specifies what must be
done, and uses as examples those who have done it well, you reward
compliance, and do not punish non-compliance.  And any behaviorist will tell
you that punishment is not a good behavior change strategy, since it doesn't
tell the learner what should be done.  Instead, we can say that IE does this
well, HomePage Reader does this well, etc.  If NN folks ask why they aren't
mentioned, then we say, "Well, we didn't find examples where NN was the
exemplar."

You don't have to slap them down in front of everyone, just don't praise
them for their bad behavior.

aloha, ian!

  I don't think we should indicate that there are problems with NN
  in the Techniques doc.

we are not highlighting NN's problems, merely documenting the keyboard
support
of a specific release of NN -- if we fail to address the keyboard support of
NN's help system -- something which is required by the UAGL -- then we have
(a)
failed to address keyboard support in a specific version of NN, and (b) have
undermined the integrity of our document...

ian, if you don't want to include any mention of NN's lack of keyboard
support
in its help system, then why don't we also junk all of the other categories
where NN fails to support the keyboard?

i don't understand your logic or your unwillingness to include a section on
keyboard support for the NN help system -- if one relies upon the keyboard
for
navigational purposes, but can't access the help system, then that should
and
must be noted...  otherwise, all our Techniques document will yield us is
peace
in our times, and just ask the-country-formerly known as Czechoslovakia how
good an idea that is...

gregory.
