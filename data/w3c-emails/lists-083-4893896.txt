aloha, ian!

you observed:

  However, there may be other functionalities in NN that don't appear
  in the table and I don't think we should spend much time trying
  to complete it, notably if the table turns out to be sparse.

agreed, but the UA Techniques document has a dependency upon the UAGL, and the
UAGL specifically addresses help and documentation, so keyboard access (or the
lack thereof) to help and documentation should be included in the table, which
addresses NN's default keybindings...

and, to for my rather tongue-in-cheek suggestion:
quote
   ian, if you don't want to include any mention of NN's lack of keyboard
support
   in its help system, then why don't we also junk all of the other categories
   where NN fails to support the keyboard?

   That's another option. That would make the table smaller, which might
   be a good thing. 
unquote

no, i don't think that shrinking the table would be a good thing in this
instance -- we are documenting how one mainstream UA supports functionality via
the keyboard, and that criterion should determine the size of the table (which,
i know, is easy for me to say, since i don't need to maintain the Techniques
document!)

gregory.

PS: as for my acerbic aside
quote
  otherwise, all our Techniques document will yield us is peace
  in our times, and just ask the-country-formerly known as Czechoslovakia how
  good an idea that is...
unquote

you asked:
quote
  You mean the Czech Republic or Slovakia?
unquote

either or...  personally, i'm just glad neville chamberlain isn't one of the
UAGL's editors!
