Please RSVP to the chair (jongund@uiuc.edu) if you plan on attending or do
NOT plan on attending the 24 November Telecon.

We will be briefly discussing telecon meeting times on Wednesday for the
first quarter of 2000.  So if you would like to attend telecons, but have
not been able to due to the current schedule, please contact me.

Thanks,
Jon
