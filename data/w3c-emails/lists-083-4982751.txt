Guideline 4:
"In order to access content, some users may require that it be rendered in
a manner other than <remove> what </remove> <add> that which </add> the
author intended."
"Note.  The checkpoints in this guideline apply to all content,
<remove> in </remove> including alternative representations of content."

Checkpoint 5.2 Techniques:
"Write output to and take input from standard system APIs rather than
<remove> direct </remove> <add> directly </add> from hardware controls
where possible."

Checkpoint 5.6 Techniques:
"It is important to note that DOM is designed to be used on a server as
well as a client and therefore <remove> many </remove> <add> a lot of
</add> user interface-specific information such as screen coordinate
information is not relevant and not addressed by the DOM specification."
"Note.  The WAI Protocols and Formats Working Group is focusing its
efforts on the DOM as the conduit from which to extract accessibility
information <remove> from and to </remove> <add> and </add> enhance the
accessibility of a rendered document through a user agent.  <remove> It is
this are should concentrate on </remove> <add> We should concentrate in
this area </add> for providing access to user agent documents."

Checkpoint 5.8 Techniques:
"Most major operating system platforms provide a series of design and
usability guidelines <remove> , </remove> <add> ; </add> these should be
followed when possible (see platforms below)."

Checkpoint 6.1 Techniques:
"The "accesskey" attribute ([HTML40], section 17.11.2) for assigning
keyboard commands to active components such as links <remove> , </remove>
and form controls."

Guideline 7:
"Sequential access (e.g., line scrolling, page scrolling, tabbing access
through active elements, etc.) means advancing through rendered <add> text
</add> in well-defined steps (line by line, screen by screen, link by
link, etc.) forward and backward."

Frame Techniques (link from Checkpoint 7.1 Techniques):
"If a page does not have a list of links within <remove> in </remove> a
frame available outside the frame, make the list available outside the
frame."
"For people with visual impairments who <remove> are </remove> enlarge
text on the screen to improve readability, frames become distorted and
unusable."
"If <remove> no frames </remove> <add> NOFRAMES (all caps) </add>
information is present it should also be rendered so the user can
optionally use that view of the information."

Checkpoint 7.3 Techniques:
"Providing table summary information <remove> , </remove> when first
navigating to a table allows the nature of a table to be easily
determined."
"The user would have the option of navigating to the <remove> forth
</remove> <add> fourth </add> cell of the parent table, or burrowing into
the table within this cell."

Checkpoint 7.6 Techniques:
"Allow users to search closes time stamp from <awkward> a text stream or a
media elements or links </awkward> and find other media elements active at
the same time."  (I'm not sure how to fix that one.  At least make media
element singular (to go with the article "a"), but there may be more
corrections needed.)

Guideline 8:
"Provide information about the resource structure, viewport structure,
element summaries, etc. that will <remove> assist </remove> <add> help
</add> the user understand <remove> their </remove> <add> his or her
</add> browsing context."
"Orientation mechanisms such as these are expecially important to users
who view content through serial means such <add> as </add> speech or
braille..."

Checkpoint 9.3 Techniques:
"If the submit button is not the last control in the form, and no controls
after it have been <remove> focussed </remove> <add> focused </add>, put
up a dialog pointing this out/asking if the user has filled in the
information after the button."

Checkpoint 11.3 Techniques:
"For example, documentation of what user agent features may be activated
with a single <remove> keystoke </remove> <add> keystroke </add>, voice
command, or button activation is an important part of the user interface
to users <add> with </add> visual impairments, some types of movement
impairments, or multiple disabilities."
