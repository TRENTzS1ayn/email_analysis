For my comments on the first part of this message, refer to [1].

What would it mean?

Actually, there's no dependency in this direction on ATAG, only on WCAG.

ATAG has already dealt with this issue. From [2]:

7.1 Use all applicable operating system and accessibility standards 
    and conventions (Priority 1 for standards and conventions 
    that are essential to accessibility, Priority 2 for those 
    that are important to accessibility, Priority 3 for those 
    that are beneficial to accessibility).

6.2 does not refer to accessibility standards, but all W3C
Recommendations.
6.1.A addresses accessibility featurse. 6.2 addresses general
conformance
(e.g., valid HTML markup).

Hmm, this was changed explicitly to "closed captions" because people
found "captions" alone confusion (e.g., they felt they referred
also to table captions, image captions, etc.).

Yes.

I'll let the Braille experts illuminate.

Seems fine.

I'm not sure about "must be able to render". That sounds like
a requirement. How about "UAs render content in a range of modes

We mean "lang", "dir", BDO, xml:lang, etc. Perhaps we should
refer to "processing markup" (a term borrowed from Nir Dagan) that
indicates changes in natural language of content.

I agree.

Ok.

We need to review your proposed changes in the WG. Thank you
for taking the time to do a thorough review. More comments
