If WAI authoring guidelines (and the techniques I've suggested) are 
observed, users should be able to accomplish this simply by 
re-specifying their preferred font size - no special 
checkpoint/technique required.

When authors use pixel- or absolute-length units (e.g., points) for 
text, however, it is charitable (and sometimes correct) to assume 
that the text must maintain a consistent size relationship to 
non-textual elements. In this case, I think a "zoom/magnify" 
functionality (such as implemented in the Opera UA) should be 
required to override specified measures. Otherwise you'd have to 
treat pixels or points specified for text as less privileged than 
pixels or points specified for (or inherent to) other objects, and 
that strikes me as unclean.
