aloha, ian!

first, since this is actually a response to your announcement that the 21
November Techniques document is available, i'd like to echo mark novak's
compliments -- you have done an excellent job restructuring the Techniques
document...

second, i'd like to re-raise an issue that would make the techniques documents
a hell of a lot more usable...  why do all of the links that refer to specific
attributes and elements defined in W3C recommendations lead only to a top-level
link, located in the References section of the document, for the relevant
recommendation?

case in point -- under the Accessibility Topic "Link Techniques", located at
(long URI warning)
http://www.w3.org/wai/ua/wai-useragent-techs-19991121#link-techniques
appears the following technique:

quote
Use :before from [CSS2] to clearly indicate that something is a link (e.g.,
'A:before { content : "LINK:" }')
unquote

the bracketed term quote CSS2 unquote is a hyperlink that leads not to the CSS2
description of the :before and :after pseudo-elements, as anyone reading the
document for the first time might reasonably expect, but, leads instead to a
link in the References section of the Techniques document, which points to the
top-level URI for the CSS2 recommendation...  would it not be more logical and
informative (not to mention more user-friendly) if the hyperlink pointed users
to the pertinent portion of the CSS2 rec, which in this case would be:
http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-CSS2-19980512/generate.html#x2
rather than leave the reader to fend for his or her self once he or she is
dumped unceremoniously at the top level URI for the relevant rec?

i know that this would entail a considerable effort, and so i volunteer my
services to assist in any such transformation,
        gregory.
