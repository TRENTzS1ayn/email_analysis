This doesn't fulfil my action item, but it is a start.

In HTML 4:

Allow the user to configure mouseover/mouseout events to be fired by (and to
fire) focus/blur events. Similarly, allow the user to use a key command, such
as enter and shift-enter to fire onclick and ondblclick events.

Implement DOM2 events (currently in draft) with a single activation event
and provide a method of firing it from each supported input device or input
API. These should be the same as the click events and mappings provided above
(but note that a user agent which is also an editor may wish to use single
click events for moving a system caret, and want to provide a different
behaviour to activate using the mouse). For example, Amaya uses a
"doAction" command for activating links and form controls, which can be
triggered either by the mouse (and it is possible to set it for single-click
or double-click) or by the keyboard (it is ossible to set it for any key
using Amaya's keyboard configuration)

make scripts available to users so they can determine the likely effects in
advance. (for example through viewing the source)
