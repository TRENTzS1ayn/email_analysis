That is correct.

I have been an invited expert to the CSS&FP WG since 1996, and have 
been harping on such "implementation issues" for 18 months or so, in 
W3C and other fora. I do not believe that any such Note is 
forthcoming. If you believe, as I do, that resolution of these 
matters is critical to the coherence of the WAI's recommendations 
regarding font size, I suggest that the WAI must not defer the 
responsibility.

Fair enough. But the "non-normative" language couching the CSS-2 
processing model description belies the fact that other models or ad 
hoc contortions are highly unlikely to support the cascade in as 
reliably determinate a fashion, and is illustrative of the CSS&FP 
WG's reticence or inability to address many UA implementation issues 
head-on. This isn't censure, either; I recognize that it is sometimes 
necessary to choose one's battles carefully, and to run away from the 
rest.

In view of the apparently determined disregard for the cascade in 
mainstream UAs (failure to inherit from HTML or even BODY into 
TH/TD), and the importance of same for WAI guidelines to be viable in 
practice, I suggest that the WAI establish an explicit checkpoint for 
correct behavior.

I believe that Microsoft will effectively defeat any such pushing in 
the CSS&FP WG, since it is contrary to their increasingly stable 
(stagnant?) implementation of HTML, CSS, and attendant UI, at least 
in Win32/Office2K. I think it is incumbent upon this group either to 
challenge this state of affairs, or to accept that MS's 
implementation is the de facto standard in this regard, and 
reformulate its recommendations regarding font size control 
accordingly. I advocate the former, as I can't see a way through the 
latter.

I do. If I fail to convince you, however, would you regard it as 
proper for the WAI to flag these implementation issues formally for 
the CSS&FP WG, as WAI concerns?
