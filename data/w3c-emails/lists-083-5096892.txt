We started using "continuous equivalent" in the SMIL access note [1].
We distinguish there between discrete equivalent (like "alt") and
one that must be synchronized with another track.

Agreed. Could be deleted.

But derived from text is an implementation detail. The end product
must be audio.

I don't agree. I think that the text clearly states that this is
an example of a continuous equivalent track.

Hmm, you're right! I thought it was for sure.

I have no objection to synchronized equivalent. Is there any
reason why a continuous equivalent would not be synchronized?

Yes.

The goal: assistive technologies, to function, must have timely access
to information. Thus, for example, it should be possible to load
them into the process space of the user agent to minimize communication
times.

Ok by me. I still don't think it's necessary to delete the sign language
example.

That's also an ok solution for me.

Even before reading the notes, I see where you're going: WCAG 1.3 is
an "until user agents" and we don't have a matching checkpoint.

Are you importing the HTML? I'd be curious to know how to fix this
so we don't get lots of complaints after publication. (We've had
problems with people printing the PDF of WCAG, for example, and I'd
like to solve that one too).

Why only "in the context of this document"? How about:

"A text transcript is a text equivalent of auditory information (e.g.,
an
audio clip). A text transcript documetns both speech and non-spoken
sounds such as sound effects."

We do use it in some places: Checkpoint 1.1, 1.3, defn of Equivalent.
Where would you use it?

I don't agree with parens, but we can de-emphasize with language.

Depends on outcome of "closed captions" v. "captions" discussion.

Eric, I would prefer to keep the "some users may be in different
scenarios than yours" bit, although we might say that not all
issues relate to accessibility; there could be clarification. 

I'll have to think about the rest of the proposed text/structure.

I don't think they mean the same thing. "functionality" means "feature".

I think "table caption" is acceptable and that's why we say
