Thank you Thierry, Geoff.

That's not exactly what it means. It means that the user should have
access
through other modes than graphics to context information. For instance,
a percentage reading on the status bar in text (or just the message
"stalled") can be used by different output devices. Does this clarify?

Ok.

It's already in the Techniques. Will that suffice?

Ok.

English is left-to-right, Hebrew and Arabic right-to-left, etc.

Yes.

Yes. And I think a global replace would be a good idea.

Proposed change:

   For example, when turned off, indicate to the user
   that content needs refreshing and allow the user
   to do so through the user interface.

Yes. There may be a change from "closed caption" to "caption" based
on other comments from Eric Hansen.

I will add if there are no objections.

I will add if there are no objections.

PROPOSAL: 
  I would propose merging the audio and video into one section.
  This is an editorial change and would solve the problem.

Yes.

Ok.

They are slightly different. 11.2 requires that accessibility
features be documented somewhere (the more important requirement). 
11.4 requires a specific section (e.g., entitled "Accessibility
Features") where all features are listed. 

Perhaps a clarifying note to 11.4 would be helpful:

   "For example, list all pertinent features in a chapter 
   entitled "Accessibility Features". Note that this is a more
   specific requirement than checkpoint 11.2.

Eric Hansen has some comments as well on the definition. Refer to [2].

Maybe we should delete this. A panner is, for me, a window over content
that you can move around to view different parts of the content.
