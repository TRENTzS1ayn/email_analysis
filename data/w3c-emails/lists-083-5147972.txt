I'll have to think about this one. I'm torn. For resources that
are stable (e.g., dated W3C Recommendations) it may not hurt. For
unstable resources, there is significant risk of links being
broken and we can't fix them once the document is published. 

I'll take an action item to talk this over in the Team. Also,
what do others in the WG think?
