aloha, ian!

i appreciate your concerns, and would like to amend my proposal to extend
_ONLY_ to dated recommendations, although, given the experience of the HTML4
guidelines and the disappearing RFCs, even that caveat leaves the proposal open
to doubt...  and yet, as far as W3C recs are concerned, i have a reasonable
expectation that they will reside at www.w3.org in perpetuity, so i'd still
like
to see them explicitly/directly linked to the WAI Guidelines suite!
