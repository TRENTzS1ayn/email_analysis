Yes, we've had a similar comment from Eric Hansen. I think we'll
have to clean this up.

Yes, there could be more emphasis on text links, form controls, etc.

Yes.

This is fixed in the 21 November Draft [1] (which is not the draft
mentioned in the last call, but a newer WG draft)

That's not good!

See if the text in [1] is better. 

Until recently, the Techniques Document has been a repository for
notes and information and is not consistent in style at all. We
are slowing molding it into a more consistent document (and your
continued comments are welcome). 

We also recently changed the structure of the document from one
organized by theme (like the second half currently) to one
organized by checkpoint. This has made it easier for people
to contribute ideas for specific checkpoints (so we are
getting more content) but we will still need a serious editorial
pass to ensure that its readable, concise, accurate, not
too redundant, etc.

yes.

In SMIL, a link at a particular place on the screen (I'll use the
graphical rendering for this comment) can point to different
resources over time. From section 4.5.2 of the SMIL spec [2]:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
   2) Associating links with temporal subparts 

   In the following example, the duration of a video clip is split into
two      
   subintervals. A different link is associated with each of these
   subintervals. 

   <video src="http://www.w3.org/CoolStuff">
     <anchor href="http://www.w3.org/AudioVideo" begin="0s" end="5s"/>
     <anchor href="http://www.w3.org/Style"      begin="5s" end="10s"/>
   </video>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

This example shows that what appears to be the same link designates
different resources between 0 and 5 seconds and 5 and 10 seconds.
If I am unable to activate the first link in time, I'll never have
access to it again.

Eric Hansen also commented on this and we'll fix it.

Nor do I. I propose deleting it.

If the user has configured the UA to perform UA-specific tasks, then
the UA can say a lot about them; they should all be in the documentation
and the bindings could link to that documentation. For example, if
Alt-N opens a new browser window, and the UA documents that
functionality,
then, for example, a brief description of what Alt-N does could link
to further documentation.

This is one of those sections that was a repository of notes
and will have to be made more intelligible.

I don't know.

The sections are not quite the same: 10.5 says - don't provide
defaults that conflict with OS conventions. The info about reserved
sequences in 10.1 (should be in 10.2 first of all) discusses dynamic
changes to the input configuration where there is overlap between
the author's mappings, the user's preferred mappings, the default
mappings, and the os conventions.

This is an issue that was highlighted in the last call announcement as
one the WG had not yet resolved [3].

This means:
 - You can distinguish defaults from user-specified from
author-specified
   with style (e.g., colors, though that's not sufficient)
 - You can render one group of bindings at a time (e.g.,
author-specified
   only for this particular page).

This section could be made clearer.

I think it should be in 10.2 for the aforementioned reason (how to
handle
the cascade).

It is a special case and I agree that this should be indicated.
However, the priority of a dedicated section is considered lower than
for documentation anywhere. Therefore, it was split into a separate
checkpoint.

Thank you so much Keren!
