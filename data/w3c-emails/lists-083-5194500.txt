I propose removing the last sentence entirely.

Yes.

I propose other edits as well to make less passive.

yes.

How about:
        Allow users to find all media elements active at
        a particular time in the presentation.

How about (I was just working on this one!):

     Provide information about resource structure,
     viewport structure, element summaries, etc. to help the
     user understand browsing context.

Yes, I had already fixed this.

Thank you again Keren for the very helpful review, complete with
suggested changes!
