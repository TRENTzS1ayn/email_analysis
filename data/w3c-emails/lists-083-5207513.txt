Refer to Jon Gunderson's comments on WG consensus on this issue.

Information about applicability used to be in the Introduction.
Refer, for example, to 31 March draft [2]. Some time around there
(I could find it in minutes but it's late...) the WG decided
to move the terms to the glossary.

Would it be interesting to move the term "applicable" to the
definition of "satisfy"? Or would that be too obscure in the
Priority definition?

No, but the Authoring Tool Guidelines do.

In part I think your concern is resolved by the WG's decision not
to focus on conformance by assistive technologies (at lease for version
1.0).

I don't think this Note works, in part because there is no agency
that grants dispensation.

I do not want to dismiss your concerns as unfounded. However, I think
we've narrowed the scope of the Guidelines to move forward  and
therefore have not tried to include every type of user agent as
potential conformant software. Does this narrowing of scope alleviate
some of your concerns?
