I think Gregory hit the nail on the head with this one.  

Sometimes one wants to target the link up one level of the document tree in
the referenced document from the most local possible reference.  That would
result in a link to
<http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-CSS2-19980512/generate.html> in this case.
However, in this particular case the before: and after: attributes are well
explained in their own section and starting one level up does not add
significantly to the context required for understanding.  So: yes, make the
hyper-references to feature definitions from the techniques document
precise; and yes, this is a good example of the appropriate level of
precision in such references.

If we only reference the top of the specification, a significant fraction
of readers following the link from the techniques document may turn away
from the chase before finding the relevant definition and conclude "It's
all too complicated and hard."
