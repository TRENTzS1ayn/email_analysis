Hello,

In his three emails, Eric Hansen suggested a lot of editorial changes
that would clear up and harmonize the Guidelines. I support most of
them.
Of the issues he raised, the following (in my opinion) were more
than editorial:


From [1]:

Issue #6: Checkpoints 10.1, 10.2, and 10.3 need restructuring and
revision.

Issue #7:  Break checkpoint 6.1 into two separate checkpoints - 6.1.A
and 6.1.B.

Issue #8. Checkpoint 6.1.A. should have "Relative Priority".
      IJ: This is one of the issues identified in the last call
announcement.

Issues #9/#10: Restructuring of 6.1

Issue #11: Change "closed captions" to "captions" throughout the
document.


More minor:
 -  "Braille" or "braille"?
 - Issue #13: Is braille accepted as a natural language? 
 - Is braille also haptic?

From [2]:

Issue #16. Eliminate the use of  "continuous equivalent track".

Issue #17. Simplify checkpoint 2.5.

Issue #18. Handle "on the fly" auditory descriptions.
           This is a proposed new checkpoint to mirror WCAG 1.3

Issue #30. Fix checkpoint 11.1.
           Proposed relative priority

More minor:
   - Issue #35. Reconsider the use of the term "table caption".
   - Issue #37. Reconsider the use of the term "visual impairment".

From [3]:

Issue #44. Document must give greater emphasis to the differential 
applicability of the guidelines to various classes of user agent, 
especially assistive technologies

    Ian: Probably not since resolved not to.

Issue #45. Some attention needs to be given to additional situations in 
which the UA document is not applicable.
