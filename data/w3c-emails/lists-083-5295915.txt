Users should, according to their preference, receive LONGDESC text

1. always
2. on request, with a brief signal should indicate its presence (e.g. a tone)
3. on request, but without even that signal.

This is in the spirit of 2.2

quote

    If more than one alternative equivalent is available for content, allow 
the user to choose from among the alternatives.

unquote
