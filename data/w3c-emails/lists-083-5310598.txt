The CSS2 selector [lang] can be used in HTML to identify elements which have
a lang attribute. In XML languages which implement the xml:lang attribute the
equivalent selector is [xml:lang]

Note that it is also possible to select for particular languages - for
example (if I recall the syntax correctly) [lang ~ en] selects languages
which include the sequence "en" - primarily english, although there may be
other examples like x-invented-language that are also selected, and [lang =
en] will match anything with lang="en"
