  We are in the process of renewing our telecon time slot for the first
  quarter of 2000.  
  I would like to propose moving the weekly telecon time and day to
  1:00-2:30pm Eastern Standard Time (USA) on Thursdays starting on January
  6th, 2000.  
  Does anybody object to this day and time change?
