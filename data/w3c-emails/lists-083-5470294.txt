Ian Jacobs and Madeleine Rothberg had concerns and comments about my Issue 
#16 ("Eliminate the use of  "continuous equivalent track"."

I will try to address a few of these.

IJ: I don't agree. I think that the text clearly states that this is
an example of a continuous equivalent track.

MR: I agree with Ian. While it is true that a sign language video might be
primary content, it might also be a continuous equivalent. The same is
true for text: a text track might be primary content or it might be a 
closed
caption track. That is why SMIL has a system attribute for indicating when
a text track is a closed captions track. SMIL does not yet have an 
attribute
for indicating when video is continuous equivalent, such as a sign language
translation, so we are left with the decision of whether we can (priority 
1) require
that UAs allow users to turn on and off tracks that SMIL does not yet allow
to be delineated as continuous equivalents.  This also applies to Eric's 
Issue 17.

On a related note, the new SMIL public working draft [1] does propose a 
system
attribute for audio descriptions, so I will be submitting revised 
techniques that
tell UAs how to use that attribute to provide improved accessibility for 
blind and
visually impaired users. If the UA WG feels we can encourage UA developers 
to
stretch their features past the existing or recommended SMIL features, I 
would
personally be in favor of encouraging implementation of ways to choose
continuous equivalent video, such as sign language, in UAs.

EH (24 Nov): I still have serious concerns about referring to "continuous 
equivalents" unless the definition can be considerably refined. I 
personally don't think that it is necessary to the document and that if it 
is not well-defined, it could cause confusion. Keep in mind that 
equivalents can be text elements or non-text elements. Does a collated text 
transcript constitute one or a pair of "continuous equivalents"? One could 
argue that it does, but I don't think that was what was intended. Does 
collation count as synchronization? Do continuous equivalents apply to 
multiple written language? How far can a pair of equivalents get out of 
synch with each other and still be counted as "continuous" (I have argued 
that a spec for on the fly auditory descriptions must allow pauses?)?

Regarding the reference to "sign language videos" as an example of 
continuous equivalent track. (By the way, I do not sign but have directed 
US Dept of Education projects related to sign language videos.) If one 
wants to simply include a reference to sign language videos, it needs to be 
clear they are _equivalent to something else_. For example, instead of 
saying: "A video track that shows sign language is another example of a 
continuous equivalent track.", it is tempting to say "A video track that 
shows sign language translation of a written text is another example of a 
continuous equivalent track.", but is it really? Doesn't the concept of 
continuous equivalent track suggest that the sign language video is 
_synchronized_ with the text. But it is just a blob of written text and is 
really, in this case, not synchronized at all with the sign language video.

In summary, I think that that definition of continuous equivalent as used 
in UAAG (5 Nov) is flawed and that the examples are problematic. I think 
that what you are trying to tackle with the construct of "continuous 
equivalent track" seems to be a combination of: (a) motion versus still 
rendering, (b) static versus time-based media, (c) synchronized versus 
independent tracks, (d) element types (e.g., text elements vs. non-text 
elements), (e) equivalency versus non-equivalency. Until there is greater 
consensus and clarity on the meaning of the term and its usefulness in the 
UAAG document, I strongly recommend eliminating it.

Regarding Madeleine's note:

"On a related note, the new SMIL public working draft [1] does propose a 
system attribute for audio descriptions, so I will be submitting revised 
techniques that tell UAs how to use that attribute to provide improved 
accessibility for blind and visually impaired users. If the UA WG feels we

implementation of ways to choose continuous equivalent video, such as sign 
language, in UAs. [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/smil-boston/"

EH (24 Nov): I am not sure if Madeleine is referring to prerecorded 
auditory descriptions or on the fly auditory descriptions or both. I think 
it is important that user agents support both.

Ian asked: 

"I have no objection to synchronized equivalent. Is there any reason why a 
continuous equivalent would not be synchronized?" 

EH (24 Nov 99): See earlier discussion of continuous equivalents. Please 
delete reference to "continuous equivalents".

Issue #37. Reconsider the use of the term "visual impairment".

IJ: Should we drop "impairment" everywhere?

MR: my organization does use the term visually impaired, but
if others feel it is out of date WAI could decide to drop it. 

MR: I can't locate the mail where this came up, and I can't remember in
which direction the current document comes down, but braille is not a
language. It is a way of writing English. I believe in the past we have 
talked
about style sheets for printed and refreshable braille as equivalents to 
style
sheets that differ for screen versus ink print versus small screen displays 
 --
 in all cases, still in English. ASL, however, is a natural language of its 
own.

EH (24 Nov 99): Evidently the term "disability" appears preferred for 
general use and appears in legislation such as the Americans with 
Disabilities Act. Nevertheless "impairment" is evidently not forbidden and 
one editor thought that it was OK if preceded with a specific (e.g., 
"hearing impaired").  I think that the term disability brings it into 
closer conformity to WCAG and ATAG. I think it would not hurt to change 
them all and it might help.

IJ: Why only "in the context of this document"? How about:
"A text transcript is a text equivalent of auditory information (e.g.,
an audio clip). A text transcript documents both speech and non-spoken
sounds such as sound effects."

MR: I think the reason for the phrase "Refer also to continuous equivalent 
track."
was as a contrast, not because the text transcript is a continuous 
equivalent.
Perhaps change to "A text transcript may contain content which is similar
or identical to the content of closed captions, but it is generally 
available in
a single time-independent document rather than as a continuous equivalent."

MR: I can't locate the first mention of the "captions vs closed captions" 
issue.
I'd like to weigh in that I think the term "closed captions" is useful in
distinuishing between information intended to replace audio tracks, and 
typically intended for use by people who are deaf, and any other thing 
called
a caption, such as a photo caption or table caption. Because closed 
captioning
is quite well known, I think it is helpful to continue using that term in 
that
context. And since other types of captions can get confused, I think it is
helpful to always use the extra word to indicate the type of caption being
discussed. For example, when we discuss the usefulness of table captions
for web surfers who are blind, we don't want people saying "Why do blind
people need captions?"

EH (24 Nov 99): Again, the think that the definition of continuous 
equivalent has too many wrinkles to work out to have it included in the 
UAAG. For example, the proposed definition of text equivalent has a few 
problems (""A text transcript may contain content which is similar or 
identical to the content of closed captions, but it is generally available 
in a single time-independent document rather than as a continuous 
equivalent.")

a. "single time-independent document" is not defined, to best of my 
knowledge. Particularly, for example, the term "time-independent" document 
is not clear.
b. Our usage of the term "text transcript" is quite distinct from that of 
"(closed) captions", so to say that it is "similar or identical" does not 
seem accurate.

Its not so much that the idea of "continuous equivalent" cannot be a viable 
term, but I think that it is not needed and we ought not to invent new 
terms when old ones will do.

Regarding the term "captions"? I can see why you want to say "closed 
captions" instead of just "captions" and it may be that the term "closed 
captions" is the best alternative, though I think that it unfortunate if 
that is the case. The term "closed captions" comes from TV and the name 
implies that it is invisible or hidden. It begs the question of what "open 
captions" are. Evidently one of the distinguishing features of closed 
captions is that they can be turned off (see 
http://www.robson.org/capfaq/overview.html#What). Yet the capability of 
turning something on or off is a separate issue in the WCAG/UAAG conceptual 
framework. I wish there were a better alternative.

Regarding Ian's question ("Why only "in the context of this document"? How 
about: "A text transcript is a text equivalent of auditory information 
(e.g., an audio clip). A text transcript documents both speech and 
non-spoken sounds such as sound effects."), I prefer to say "In the context 
of this document, a text transcript?", since I doubt that the world defines 
the term so narrowly. The phrase signals that this is specialized usage. I 
don't think we invented the term. Isn't the term used generally to refer to 
transcripts that are actually closer to "collated text transcripts".

IJ: "Are you importing the HTML? I'd be curious to know how to fix this

problems with people printing the PDF of WCAG, for example, and I'd
like to solve that one too)."

EH: Yes, importing ("opening").
