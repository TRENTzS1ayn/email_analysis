Hi Mark. Home Page Reader does the same and plans the same. So far there
are no candidates for the "Many assistive technologies that ... " I feel
strongly that making statements like that triviallizes a the efforts of
folks doing assistive technologies.

pwWebSpeak allows synthesizer language changing for the page under these
conditions:

1. The LANG attribute is specified in the HTML element.
2. The LANG attribute corresponds to one of the installed synthesizer
languages.

Users can manually switch the "reading" synthesizer to one of the installed
languages, if no LANG attribute is present.

Presently we don't switch on LANG attributes within a page (though we are
likely to add that). We do note significant time delays when switching
between some synthesizers (eg, some SAPI engines may exhibit a long load
time, particularly when using engines from different vendors). That has
been
a concern of mine if we switch on arbitrary LANG attributes appearing in
the
page as it could introduce unnatural reading flow.
