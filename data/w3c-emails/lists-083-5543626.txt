aloha, jim!

while i agree that there aren't many (any?) assistive technologies that _do_
switch languages when the language attribute is defined inline, it is true
that:

a) assistive technologies that support multiple languages could change which
language rule base is being used when the lang attribute is encountered --
whether in the HTML element (which, is what HPR currently does) or in an inline
declaration (i.e. <SPAN lang="la">Vita mutator, non tollitor</SPAN>)

b) assistive technologies that are DOM aware and which support multiple
languages could easily switch languages when an inline language declaration is
encountered

with the current state-of-the-art in screen-readers, it is not unreasonable to
ask that any screen reader (or self-voicing browser) that supports multiple
languages switch in response to inline natural language declarations, 

that it is not currently being done doesn't mean that it can't be done, nor
that it isn't something that is greatly needed...  

and, it should be pointed out, this isn't just a web-based issue -- the Digital
Talking Book will have to be capable of responding to changes in language if it
is to be of any real use in an academic setting -- or even if one wants to read
a Hercule Poirot mystery or anything by Umberto Ecco without either cringing in
horror at the mispronunciations or having to have the reader spell out every
non-english word so that the non-english words can be fully comprehended...
