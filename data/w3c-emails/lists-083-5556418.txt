  I hope this is OK as starting point. Gregory promised to make another

i think you provided an excellent basis on which to build...  the only
additions slash modifications i have to offer are:

1) in addition to your proposed example

quote
For  instance, a screen reader might change the pronunciation of the text
according to the language definition.

i would advocate adding something about screen magnification, such as:

quote
For  instance, a screen reader might change the pronunciation of the text, or a
screen magnification program might change fonts, in accordance with the
language definition. 
unquote

2) use of CSS2 pseudo-elements to signal language change -- actually, that's
really more of a WCAG technique, so let me rephrase that to read:

quote
Support CSS2 pseudo-elements and offer the user the option to have the user
agent render pseudo-elements.

For example, with the following definition in the stylesheet:

    P:before { content : "paragraph "; }
    P.spanish { font-weight : bold; }
    [lang|=es]:before { content: "start Spanish:"; }
    [lang|=es]:after { content: "end Spanish"; }

the following snippet:

<p lang="es" class="spanish"><a href="foo_esp.html" 
hreflang="es">Esta pagina en espa&ntilde;ol</a></p>

should, in a CSS2 capable browser that supports pseudo-elements (anyone know of
one?), be rendered thus:

paragraph start Spanish _Esta pagina en espanol_ end Spanish

unquote

ok, you can excise the acerbic aside, and note that i utilized underscores in
the expected rendering to signify hyperlink text..  oh, and the relevant
snippets above validate using the W3C CSS and HTML Validation services,
respectively...

support of CSS2's pseudo-elements also provides a cheap means of satisfying
Checkpoint 2.9 (which is where, perhaps, my second addition to Marja's proposal
properly belongs--or, at least, where the snippets of code belong)

thanks to Charles McCN for assisting me in debugging the language-specific
portions of my stylesheet in the absence of a rendering agent that will
actually render pseudo-elements...

and if anyone does have a browser that supports pseudo-elements, you can check
out the hypertextualized version of Jon's GIF at:
        http://www.hicom.net/~oedipus/wai/ua/pseudo_element_example-v2.html

i'm still trying to figure out how to get pseudo-elements to calculate the
depth of nested list items, i.e.:

<UL>
<LI>
     <UL>
     <LI>
          <UL>
          <LI>
          </UL>
     </UL>
<LI>
</UL>

to translate to:

* level 1 list item
        + level 2 list item
                o level 3 list item 
* level 1 list item

but that one has me (for now at least) flummoxed...  Jim Allen, i think this is
where _YOU_ (and any of the WG's other CSS mavens) come in!
