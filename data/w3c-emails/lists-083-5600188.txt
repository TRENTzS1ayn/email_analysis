On "closed caption" this page http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/research/namgallery/ I
just hit shows the Web uses the term caption to describe 1 photo as noted below
>many Web pages offer display of a photo or caption that is a text
description of 1
>photo analogous a to newspaper caption of a photo
Following the established Web usage seems wise since TV's provision of
"closed caption" as moving text makes the term "closed caption" widely
understood
