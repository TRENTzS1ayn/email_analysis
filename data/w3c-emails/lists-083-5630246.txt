aloha, ian!

all i'm saying is that in any description of the keyboard functionality of a
user agent, we must address keyboard support _for_ the help system...

not drawing any conclusions, nor seeking to sling a wet noodle -- simply
pointing out that the list of keyboard functionalities was -- er, is --
incomplete...

and as for telling netscape, i think i mentioned it when i emailed lake in
response to jon's re-post of her emessage requesting input from the UA WG... 
and i've certainly railed about it ad nauseam on list, so they should (if they
keep tabs on w3c-wai-ua@w3.org) know that it is a major issue..
