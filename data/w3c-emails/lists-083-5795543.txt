Thank you for your comments.

I think we are trying to give designers of user agents a means to develop
accessible user agents.  The issue of conformance is important for
developers to be able to identify their product as statisfying the
requirements of the guidelines at a particular level.  It is of hope that
many companies will see this of value and devote resources to secure
conformance and therefore improve accessibility of their product.

I think some of the issues you raised are important.  Like how do I now I
used an accessible API or a non-accessible API when implementing a
function. What techniques can I use to test if I can do it correctly.
These are issues that the techniques document can use to help guide
developers in developing and testing whether they have satisfied a
particular checkpoint.  Your experience would be very helpful in
highlighting you knowledge through examples and how you test your
software.  If you have further recommendations in these areas please send
them to the list.
