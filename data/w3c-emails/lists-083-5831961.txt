no, 1.3 refers to the auditory recording of the video description.

no, we want the user agent to synchronize the synthesis of the speech with 
the rest of the auditory track.  the reason is that not everyone has the 
tools or the time to record additional auditory tracks.  we figured if the 
user agent could synthesize and synchronize it would save the author some time.

the collated text transcript is not ALWAYS required.  It depends on the 
type of clip and the information being provided in the clip.

as i said earlier, to relieve the author of some work.

There are 2 priority 1 checkpoints.
here is text from the issues list that was generated during proposed 
recommendation:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Final resolution
1.3 Until most user agents can automatically read aloud the text equivalent 
of the visual track, provide an auditory description of the important 
information in the visual track of multimedia presentations. [Priority 1] 
(Note: Per 1.4 this must be synchronized with the audio track) (See 1.1 
regarding text equivalents for visual information)
**[Note: If there is no important visual information (e.g. a talking head) 
then a visual description is not required.] --- goes into techniques doc
Rationale: animation is covered if part of a presentation. This will be 
made clear in the techniques doc. Other animations that are part of 
programmatic interactions are covered elsewhere.
Minority position: Eric Phill: Full compiled text would provide Basic level 
access to the information. (p1) Providing Auditory description would 
provide better access or p2 level access.

specific discussions that occurred  during Proposed Rec:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/1999AprJun/0043.html - Jason 
summarizes Gregg's, Eric's and his own position.
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/1999AprJun/0050.html - 
Charles clarifies that we need a general checkpoint but that who provides 
the audio (a synthesizer or a recording of a human) is a technique and 
discusses some future scenarios.
