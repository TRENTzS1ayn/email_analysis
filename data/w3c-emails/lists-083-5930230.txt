Ian,

You are quite right.  You cannot properly say that the person has a
disability.  They may have an impairment or a functional limitation, but
they have disabilities only in certain environments.  And, in fact, that is
what the accessibility project is about: defining the environment in which
various functional limitations and impairments do *not* lead to
disabilities.

I would say that we should be very careful in the use of this terminology,
because it actually allows a much better understanding of the issues of
disability and impairment than just throwing the terms around at random.

This suggests to me that it is incorrect to say that someone
"has a disability period". You may say that a person "has a visual
impairment period" or that the person "has a disability in this
particular
context", but you would not be able to discuss a disability out of
context.

Does this mean we should adopt very careful language to respect
this distinction? Or does this mean that we can more casually exchange
the terms and not offend nor cause misunderstanding?
