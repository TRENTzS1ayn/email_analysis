Subject:  Endorsement of November 5, 1999 Last Call Draft
 
Thank you for the opportunity of reviewing the above-referenced
guidelines.  I believe they constitute an excellent approach to dealing
with the definition, implementation and evaluation of user agent
accessibility.  I further believe that they are highly consistent with the
excellent approach taken to Internet accessibility by other W#C projects,
and that they will advance the cause of access to electronic information
and full participation in society of Americans with disabilities.
 
Accordingly, UCP is pleased to endorse this work.
