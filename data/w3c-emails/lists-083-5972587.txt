I think the requirement is stronger than what you are suggesting.
Graphical
desktop browsers are, in fact, required by these guidelines 
to make information available to ATs. It's a Priority 1 requirement
(checkpoints 5.1, 5.3, 5.5, and 5.6), hence "must".

Links to definitions are indicated graphically with green, italic text
by
default. The idea was to allow users to specify their own style
preferences
for that class of links if desired. We try to expose the use of style
sheets for this purpose without going so far as to say
"class="dfn-instance")
Note that we also use: rel="glossary" and title="Definition of XYZ" in
the
link, so there's no shortage of information.

Yes, this has been pointed out and will be cleaned up by moving the
comment to the Techniques document.

Worse, a tax lawyer. Just kidding.

Sounds good.

Ok.

I'll add "e.g.," before "(e.g., assistive technologies, ...). And I'll
break into two sentences, giving:

<QUOTE>
Communicate with other software
(e.g., assistive technologies, the operating system, plug-ins)
through applicable interfaces. Observe conventions
for the user interface, documentation, installation, etc.

Because the DOM doesn't specify how the interfaces it specifies are
actually
exported for use. For example, on a Windows platform, COM or CORBA may
be the conventional ways of getting at the DOM interfaces.

Perhaps the note belongs in the techniques document. The question that
motivated the Note was: Is it possible to conform to the DOM while 
doing more than what the DOM specifies? The answer is yes.
