Subject: One final comment 

Jon--
Omitted to include this one in my comments yesterday --
The bit about user control of audio playback speed is a bit
mystifying. Controlling speed of synthetic speech makes
sense --perhaps controlling speed of recorded speech might
make sense in some situations --but as written, the
guideline will only confuse the reader.

Best Regards,
