Thanks Al!

I am not sure where this comment should go, I would suggest another item 
under guideline 10.

10.9 Allow the user to quickly enable/disable accessibility features for a 
particular file as opposed to requiring the user to (re)configure settings 
for the routine operation of the application [Priority 2].  Make it easy to 
show/hide captioning and audio descriptions.  Getting to the basic on/off 
settings for these features should be as easy as, for example, changing a 
clip's volume setting.

Have you checked out the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines in this regard
(user control of media play)?  Does this document explain well enough how
it should work?
