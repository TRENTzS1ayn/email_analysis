     I read the guidelines today, and thought they did an excellent job of 
     covering the territory.  I didn't have anything to add, since I'm not 
     a screen reader developer.  I like the DOM recommendations, though!

Hello

I'd like to again remind confirmed and potential reviewers 
that the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines last call [1] 
ends this Wednesday, 1 December 1999.

Please submit your comments as soon as possible so that the 
editors and Working Group have time to process them before 
their face-to-face meeting in December [2]. Details about 
the review are available at [1] and the Guidelines are
at [3].
     
Thank you,
     
  - Ian
