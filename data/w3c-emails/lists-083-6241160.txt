Ian --I understand that graphical desktop browsers 
*must* be accessible.

However, in the context of the introduction section of the
UA Guidelines it still comes out to me as being a bit out of
place.
I think the reason for this is that the "must be accessible"
occurs as a subordinate clause in the sentence in question
i.e.
it is saying something like 
"do A because B"
--where B== "must be accessible"
--this is why it bothered me.

If "must be accessible" is a priority 1 requirement,
then I suggest rephrasing the sentence in question as 
two sentences in the following sequence 
B =="graphical browsers must be accessible"
for achieving B do A


    Ian> hence "must".

I understand all that --however I still maintain that 
reading "we highlight x by using stylesheets"
is distracting and confusing in the prose.

I dont know. Still smells of entangling things into the OS
that dont belong there.
