I was pondering this week whether we could identify "applicability
groups" -- in the sense that the WCAG's checkpoints seem to be
organized along a "And if you use <X>..." basis.  Perhaps this 
concept could be useful for Authoring Tools, e.g.:

And if your tool allows for WYSIWYG editing...
And if your tool provides templates...

Would this even be possible?  It works for WCAG because you can
divide HTML into distinct groupings of elements and attributes --
frames, imagemaps, etc.  Can we define functionality categories
for Authoring Tools in a parallel manner, or am I just nuts today?
