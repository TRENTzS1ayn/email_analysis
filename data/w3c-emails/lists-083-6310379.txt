Thank you, Liam.

HTML documents will still work without style sheets (in fact the WCAG
requires that they do).

I think you are correct. From the CSS2 specification [1]:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Conforming user agents must apply a default style sheet 
 (or behave as if they did) prior to all other style 
 sheets for a document. A user agent's default style
 sheet should present the elements of the document language 
 in ways that satisfy general presentation expectations 
 for the document language (e.g., for visual browsers, the
 EM element in HTML is presented using an italic font).

However, what is the UA default style sheet for an XML document?

Ok.

Thank you again Liam,
