No problem, here we go!

At the 24 November teleconf [1] we decided to go with "Braille" since
more
people favored that spelling and there were no objections.

Right.

We had some discussion of this as well on 24 November and it
was minuted that Braille is haptic. We'll have to review that
(or just delete the term from the document).

Those four sound fine to me, but it may become tedious to use only
those.

It would be a useful exercise for the Working Group to choose
appropriate terms and then the editors will ensure their application.

The WG split one checkpoint into two because some members of the WG
felt it was more important for user agents to document configurations
they allow than to document configurations specified by the author.
The split did not have to do with different types of user agents.

I'll raise that as an issue with the WG. Refer to issue 133
http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#133

This proposal added as issue 134

The term does not yet appear in the document, but is used in
the Authoring Tool Guidelines [2]:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Some checkpoints that refer to generating, authoring,
or checking Web content have multiple priorities.
The priority is dependent on the priority in the Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines [WAI-WEBCONTENT].
</BLOCKQUOTE>

I'm not sure I understand (or agree) with this comment. I think below
you explore this more.

Relative priority would have a specific meaning:

   "It is Priority 1 to implement the checkpoint for 
   content features that are a Priority 1 requirement
   in [WAI-WEBCONTENT]."

 And so forth for Priority 2 and Priority 3.

Perhaps with the clarification above you have a different opinion.

7.1: Allow the user to navigate viewports (including frames).

This is very pertinent to graphical desktop browsers and is possible
today in Opera and Navigator at least.

7.2: For user agents that offer a browsing history mechanism,
     when the user returns to a previous view, restore the 
     point of regard in the viewport.

This is already done by browsers today.

7.3: Allow the user to navigate just among cells of a table
     (notably left and right within a row and up and down within a
column).

This was initially for assistive technologies, then rephrased to
include graphical desktop browsers. It is, admittedly, more vague
as a result.

7.6: Allow the user to search for rendered text content, 
     including alternative text content.

  Browsers I am familiar with already do this, though perhaps
  not for alt content.

7.7: Allow the user to navigate according to structure.

  This is not done much today I believe.

7.8 Allow the user to configure structured navigation

  This is not done much either.

Yes.

We have had other comments that some of the checkpoints that were
generalized to fit more user agents have lost their zing, including
7.3 and 8.2 (both about tables).

That is likely true: you could satisfy all but one of the Priority 1
checkpoints and you would be close to being a Level A user agent.
But you wouldn't be Level A. The Working Group decided for a number
of reasons (and after many discussions, refer to summary [3]) to
maintain
three discrete conformance levels.

Interesting question: what if you built a really really accessible
tool that did not communicate any information to other tools?
I suspect that the answer would still be that the tool, while useful,
would not be accessible to those who needed to tailor the information
to their particular needs, output devices, etc.

The should not only prevent it, they should (I hope) promote the
creation
of such user agents.

Please expand on this. What would it men to meet the functionality
but not fulfill the checkpoint? The checkpoints have been designed
precisely to capture the functionalities required for accessibility.
How are you separating the dancer from the dance, as it were?
