Hello,

When the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines became a 
Recommendation in May 1999, we published a "Fact Sheet" [1]
(a 20-question FAQ, essentially) with the press release [2].

With the expectation that the UAGL will at some point become
a Recommendation, I would like to start compiling some frequently
asked questions and welcome input from the Working Group. I haven't
put much thought into it yet, but having reviewed a number of
last call review comments, here are some candidate questions:

  1. Can my screen reader conform? (yes, but the spec not designed for
this)
  2. Can my UA in conjunction with another AT conform? (conformance
     must be native)
  3. Can I satisfy a checkpoint by using features supplied by the 
     operating system? (yes, using system conventions a good idea)
  4. What does "applicable checkpoint" mean? (summarize definition)
  5. Are these Guidelines legal requirements (no, refer to
     similar question 11 in [2]. Potentially discuss
     relationship to 508, ADA, Telecom Act.)

Note that if a question is asked all the time, there's a problem
with the document and the point should be clarified there first.
Not all questions are within the scope of the document, but
readers must be able to find answers to questions that are
in scope in the document.

Your suggestions welcome,

 - Ian
