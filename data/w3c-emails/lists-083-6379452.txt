Regrading John Gardners comments on tactile vs haptic...

from dictionary.com
tactile, adj. -Perceptible to the sense of touch;
haptic, adj. - Of or relating to the sense of touch; tactile.

common understanding of braille usage is through the sense of touch, many
people are confused or are unsure of the term haptic. I would have no
problem changing it to "tactile"

We had some discussion of this as well on 24 November and it
was minuted that Braille is haptic. We'll have to review that
(or just delete the term from the document).
