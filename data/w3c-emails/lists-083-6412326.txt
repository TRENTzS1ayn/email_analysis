Quoting from "Haptic Issues for Virtual Manipulation," a dissertation by Ken
Hinkley, "Haptic comes from the Greek word haptesthai, which means to touch.
In human-computer interaction, and for the purposes of this thesis, the term
haptic encompasses a broad set of related sensations including
proprioception and kinesthesis."  This is "tactile sensation," but it isn't
texture of temperature, it is the position and movements of joints that we
are talking about. A haptic mouse will "bump" when it runs into an icon on
the screen, for example.  In this usage, Braille probably isn't "haptic."

Regrading John Gardners comments on tactile vs haptic...

from dictionary.com
tactile, adj. -Perceptible to the sense of touch;
haptic, adj. - Of or relating to the sense of touch; tactile.

common understanding of braille usage is through the sense of touch, many
people are confused or are unsure of the term haptic. I would have no
problem changing it to "tactile"

We had some discussion of this as well on 24 November and it
was minuted that Braille is haptic. We'll have to review that
(or just delete the term from the document).
