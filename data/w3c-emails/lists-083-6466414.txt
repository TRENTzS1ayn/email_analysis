The distinction between haptic and tactile is that haptic is intrinsically
duynamic.  For example, force-feedback devices like joysticks and haptic
mice either move or respont to motion by the user.  Braille is tactile but
not haptic, because it sits still and doesn't change in response to the
motion of the user's fingers.  Hope this helps.
