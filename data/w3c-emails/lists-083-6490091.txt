I propose a short but important addition (specifically citing the use of
metatags, which would help not only the cognitively disabled but everyone),
as follows:
================================

Guideline 7. Provide navigation mechanisms


         Provide navigation mechanisms that meet the needs of different users:
serial navigation for context, direct navigation for speed, search functions,
structured navigation, etc.  [ADD NEW SENTENCE: This should include the
routine use of metatags in coding web pages, especially the meta
description and keywords, to increase the "find-ability" of web pages
by directory and search engines, and hence by the cognitively disabled
user and all users.]


================================

I'd be happy to discuss further, as requested.
