Scott,

I think you are correct that this style of numbering would be much easier to
navigate, and even for a sighted person who jumped into the middle of a long
list.  But this would be a list style feature of HTML, and would be turned
on and off, I would think, via a local style sheet.  We already have support
for user style sheets as a desirable characteristic, so the appropriate
place for this would be in the HTML definition, rather than expecting the
browser to repair HTML!

Hi,

I just realized I forgot to mention about an option for numbering
nested lists.  Sighted people can read nested lists like:

   A.  some info

       1.  detail info

       2.  more detail

           a.  sub-detail

           b.  more sub-detail

   B.  other info

   C.  additional info

       1.  a little more detail

       2.  additional detail

       3.  even more detail


This structure requires that the blind user keep track of where in
the nested list structure they are.  It would be helpful for blind users
if they had an option where list numbering was rendered like:



   A.  some info

       A.1.  detail info

       A.2.  more detail

           A.2.a.  sub-detail

           A.2.b.  more sub-detail

   B.  other info

   C.  additional info

       C.1.  a little more detail

       C.2.  additional detail

       C.3.  even more detail


By having it as an option, it can be turned off if the output gets to noisy
or turned on when the nesting gets confusing.

Scott
