This looks like an authoring issue more than an UA issue.  If the author
didn't put meta-tags in a page, how could the agent create them?

Subject: Last Call review period: W3C User Agent Accessibility Guidelines
(Dec. 1)

I propose a short but important addition (specifically citing the use of
metatags, which would help not only the cognitively disabled but everyone),
as follows:
================================

Guideline 7. Provide navigation mechanisms


         Provide navigation mechanisms that meet the needs of different
users:
serial navigation for context, direct navigation for speed, search
functions,
structured navigation, etc.  [ADD NEW SENTENCE: This should include the
routine use of metatags in coding web pages, especially the meta
description and keywords, to increase the "find-ability" of web pages
by directory and search engines, and hence by the cognitively disabled
user and all users.]


================================

I'd be happy to discuss further, as requested.
