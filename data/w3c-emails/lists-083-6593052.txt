Hello,

I am forwarding comments from Chuck Hitchcock on the last
call User Agent Guidelines [1]. My comments are intermixed.

Thank you for the review, Chuck!

This sounds like a Technique, but the WG should consider whether
this should be a checkpoint, say in the section on configuration.

Unless there are objections, I will use your language.

I would argue that if you can't do something at all with a given device,
the UA is broken. I can enter text with the mouse if I have an onscreen
keyboard. However, I don't want to do so since I can use the keyboard
(and for that particular functionality, I don't want to require the
UA to support text entry with the mouse; it's still conceivable,
however).

Thus, in my opinion, users who can use different devices should be
able to use the one best-suited to their abilities and the task at
hand. Users who can only use one device should be able to operate the
tool with that device alone.

Yes, I think we need to add a definition.

This may have been a conscious change since the WCAG, but I don't
recall. Comments from others?

Ok. (Fixed).

I'll add to the techniques document.

I don't know that this is required since the conformance clause
says:

       "User agents must satisfy natively all the applicable 
        checkpoints for a chosen conformance level."

Thus, browsers that do not synthesize speech natively don't have
to satisfy the checkpoints.

Agreed. Refer to issue 132
http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#132

Checkpoint 5.1 needs clarification, which may have an impact
on this situation. Refer to issue 125.

You're right. The reference to table regions seems out of place
here. It might be better closer to 7.3 (if 7.3 survives).

I think it should be removed from the rationale and either
moved to G7 or to the techniques.

Refer to issue 137.

Same comment.

Thanks again Chuck,
