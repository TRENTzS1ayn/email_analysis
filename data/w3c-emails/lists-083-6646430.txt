Hi, Denis

Having it in HTML/CSS makes sense.  However, I would also include an
option in the browser.  The reason is that the user may not always know
in what situations it will be useful and when it will be annoying.

I guess one approach might be for browsers to support multiple user
style sheets and dynamically turning them on and off.  I guess the part
I don't like about that a[[rpach is that it puts a greater burden on
users to understand style sheets and knowing which to select.  I believe
that the option is useful enough that less computer-sophisticated users
should not be penalized because of their lack of background.
