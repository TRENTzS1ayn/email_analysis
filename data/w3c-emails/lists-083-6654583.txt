This sounds like a Technique, but the WG should consider whether
this should be a checkpoint, say in the section on configuration.
I think it might be a checkpoint, with a priority 2 level. Restore defaults
is a common feature on highly configurable products, since you can easily
make the product unusable if you forget the changes you've made.  Changing
back to a known standard is a good way to recover.

Unless there are objections, I will use your language.
If we are talking about menus with sub-menus, they do help those with
cognitive deficits who can't process too many options at once, but they are
a real problem for those with motor control problems, since it's very easy
to fall off the side of the menu, and have it collapse.  Even with normal
hand function, I have this happen often enough to be annoying.

I would argue that if you can't do something at all with a given device,
the UA is broken. I can enter text with the mouse if I have an onscreen
keyboard. However, I don't want to do so since I can use the keyboard
(and for that particular functionality, I don't want to require the
UA to support text entry with the mouse; it's still conceivable,
however).

Thus, in my opinion, users who can use different devices should be
able to use the one best-suited to their abilities and the task at
hand. Users who can only use one device should be able to operate the
tool with that device alone.

I agree with Ian here.  Using an on-screen keyboard is ridiculous for a
person who can use the physical keyboard, because the physical device is
faster and more effective.  But if you are using a mouse emulator, and can't
use the keyboard, then being able to use an on-screen keyboard makes the UA
usable.  Similarly, if you can use a keyboard, but not a mouse, then having
keyboard equivalents for all functionality makes the UA accessible, but a
person who can use the mouse will probably prefer to use that as the input
device.
