I don't think it's necessarily to literally squoze the text onto the screen 
or scroll.  For example, with w3/emacspeak and other setups, the whole page 
gets read without visually sqozing or even visually scrolling the screen at 
all.  The screen just stays static while the software goes merrily reading 
past the bottom of the page.

I'm not saying thats the optimal way for it to work.  For example, if I'm 
working with a blind user we're no longer looking at the same thing once it 
starts reading past the bottom.  It also confuses me.  However, it may be 
easier to implement this than to try to keep the audio and visual views in 
synch, and it satisfies the first priority of getting the info to a blind 
user with a minimum of keystrokes.

And even if you don't do that, you can have the screen automatically scroll 
horizontally or vertically as the UA reads.  For example, like Zoomtext in 
voice mode.
