While working on techniques for Guideline 2, I didn't write any specific
techniques for Checkpoint 2.6:
If a technology allows for more than one audio track, allow
the user to choose from among tracks.

I am unsure of the intent of this checkpoint. It seems to me that it might be a
special case of Checkpoint 2.2:
If a technology allows for more than one continuous equivalent tracks
(e.g., closed captions, auditory descriptions, video of sign language, etc.), allow
the user to choose from among the tracks. 

It would be a special case if the various audio tracks were considered continuous
equivalents, such as versions of the audio channel or audio description in
different languages. In that case, I think we can remove the checkpoint and
make reference to multiple versions of audio in 2.2.

However, if we are referring in 2.6 to audio tracks that are not continuous 
equivalents, such as director's comments or a laugh track, then the ability to
turn them on and off is a UI issue, not an access issue, as far as I can see.
And again, if this is the case I don't think this is a necessary checkpoint.

I thought I had raised this question in the past, but I can't find it in the issues
list. I apologize if I am re-opening a settled issue.
