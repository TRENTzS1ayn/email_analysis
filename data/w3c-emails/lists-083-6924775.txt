But in this case, the *standard* APIs for the system would be different
(or non-existent), wouldn't they?

Added as issue 150: Do APIs apply when the software is accessible 
on its own?

(I suspect that the answer will be that the UA still needs to 
make information available.)

Good idea.

Meaning: respect synchronization?

This is probably covered by 2.1: ensure access to all content.

yes, in the techniques.
