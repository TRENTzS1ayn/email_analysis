aloha, lauren!

have you seen h?kon's comments on the DOM in his review of the UAGL? [1]

Adding support for DOM effectively turns a browser into an editor.
This is often beneficial, but in memory-constrained enviroments it is
often impossible. By making this Priority 1, a whole segment of UAs
will fail conformance and might therefore pay less attention to the
Guidelines in general. I suggest changing it to Priority 2 and limit
the requirement fo the read (i.e. not write) portions of the DOM.

I suggest changing all sections in Guidline 5 to reflect this.

what do you think?
