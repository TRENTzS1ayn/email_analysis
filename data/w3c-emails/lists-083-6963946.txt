I think that dropping the requirement for the write functionality of DOM may
be appropriate. Although I believe that some tools write to the DOM to
restructure a page for more appropriate presentation. If we drop the
requirement to support DOM write functions do we destroy compatibility with
those assistive technologies, and do I understand the way they are working
correctly?

There is a broader question of whether the DOM is indeed something that needs
to be implemented, or whether it is sufficient to implement an interface,
with the use of DOM in particular being a lower priority.

  thank you for your extremely valuable and insightful comments on the Last Call
  draft of the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines...
  
  in your review, you noted:
  
  quote
  Adding support for DOM effectively turns a browser into an editor.
  This is often beneficial, but in memory-constrained enviroments it is
  often impossible. By making this Priority 1, a whole segment of UAs
  will fail conformance and might therefore pay less attention to the
  Guidelines in general. I suggest changing it to Priority 2 and limit
  the requirement fo the read (i.e. not write) portions of the DOM.
  
  I suggest changing all sections in Guidline 5 to reflect this.
  unquote
  
  while your point is very well taken, i would like to propose a median solution:
  retain Priority 1 for the read portions of the DOM and Priority 2 for the write
  portions...  this could be accomplished either by splitting the checkpoint in
  2, or by simply listing the priority level as P1 for read functions and P2 for
  write functions...
