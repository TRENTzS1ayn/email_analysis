But in this case, the *standard* APIs for the system would be different
(or non-existent), wouldn't they?

There is a tendency to assume that those who can't read the screen will
automatically be able to hear the screen.  That simply isn't true.
Refreshable Braille may be the only access mode for a deaf-blind person.
The reason that the browser should expose the content through a standard API
is so that the user can use whatever access method is their standard, and
not have to limit themselves to the method that the author of the UA thought
was appropriate.
