LRK2: First, let me correct what I said:  I really meant names of classes.

This was discussed in the Sept and October wai-er-ig archives under "CSS 
abuse". It may be true that technically speaking class names are required 
to be accessible, although I'm having trouble seeing that.

However, at best, most readers will miss that.    2.1 talks about 
"alternative equivalents for content".   Hence it is talking about 
alternatives to what a sighted user sees, or what a hearing person hears, 
but doesn't address alternatives to things that nobody normally sees or 
hears.  For example, sighted users don't see image filenames.  Hence, 2.1 
doesn't require agents to provide alternative representations of image 
filenames.  Similarly, users don't see names of classes. So 2.1 doesn't 
seem to require alternatives here either.

Therefore I think this has to be an explicit requirement or few if any 
implementors will do it.

LRK2:: yes, synchronized per SMIL description.
