Guildline Introduction Line 4 says: "They may have a text-only screen, a
small screen, or a slow Internet connection." unquote} Recognizing slow
connections vendors may choose to create smaller UAs which shouldn't be
given a lower conformance mark because they fulfil other needs & suit that
firms approach to Web business. In any case, very few people have write
privileges on the Web. DOM strikes me as something akin to Groupware
allowing workers to edit documents on a business LAN. We shouldn't be
distracted from the goal of enhanced Web usability. Other laws make business
programs Accessible WAI is about Web browsing.
