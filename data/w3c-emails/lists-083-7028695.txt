It depends on why you say that UAs should implement the DOM. 
Since I think that you could use the DOM to implement 5.1, 5.3 
and 5.5, which are all Priority 1, it would seem to follow that at 
least some parts of the DOM should be Priority 1. If the UA is a 
readonly tool, then obviously read-write parts of the DOM are 
inapplicable, but could be used for "writing" parts of a document to, 
e.g., a screen-reader.

However, if you don't see the DOM as being a way to implement 
other guidelines, but as something else entirely, then the priority 
should depend on what use cases you have for using the DOM at 
all.
