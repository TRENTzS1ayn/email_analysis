MN:    I need to do a lot of email reading to catch up to the root or source of
this discussion, but one thing that caught my attention directly is the comment
that "MSAA is still reliant on an offscreen model".

Please note, MSAA *does not* require an Off-Screen Model for the information
it provides.
