For clarification I'm suggesting this basic format be used on
all of the guidelines containing a mixture of UI and content
checkpoints. And while the search for removable checkpoints may
prove fruitless, this approach still provides a form of
checkpoint reduction. Engineers working on the overall UI will
be able to see which of the checkpoints apply to them as will
those working on the content parser. By identifying which of
these 2 buckets the checkpoint falls into, the structure makes
it easy for these engineers to filter out checkpoints that
aren't relevant to them.
