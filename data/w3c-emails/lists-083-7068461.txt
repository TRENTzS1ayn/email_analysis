aloha, y'all!

can someone refresh my (obviously failing) memory, and explain to me why
Checkpoint 5.8 is only P2?

here's the checkpoint text:

quote
Follow operating system conventions and accessibility settings. In
particular, follow conventions for user interface design, default keyboard
configuration, product installation, and documentation. [Priority 2]
unquote

seems to me that this is a P1 as P1 gets...  if i can't install or
reinstall the software, what good is it?  if i can't get all of the
information that a sighted user can get when i choose the custom
installation, and moving focus from one item to the next in a list box
causes a portion of the screen to update with a description of the items,
their function, and the amount of memory needed to install them, then is
user agent accessible?

no, i ain't, and 5.8 ought to be -- must be -- a Priority 1

gregory.
