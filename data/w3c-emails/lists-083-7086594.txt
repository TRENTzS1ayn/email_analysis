Gregory,

The P1 standard is that the software will be unusable without the feature or
functionality.  P2 means that it will be difficult to use without the
functionality.  Installation by another person may make the software more
difficult to install and configure, but unless you are residing on a desert
island by yourself, it probably doesn't make it impossible to use.

aloha, y'all!

can someone refresh my (obviously failing) memory, and explain to me why
Checkpoint 5.8 is only P2?

here's the checkpoint text:

quote
Follow operating system conventions and accessibility settings. In
particular, follow conventions for user interface design, default keyboard
configuration, product installation, and documentation. [Priority 2]
unquote

seems to me that this is a P1 as P1 gets...  if i can't install or
reinstall the software, what good is it?  if i can't get all of the
information that a sighted user can get when i choose the custom
installation, and moving focus from one item to the next in a list box
causes a portion of the screen to update with a description of the items,
their function, and the amount of memory needed to install them, then is
user agent accessible?

no, i ain't, and 5.8 ought to be -- must be -- a Priority 1
