One of my reasons for doing the DOM in the frst place was to give 
adaptive technology vendors a standard interface so they could 
write tools that hook into browser, editors, etc which implement the 
DOM. So I think such tools should implement the DOM, to enable 
this. There is, to my mind, little point in implementing a proprietary 
interface when a standard one is available, particularly since the 
WAI groups have input to the standard interface and not to 
proprietary interfaces in general.

If adaptive technology vendors (screen readers, etc) implement 
hooks to be a client of the DOM, they should be able to hook into 
any DOM implementation with minimal changes. Otherwise they 
need to change their client interface for each tool. For example, 
SoftQuad Software's HoTMetaL and XMetaL implement the DOM 
(more with each release) and Mozilla implements the DOM, and 
MSIE implements the DOM, and .... so why reinvent the wheel 
each time?

If these tools can't use the DOM  for some reason, then the DOM 
WG needs to know about this.
