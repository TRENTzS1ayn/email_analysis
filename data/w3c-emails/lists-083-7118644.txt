aloha, lauren!

thank you for your extremely informative response...  the scenario which you
outlined was my understanding of the issue, but i have yet to really hear
anything concrete from assistive technology vendors on the topic of "what do we
need from the DOM" and "what does the DOM need for us to provide access to
content and make orientation information available and to facillitate
navigation"

i understand that in a niche market as competitive as assistive technology,
firm examples may be hard to come by, but if microsoft, sun, and apple can all
sit at the same table and discuss issues openly, why not henter-joyce,
gw-micro, and the others?

the assistive technology vendors need to let both the UA WG and the DOM WG know
more precisely what it is they need from the DOM...  otherwise, all the UAGL's
talk of implementing the DOM to achieve accessiblity will be naught but hot
air...

gregory.
