That's a possibility but if that's the philosophy it should be explicit and 
highlighted.

Plus there's still the case... though it may be unlikely... that someone 
designs a browser with built in  output access to all disabilities, 
including e.g. built in sound, drivers for most Braille terminals, 
magnification, captioning, etc.  For the sake of example, assume the input 
follows standards.  I think they should be allowed at least an A rating 
even if they don't have a standard API for output.
