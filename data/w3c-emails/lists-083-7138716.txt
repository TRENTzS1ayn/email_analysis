Gregory,

No, not at all.  Your example was about installing the software.  If the
installation requires assistance, that isn't an "end of the world" issue.
If you can't use it after its installed, then we have a P1 issue.  It's the
difference between difficult and impossible that I was referring to.

aloha, denis!

i strongly resent your use of the "desert island" scenario...   i happen to
live in a brownstone with 4 other persons, all of whom are fully sighted,
but
that doesn't mean that they are always around to act as screen readers when
my
screen reader crashes or to assist me when my screen reader is unable to
interpret an interface or web page...

furthermore, i don't understand your logic -- are you saying that even if i
need someone to sit by my side as i surf the web or use an online banking
system to handle my personal finances, or install or reinstall a piece of
software, that this isn't a P1 issue?  would you call dependence upon
another
individual accessibility?  i sure as hell wouldn't...

i reject your argument that 5.8 is only a P2 issue because i could always
get
sighted assistance...  if i can't configure a user agent by MYSELF, then it
cannot be considered UAGL compliant...  if i can't install the user agent
MYSELF, then it cannot be considered UAGL compliant at any level...

and what could be more unusable than a piece of software that i can't
install
or configure MYSELF without assistance?  if there's no one around to assist,
then it IS impossible to use, denis...

5.8 is a P1, plain and simple,
gregory.
