aloha, len!

i adamantly oppose different conformance levels for different target
audiences...

if someone creates a user agent specifically targeted at the totally blind
working in an exclusively aural environment, they don't need the WAI slash UA
seal-of-conformance to reach their target audience...

the UAGL address what comprises the BASE FUNCTIONALITY of a specific class of
tools called user agents, outlining what functionality they need to offer ALL
users and what information they need to expose to any application that requests
that information...
