Mark,

MSAA *does* rely on an offscreen model to provide access to text in
documents and many other custom contols. For simple buttons and menu items
it does allow you to get access to the text but that is not enough by a
long shot.

 A miracle has not happened here yet.

MN:    I need to do a lot of email reading to catch up to the root or
source of
this discussion, but one thing that caught my attention directly is the
comment
that "MSAA is still reliant on an offscreen model".

Please note, MSAA *does not* require an Off-Screen Model for the
information
it provides.
