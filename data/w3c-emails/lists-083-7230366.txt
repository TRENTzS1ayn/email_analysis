Thanks Gregg! My comments below. I have cut out the editorial issues.

I guess what's need here is "or through an API". I believe we've
been working under the assumption that, for example, text messages
on the screen suffice since they can be picked up by assistive
technologies. But that solution wouldn't satisfy this checkpoint
as written. Added as issue 142.

The term "control" is defined in the glossary as follows:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
      User control of the user agent - interface, behavior,      
      styles, etc. - means that the user  can choose preferred 
      behavior from a set of options. For instance, control of colors
      means that the user can choose from available colors, within 
      the limits offered by the operating system or user agent. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

I'll make sure that instances of the word "control" link to that
definition.

I'm not sure you're referring to 2.7, which reads
"When no text equivalent has been specified, indicate what 
type of object is present."

Checkpoint 2.8 reads "When alternative text has been 
specified explicitly as empty (i.e., an empty string), 
render nothing."

But 2.8 uses "i.e." not "e.g.", so I don't think it suggests
more than one possibility.

I will raise this as an issue but assume it's editorial so I
can propose changes directly in the next draft. Added as issue 144

That is apparently what 3.4 means.

In Unix, documentation conventions include "man" and "info"
In Windows, documentation conventions involve the windows help system.

7.4 reads "Allow the user to navigate all active elements."
7.5 reads "Allow the user to navigate just among all active elements."

I guess the best solution is to say in 7.5 what is different from 7.4
in a note.

I don't think additional "relaxation" is necessary. The checkpoint
doesn't go so far as to say "don't change anything", it conveys
the notion of consistency. Furthermore, the second sentence indicates
explicitly where flexibility may be applied: Consistency is less 
important than accessibility and adoption of operating 
system conventions.

The note below indicates another way: a script that submits the form
when a menu item changes. Does RETURN count as explicit submit?
How does one push a button without a mouse in today's browsers?

Checkpoint 10.3 reads "Allow the user to change and control the input 
configuration." This means reconfigure keyboard, voice, and other
input bindings. Not redesign the whole GUI interface.

Note that 10.8 refers to moving around GUI parts (Priority 3).

The "and software" part is more of a wish than a requirement.

Yes, I think we will try to do that at the ftf in Austin.
