MN2:  my comment is correct at stated.  I felt your reply to Ian was misleading,
if Mozilla is truely using "standard" controls when on the windows platform,
that information is available thru MSAA, and *does not* require an
Off-Screen Model.   MSAA can also provide more information than just the
"text" for standard controls.  As for what is defined by "enough", I think
that depends
entirely upon a user's needs.

Now, If you want to change that to "custom" controls on the windows
platform, I already
stated in an earlier email, that is a more general accessibility problem, and
one which I hope *someone* is encouraging Mozilla development team to
avoid.  If the Mozilla development team is going to provide custom controls
that are not accessible to MSAA on the windows platform, then by all means I
think it is also their responsibility to make sure those controls are
accessible.

As for accessing the text in doc., I wasn't implying to use MSAA to do
that.  I would
continue to use the DOM, for UAs, as you've stated.
