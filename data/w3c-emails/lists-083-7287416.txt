Version 5.5 Beta of Internet Explorer Has Hit the Web!

http://2.digital.cnet.com/cgi-bin2/flo?x=dEYuAABmYwgmBguh

Hot on the heels of the release of version 5.01, Microsoft has
made a beta version of Internet Explorer 5.5 available to the
public. If you're looking for a ton of flashy new features, you
might be a bit disappointed. However, several behind-the-scenes
enhancements have been made, such as improved support for
DHTML, Cascading Style Sheets, and the new Synchronized
Multimedia Integration Language. And if you're into printing
what you find on the Web, you'll be glad to hear that this
version of IE includes a new print preview feature.

Grab the beta right here:
