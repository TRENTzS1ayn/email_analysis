I agree with Denis. The "provide" in the checkpoint below is
meant for the user agent, and the UA will usually (always?)
derive navigation mechanisms from markup: LINK elements, header elements
used to contstruct a table of contents, etc.

Furthermore, the requirement for metadata from authors is 
checkpint 13.2 of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 
(under Guideline 13) [1]:

     13.2 Provide metadata to add semantic information to pages and
sites.

The UA Working Group has discussed how to support metadata provided
by authors and decided that user agents should 
handle metadata according to specification.

Thank you,
