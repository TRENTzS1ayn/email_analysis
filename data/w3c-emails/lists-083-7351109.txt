This is exactly the type of device we are *not* catering to in these
Guidelines. That particular device would be extremely useful
for many users (Can you get me one??), but it's not the general
purpose device the guidelines are designed to address.

The Working Group has discussed the "user profile" approach
to conformance for these Guidelines and decided not to pursue it.
For background information on conformance approaches/proposals
considered by the WG, please refer to [1]. In particular, refer to
Al's initial proposal for a conformance provision based
on user profile [2].

That's the intended audience for this document. Future versions, or
additional documents intended for software in combination or specialized
tools would be very useful.

Though a difficult decision to exclude (de facto) assistive technologies
from the conformance umbrella, the WG reached consensus on this issue,
as documented by the Chair in [3]. The resolution states:

   The User Agent Guidelines conformance clause will not 
   distinguish between classes of users agents.

Vendors of any type of software may claim conformance, but the
checkpoints
are geared at desktop graphical browsers and other general purpose
tools. Unfortunately, but by consensus necessary for the timely
completion
of this version of the Guidelines, this will probably prevent many
assistive technologies from being able to claim conformance.
