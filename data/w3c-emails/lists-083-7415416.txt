Hello,

(I thought I had sent these comments to the list and/or added this
 to the issues list but I must be dreaming since I find evidence
 of neither.)

In discussions with the Microsoft IE Team about the User Agent
Guidelines, they expressed concern that two checkpoints
in the last call draft numbered 7.3 and 8.2 were too vague
to be useful:

7.3 Allow the user to navigate just among cells of a table 
   (notably left and right within a row and up and down 
    within a column). [Priority 1] 

8.2 Convey the author-specified purpose of each table
    and the relationships among the table cells and
    headers. [Priority 1] 

Recall that these checkpoints were initially for
assistive technologies. When we changed conformance strategy,
we chose to generalize the checkpoints that became these
two.

History:

 - Changes to 7.3 and 8.2 proposed by Ian [2].
 - Working Group resolves to adopt changes 6 October [3].

I will add a proposal to delete these (or move to
assistive technology section in Techniques Doc) to the issues
list.

Regards,

  - Ian
