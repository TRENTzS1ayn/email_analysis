Thank you for the comments, Richard. I will add issues that
you raise to our issues list [1]. My comments are below. For
your comments that are purely editorial, I will make the
appropriate corrections.

Thank you,

These comments are very interesting and I will take them to the
W3C Team for discussion. Though I am not a lawyer, I would
split the issue into two:

1) Rendering changes

The HTML specification describes in very few places how content should
be rendered. Therefore, anyone who writes a Web page in HTML and
expects it to be rendered in a specific way is using the wrong language
for designing their page. The fact that HTML says so little
is one reason why browsers differ in behavior today. 

If we extend the discussion to style sheets, user override of style
is built into the CSS specification (CSS2 reinforces the override
by ensuring that users can have final say). Therefore, anyone using
CSS who expects to have final control over styles is using the wrong
language for style.

In short, I don't know how one would defend an argument that user
agents MUST render content in a particular manner. 

2) Content changes

It is possible for users to add content to Web pages (through
transformations, style sheets, and other mechanisms). If I make
these transformations for my personal use but do not republish
them, do I infringe the author's copyright? Is it illegal
to tear pages out of a book because it has been bound too tightly
and I can't read the inside margin of the pages?

I look forward to interesting discussion on this topic.

Eric Hansen has pointed this out as well ([2], Issue #1) 
and the definitions will be cleaned up in future drafts.

I'm not sure what your comment refers to. Checkpoint 1.3 in the
last call draft [3] reads:

   "Ensure that the user can interact with all active 
    elements in a device-independent manner."

Checkpoint 2.8 reads:

     When alternative text has been specified explicitly as
     empty (i.e., an empty string), render nothing.

Authors should be able to specify empty alt text when they mean,
for example, "this image is purely decorative and has no function
in the page." Thus, we ask UAs to not attempt to guess what the
function of the image is since the author has (we hope) meant
"no function" by specifying empty alt text.

Our current techniques for checkpoint 2.7 (missing Alt text)
refer to the "altifier" tool heuristics [4]. Your suggestions could
be added as another technique.

Are you suggesting that the priority of checkpoint 2.9 be
raised to Priority 1?

Ignorance of the copyright statement doesn't mean that it doesn't apply.
Important information on the screen might just as easily be obscured
by the placement of my windows.

The Working Group elected to reduce the priority of turning  off
(static) image rendering because rendering images did not raise barriers
to
accessibility. Background images may make text impossible to read and
thus the WG made checkpoint 3.1 a priority 1 checkpoint.

Do you have significant arguments for raising the priority level of
checkpoint 3.1?

Please refer to the 12 October WG face-to-face minutes [5] for
information
about this resolution. The checkpoint number in the document under
review at that meeting was 4.1.

I'll add this as issue 158

This checkpoint is already on our issues list as issue 125

You should stop reading them. That helped me. <wink>

Good idea. That's how we handle other checkpoints that are important
special cases. However, I think 5.4 is more a special case
of 5.3 than 5.5 (which is more about change than read/write access).

6.1 is specifically about accessibility features.
6.2 is about conformance to specification; all features
    in addition to accessibility features.

I agree that 6.1 is a special case of 6.2 for W3C specifications.
However, 6.1 is not limited to W3C specifications (it would include,
for example, Java, in my opinion).

I don't think that's true. If I enter a long page (that requires
scrolling
to view the entire contents) but I leave the page via a link at the
top of the page, there is no guarantee that I have viewed anything below
the first screen (nor that I have viewed a piece of content in the
first screen that I may have missed, or understood if written in a
language I don't understand, etc.)

I think the Web is mostly about direct access through links and
therefore,
there are few guarantees of sequential access to information. 
The traditional narrative structure is lost (or rather augemented) in
the
hypertext model.

I think that a "Favorites" functionality is useful (like a Back/Forward
functionality) but is probably a technique for another checkpoint
related to navigation.
