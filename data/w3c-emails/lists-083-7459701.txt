Hi Wendy,

Thank you for the comments!

Do you mean that it's confusing to have other checkpoints that are
special cases (e.g., 1.4) or that checkpoint 1.1 itself is
confusin (i.e., the part about low-level interfaces)?

Please clarify your proposal.

The key phrase in 1.3 is "active element". The key phrase in 1.4 is 
"keyboard". They are different in that fundamental way. Both
checkpoints 1.3 and 1.4 indicate that they are important special cases
of
checkpoint 1.1.

In the rationale of Guideline 4, the following Note covers your
requirement:

        Note. The checkpoints in this guideline apply to all 
              content, in including alternative representations
              of content.

The note after 5.2 is already long and I don't want to overload
it with an entirely separate topic (OS flags). Some options:

1) Leave it where it is
2) Move it to the Techniques.
3) Integrate some keyword into the checkpoint text.

I'll add as issue 165.

I'm not sure what to suggest here. Sequential access *can* provide
more context, but in the tabbing scenario, you don't get all context.
It's still true that in direct navigation, "some context may be lost."

1) I suspect that checkpoint 7.3 may go. Refer to issue 160
   http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#160

2) 7.5 is a special case of 7.4

3) 7.8 is a related to 7.7.

This means that the key navigation checkpoints are:

  a) viewports
  b) active elements (this includes direct and serial)
  c) structure 
  d) searching

The WG decided (reference not handy since working offline due
to Bell Atlantic ISP problem) that specifics about navigation
would be better off in the techniques document.

I have already proposed a note that clarifies that 
7.5 is a special case of 7.4.

I guess one could consider 7.4 to be a special case of 7.7 (7.7
requires structured navigation, 7.8 requires configuration thereof). 
I don't mind adding a note to 7.4 to this effect.

Yes, I'll add a note that it's an important special case as we've
done elsewhere.

Yes, checkpoint 8.3:

             8.3 Provide an outline of a resource view built from 
                 its structural elements (e.g., frames,
                 headers, lists, forms, tables, etc.) 

I propose some rewording of 8.3 to read "outline view of a resource".

Please  propose a rewording or that we should reconsider the checkpoint.

I'd actually rather break out the parenthetical examples into a
second sentence. With your other change, that would give:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Changes to content or browsing context may disorient users with
visual impairments or certain types of learning disabilities.
Unexpected changes may cause users to lose track of how many 
viewports are open, which is the current
viewport, etc.

Refer to existing issue 137.

9.1 Requires that the user agent notify the user
9.4 Allows the user to configure the user agent to filter out
information.

I'm not sure that the only changes that interest the user are those
that require user reponse. There are certainly changes that don't
interest
the user (e.g., the little icon is turning in circles). But there is
probably a class of changes (e.g., automatic refresh) where knowing is
important but no action is required.

Yep.

To the user and through APIs. This should be clarified as is done
in 9.1: "directly to  the user and through APIs."

The only difference between 10.1 and 10.2 is where the configuration
comes from (10.1: user, 10.2: author). This is one of the issues
highlighted in the last call announcement and it appears
in the document status section.

Refer to issue 112

Ok.

This checkpoint was only meant for the 
graphical user interface (e.g., buttons, menus, etc.)
