I think that if a standard API is not available, then the UA would
would not be able to use it. Does the "applicability" exception address
your concern?

This sound either like a technique for providing access to content
and/or related to issue 135: incremental fast forward and rewind.

There is not currently a requirement to checkpoint 2.3 to 
notify users of the language switching.

I'll add the proposal to allow users to turn off language switching
as issue 167.

Do you think a techniques discussion of this is sufficient, or should
there be a checkpoint-level requirement to have the object
name available. What if the resource is not easily nameable  (e.g.,
the URI is part of a query to a database)? (The same argument may
be made for object type, but there may be more information, e.g.,
"type" attribute HTTP headers, etc. to identify object type).

Added as issue 168.

The "applicability" clause  comes into play here:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
     A checkpoint applies to a user agent unless:

       * The checkpoint includes requirements about a content 
         type (script, image, video, sound, applets, etc.) that 
         the user agent does not recognize at all. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Thus, if the UA can't tell, it doesn't have to support control. If
a plug in or some other user agent renders the content, that plug
in or user agent is responsible for the control.

> > they wish to turn off? 

I'd suggest that if the user interface here is designed with
accessibility in mind, the user should not have to know about
the object technologies. "Please turn off blinking things" would
be a convenient request to the user agent. If the user agent
allows the user to turn off the objects through other means
(e.g., by turning off scripts), then this would also be
sufficient, but the user agent should document that this is
how the user can achieve this particular goal.

Can you expand on this question?

Nope, another clause from the definition of "applicability":

<BLOCKQUOTE>
     A checkpoint applies to a user agent unless:

     * The checkpoint refers to the properties of an 
       embedded object (e.g., video or animation
       rate) that may not be controlled or accessed by the user agent. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

I'd like to note here that the "applicability" definition used to
be in the section of the guidelines on conformance. The Working Group
decided to move it to the glossary, but I'm beginning to think that
it deserves more visibility up front.

I would argue that the previous comment applies here too, but I will
happily add a note after the checkpoint:

        User agents may not be able to control the playback rate for
        some audio formats.

The checkpoints on speech only apply to user agents that do speech
synthesis natively. If the UA itself doesn't support gender switching,
then this checkpoint doesn't apply.

Can you list some scenarios where this would not apply? For instance,
I can imagine that in a stand-alone system where no interfaces are
used, this would not apply.

I'll add this as a technique.

Configuration of the view is covered by checkpoint 8.6:

        "Allow the user to configure the outline view."

As for creation of the outline view, if you have repair techniques, they
would
be welcome. I don't know whether we can require user agents to handle
idioms that misuse presentation to represent structure since the list of
those
idioms is not well-defined.

Yes. Wendy made a similar comment and I'll fix throughout the document.
