Hi Jamal,

Thank you for the suggested techniques. Some comments below:

For which checkpoint is this a technique? How exactly would this
work?

1) If you say "Download the current page and everything it links
to recursively" you may get the whole Web on your hard drive...
You might do the following:

1) Download the current page and any linked to it via LINK
2) Download all referenced images, objects, etc. (What about
   applets?)
3) Don't download resources linked by  <A href..>

2) If you spend time identifying each page you want to download
   and putting the URL in a list box, doesn't that amount
   to following the link as we do today?

While extremely important, this feature does not seem to be 
an accessibility issue and my gut feeling is that it's out
of scope for this document.

I realize that anything that saves time can benefit accessibility.
Can you suggest important reasons while resumption of a download
benefits accessibility?

Thanks Jamal!
