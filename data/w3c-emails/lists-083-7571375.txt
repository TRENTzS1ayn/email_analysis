I think one of the things we are talking about here is something that
can only be moused to my knowledge.  that is if there is a list of
things that are downloadable we have to select one at a time because we
have no good way to select the ones we want to download unless they are
set up with checkboxes as in the microsoft windows.98 update site.  that
is a lovely way to do a lot of downloading with little effort.
