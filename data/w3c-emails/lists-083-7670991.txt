Hello all,

Just a quick status report as we prepare for the face-to-face
meeting this week in Austin [1]:

1) The issues list is more or less up to date as of 11pm ET 5 Dec.
   I logged about 60 issues that were raised during the last call
   review (or shortly thereafter). 

2) The list of last call reviewers [3] has been updated to include
   links to comments by reviewers (not all comments, just the
   first, primary reviews). Many thanks to all the reviewers!
   Please note that due to time constraints before the face-to-face
   and the fact that the deadline for last call comments was 1 December,
   we may not be able to process additional comments before the
   face-to-face meeting.

3) I will publish a new draft of both Guidelines and Techniques
   Monday 6 December (probably end of day). I will incorporate
   the many editorial suggestions that came in during the
   last call review. I may not have time to actually reread the document
   as a whole before tomorrow, so more "smoothing out" is 
   likely in the following draft (after the face-to-face, 
   where many changes will be likely made).

Reminder: next teleconf is 7 December and there is no teleconf
8 December (details on home page [4]).

Thank you,

 - Ian
