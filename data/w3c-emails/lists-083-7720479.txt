Hello.

Just two more points I just became aware of:

Guideline 6 makes it look
as if HTML32 is a good thing to be used. However, internationalization
is only provided in HTML40; HTML32 should therefore not be given as
an example, or only with appropriate warnings.

Checkpoint 6.2: For an event model, implement DOM 2: Due mainly to
completely lacking support for i18n, the key events have been taken
out of DOM2, and new work has started last week to address this
seriously in DOM3.


Regards,   Martin.
