as I see this, it boils down to three components.
1> the ua.
2> the os.
3> the assistive technology that interfaces with the computer/device.

Further, there are myriad combinatorials of this for instance, there is
a ua with built in a t or more than one.  there are possibly ats which
ride on top of a specific ua.  There are integrations of all three
components into specialized systems.

Our focus is on the ua which in many respects generalizes to the os.

This leads us according to our charter, purpose and scope to draw some
lines which can be extended as you suggest.  I don't have specific
sitings to hand, however, the extendability can be done through w3c
standards and os support.  Many of these are still in development and as
we have many ua types to deal with the best we can do for the moment is
in part what we have done in refering to extention through os standards
and w3c standards.  It is our hope I believe that this layer will come
about through this approach in that the os and the w3c standards will
develop towards your stated level where an a t will only need to hook
into what is going on with the os and that the ua will provide
additional ui through the w3c standard protocols.

As to the conformance issue, there may be something in the compliance
requirements that exempts special uas from compliance and allows what
might be a conditional rating meaning that it quallifies in a certain
class, but I doubt we'll tackle this before we finish the guideline
process its self.  This conformance rating would be based upon
documentation which has yet to be finalized if it is done at all.  I
think a better approach for our current purpose is to strongly emphasize
that our conformance is aimed squarely at the general class of browsers
to provide accessible rendering and ui capabilities to the extent
possible as this field evolves and that there should be other more
general a t software development documents that would come from a
process similar to this one but perhaps out of an operating systems
guidelines group from the at community.  There is an parellell to the w3
in the software/computer field which this could possibly be extended
through.


There are sisters to this working group as you know within the wai which
have and will be putting forth guideline documents which address some of
these issues.

I really want to send a strong wake up call to ua developpers some of
which are working with us so they don't need it that there Is a large
population which is or can be excluded by practices that do not take
certain things into account which these guidelines address well I hope. 
Much of this awareness raising has been done by the release of the web
content accessability guidelines and I am encouraged by this success so
far.
