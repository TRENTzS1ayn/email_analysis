KB:  Ian, I don't use my history list that often, that is I don't go
looking through
my history list for some page that I know I have visited before but when i
do use
my history list I think of it more like a bookmarked page. When I use a
bookmark I "expect"
to be placed at the top of the page. So that is why I raised the distinction
when I was looking at the techniques for this checkpoint. 

This is where some usability data would come in handy so that we'd know
what people were "expecting" when they use a feature. So yes, it probably
is more interesting to have focus restored in all cases. As an physics
teacher once told me (using different terms), if history and bookmark where
the 
same thing they would be spelled the same.

Does anyone else use the history list like I do?
