Many thanks to the Working Group for their review!

This issue has already been raised as issue 140. I will make sure
that your proposals are discussed at our face-to-face meeting.

That's my preferred solution.

Yes. I propose the following editorial clarification:

     For identified but unsupported natural languages,
     allow the user to request notification 
     of language changes.

     Note. The user should be able to request 
            no notification of language changes.

I think that graphically, sufficient notification takes place with
the use of a different font family.

Given that request, perhaps it makes more sense to clarify
your above point about supported languages by adding a note to
2.3 such as:
 
  Note. A user agent may not support all languages. When
        a user agent supports a language identified by a 
        multipart identifier (e.g., "en-us"), the user agent 
        must indicate in its conformance claim which language 
        it claims to support (e.g., "en" alone, "en-us" alone, 
        or both).

Please let me know if the above note make sense and whether it:

  a) Uses the appropriate terminology
  b) Could use a better example than "en" and "en-us".

I propose the following changes to the defn of insertion point:

  1) A viewport has at most one <INS>logical</INS> insertion point.
  2) Add this note to the end of the paragraph:

       Graphical user agents that render bidirectional text
       may render the insertion point at two locations on  
       the screen. Often, the cursor is shown as split into 
       an upper half and a lower half.

I prefer the latter and propose the following parenthetical
addition to the section on selection:

  A viewport has at most one user selection
 (though the selection may be rendered graphically 
  as discontinuous text fragments).

Ok.

The link is already in the comments on the document source.

Yes. Someone else also raised the question of "what do you do
when no standard API exists". A new definition of
"applicability" should cover this.

Ok.

Thank you and the I18N WG very much, Martin, for the 
thorough and thoughtful review.
