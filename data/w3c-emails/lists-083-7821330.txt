Thanks for clarifying that these guidelines are for general purpose user 
agents.  I already agreed in advance that we don't want per-disability 
conformance for that case.

However, I think you need to make this scope explicit in the guidelines.

It would also be good to add an informal comment  that designers of devices 
suitable for specific disabilities may find it useful to look at guidelines 
that address those disabilities.
