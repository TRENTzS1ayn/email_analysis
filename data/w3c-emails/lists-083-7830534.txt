I will take this into account as I edit the abstract for the
next release (today).

It used to appear in the section on conformance but the WG
chose to move it to the glossary. However, many reviewers have
focused on the definition and I strongly agree with your suggestion.
Refer to issue #119

A couple of comments here:

1) Several reviewers have wished that UI checkpoints (and Guidelines
   I suppose) be distinguished from content-related checkpoints.
   The solution we have in mind (identifying classes of checkpoints
   as UI- or content-related within the existing guidelines) may
   contribute to your suggestion that some are close to general
   UI guidelines.

2) Are you suggesting that we emphasize that good UI design  is
   also related to accessibility? 

3) The following statements appear in section 1.1 under
   "Ensure that the user interface is accessible":

          The general topic of user interface accessibility for 
          computer software exceeds the scope of this document. 
          The guidelines do discuss some important user interface 
          topics such as device-independence, configurability, 
          and accessible product documentation. 

   Is this the type of statement you're looking for?

We need a "pocket-depth" attribute, I guess!

Such checkpoints exist so that developers will not assume, for
example, that color alone is sufficient to indicate that 
following a link will cost money. 

I also believe that not all developers would find this as
obvious as you do.

Frames are not deprecated in HTML 4.0. However, a note under
checkpoint 6.2 about support for deprecated features might
be useful. I propose:

   For reasons of backward compatibility, user agents should 
   to continue to support deprecated features of specifications. 
   The current guidelines refer to some deprecated language 
   features that do not necessarily promote accessibility but
   are widely deployed.

Suppose that the user is tabbing through links and the next
link is outside of the current viewport's contents. When
the focus is moved, the viewport should be scrolled so that
the focus is in the viewport afterwards.

Ok, I'll add that to comments on issue 112
http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#112

No, this doesn't include modifiers. The requirement of 10.3 is
not that each functionality be bound to a single key, only
that users be able to activate a functionality with a single
key. For example, the user could select the 20 most important
and configure the user agent for those 20.

We'll discuss this when we discuss issue 134

I'd rather change the section to "Glossary"

You mean the entire title disappears, or just the box?
Note that we provide PS and PDF versions for better printing.

Fixed.

No, I'll fix.

The original spelling is Double-A, not "AA". The WCAG WG
decided not to use "AA" at all for reasons of speech
synthesis, and we adopted their decision.

Ok.

That's my suggestion in issue 136

Yes. Refer to issue 132.

Fixed.

The second period is generated by a script. I'll be more careful.

Fixed.

Is this incorrect? We use "device-independent" and "output device"
so why not "output device-independent"?

Yes.
