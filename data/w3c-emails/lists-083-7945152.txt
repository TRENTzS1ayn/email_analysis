EJThis doesn't seem to catch the API aspect of the checkpoint.
"Through the UI" suggests to me that this is refering to the
user who is able to interact with the UA through it's primary
mode of presentation (e.g. visually in a GUI). Keeping with the
GUI example, this doesn't seem to cover the situation where a
user is utililizing an assistive technology (AT) to translate
this visual information into another presentation modality
(e.g. audio). This type of situation is, I believe, what the
mention of API in the checkpoint was meant to cover. I thinks
it's good for the checkpoint to still clearly cover the jist of
the point being made by mentioning API even if API isn't
specifically mentioned in it (not mentioned, for example,
because developers may not utilize an accessibility API to
enable the alternate interaction modality while still
supporting the programmatic capability that enables an AT to
get at the info so it can be translated).
