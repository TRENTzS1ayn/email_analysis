to circumvent this, it could be possible to skip the product code and
add it in later much as was once possible in wordperfect for dos.  the
product code then could be developped using a user profile being filled
in online or via email link on a web site and there after the same
product id could be used again.  an alternative would be that the
product key could be made up of a sequenc that was derivable from a set
of data such as your birthdate and the purchase date of the product or
your initials and your age etc.
