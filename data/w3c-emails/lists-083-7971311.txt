Sorry,  What I meant was that if they don't use the standard API interface, 
they provide some other API, a way to interact with it, and documentation 
explaining how to do it so that people don't have to reverse engineer it.

This would be in practice a link to their internal interface. I'm assuming 
that most software design has some sort of clean interface even if it 
doesn't follow the operating system standards.

Since their may be valid implementation problems even with this, priority 
would be less than 1.
