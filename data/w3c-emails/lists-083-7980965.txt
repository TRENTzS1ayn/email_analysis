I have sorted the last call issue list by guideline.  
You can view the list at the following URL:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/1999/12/last-call-issues-by-guideline.html

I suggested that we organize the F2F meeting discussions to resolve issues
based on guidelines, since several issues may impact the checkpoints in a
guideline.
