I think the back button is the thing I use most in a browser (after the
ability  to follow a link). If histories were maintained in trees instead of
linearly Lynx allows this by maintaining a history list that you can pop
from, ading to the stack, but it doesn't have a forward function which is a
real nusciance) I would use them a lot more.

  KB:  Ian, I don't use my history list that often, that is I don't go
  looking through
  my history list for some page that I know I have visited before but when i
  do use
  my history list I think of it more like a bookmarked page. When I use a
  bookmark I "expect"
  to be placed at the top of the page. So that is why I raised the distinction
  when I was looking at the techniques for this checkpoint. 
  
  This is where some usability data would come in handy so that we'd know
  what people were "expecting" when they use a feature. So yes, it probably
  is more interesting to have focus restored in all cases. As an physics
  teacher once told me (using different terms), if history and bookmark where
  the 
  same thing they would be spelled the same.
  
  Does anyone else use the history list like I do?
