Hello,

I've published the 6 December Guidelines [1] and Techniques [2]
documents. The list of changes is online [3] (and is pasted
below). 

Most of the changes in this draft of the Guidelines were
editorial (and there were many!). Non-editorial issues
are indicated in the issues list [4] for discussion at the
face-to-face in Austion [5].

Comments welcome,

 - Ian

------------------

  Changes to Guidelines

   A number of editorial changes were made based on Eric Hansen
comments.
   Changes include:
     * New Abstract text. More about scope of Guidelines.
     * New Introduction structure. Also, new text in 1.1 Benefits to
       Accessibility to distinguish accessibility issues from design
       benefits.
     * Guideline titles shortened per Gregg Vanderheiden suggestion.
       Guideline subheads edited to make up for shorter titles.
     * Guidelines now identify more clearly which checkpoints address
       user interface accessibility and which address content
       accessibility. This has resulted in some checkpoint renumbering
       (old-to-new-number map not provided yet).
     * Added more information about the non-normative nature of the
       Techniques in the Techniques Document.
     * Edits to Guideline 1 rationale.
     * Edited Guideline 2 subhead and rationale.
     * New I18N related notes after checkpoint 2.2.
     * Checkpoint 2.9 text on natural language change notification
       clarified.
     * The "applicability" section is now more visible under 1.7
       Conformance. The term "native" has been subsumed by the
       applicability section.
     * Added more notes about which checkpoints are special cases of
       other checkpoints.(e.g., 5.4 is special case of 5.3).
     * Edited Guideline 3 rationale.
     * To checkpoint 4.11, added note that UA may not be able to control
       playback rate for all formats.
     * Fixed bug in 4.17 checkpoint text.
     * Added note to checkpoint 5.4 about availability of input config
       through APIs.
     * Edits Guideline 7 rationale.
     * Checkpoints 7.6 and 7.7 have new notes about system conventions
       for focus and selection.
     * Edits Guideline 8 rationale.
     * Moved note after 11.3 to Guideline 11 rationale. Also, some edits
       to Guideline 11 rationale.
     * New clarifying note in 11.4
     * Term "alternative content" has been replaced by "alternative
       equivalent". "Alternative text" has been replaced by "text
       equivalent". The glossary defines both.
     * Replaced "motor" by "disability" except one occurrence.
     * Replaced "impairment" by "disability".
     * "Continuous equivalent" has been replaced by the more specific
       captions + auditory description.
     * Added abbreviation expansions to key terms.
     * "Braille" instead of (small "b") "braille".
     * "closed captions" to "captions" with clarification in definition.
     * Some glossary structure clarification. In the glossary, modified
       definitions of Assistive Technology, Natural Language, Content,
       Equivalent, Text Transcript, Auditory Description, Captions, User
       Styles, Author Styles, selection, focus, point of regard, and
       insertion point.
     * New references: [SPEAK2WRITE], [CHARMOD], [BRAILLEFORMATS]
     * Removed some references to DOM2 event model since may be for
DOM3.
       Need more info.

  Changes to Techniques

     * Improved reference style and links directly to the pertinent
parts
       of other specs.
     * Created linear version of NN keymap table. Added an empty line to
       show no key access to documentation.
     * Added a lot of techniques!
