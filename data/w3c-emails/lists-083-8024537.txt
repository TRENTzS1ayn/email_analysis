Many thanks for your quick and precise reply!

This very much depends on the languages in question. There
is usually no need at all to change fonts e.g. from English
to French text; quite to the contrary, changing fonts can be
visually very confusing. This very much depends on the document
at hand, for example most dictionaries use different fonts for
different languages; other texts may use conventions anyway
used for quotes if they quote foreign language text. This has
to stay under the control of the author (or of course the user)
and should not be done automaticaly by an aplication.

Of course if the languages use different scripts, it is often
necessary to use different fonts to cover these scripts, and
in this case, a change should happen automatically, rather than
to not render some characters that are not covered by a font.

A boundary case is the distinction between e.g. Japanese and
Chinese variants of ideographs. Different default fonts should
be used by the application for pages in Japanese and in Chinese,
and probably also down to the level of a paragraph or so, but
depending on the type of document, one wouldn't want to mix
fonts inline as long as the characters are covered in one font.

Sorry, I didn't mean the question of tags and subtags (which
indeed is a good question), but the question of tag (e.g. 'en')
vs. language name (e.g. 'English'). Does 'identified' mean that
the UA knows that 'en' means 'English', or does it only mean
that the UA saw a tag with some value that happened to be 'en'.

Probably overall what should happen is some of the following:

- If the UA knows how to deal with English, deal with it.
- If the UA knows that 'en' is English, but nothing more,
  tell the user that some English text is comming (and
  then spell it out, or whatever else is the fallback mode)
- If the UA sees 'en' without knowing what it is, say
  something like 'unknown language', then spell the tag,
  then the content.

But I'm not sure how much that makes sense in view of
accessability.


As for tags/subtags, if fully spelt out, the following rules
should apply (adapted from SMIL10, which took this from HTTP11;
probably better put this into the techniques document than into
the Guidelines):

- The UA should treat as a known language, and apply the rendering
  rules it knows for this language, if and only if: 
  
    the tag for one of the languages it knows exactly equals
    the tag for the language in the document, or the tag for one
    of the languages it knows exactly equals a prefix of the tag
    for the language in the document such that the first tag character
    following the prefix is "-".

  Otherwise, the UA should treat the language as  unknown.

  Note: This use of a prefix matching rule does not imply that
        language tags are assigned to languages in such a way
        that it is always true that if a user understands a
        language with a certain tag, then this user will also
        understand all languages with tags for which this tag
        is a prefix. The prefix rule simply allows the use of
        prefix tags if this is the case.

See http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-smil/#switch for further details.

Some quotes from RFC 1766:

The language tag is composed of 1 or more parts:
A primary language tag and a (possibly empty) series of subtags.

You should also mention that it may consist of logically
disconnected fragments. Besides bidi, that's possible
sometimes if you press the shift key.
