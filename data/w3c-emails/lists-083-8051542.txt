Good idea, but not my point.

Well, in some way yes, of course. But not exactly my point.

I'm looking for two things:

- A statement that some of this stuff is close to, or related
  to, general guidelines for user interface design (which is
  more general than the (still general) topic of user interface
  accessibility).

- Removal, or rewording, in cases where the accessibility
  guideline coincides with general user interface guidelines,
  for example like the next point, or things like 'state
  (e.g. of input devices) should always be 'visible'. That
  the state should always be visible is something very basic,
  and it might sourd as if e.g. Mac and Windows users (as
  opposed to Unix or DOS command users) all have some
  disability if you state that so generally.

I see. In that case please change the wording to say so.

Do you care if a developer provides a product that won't
tell you whether you are charged for following a link or not?
I guess you do. But is this an accessibility issue, if the
developer decides to not show this info at all? I very
clearly think no. He may not sell the product, but it
should still conform to the guidelines, because it in
no way disadvantages people with disabilities.

They are not deprecated in HTML 4.0, but there is general
agreement that they are not a good idea, for various reasons
(URI problems, accessibility problems,...). I mean deprecated
in this sense, probably there is a better word for it.

I think the main reason is not backwards compatibility, but
the amount of contents that still doesn't conform to e.g.
the content authoring guidelines. And the note should be
at the beginning of the document.

to continue -> continue

Got it. Can you please make sure that the doc says that?

So the requirement is that the user must be able to configure
shortcuts, and in particular must be able to map some of  them
to single keys (i.e. one key without any modifier).
So just change the text to make this clear.

The entire title. Some of the box is still visible.

That should be enough. missed them, sorry.

I understand that. The main reason I'm a bit worried is
that while in the US, everybody might easily immagine
AA when reading Double-A, I'm not sure people all over
the world will make this association as quickly. Mostly,
they just have seen AAA and AA, and read it according
to local conventions.

No space between two words is the stronges binding. A hyphen
is the next looser binding. A space is even looser.
In 'output device independent', the binding is stronger
between output and device than between device and independent,
which is not matched by using a space for the former and a hyphen
for the later. I suggest using something like 'independent of'.

Here we go:


Definitions, active element: with associated scripts ... associated
     repetition, remove one 'associated'.

Assistive technologies:
     In the area of Web Accessibility, common
              software-based assistive technologies include assistive
              technologies, which rely on other user agents for input
              and/or output. These include:
    rewrite:
     In the area of Web Accessibility, common
              software-based assistive technologies include
              technologies that rely on other user agents for input
              and/or output, in particular:

Continuous equivalent track:
  captions are rendered by being superimposed: on TV, of course they
  are superimposed, but on a PC, there is no need to superimpose
  them, usually there is enough space elsewhere.


Control:   Within the limits offered by the operating system or the
           user agent.  I suggest you add hardware limits here.


Documents,...: haveattributes: space missing
               is that which: improve wording.

Events: 'Note.': wouldn't 'Note:' look better?
    this document will only refer to: change future tense to present.

Focus: generally presented (e.g. highlighted) in a way that makes it
   stand out: highlighted is already defined to make things stand
   out, in a very general way, so you can just say 'The current focus
   is usually highlighted.'.

Properties: Should 'ascribed' be changed to 'ascribed to'? Not sure.
     property'sdefault: Space missing.

User Agent-initiated: space/hyphen problem again.

Views,...: a window, frame, a piece:  frame -> a frame
    The view is how -> The view corresponds to how, the view defines how,...
    user'spoint of regard: space missing.



That's it.  Regards,   Martin.
