A tool that doesn't tell you about a fee link at all is a bad too.
A tool that tells some users but not users with disabilities
is an inaccessible tool.

You can use frames and make them accessible. I don't think
that the WCAG says that frames are inaccessible (though
they may not be a good idea). Authors need to make them
accessible by providing alternatives that don't rely
on 2-dimensional layout, etc. And user agents needs to give
access to frames in a serial manner for those without
graphical displays.

Argh. I'll talk to the Webmaster about this.

I'll look into this.

I'll incorporate your editorial comments below into the next
draft.
