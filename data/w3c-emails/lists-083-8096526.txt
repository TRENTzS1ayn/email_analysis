Is there a reason that checkpoint 3.4 begins with "When the user agent
renders audio natively" while none of the other checkpoints on turning
media on and off come with that qualifying phrase?

3.4 When the user agent renders audio natively, allow the user to turn on and off rendering of audio.

compare to 
3.2 Allow the user to turn on and off rendering of background audio.
and
3.3 Allow the user to turn on and off rendering of video.
