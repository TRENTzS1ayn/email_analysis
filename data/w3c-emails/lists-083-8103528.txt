Here is a review of techniques in GL3, focusing on multimedia. Using the
document Techniques for User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0
W3C Working Draft 6 December 1999
http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-WAI-USERAGENT-TECHS-19991206

3.2 Allow the user to turn on and off rendering of background audio. [Priority 1] 
Techniques:
 Users sometimes specify background sounds with the "bgsound" attribute.
 Note. This attribute is not part of HTML 4.0 [HTML40]. 

MR: Should this item say "Web page authors sometimes specify"?

3.6 Techniques:
Allow the user to turn off animated or blinking text through the user
 interface (e.g., by hitting the ESCAPE key to stop animations). Render
a still image in its place.x 

MR: trailing x is a typo?

3.8 Allow the user to turn on and off rendering of images. [Priority 3] 
Techniques:
Refer to techniques for checkpoint 3.1. 

MR: Propose adding this:
Provide a simple command that allows users to toggle on and off the
rendering of images on a page. This will be useful to users who wish
to switch between viewing the images and the corresponding alt text tags.

Techniques for 3.9 (automatic forwarding) and 3.10 (automatic refresh)
are mixed together in the 3.9 section.


That's all for GL 3.
