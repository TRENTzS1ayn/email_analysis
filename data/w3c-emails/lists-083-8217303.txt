Ian,

I think that the techniques related to these checkpoints should use the
concept of "paging" through a book, to identify the region of relevant
information.  This analogy gives an idea of what a "small increment" is.  We
are not talking about frame by frame movement, but in blocks that are
seconds to minutes long.

Hello,

Per my action item from today's teleconf (minutes [1]), here
is a proposal based on comments initially from Scott Luebking [2]:

  Checkpoint 1)
       Allow the user to advance and rewind in small increments
       audio, video, and animations. [Priority 2]

  Checkpoint 2)
       Allow the user to configure the increments of the previous
       checkpoint [Priority 3]
