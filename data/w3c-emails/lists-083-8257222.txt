Gregg and Jutta, 

I would like to propose a join telecon to resolve terminology issues
between the three guidelines related to multi-media.  I particular a issue
raised about terminolgy in last call for UA:

LC#138: "Synchronized equivalent" v. "Continuous Equivalent"/ Proposed
split of 2.5 
http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#138 


Would it be possible to do this on 15 December at 12:00 EST?
This is the normal UA telecon time.
