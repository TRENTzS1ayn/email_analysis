Hi
New thought the only way have the full list in a drop-down box shown as on page
http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/index.html
under the heading "Browse the Gallery" is to click it & key through 1 item
at a time (which is a bit easier now that it doesn't do auto get, at my
request. NASA Web site Officials are extremely responsible to visitor ideas
about making their sites' very usability for folks with disabilities.) Opera
gets to the box quick via the Tab key then it gets slow picking items a
keystroke to show the whole list would help. A 2 or 3 key command would do
as it isn't used as much as navigation keys. Thanks
Regards,
Bryan
