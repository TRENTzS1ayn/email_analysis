Hello,

A proposed agenda [1] for the meeting in Austin Thursday and
Friday is online (and included as text below). 

The meeting page [2] has bus schedule information from the 
hotel to IBM, to restaurants, etc.

Rich has told me that we should have equipment set up
to allow people call us (through an 800 number) during
the meeting. We'll post details about what number to 
call as soon as we have that information.

Talk to you soon,

 - Ian
