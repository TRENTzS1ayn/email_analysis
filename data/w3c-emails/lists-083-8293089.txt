     * [4]Austin meeting page
     * [5]Issues list
     * [6]6 December Guidelines

  Proposed process for resolving issues

   Since we received a number of [7]issues during last call, the Chair
   proposes the following process for resolving them during the meeting:

      [7] http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html

     Each issue will be given 10 minutes for discussion and resolution.
     If the issue has not been resolved after 10 minutes, the group by
     consensus allocate an additional 5 minutes for discussion if they
     feel the additional time will lead to resolution. If the issue is
     still not resolved, it will remain on the table until the Friday
     afternoon time block reserved for resolving remaining open issues.
     Working group members interested in the issue will be solicitied to
     develop proposals to help resolve the issues on Friday afternoon.
