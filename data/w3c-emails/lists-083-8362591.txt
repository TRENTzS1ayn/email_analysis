The best reason for product installation being P-1 is that the person with
the disability is likely 1 who best understands (maybe the only 1 who
understands, lets just say each PC is unique [grin]) the she runs daily.
Choices made during installation can disturb other programs which are more
likely to be avoided if the main user does a careful install. It is another
way for vendors decrease the amount of support required & not inconvenience
users. Importantly install is an infrequent operation so usability isn't too
much of a factor, a difficult layout very seldom used is tolerable, if
unwelcomed.
