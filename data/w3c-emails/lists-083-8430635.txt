Hi Rich,

I agree with you. 

It may just have been that my use of some terminology
unintendedly deviated from custom usage or your usage.

My use of the term "off-screen model" was meant to refer
only an (apparently idealized) situation where there is 
a single ("reference") off-screen model or architecture
per operating system, such that the hypothetical minimum-
functionality "reference" screen reader could use a subset
of that OSM to implement its functions. When this OSM is 
available (e.g., provided by the operating system vendor),
there would be no necessity to "reverse engineer" an OSM
architecture in order to implement the basic screen reading
functions. With reverse engineered OSM's for each user agent,
one would indeed expect many more compatibility problems.

Even with that single reference OSM, the user agent or
screen reader developer could of course still decide to
add "reverse engineering" from displayed screen content 
to add more-than-basic functionality (for instance to do
"something useful" with textures as rendered by advanced
3D graphics cards), but that would then be their problem
or opportunity to stand out from the crowd of UA's that
already conform at least to the basic "reference" screen 
reader functionality for basic accessibility.

Thus, I personally strongly support you where you say

I wished there were also a platform independent video 
capture architecture and technology. I once hoped that
Java would soon be offering something like that, but at
the time I could no longer afford to wait for that to 
happen, if at all, and therefore I opted for a platform
dependent solution - for the time being.

Best wishes,

Peter Meijer
