Ian,
Thanks for your response.  You're right that the resume of aborted downloads is a usability not 
accessibility feature.  I think the downloading of linked pages is accessibility related because it 
enables one to read web pages with whatever viewing program is most accessible and 
efficient for the user, which often is not the web browser itself.  I did not mean a recursive 
download of linked pages, just downloading those linked to the currently loaded web page.

Regards,
Jamal
