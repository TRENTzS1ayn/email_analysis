completing my task proposal for merger of 3.9 and 3.10

in current draft
3.9 Allow the user to turn on and off author-specified forwards that occur
after a time delay and without user intervention. [Priority 3]
For example, when forwarding has been turned off, offer a static link to the
target.

3.10 Allow the user to turn on and off automatic content refresh. [Priority
3]
For example, when turned off, indicate to the user that content needs
refreshing and allow the user to do so through the user interface.


**proposal

3.9 Allow the user to set a minimum rate for author specified forwards
and/or refreshes that occur after a time delay and without user information.

add techniques
1. Provide a UI settings feature to allow the user to configure the minimum
rate for author specified forward and/or refresh rates. (set increment times
in seconds)
2. provide current information about refresh rate metadata from the DOM
3. allow user to configure notification that a page has a refresh rate or a
forward
