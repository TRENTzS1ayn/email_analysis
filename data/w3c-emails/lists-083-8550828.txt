Scot, This seems to work for me although I am not comprehending at the
appropriate level.  The question we need to address as well though is
improper mark up.  you can mark up something inaccessably and it will
still fly graphically.  We are not going to adress this here and I agree
with that decision but there is plenty of bad mark up out there.

I need something like this.
1> get to the table<s> after finding that thay are being rendered.
2> move through the bable the way the eye can.  reading each cell,
reading each row, reading each column and keeping a reference all the
while.  if a table is composed of several tables, then that neds to be
clearly available as information.

I am sure I haven't stated all that I need but it would at least be a
beginning.  I'd like to be able to address any place from any where by
asking for the appropriate point on the matrix.  There are lots of
places where doing this makes sense.
Thanks!
