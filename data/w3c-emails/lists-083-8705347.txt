After reading this article, I think it would be useful to add the term
"disability" into the glossaries of the WCAG, ATAG, and UAAG.  The
definition would include a link to link to either or both the Institute of
Medicine (IOM) model for defining disability and the World Health
Organization (WHO) model.  I searched and found URLs for the article's
references:

Institute of Medicine, Disability in America: Toward A National Agenda for
Prevention, A.M. Pope and A.R. Tarlov (eds.) (Washington, DC: National
Academy Press, 1991) http://www.nap.edu/books/0309043786/html/

World Health Organization, International Classification of Impairments,
Disabilities, and Handicaps (Geneva, Switzerland: World Health
Organization, 1980). http://www.who.int/whosis/icidh/icidh.html
