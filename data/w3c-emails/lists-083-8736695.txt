Madeleine, Marja, Eric ,Ian,
The terminology associated with multi-media and alternative information has
been discussed in the UA working group in response to an issue raised by Eric
Hansen:

http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#138

I have brought the issue to the CG group to try to coordinate with WC and AT. 
The CG group suggested to send a proposal summarizing the issue, the potential
impact on current and future documents, and a proposed resolution to the UA and
GL lists for consensus.  Are any of you willing to work individually or as a
group to produce this information?

Plese let me know either way.

Thanks,
Jon
