Some additional ideas for the record:

* My browser doesn't support Java. How does that affect
  conformance? ("applicability" clause).

* Do I have to implement all of the Techniques?
  (No, none of them in fact. They are only suggestions
   and samples)

* Which browsers conform?  (Good question!)

* Does conformance mean that a browser is accessible
  on its own? (The goal of the guidelines is to
  make general purpose UAs accessible. However, many
  users require additional software -- assistive
  technologies -- to furnish some services. The 
  Guidelines have been designed to ensure communication
  between user agents.)
