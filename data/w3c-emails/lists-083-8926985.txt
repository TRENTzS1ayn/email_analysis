All:

Due to the increasingly widespread use of computers in the home,
high-speed
internet access and voluminous marketing and promotion of the subject,
e-commerce is being more widely used this holiday season than ever
before.
And due to recent advances in JAWS for Windows Screen Reader Software,
use
of these systems is more accessible to people who are blind and visually
impaired than at any time in the past.

Henter-Joyce Chief Technical Officer Glen Gordon will appear on a
special
segment of CNN Financial Network's "Digital Jam," Tuesday, December 21
to
demonstrate this new technology and the benefits it offers to blind and
visually impaired web surfers.

Be sure to tune in from 7:30-8:30 Eastern Time (U.S.) to catch a
demonstration of the newest features and functions of the world's most
powerful screen reader live on the web and live on CNN Financial
Network's
"Digital Jam."

As always, thank you for your time and consideration.

Regards,

Wilson Craig
