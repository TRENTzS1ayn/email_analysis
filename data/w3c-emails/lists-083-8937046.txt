This is discussed at the face-to-face meeting (issue 129). 
The WG resolved to leave the second part as part of 10.3.

This would be a technique for checkpoint 7.4:
"Allow the user to navigate all active elements."

The note after this checkpoint reads:

  <QUOTE>
  Navigation mechanisms may range from sequential 
  (e.g., serial navigation by tabbing) ...
  </QUOTE>

The techniques document should say that the default
order may vary and depends the natural language of the document.

Two checkpoints relate to this:

       8.1 Provide a mechanism for highlighting and identifying
          (through a standard interface where available) the 
          current viewport, selection, and focus. [Priority 1] 

       9.2 Ensure that when the selection or focus changes,
           it is in the viewport after the change. [Priority 2]

Checkpoint 8.1 covers both cases.

Can you be more specific about that request? Here's a list of 
current supporting materials available from the home page:

    1) Guidelines
    2) Techniques
    3) Impact matrix (being updated)
       http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/NOTE-UAGL-impact-matrix-19990903
    4) Evaluations of different UAs and the guidelines
       (This will serve to improve the guidelines and show
        implementation status of checkpoints)
    5) Link to Alternative Browser page (EO)
       http://www.w3.org/WAI/References/Browsing
    6) Link to UA Browser Support page

Yes, we're waiting for it!

That is a good idea. Added as issue 181

Proposed change:

   The keystroke-only command protocol of the user interface 
   should be tested to ensure usability.
