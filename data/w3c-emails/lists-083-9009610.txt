Hi,
I have a concern about the note following Checkpoint 2.1
(Taken from the 20 December working draft):

2.1 Ensure that the user has access to all content, including
alternative equivalents for content. [Priority 1] 
Note. Although it is not a requirement that alternative equivalents be available
at the same time as primary content, some users may benefit from simultaneous
access. For instance, users with low vision may want to view images (even
imperfectly) but require a text equivalent for the image; the text may be
rendered with a large font or as speech. 

I have been assuming that this checkpoint is the umbrella requiring UAs
to provide access to multimedia alternative equivalents and that the
later checkpoint 2.6 that requires synchronizing captions or auditory
description is a special case of this. Since the note on 2.1 explicitly
says that it is not a requirement to render at the same time, but 2.6
says that some tracks must be rendered synchronously, perhaps the note
for 2.1 should say it is not a requirement for all alternative equivalents
to be available at the same time as primary content, but see Checkpoint 2.6
for cases where that is required.
