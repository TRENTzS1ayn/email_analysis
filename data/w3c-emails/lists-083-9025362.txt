I believe this is a typo. In the last paragraph of the revised rationale for GL 3 is the sentence:
A user agent must provide on/off control even when it hands off content (e.g., a sound file) to the operating system or a helper application for rendering; the user is aware of the content type and thus can choose not to render it.

I think we meant to say that the user agent is aware of the content type and thus can choose not to render it, not the user.
