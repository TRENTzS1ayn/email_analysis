Mickey,
There is a whole section on table access in the techniques document:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-WAI-USERAGENT-TECHS-19991220/#table-techniques

There current some examples of table access in the techniques document.  If
you have additional examples send them to the list for inclusion in the
techniques document.

Jon
