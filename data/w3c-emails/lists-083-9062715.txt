Ian --
For a review of table navigation using speech see the
section on browsing two dimensional structures in the book 
Auditory User Interfaces --toward the speaking computer --
as part of writing that section I implemented a complete
table UI on top of an idealized table representation to
separate  out 
the two problems 
a) obtaining the structure 
b) what can I do if have the structure 

--too often the UI for what can be done is motivated by the
  structure that is available which feels and smells counter
  productive because the available representation tends to
  box the UI inside a tiny box

-- 
Best Regards,
--raman
