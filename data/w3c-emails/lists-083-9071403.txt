Hi, Ian

In terms of relative movement, I think the techniques should allow for
simultaneous row and column relative movement, e.g. down 7 rows left 3
columns.

The reason I brought up the issue of multiple keystrokes is to allow
specifying arbitrary rows and columns, e.g. row 33 column 11.  This type
type of specification cannot be done in a single keystroke.  Some
browsers don't allow for direct row, column position because the
designers didn't plan for actions requiring more than one keystroke.

Mixed navigation is like row 12 and right 5 columns.  It is a
combination of a direct movement and a relative action.

In terms of span cell movement, you might have missed my point.  If a
row has a single cell, a span cell of 3 columns and a single cell and
the row below it has 5 cells and if the user who is in the span cell
decides to go down one row, which cell of the 5 in that row  does he end
up in?


I haven't read Raman's book on auditory interfaces, but I strongly
suspect we've come up with very similar techniques of table navigation.
He's calling his a "theoretical" table and I'm calling mine a
"normalized" table.

Looking at your emacs example, suppose that you are in position N in
line L.  Line L+1, which is shorter than line L , has M positions.  If
you go down from position N in line L, you end up at M in line L+1.  Now
suppose that line L+2 has more than N positions.  What is the deirable
behavior if you go down another line?  Would you want to end up at M or
N in line L+2?  In similar navigation down a table, you probably want to
end up in the equivalent of N.
