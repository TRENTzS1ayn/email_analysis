> Dear web gurus -- 
> 
> I'm writing to ask a favor. All of you have played a leading role in
> helping developers understand the ins and outs of standards-based and
> cross-browser development and working around the bugs of existing
> browsers. To help Navigator 5 be as standards-compliant and bug-free
> as possible (thus making life easier for developers everywhere), would
> you please consider adding a prominent link on your own technology
> info site's home page to the Gecko BugAThon at
> http://www.mozilla.org/newlayout/bugathon.html ? 
> 
> Many people want to help deliver the first browser with full support
> for HTML 4.0, CSS1, DOM1, and XML but think only C++ engineers can 
> help. They don't realize that anyone who knows HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 
> and or the W3C DOM can make a contribution *just as valuable* as 
> C++ engineers by helping simplify bug reports down to a test case. 
> Every minute a net volunteer contributes simplifying bug reports down
> to test cases is a minute one of the Gecko team engineers can spend on
> *fixing* bugs instead of simplifying the bug reports themselves. The
> minutes convert one-to-one into C++ development and bugfixing time, so
> someone who knows just a little HTML, CSS, or JavaScript and is
> willing to help can make a huge difference! 
> 
> By putting a link to the BugAThon on your site, you'll make web
> developers everywhere realize that they can contribute a little time
> now to help make Navigator 5 more standards-compliant and bug free,
> thus saving all of us time later that otherwise would have been spent
> working around bugs that were overlooked. Please consider something
> like the following: 
> 
> "Tired of browser bugs and lack of standards support? Let's get one 
> browser right! You can make a difference. Join the Gecko BugAThon!" 
> 
> Thanks for your help in raising awareness of the chance to get
> involved while it can still make a difference. As Eric Raymond says,
> "Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow," and by recruiting more
> eyeballs, we can help deliver a robust, standards-compliant, free, and
> open source browser that will benefit web and browser developers and
> users everywhere.

> All the best,
