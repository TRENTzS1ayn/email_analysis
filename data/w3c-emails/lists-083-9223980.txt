Hi Neal,

First of all, the UA Guidelines require (checkpoint 2.1
in the 20 December draft [0])
that the user have access to all content, 
including all alt and title text. Beyond
that requirement, there are techniques for making this
information available. From the 20 December Techniques [1]:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Users should be able to:
        Configure what information about links they wish presented to
them. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

There is also information about providing alternative informtion
(alt, title, etc.). Please review this section of the Techniques
document - we welcome your comments and suggestions.
