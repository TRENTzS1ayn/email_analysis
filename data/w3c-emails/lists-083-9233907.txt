(Mark's message of 16 December
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999OctDec/0710.html)

I guess the question had several parts to it (as I understood it):

 - How do users write sound schemes in Windows?
 - How do these interact with SoundSentry and ShowSounds?
 - Where can developers find information about making use
   of these features?

Yes, very much so. Questions:

 - Did the DOM meet your needs? If not, what is missing?
 - Did you find adequate information at the W3C site (or elsewhere)
   to build the program?
 - Is there a demo online?
 - What's the URI for more information about the scripts/EXEs/DLLs?
   (Can we include the Techniques Document?)

Thanks Mark!
