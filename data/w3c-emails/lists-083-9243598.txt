Rich,

Even assuming that the AT must provide support for tables, the user agent
must provide sufficient information, through some sort of standard API, to
allow the AT to navigate tables.  If the AT is stuck with reading the table
off the screen or off-screen model, we have all of the current problems with
tables.

I think that, at a minimum, the AT must be able to ask for the contents of
the current cell, the headers for the current cell, and to move a Point of
Regard or some other locator to the cell to the left or right, and the cell
above and below.

If this is too great a burden for the UA to support, how will it be any
easier for the AT to do?

User agents should not be considered with table navigation because it is an
unwarranted burden on them. This should be left up to the assistive
technology. The example mentioned below does not deal with an embedded
table or cells spanning multiple columns. The task is very complex.
Furthermore, your table navigation mechansim may need to change for
different types of devices.

Yes.

I'll add relative "direct" navigation to the techniques.

I'm not sure if I agree with that. I think the number of keystrokes
is separate from the functionalities you describe.

What is "mixed navigation"?

To the row below..

Yes, I think it would be disorienting to move from row N down one row
and find yourself in row N + 20. Instead, you might have to have
to have your position adjusted left or right. Cells (in the HTML model)
start in the row / column position where they are specified. They may
extend into the row or column (left or right depending on the table
direction).
In the case you describe above, I'd move the focus down one row
into the cell that happens to span that row.

That's how emacs seems to work when I move the cursor up and down
among lines of text of differing lengths (although I'm sure
this is configurable): If horizontal position N exists in line L + 1,
move the curor from L(N) to L+1(N). If not, move it from L(N) to
L+1(end-of-line).
