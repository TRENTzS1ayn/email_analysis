|    1.IJ: Review techniques for topic 3.2

     Done. No comments for now. I intend to do a comprehensive review of
     the Techniques Document and will explore 3.2 in more depth at that
time.

|    2.IJ: Add clarifying Note to rationale that UAs can turn off
control of
|          content even if it passes content off for rendering.

     Done. Refer to Guideline 3 rationale of 20 December 1999 UAGL.

|    3.IJ: Send proposal to list related to checkpoint for incremental
|          positioning control in multi-media

     Done. My original proposal was sent 7 December.
     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999OctDec/0655.html

     At the face to face, we decided to make incremental a technique  
     (issue 135).
     http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#135

     In the 20 December 1999 UAGL, checkpoint 4.6 includes generic
forward
     and reverse. Techniques included in 20 December Techniques
document.

|    4.IJ: Draft a statement for time of publication, there is no
|          authoritative body that validates claims of conformance

     Pending. Refer to action 7 below. 

|    5.IJ: Refer to ATAG definition of "applicability" and propose to
list.

     Cancelled. Applicability not used in ATAG.

|    6.IJ: Repropose simpler Checkpoint for 1.1

     Done.
     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999OctDec/0757.html

|    7.IJ: Repropose the delivery mechanism of conformance statement to
allow
|          documentation as an option

     Pending. Sent to WAI Team; will make public shortly.

|    8.IJ: Propose new checkpoint by merging 7.3 and 7.7 to the list

     Done. Refer to checkpoint 7.6 of 20 December 1999 UAGL.

|    9.IJ: Propose a technique for using XSL to transform content

     TODO.

|   10.IJ: Write Bryan Campbell/H?kon Lie for clarification and David
Clark,
|          Mark Novak (cc the list).

     Done. I believe this refers to meaning of "single key" access. Here
     are Bryan's comments
