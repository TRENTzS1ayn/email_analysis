Hi,

Actually, the methodology does handle spanned cells.  The nested table
navigation is dependent on how nested tables are represented which is why
I didn't include it.  I believe that the level of abstraction is probably
great enough to allow for different types.

The table navigation is probably better left to the assistive technology
developers.  I guess one question is how much of a browser will
access technology need to become?
