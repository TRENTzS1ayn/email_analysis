aloha, y'all!

i was wondering if either ian or jon could confirm that the tuesday 
face2face session at RFB&D ends at 2:30pm, as jon has stated on numerous 
occasions during teleconferences...

i attempted to confirm whether or not the 11 april session will end at 
2:30pm by checking the the face2face information page, located at:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2000/04/ua-meeting-rfbd.html

but in the unordered list entitled "Meeting Information" that appears at 
the top of the page (immediately following the level 1 header) the fourth 
list item simply lists the duration of each day's session as 9am to 5:30pm...

nowhere on the page could i find mention that the tuesday session would end 
at 2:30pm, so i am requesting confirmation that this is, indeed, the case...

thanks,
gregory.
