Hi WG,

I'm going to be on the road tomorrow, so I won't have
completed my action items from today's meeting [1]
until Friday night or Saturday.

Action 1: Propose definitions for content-related terms to list
Action 2: Propose 2.1 based on these definitions and other
          points of consensus from the meeting. 
 
 [I don't think that Action 2 is listed in the raw minutes [1].]

 - Ian
