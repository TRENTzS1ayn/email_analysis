I proposed that issue WD#188: "Add definition of disability?" is similar to
the conformance statement.  If a definition of disability is developed by
WAI it will be a shared document between all guidelines and we only need to
link to it when it becomes available.  I don't think we need to develop a
user agent definition of disability.
