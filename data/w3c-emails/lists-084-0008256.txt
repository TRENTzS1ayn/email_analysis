I recommend that checkpoint 10.8 "Allow the user to configure the
arrangement of graphical user agent user interface controls." remain at
Priority 3.  It is not that I don't think it is important, but we have not
identified the core requirements that are definitely priority 2 items.
This is reflected in the 13 January telecon where there were groups of
people who though the checkpoint was a priority 2, some who though it was
priority 3 and others who were not sure which priority.  Denis Anson's
request to Alan Cantor produced an eloquent response on the need for
configuration, but no specific recommendations that could be formed into
checkpoint requirements.  So until there is a specific proposal on core
requirements at a priority level 2 I suggest that we resolve to leave this
at priority 3 so the group can move on to other issues.    Minority opinons
can be attached to the checkpoint for review during Candidate
Recommendation, Proposed Recommendation and by the W3C Director.

Thanks,
Jon
