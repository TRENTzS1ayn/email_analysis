I propose that WD#178 "In 10.1 and 10.3 what does communicate through an
API mean" that the API language be dropped from the checkpoints for two
reasons:

1. If the user interface is not configurable static documentation will
satisfy the checkpoint and the accessibility of documentation is covered
under 11.1

2. If the user agent is configurable, the current keyboard bindings would
need to be rendered through some type of user interface controls.  The use
of accessible controls is covered under checkpoint 5.2
