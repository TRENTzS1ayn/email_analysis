Gregory and David,
I propose that we have captured the essence of the problem stated in issue
WD#177 related to the focus and notification issues related to user agent
spawned windows in checkpoint 4.15 Allow the user to control user agent
initiated spawned viewports. [Priority 2].   I suggest that if you support this
view that the action item work Gregory is doing related to describing the
problem and possible solutions should be placed in the techniques document.

What do you think?

Jon
