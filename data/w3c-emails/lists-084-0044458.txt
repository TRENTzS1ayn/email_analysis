I propose that we discuss this in the techniques document related to this
checkpoint.  Probably the easiest thing to do is to state programming
examples on major plateforms that would be acceptable.

Some technique issues:
1. In process versus out of process access
2. Microsoft COM technologies
3. COBRA technologies
4. Mac???
5. UNIX???

I think we will need some programming specialists to help fill out this
list.  Maybe Rich Schwerdtfeger and Mark Novak could help out and maybe
talking to some of the people in the Amaya team.
