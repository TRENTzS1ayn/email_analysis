Working Group,
Ian and I have sent a number of proposals to the list to help stimulate
discussion of the open issues on the list and to help try to resolve
outstanding issues faster.  Please review and comment on the proposals.  If
there is some consensus on the list we can resolve the issues quickly
during the telecons and use the majority of the telecon time to discuss
more difficult to resolve issues.

Thanks again to all the extra effort people are putting in this month to
help move the document forward.  Special thanks to Ian for all the work he
is putting into preparing and revising documents for candidate recommentation.

Jon
