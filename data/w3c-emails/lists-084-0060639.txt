1. Define "claim" as it is ?or is it a set of claims are? applied from a 
particular guideline as meeting the applicable checkpoints for that level:
     A    (all priority 1 checkpoints),
     AA   (all priority 1 and priority 2),
     AAA  (all checkpoints, priority 1, priority 2, and priority 3)

All checkpoints at a priority level are applicable unless that functionality
is explicitly inappropriate for the hardware/software and the claimed level.

3. Details of a claim

It is not clear that only one claim applies to a particular UA.
If many claims are required, as I understood it above (1 claim per
applicable checkpoint), then much of the details of each claim
are shareable. Why must they be repeated?
