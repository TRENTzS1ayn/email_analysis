I'd like to see what Ian comes up with for 1.5 which I know is about
redundancy, but this important implication must not be missed and also
I'd like possibly to see checkpoint 4.15 have wording that includes
system messages.  I don't see anything here that would indicate that
system messages are covered because they may not have anything to do
with "view port" unless specifically stated in the checkpoint.

This is why when the issue of system messages came up gregory and I
felt that it was important to note.  I'll tell it this way.  I think
of a view port change as when you are following a link or have
submitted a form and something happens.  In the case of system
messages such as a security question or download complete or do you
want to install this now message comes up, this is done possibly after
a delay and you are doing something else during the time before it
happens.  As long as it is well documented and developpers can
understand that system messages that cause or currently cause a change
of focus need to be configurable not to do that, I am happy.
