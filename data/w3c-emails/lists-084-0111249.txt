If we do not clear the issues list today I am going to schedule an extra
telecon for Wednesday 26 January at 12:00-1:30 EST.  

We have had alot of telecons this month so let's try to focus on clearing
the issues list today.  I urge people to prepare by reviewing all the
issues and recent comments related to an issue so that we can quickly
identify resolutions to issues.
