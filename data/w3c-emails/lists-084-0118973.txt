aloha, jon!

actually, the action item was given to wilson craig, whose first attempt can be
found at:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-eo/1999OctDec/0083.html

i was, however, asked to write an basic explanation of and introduction to the
DOM for the EO group, but after reviewing the materials available in the latest
(candidate recommendation) DOM2, draft, i think the "Introduction" document
does that far better than i could...   the document to which i refer resides
at:
http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2/introduction.html

what may, perhaps, be needed before all is said and done, is a Note explaining
how ATs could / should work with the DOM, but that is another issue for another
list, and definitely not a reason to hold up CR...
