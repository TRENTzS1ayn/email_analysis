Hello,

To resolve issue 177 [1], I propose the following
changes to checkpoint 4.15 of the 15 january 2000 draft. Change

<OLD>
4.15 Allow the user to control user agent initiated spawned viewports.
     [Priority 2] 
</OLD>

to:

<NEW>
4.15 Allow the user to control user agent initiated
     changes to the user interface that might interfere
     with access to content or the user interface 
     (e.g., appearance of viewports,  changes of 
     focus to prompts, long audio messages, etc.) [Priority 2] 
</NEW>

There would also be a cross link to checkpoint 9.1 on
user notification of content and UI changes.

 - Ian
