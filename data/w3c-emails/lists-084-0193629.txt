Ian,

The problem with the proposed rewording, I think, is that it may be
considered too vague.  What changes to the user interface could not
interfere with access to content.

Would you consider something a bit more concrete such as

4.15 Allow the user to contol user agent agent actions which change the
appearance, focus, or access to the content of documents.

Subject: Proposed change to checkpoint on spawned viewports


Hello,

To resolve issue 177 [1], I propose the following
changes to checkpoint 4.15 of the 15 january 2000 draft. Change

<OLD>
4.15 Allow the user to control user agent initiated spawned viewports.
     [Priority 2]
</OLD>

to:

<NEW>
4.15 Allow the user to control user agent initiated
     changes to the user interface that might interfere
     with access to content or the user interface
     (e.g., appearance of viewports,  changes of
     focus to prompts, long audio messages, etc.) [Priority 2]
</NEW>

There would also be a cross link to checkpoint 9.1 on
user notification of content and UI changes.

 - Ian
