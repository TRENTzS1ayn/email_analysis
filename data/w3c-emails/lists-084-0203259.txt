Hello,

Issue 185 [1] involves clarification of the single stroke requirement
of checkpoint 10.4 of the 15 January 2000 Guidelines [2]:

<OLD>
10.4 Allow the user to change and control the input configuration.
     Allow the user to configure the user agent so that some
functionalities
     may be activated with a single command (e.g., single key, single
voice
     command, etc.). [Priority 2] 
</OLD>

In particular, the issue involves clarifiation of what "single key"
means. We discussed this issue at the 19 January teleconf [3].

PROPOSED

1) Change 10.4 to read:

   <NEW 10.4>
      Allow the user to change the input configuration.
      [Priority 2]
   </NEW>

2) Create a new checkpoint that reads:

   <NEW>
     Allow the user to configure the user agent so that frequently 
     used one-step operations may be activated directly 
     with a single input command (keystroke, voice command, etc.). 
        Note. User agents are not required to provide for single command
              activation of all functionalites at the same time.
              This checkpoint is an important special case of 10.4.
   </NEW>

   - This checkpoint says nothing about "how many", and the
     techniques document will say that user agents 

   - Techniques: Refer to Bryan Campbell emails on the list.
                 Also, think about macro capabilities.
                 Also, think about modes of operation (e.g., editing
                 mode in which text keys are used for text, not UI
control)

3) Delete the term "control" from the document and use "configure"
   instead. The current definitions are very close. To control means
   "that the user can choose preferred behavior from a set of 
   options." This sounds like configure to me! Configure talks about
   ways to configure as well (profiles, UI, etc.)
