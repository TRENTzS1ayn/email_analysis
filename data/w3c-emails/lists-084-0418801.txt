I recommend being able to show/hide controls be a P2 requirement. Not having
to tab through them will make life somewhat easier. In addition Jonathan
Chetwynd has writen in the context of search engines that a major problem for
people with Copgnitive disabilities is knowing where to enter something. He
recommends the Google engine because the inteerface is relatively sparse and
junk-free (unlike this email, I realise) but says he still works with people
who get confudsed between the input box and the box where you input a URI (I
note that many browsers do allow this to be hidden, and often the
toolbar(s) as well.

  I recommend that checkpoint 10.8 "Allow the user to configure the
  arrangement of graphical user agent user interface controls." remain at
  Priority 3.  It is not that I don't think it is important, but we have not
  identified the core requirements that are definitely priority 2 items.
  This is reflected in the 13 January telecon where there were groups of
  people who though the checkpoint was a priority 2, some who though it was
  priority 3 and others who were not sure which priority.  Denis Anson's
  request to Alan Cantor produced an eloquent response on the need for
  configuration, but no specific recommendations that could be formed into
  checkpoint requirements.  So until there is a specific proposal on core
  requirements at a priority level 2 I suggest that we resolve to leave this
  at priority 3 so the group can move on to other issues.    Minority opinons
  can be attached to the checkpoint for review during Candidate
  Recommendation, Proposed Recommendation and by the W3C Director.
