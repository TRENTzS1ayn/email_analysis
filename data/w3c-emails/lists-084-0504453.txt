Mickey,
One of the problems of the W3C HTML 4.0 specification is that it only
describes the syntax of how to markup an element to attach an accesskey.
There is no specification of behavior.  The only implementation that I know
of is for IE 4.0 and IE 5.0.  Basically it uses the ALT key in combination
with the accessksy specified to move the focus to a link or control.

Jon
