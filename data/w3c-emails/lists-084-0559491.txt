Hello,

I've updated the "User Agent Responsibilities" document [1].
Changes since the last version:

 - Some minor cleanup to eliminate "I" and replace with "Working Group"

 - Removed section on "Unknown" checkpoints and moved checkpoint 8.1
   to the section on "Requirements for content rendered natively":
   
    8.1 Make available to the user the author-specified purpose
        of each table and the relationships among the table cells 
        and headers.

   This checkpoint was originally listed in "unknown" since I could
   not come up with an "a priori" reason why this was a requirement
   for general purpose user agents. In fact, the whole reason I
published
   "UA Responsibilities" was that at the 10 December Austin meeting,
there
   was little consensus about whether this checkpoint was required for
   general purpose user agents. Note that the WG did resolve
   that the requirement made by the checkpoint is for general 
   purpose user agents (refer to issue 160 discussion at the Austin
   meeting).

 - Ian
