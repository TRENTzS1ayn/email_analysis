aloha, jon!

while i would rather see 10.1 and 10.3 merged, and accorded a P1, i wanted to
address some of your assertions about ACCESSKEY...

while it is true that the other WAI guidelines groups have accorded ACCESSKEY a
priority rating of 3,  ATAG's indirect prioritization of support for ACCESSKEY
is dependent upon WCAG's explicit prioritization of ACCESSKEY...  i have
repeatedly made a specific proposal (on this list and others) that the priority
level accorded ACCESSKEY in WCAG be raised (at least to 2, although i think it
a P1), and that a checkpoint encouraging authors to include ACCESSKEY
information either inline or in a linked file, be added to WCAG at a lower
priority...

as i have oft noted in this forum, author-defined UI controls, such as
acceleration keys, which the author can supply via the ACCESSKEY attribute in
HTML4, are not only the keystone of direct (versus serial) access to any UI
that supports direct access, but the very principle upon which an entire class
of adaptive technology for persons with certain classes of disabilities is
based... 

moreover, i am extremely concerned that ACCESSKEY is being given such
short-shrift because of the (from what i understand) intentional  vagueness of
the HTML 4.0 definition of the functionality of ACCESSKEY, the lack of
implementation, and the poor choice of an invocation mechanism (the ALT key) by
the one mainstream UA developer which has implemented ACCESSKEY...

i have spent hours on this topic, and have posted extensively on the topic to
this and other WAI lists...  my posts have included many techniques that would
either provide a user-configurable cascade order for conflicting keystrokes, a
user-defined triggering mechanism, and a pass through key...  i have raised the
issues associated with ACCESSKEY (and TABINDEX) on the PF list, and have been
tracking developments in this area in CSS3 and XHTML, and am loathe to let this
issue die such an ignominious death...  in my posts on the subject, i have not
attempted to quote fix unquote ACCESSKEY, or to force UAs to do so, only to
show that ACCESSKEY isn't necessarily broken if:

1. the UA does not bind ACCESSKEY to only one triggering mechanism (such as the
ALT key)

2. the UA offers the user the choice between moving-to the element for which
the ACCESSKEY has been defined and activating (if appropriate) the element for
which the ACCESSKEY has been defined

3. authors are encouraged (by WCAG and ATAG) not only to incorporate ACCESSKEYs
into their document source, but to provide an inline or linked list of the
accesskeys defined for that page (although i would welcome a user agent that
could provide such a list on the fly)

a few other ideas are:

a. let the user define the triggering mechanism,
b. provide a cascade order for controls and a pass through (ignore-next-input)
key, for cases where ACCESSKEYs, in conjunction with their triggers conflict
with OS or UA keybindings)
c. provide a special mode (such as Opera's forms mode) that would allow the
user to enter "naked" ACCESSKEYs

so, when it comes to ACCESSKEY, the fact of the matter is:

1. for certain classes of users, ACCESSKEY is indispensable
2. ACCESSKEY is implementable
3. implementation of ACCESSKEY can be improved, and suggestions for such
improvement have been documented by this WG
