HB: I agree that it is the UA's responsibility to let the user ask and learn
the full content of the input controls. But, if the user doesn't give a 
complete specification of all possible input controls, then surprises are 
likely
for any other controls that an author may change from the OS default.
For that reason, I believe there are two distinct checkpoints, unless
the result of user query about who established each control is multi-valued:
user profile, user agent default, AT default, OS default, or author override.

A further concern is that there is no presumption that the set of controls
is consistent across OS, user agent or AT running under it, or application
in which an author presents information (HTML, XHTML, any XML application).
Cross-OS use of a profile is unlikely unless the members of this set of
controls is fixed and have stable, consistent definitions.
