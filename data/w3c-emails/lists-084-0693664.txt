JRG: I am not sure this version of the document will have any major changes
on this issue, so I don't think there is any immediate need to get more
information.  I think it is still important to try to get more ideas
related to cognitive disabilties and people with this expertise in
cognitive disabilities to get envolved in the process.  So if you want I
can remove the action item from the list.

JRG: I talked to DB and he seemed happy with the meeting and will work on
allowing the review to be published.
