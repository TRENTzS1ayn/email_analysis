Hello,

We are nearly ready to go to Candidate Recommendation. I have
updated three documents:

26 January Guidelines
  http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/CR-UAAG10-20000126

  Changes:
      1) Important. Updated the conformance statement based on the 25
January       
                    unified conformance scheme. 
      2) Changed all occurrences of "alternative equivalent"
         to "equivalent alternative" as in WCAG and ATAG. 
      3) Incorporated editorial comments from Judy Brewer. 
      4) Switched checkpoints 3.8 and 3.9 to put them in the correct
         priority order. 
      5) The PDF version of the spec is no longer gzipped. 


26 January Techniques
  http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-TECHS-20000126

  Changes:
     1) Added a cross-reference from checkpoint 5.6 techniques
        to the appendix on in-process loading. Also added some verbiage
as
        the beginning of clarificationon the meaning of "timely". 
     2) Added some techniques to 10.9 about turning on/off controls 
        based on a Charles request. 
     3) Based on Mark Novak comment, added some info to Appendix 4 
        on where to find access info in MS Windows. 

26 January Implementation Report
  http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-IMP-20000126

  Changes: 
   - Additional Netscape/Linux information
   - Additional Amaya information
   - Additional links to documentation for Opera and Amaya
   - Changed the word "difficult" to "may require developer
     documentation"
   - Removed the word "claim" from some descriptions.

Thank you,

 - Ian
