Current techniques for 5.5:

1. @@This needs work and probably should be in the guidelines@@. The
exchange of information between user agents must keep pace with changes in
the content. It may be necessary to allow the user to configure the user
agent to pause before changes to content or the user interface so that an
assistive technology has time to react. 

JRG: Unless we have an example of how this would work I would like to see
it removed.  We can add it to a future issues list for the document or
forwarded to the PF group, but I know off no technical way for AT and UA to
do this or how it would help assistive technology.  This has been a
consistently difficult checkpoint for developers to understand and I think
this type of techniques suggestion will only add to the confusion on what
should be a simple checkpoint to understand.

2. Please refer to the appendix that explains how to load assistive
technologies for DOM access. 

JRG: I would like to see this bullet changed to:
"Loading assistive technologies into the same address space as the address
space used by the UA reduces the time it takes for AT requests to the UA to
be processed.  Examples of how to do this with diiferent operating systems
can be found in an appendix to this document.  This is especailly important
for access to the DOM"

Additional Bullet:
Use operating system conventions for programmatic interfaces that require
the least amount of operating system overhead for the exchange of
information between assistive technologies and user agents.  The two ares
of concern are for timeliness of access to the DOM and timeliness of access
to user interface controls by assistive technologies.  In the case of user
interface controls using standard system controls will typically support
timely access.
