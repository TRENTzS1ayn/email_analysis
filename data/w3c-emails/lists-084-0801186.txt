JRG2: If a technique needs work at this point in the development of the
techniques document I think it should be given to interested working group
members as an action item for them to develop.  When the validity of the
technique for accessibility is clearer to the working group it can then be
added to the techniques document. Until that time I think putting in
questionable techniques will cause unnecessary problems during the review
process.  This would be the only technique I am aware of as marked as
"needs work" if included.
