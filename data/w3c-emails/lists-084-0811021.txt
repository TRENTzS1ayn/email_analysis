IJ2: Up to now, techniques have not undergone explicit WG review before
being included in the techniques document. I don't disagree with a
policy where the WG would approve techniques before they are added,
but we don't have such a policy today. 

I marked it as "needs work" not because it's any less ripe than other
techniques, but because the ideas themselves are in discussion and
I wanted to mark for myself that we needed to continue to develop
these ideas.  I did not want to use the issues list before going to
CR.
