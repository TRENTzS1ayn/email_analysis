David,

I assume you mean IE 5.5 rather than 5.05.

IE 5.5 can be downloaded from
http://msdn.microsoft.com/downloads/webtechnology/ie/iepreview.asp.

That page includes various info and warnings that IE 5.5 is a beta release
and is aimed at experienced users who should use at their own risk. It also
includes a page for bug reporting -- http://131.107.85.110/msdn/bugreports/
-- and I would encourage you to submit any bugs, accessibility-related or
otherwise.

The final release of IE 5.5 should be more accessible than IE 5.0 and IE
5.01, in part because of improved support for MSAA.

Dick

Ok, I'm using millenium shshshsh...
It contains ie 5.05.  Ie 5.05 does not work with jfw in frames or on
forms.  JFW does not read what is in the frames and does not track
forms properly.  How can I get the latest beta of ie5.05?  I went to
the microsoft site with netscape and can navigate it that way but did
not see anything about a beta.
Thanks!
