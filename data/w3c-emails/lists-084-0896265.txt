I hear we need a technique for Checkpoint 4.8, Allow the user to
configure the position of captions on graphical displays.

There are currently no implementations of this that I know of that
are intended for use by end users. In QuickTime, once you download
a movie you can go into the authoring mode and move the tracks
around yourself, but that is really meant for authoring, not for 
watching, if you know what I mean. Also, if it's a streaming video
the captions can't be moved. And similarly if you downloaded a SMIL
file and edited the layout you could move the captions yourself,
but that's authoring, not using a user agent, so it shouldn't count.

I propose this information for the technique:

Allow the user to choose whether captions appear at the bottom or top
of the video area or in other positions. Currently authors may place
captions overlying the video or in a separate box. Captions may block
the user's view of other information in the video or on other parts
of the screen, making it necessary to move the captions in order to
view all content at once. In addition, some users may find captions
easier to read if they can place them in a location best suited to
their reading style. 

Users should not be required to edit the authoring of the presentation
in order to move the captions. For example, it is not sufficient to
suggest that users download a SMIL presentation and edit the code for
layout in the .SMI file in order to move captions on the display.

Allow users to set a preference for where they generally prefer to have
captions appear and also to adjust the caption position for individual
presentations through the user interface. Ensure that these adjustments
can be carried out using the keyboard as well as with a pointing device.
