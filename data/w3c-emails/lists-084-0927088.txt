I'm not sure I understand this one. Does this mean: do you require
information from another user agent? or specifically do you require
a structured tree model?

How about phrasing the question in terms of the UAAG requirement, for
instance:

 "The User Agent Guidelines requires that general purpose user agents
  implement the W3C DOM [1] for providing access to content. Will
  the DOM meet your needs for access to content?
 
  [1] http://www.w3.org/DOM/

  I'm not sure I understand this question. Does it mean "Would the W3C
DOM
  be better than what you're using now?"

  What kind of tools are you thinking of? Do you have any in mind that
you
  could list as examples?

  Yes.

How about these questions:

 - Are you familiar with the W3C DOM?
 - Do you implement it for communication with browsers?
 - Do you plan to?
 - What platforms do you run on/expect to run on? What do you use
   currently on those platforms for access to content? To user the 
   interface?
 - How resource-intensive do you think it would be to implement the DOM?
