Rich,

In speaking of developing DOM 3 to include agent chrome, you say that
the only alternative is:  "going back down the antiquated OSM route to
get the needed information."  I would hardly call Off-Screen Model
technology "antiquated."  I suspect that having put so much effort into
developing the most stable and robust OSM in the business, you didn't
remember that Screen Reader/2 used OS/2 messages and queries
to get at chrome. So it is today that most screen readers depend
on Windows messages and queries, and those available through from a
common interface, namely MSAA, to access Chrome. I see no reason
for including Chrome  in the DOM. The age of OSM technology, about
13 years, has nothing to do with it.

That's fine.

I think you should know that I met with the DOM working group in
California. We (PF group) plan on extending the DOM further for
accessibility in DOM 3. Furthermore, I have started the wheels rolling on
an editorial team in the DOM working group to address the feasibility of
extending the DOM to include the "chrome." There were a number of DOM WG
members who were very interested in this prospect for a number reasons:
audio browsers pervasive devices, etc.

I don't understand why you feel it is necessary to solicit support given
that there is no other mechanism other than going back down the antiquated
OSM route to get the needed information.

Subject:  Tenative meeting on the DOM with AT vendors for the User Agent
      Guidelines




Peter, Mark and Rich,
The W3C WAI User Agent guidelines are going to be in Candidate
Recommendation within a day or two.  Part of the goal of our candidate
recommendation period is to discuss the use of the DOM with AT vendors for
assistive technologies to provide  alternative access to WWW content.  We
hope to gain their support in using the DOM as the primary way to provide
an exchange of WWW content between user agents and assistive technologies.
We have tenatively scheduled this meeting for 18 Feburary at 2:00 EST.  I
would like to invite all of you to participate in this teleconference and
was wondering about your availability and interest in attending at the
tenative date and time.

Thank you,
Jon
