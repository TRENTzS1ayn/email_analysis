JRG: Charles I think this is a step backward, the working group already 
decided to delete these types of checkpoints as a part of last call. See 
issue #160:

JRG: We have had this type of checkpoint before too.  The main problem with 
the DOM is that is a programmatic view of the document and there are few 
documents where the human semantic structure of the document is reflected 
in the W3C DOM.  I also don't think most users have a container model for 
navigating a document.

In summary these seem to be rehashes of old proposals the group has already 
gone through and rejected for various reasons.  They also don't clearly 
state the problem to the developer on the problem that is being solved.
