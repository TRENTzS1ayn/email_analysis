I took an action item to describe how configuring volume is different
from setting volume. from:
   4.7 Allow the user to configure the audio volume. [Priority 2]

Configuration allows for fixed volume as well as how volume can be set
and controls used.  this is an os supported convention.
setting only allows the value to be set.
Techniques:
1> allow a shortcut for easy access to volume controll.  2> Provide
for hiding volume and having it remain fixed at a user defined level
and at the option of the user.
 
se windows .95 and .98 and nt for their implementation of this.
