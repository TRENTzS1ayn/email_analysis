  I STRONGLY OPPOSE THIS PROPOSAL. The WG long ago chose not to include
  a table navigation checkpoint and I don't believe that this issue should
  be reopened at this point. Refer to issue 160 [1]

If I can't find out what is in a table I can't access the content. For
graphical systems we have agreed that vertical / horizontal scrolling plus
exporting the DOM are sufficient. That is not the same as "therefore there is
no requirement to be able to read the content".

  I don't like this ISO-HTML specific checkpoint. Why doesn't SVG have a
  container
  model? What is the "g" element? 
CMN  
SVG does have a container model - and therefore this checkpoint would not
apply to SVG. (My editorial bad).
IJ
  Can this just be a technique? Is there a URI to the ISO-HTML spec?
  If a URI isn't available (or if the ISO spec costs money) I am not
  excited about including it.
CMN
No, I do not consider that this can just be a technique. It is a requirement
to have a navigable structure, and HTML doesn't. We can specify the algorithm
ourselves rather than referring to ISO - I just wanted to save myself typing
something I believed everyone understood.

IJ  
  Ok.
  
CMN
This would apply to SVG. It is a strategy for dealing with the fact that poor
authoring may result in a large series of paths, only differentiated by style
properties. The gain in that circumstance might be minimal, but minimal is
better than nothing.

IJ  
  We have already decided that this navigation mechanism is best handled
  by
  assistive technologies. I strongly object re-adding this requirement.
CMN  
As I understood it we had agreed that a visual technology had to layout the
things in table form and scroll up down left right with the viewport, plus
export the DOM so an assistive technology could provide whatever it wanted. I
didn't understand that we had therefore decided that the functionality wasn't
important, and if we had then I register my very strong disagreement with
that decision.
