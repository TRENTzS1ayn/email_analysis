Harvey,

Thanks for your comments. I have added a few comments below, marked with
"EH1:"

In addition to the comments, this memo a suggests an addition to my earlier
definition of "Text element" and proposes a definition of "Text".

Regards,

Eric

EH1: I don't mean to assert that all braille users are blind. Similarly, I
do not mean to assert that all users of synthesized speech are blind or that
all users of visually-displayed text are deaf. I simply wanted to anchor
each modality in a single group for which that modality is very important.
For the braille category one could say: "(3) braille (for a person who is
deaf-blind or _blind_ and adept at reading braille)"[emphasis added], but I
don't think that it is necessary and begs the question, "Why not add yet
other disability groups for which a particular rendering is likely to be
helpful?". I'd like to keep the definition simple. Braille is particularly
important for people who are deaf-blind because, unlike people who are
blind-only, they cannot hear the audio renderings.

Very good point. I think that you have stated well some of the implicit
assumptions. Generally, speaking I like making assumptions explicit.
Possible language to add to the definition of "Text element":

"In this definition, the representatives of the reference disability groups
(deaf, blind, deaf-blind) are assumed to be _similarly well-prepared to
understand_ by factors such as their educational preparation, by the
availability of appropriate commercial input and output technologies
(including assistive technologies, as necessary), and by reasonably
favorable operating conditions (e.g., quiet, well-lighted room, etc.) for
the kind of technology for which conformance claim is made. In this case,
each claim pertains to a user agent (composite or singular) that must adhere
to one or more sets of checkpoints beyond the core level."

Thus, the issue of "language" would be encompassed by the phrase
"educational preparation".

I am actually a little nervous about linking the definition of text element
so directly directly dependent upon delivery technology. Maybe the
definition should end immediately after "favorable operating conditions
(e.g., quiet, well-lighted room, etc.)".

EH1: That's right. I have argued elsewhere that that synthesized speech and
braille should be included _within_ the boundary of the Subject ('subject of
the claim'), however, for a variety of reasons (technical and non-technical)
that view has not held sway. Yet this definition reaches out beyond the
boundary of the subject in a soft (but I think necessary way), making
implicit reference to a channel of communication based on commercial
technologies that would allow, if necessary, output as braille or
synthesized speech.

EH1: Sometimes I would really like to include the WCAG 1.0 checkpoint 14.1
provision as part of the definition of "text element"; one one sense it is
already an implicit part of the definition since if there is a candidate
text element that does not adhere to checkpoint 14.1, the page (and any site
built upon it) cannot conform at the WCAG single-A level. I think that "text
elements" and "text equivalents" (which are simply text elements that
fulfill the essential function of some other content) should exemplify our
conception of accessibilty. On the other hand, I am concerned that to make
that requirement an explict part of the definition may appear to overburden
the definition. And certainly, as you say, the checkpoint is very difficult
to validate.

EH1: Thanks for what seems to be a very clear explanation of the terms.
Maybe we need a definitions of "character" and "glyph" within the definition
of "Text" in the document. See definition below in this memo.

EH1: Do you think that anything in the document needs to change to account
for this? Does anything like that operate on the "alt" attribute?

EH1: Somebody can correct me if I am wrong, but I suspect that the output
from the DOM might have structural markup that would allow some other
process (e.g., a rendering process) to produce the nested lists enumerated
with lower and uppercase letters, numbers, etc. If you feel that
case-sensitive search ought to be added to the checkpoint, perhaps you
should make proposal to that effect.

EH1: Doesn't the current definition of content allow that? I suppose that
the definition was thought to _not_ require comment on rendering.

EH1: Following is a possible definition for "Text".

Proposed definition of "Text"

"Text"

"In a narrow, technical sense, 'text' refers to the abstract character
represented by its character code in some character set. This document uses
the term more broadly to include an additional meaning as _rendered
characters_ (which, particularly in visual renderings, are sometimes called
"glyphs" [EH comment: I presume that the term glyph was intended for visual
renderings and adaptable to some tactile renderings (e.g., sculpted relief
carvings of letters) but does it even apply in the area of synthetic speech
or braille?]). Different fonts have different glyphs for the same character
code. Although this document does not require support for any particular
character set, it is expected that user agent developers will implement
character sets like those found in the Unicode base of ISO 10646 [NEED
REFERENCE]. It should be noted that certain terms using the word "text" have
highly specialized meanings. (See the definitions of _non-text element,
non-text content, text element, text content, text equivalent, non-text
equivalent_.)"
