Hello,

Here's why I think a table navigation checkpoint isn't
required (and this, I believe is a summary of the history
of how we got to where we are today):

1) Checkpoint 2.1 requires access to all content.
2) Checkpoint 8.1 requires the UA to communicate relationships
   among cells and headers
3) Checkpoint 7.6 requires navigation to meaningful elements, which
   includes tables and table cells in the case of HTML.

Therefore, I believe that Charles' requirement is already met
by the current set of checkpoints, and the current set of checkpoints
is the result of work that led to us removing checkpoints for
navigation to elements of a particular type.

IJ2: If HTML is broken, ask that it be fixed. I don't think we should
enter
the realm of repair checkpoints at this point in the life of the
document.
We can make suggestions in techniques for the case of HTML. I would
rather avoid
technology specific requirements in the checkpoints (and I am glad to
get rid
of the explicit list of HTML elements if we can).
