OK. This makes sense to me, so I withdraw the proposal for navigating table
cells.

I agree that the place to  repair HTML is in the HTML WG, but there may be
many reasons why a document is not constructed with a container model. HTML
is just one example of a type that is rarely created in this way.

An alternative approach is to require that any outline (for example provided
in accordance with 8.4) be navigable parent-child and sibling-sibling. This
is weaker than my original proposal, since it is not clear how such an
outline is constructed. I agree that there is a problem with the specificity
of my proposal. An alternative would be to propose to the WCAg group that
they make explicit their requirement for structure, in such a way that a
checkpoint of this kind could refer to it. But that will also be complex.

  Hello,
  
  Here's why I think a table navigation checkpoint isn't
  required (and this, I believe is a summary of the history
  of how we got to where we are today):
  
  1) Checkpoint 2.1 requires access to all content.
  2) Checkpoint 8.1 requires the UA to communicate relationships
     among cells and headers
  3) Checkpoint 7.6 requires navigation to meaningful elements, which
     includes tables and table cells in the case of HTML.
  
  Therefore, I believe that Charles' requirement is already met
  by the current set of checkpoints, and the current set of checkpoints
  is the result of work that led to us removing checkpoints for
  navigation to elements of a particular type.

  IJ2: If HTML is broken, ask that it be fixed. I don't think we should
  enter
  the realm of repair checkpoints at this point in the life of the
  document.
  We can make suggestions in techniques for the case of HTML. I would
  rather avoid
  technology specific requirements in the checkpoints (and I am glad to
  get rid
  of the explicit list of HTML elements if we can).
