JRG: I agree with Ian that we need specifications that enforce structure 
before we can have any strong stance in user agent to use that structure 
for navigation purposes.  I will raise this issue with the coordination 
group.

It seems to me that most navigation techniques are unproven at this point, 
so it makes it difficult for the group to take any strong stance on any 
particular technique.  Different techniques have been proposed to be useful 
for people with various skills in different situations.  I think at this 
point we need more general approaches to highlight the navigation problems 
and with minimal requirements that benefit all users.
