Actually there are other cases. Well-written hypertext contains its own
navigation already, but there is a large amount of content on the Web that is
not produced as hypertext, but as marked-up text. Reading a large document
(for example an RFC) presented as marked-up text presents the same problem,
with a tank-trap of large blocks of content. (It would be better if all
documetns were written as hypertext, but at the moment they aren't.)

  Sorry, this is going to be hasty.  I have been wanting to do a more
  professional writeup but I know you are having a meeting tomorrow where you
  need to consider this.
  
  a) So far as I know the only justification for the P2 priority is the "top
  links tank trap" problem.  Otherwise structural navigation is a convenience
  but not an access necessity [only 1 vote].

[lots more well written thought on the topic]
