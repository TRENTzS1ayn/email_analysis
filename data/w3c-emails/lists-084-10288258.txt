Al,
Thank you for your response. If I could summarize some of the main topics 
that I caught from your response.

1. A new checkpoint should be created that would directly address skipping 
over author identified navigation bars (i.e. MAP in HTML).

2. Important elements should be informative and presented through a 
description of what make the elements important (i.e. some elements are 
more important than other elements for navigation and structure)

3. Need to break large documents in to smaller units of information that 
can more easily be digested.  The smaller units can be navigated from a 
generated table of contents.

4. Some pages have author supplied tables of contents.

5. Improve linking of checkpoints 8.4 and 7.6, or make part of requirement 
in 8.4 is that this view be a navigation mechanism for the document

Does this summarize your important requirements for a solution?
