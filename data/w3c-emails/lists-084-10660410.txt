Gregory,
I am going to consider your proposal to raise the priority levels of 8.4 
and 8.5 as a minority opinion, since changes in priority of these 
checkpoints was not raised during PR.  I will only bring it back before the 
group as issue if a significant number of other working group members also 
feel similarly.  I ENCOURAGE working group members to respond to this 
thread for there support or opposition to Gregory's proposal.

As a minority opinion, it will be forwarded with the document to last call 
and proposed recommendation with document.  Although I would suggest to 
strength your case with the director and other reviewers to explain why 
this opinion was not included as a minority opinion in the previous last 
call and proposed recommendation periods.

Jon
