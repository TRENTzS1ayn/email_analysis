aloha, jon!

thank you for your reply, for considering my proposal as a minority 
opinion, and for your advice...  i will track this thread, and draft 
something more formal as soon as appropriate (read: as soon as i hear from 
others on it, or when i steal a spare moment)

thanks, too, to ian, for re-subscribing me to the list,
         gregory.
