In order to comment on the adequacy of this change, I need a little
clarification.

Is it correct that the document and recent working group agreements do _not_
require writing data back to the DOM? We allow user agents to make whatever
repair they do _during load_ without being impinged upon by our guidelines.
We have had a lot of discussion about repair functions (and even more may be
due), but is it correct that we have not agreed to any post-load repair
function that writes back to the DOM?

I do want to submit the idea that if we do require post-load repair that
writes to the DOM, then those actions constitute authoring, making the user
agent an authoring tool and therefore making the ATAG 1.0 document relevant.


However, if that occurs, I can't see all of ATAG (especially all three
priority levels) being relevant. I can see all three levels of WCAG 1.0 as
being relevant for 6.1

With this caveat, the change seems OK.
