Hello,

Marja Koivunen has pointed out to me that checkpoints 
4.14 and 4.15 of the 1 September Guidelines have minor problems.
The checkpoints are:

<OLD>
4.14 Allow the user to configure how the selection is highlighted 
(e.g., foreground and background color). Offer
at least three rendering options, including colors and fonts. 
Allow the user to select from among the range of
system colors and fonts. [Priority 1] 

4.15 Allow the user to configure how the content focus is 
highlighted (e.g., foreground and background color).
Offer at least three rendering options, including colors and 
fonts. Allow the user to select from among the range
of system colors and fonts. The default focus highlight mechanism 
must be different from the default selection
highlight mechanism. [Priority 1] 
</OLD>

The problems are:

a) Neither checkpoint talks about non-visual highlighting
b) Neither checkpoint includes a minimum requirement for
   non-visual highlighting.

To address this, I propose the following changes:

1) List "voice pitch" as an example of how audio highlighting
   might be done.

2) Specify that the minimal requirements mentioned (fonts and colors)
   apply to graphical user agents.

3) Do not include minimal requirements for non-visual highlighting, but
   add a cross reference to checkpoint 4.12 (speech parameter control).

<NEW>
Allow the user to configure how the selection is highlighted
(e.g., foreground and background color, voice pitch, etc.). 
For graphical user interfaces, offer at least three rendering 
options, including colors and fonts.
Allow the user to select from among the range of system colors and
fonts.

Allow the user to configure how the content focus is highlighted 
(e.g., foreground and background color, voice pitch, etc.). 
For graphical user interfaces, offer at least three rendering options, 
including colors and fonts. For graphical user interfaces, allow the 
user to select from among the range of system colors and fonts.
The default focus highlight mechanism must be different from the 
default selection highlight mechanism.

P.S. I intend to include these changes in the next draft and will 
revert them if discussion about this topic requires.
