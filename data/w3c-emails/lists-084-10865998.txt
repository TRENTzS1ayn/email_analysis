As a side comment, if the tool does become an authoring tool (I guess that as
well as changing the DOM it really needs to have a mechanism for putting the
changed DOM back onto the web somewhere) then yes, ATAG 1.0 does apply. But
that already exists, and need not take up space in the UA guidelines.
