Hakon,
I would like to thank you for your last call review of the User Agent
guidelines.  I know you have been in discussion recently with Ian about the
Candidate Recommendation version of the guidelines and that you have
concerns with the current requirement for full implementation of DOM.  I
hope that you will continue your discussions with Ian and I would also like
to invite you to a special meeting on the DOM issues with AT vendors on 18
Feburary 2000.  If you cannot make that meeting, would you be able to make
any other meetings in February? We would block a section of time to discuss
your concerns with the current DOM requirements in the UA guidelines.  The
group typically meets on Thursdays from 2:00-3:30pm (EST USA).  

Would you be able to make the special meeting on 18 February or another
meeting this month?

Thank you for your help in developing the guidelines,
Jon
