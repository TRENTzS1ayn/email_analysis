I support this proposal.

  Hello,
  
  In the 1 September UAAG 1.0 [1], checkpoint 6.1 is P1 and reads:
  
    Implement the accessibility features of all supported specifications 
    (markup languages, style sheet languages, metadata languages,
    graphics formats, etc.). Accessibility features are those identified 
    in the specification and those features of the specification 
    that support requirements of the "Web Content Accessibility 
    Guidelines 1.0" [WCAG10], the "Authoring Tool Accessibility 
    Guidelines 1.0" [ATAG10], and the current document. [Priority 1] 
  
  The issue of whether this checkpoint should have a relative priority
  has already been raised (number 111 [2]), and at the Princeton
  face-to-face, we resolved to leave it a P1 checkpoint [3]. Eric
  has recently broached the topic again [4], asking:
  
     "Is it a Priority 1 UAAG requirement to ensure that 
      features that support all three_ WCAG and ATAG priority 
      levels are implemented?"
  
  In fact, I see a bug in the UAAG 1.0 spec since it refers 
  at a P1 level to "those features of the specifcation that support 
  the requirements of ... the current document") and not all
  the requirements are P1. 
  
  If I recall, the strongest argument against a relative priority
  for this checkpoint was that even if a requirement is P3 in WCAG,
  it is important for user agents to implement such features, otherwise
  there is no pressure to provide the support author's need. I believe
  the same argument may be made for ATAG requirements that refer to
  content, but not necessarily those that refer to user interface.
  
  PROPOSED FIX:
  
    - Delete "and the current document" from 6.1. Thus, to conform
      to this document, you must satisfy the checkpoints of this document
      and relevant requirements of other documents at a P1 level
  
    - Delete the reference to ATAG 1.0 (since content requirements
      covered by WCAG and  user interface requirements covered by UAAG).
  
    - Clearly state that we mean *all* requirements of WCAG 1.0 (P1, P2,
  and P3).
  
  <NEW>
    Implement the accessibility features of all supported specifications 
    (markup languages, style sheet languages, metadata languages,
    graphics formats, etc.). Accessibility features are those identified 
    in the specification and those features of the specification 
    that support requirements of the "Web Content Accessibility 
    Guidelines 1.0" [WCAG10] [Priority 1]
