In the way I understand it, it includes images and other things that are
presented (the perceived effect of scripts, but not the actual code, for

  A couple of comments:
  
  1) I'm not sure it's necessary to distinguish what you are calling
  "native content" from other content.
  
  2) Does native content also exclude style, scripts, and binary
     code? Does that amount to "human readable text"?
