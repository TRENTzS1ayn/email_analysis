I agree with these proposals, although it  would be nice to see at least 3
examples of graphical options (At the moment I am too tired to think of any
though).

  Hello,
  
  Marja Koivunen has pointed out to me that checkpoints 
  4.14 and 4.15 of the 1 September Guidelines have minor problems.
  The checkpoints are:
  
  <OLD>
  4.14 Allow the user to configure how the selection is highlighted 
  (e.g., foreground and background color). Offer
  at least three rendering options, including colors and fonts. 
  Allow the user to select from among the range of
  system colors and fonts. [Priority 1] 
  
  4.15 Allow the user to configure how the content focus is 
  highlighted (e.g., foreground and background color).
  Offer at least three rendering options, including colors and 
  fonts. Allow the user to select from among the range
  of system colors and fonts. The default focus highlight mechanism 
  must be different from the default selection
  highlight mechanism. [Priority 1] 
  </OLD>
  
  The problems are:
  
  a) Neither checkpoint talks about non-visual highlighting
  b) Neither checkpoint includes a minimum requirement for
     non-visual highlighting.
  
  To address this, I propose the following changes:
  
  1) List "voice pitch" as an example of how audio highlighting
     might be done.
  
  2) Specify that the minimal requirements mentioned (fonts and colors)
     apply to graphical user agents.
  
  3) Do not include minimal requirements for non-visual highlighting, but
     add a cross reference to checkpoint 4.12 (speech parameter control).
  
  <NEW>
  Allow the user to configure how the selection is highlighted
  (e.g., foreground and background color, voice pitch, etc.). 
  For graphical user interfaces, offer at least three rendering 
  options, including colors and fonts.
  Allow the user to select from among the range of system colors and
  fonts.

  P.S. I intend to include these changes in the next draft and will 
  revert them if discussion about this topic requires.
