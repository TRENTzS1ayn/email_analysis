I would like to propose the following schedule for the next two weeks.

1. A new working draft should be available in the next few days 
incorporating all the resolutions from from open issues.  Working group 
members should consider this the "working group's" last call 
document.  This will probably be your last chance to comment on the 
document before going to last call.  Therefore ALL working group members 
should read and comment on any problems they have with the draft.  After we 
go to last call the working group will only be addressing issue raised by 
last call reviewers.

2. Cancel the 5 October meeting, due to the large number of people 
participating in other WAI FTF meetings that week.  Members can use this 
time to review the new working draft of the guidelines.

3. Post any issues relating to the last call working draft by 9 October to 
the mail list.  The list of issues will be used to generate the agenda for 
a teleconference on 10 October.

4. Have an 60 minute teleconference on Tuesday 10 October to discuss any 
changes in the new working draft.  If possible, vote on going to last call.

5. Have our regular teleconference on Thursday 12 October to to discuss 
remaining issues with new working draft.  If possible, vote on going to 
last call.

Please let me know if you cannot participate in this schedule.
