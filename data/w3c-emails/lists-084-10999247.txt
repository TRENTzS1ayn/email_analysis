    Please let me know if you can or cannot attend a FTF meeting hosted by AOL 
    near the Dulles Airport outside of Washington, D.C. on Thursday and Friday 
    November 16 and 17th.  The meeting will be used primarily to process last 
    call issues.  It will start on Thursday morning at 8:30am and end on Friday 
    about 3:00 or 3:30 so people can catch Friday evening flights.  Please let 
    me know as soon as possible.  I think this is an important opportunity to 
    meet at a major Internet company and recruit AOL staff to participate in 
    current and future UA discussions.  I encourage all working member to try 
    to attend.
    
    Thank you,
