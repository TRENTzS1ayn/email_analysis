I have also deleted "equivalent alternative" from the rest of the
document.

Ok.

I don't agree with that change and therefore will change "eesential" to 
"important". If you make it a "must" level requirement, it belongs in
the
checkpoint, not the note. I disagree with a new requirement at this
point
to provide a document source view.

Ok.
