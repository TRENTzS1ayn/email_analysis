  General

     * Added Eric Hansen as co-editor.
     * Harmonize how checkpoints use graphical user interface or
       graphical viewport for applicability.

  Abstract/Introduction

     * In abstract, more info about target of guidelines.

  Conformance

   Implemented resolutions of [7]28 September teleconf as follows:
     * To section 3.2: Modifications to Note: "Note: Some software may
       not conform to this document but still be accessible to some
users
       with disabilities. Conformance is expected to be a strong
       indicator of accessibility, but it is neither a necessary nor
       sufficient condition for ensuring the accessibility of software."
     * Deleted old applicability provisions 1 and 4.
     * Added new section on labeled sets (3.4) of checkpoints per
       resolution of [8]28 September teleconference
     * Used the term "subject" consistently in section on conformance.
     * Added to section on applicability checkpoints (3.5):
          + "For each content types label in a claim, all of the
            corresponding checkpoints apply."
          + (In exception provisions): "The checkpoint refers explicitly
            to graphical user interfaces or viewports and the subject
            only has an audio or tactile user interface or viewports. "
     * Added requirement for label to well-formed claim section.
     * Tightened up definition of applicability.
     * Added Multimedia label to sample claim.

  Guidelines

     * Guideline 2: Added note that content is expected to conform to
       WCAG 1.0.
     * Guideline 4: Added labels to identify checkpoints that relate to
       content accessibility.
     * Guideline 6: Changed title to avoid some possible ambiguity (per
       Marja suggestion).
     * Guideline 8: Added some prose to explain orientation.

  Checkpoints

     * 1.1: Removed applicability statement.
     * 1.3: Removed applicability statement. Changed "standard keyboard
       API" to "standard API for the keyboard" to avoid potential
(though
       unlikely) confusion.
     * 1.5: Some editori changes based on [9]comments from Eric Hansen.
     * 2.1, 2.3: Changes based on [10]suggestions from Eric resolved per
       [11]28 Sep teleconf.
     * 2.6: Editorial change based on [12]observation by Jon Gunderson.
     * 3.1, 3.2, 3.4, 3.8: Modified per [13]proposal from Ian as
resolved
       at [14]12 Sept telecon.
     * 3.7, 3.8: Editorial changes. For 3.7, use singular voice. For
3.8,
       clarified that the refresh impulse is coming from the client, not
       the server. Thus, new content is not "available" (i.e., a clue
       from the server). Instead, the user may retrieve new content at
       regular intervals (the checkpoints says "author-specified content
       refreshes").
     * 4.5, 4.6, 4.8, 4.9: Modified per [15]proposal from Ian as
resolved
       at [16]12 Sept telecon.
     * 4.7: Minor editorial changes.
     * 4.15: Clarified that user must be able to select and apply style
       sheets.
     * 4.16, 4.17: Changed per [17]proposal from Ian.
     * 4.19: Modified per [18]14 Sep teleconf.
     * 4.20: New checkpoint added per [19]14 Sep teleconf.
     * 6.1: Deleted UAAG 1.0 and ATAG 1.0 references per [20]proposal
       from Ian.
     * 7.5: Changed per [21]14 Sep teleconf.
     * 7.6: Made changes prescribed at [22]26 Sep teleconf. Added three
       HTML elements to informative list of important html elements:
       applet, link, iframe. Made some editorial changes suggested by
       Gregory.
     * 8.1: Minor editorial changes.
     * 8.2, 8.3: Distinguish minimum requirements for graphical
viewports
       from others.
     * Deleted old 8.5 (in favor of 7.7) per [23]26 Sep teleconf
     * 9.1: Added note afterwards and techniques to talk about
       persistence per [24]28 September teleconf.
     * 11.1: Removed Note after checkpoint and moved min requirement to
       the checkpoint itself.
