Section 3.4 Content type labels

1. Audio label missing checkpoint 3.2, remove 4.15 and 4.16 (add to speech
label), and order checkpoints numerically. 

2. Image label missing 3.4 (if label is to be consistent with including 
3.3 in Text grouping for animations)

3. Speech label missing 4.15, 4.16, 8.2 and 8.3

4. I think there are two issues in the use of the content type section:
helping developers to understand which checkpoints apply to them and
secondly to help consumers more easily understand if developer claims will
make a user agent more accessible to them.  The groupings Text, Color,
Image, Animation, Video, Audio and Speech address the needs of developers
to easily identify which checkpoints are applicable to associated media
types.  The groupings Multimedia and All, seem more useful to consumers
wanting to know more about the general accessibility of a user agent.  I
therefore propose an additional grouping primarily for consumers, GUI for
graphical user interface.  GUI would include the following groupings and
checkpoint:

Text, Color, Image, Animation and checkpoint 3.2.

This grouping would be applicable to current user agent technology like
Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator and Opera.
