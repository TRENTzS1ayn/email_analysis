Comments on Section 3.4 Content type labels

Comment 1: Audio label missing checkpoint 3.2, remove 4.15 and 4.16 (add to 
speech label), and order checkpoints numerically.

Comment 2: Image label missing 3.4 (if label is to be consistent with 
including 3.3 in Text grouping for animations)

Comment 3: Speech label missing 4.15, 4.16, 8.2 and 8.3

Comment 4: I think there are two issues in the use of the content type 
section: helping developers to understand which checkpoints apply to them 
and secondly to help consumers more easily understand if developer claims 
will make a user agent more accessible to them. The groupings Text, Color, 
Image, Animation, Video, Audio and Speech address the needs of developers 
to easily identify which checkpoints are applicable to associated media 
types. The groupings Multimedia and All, seem more useful to consumers 
wanting to know more about the general accessibility of a user agent. I 
therefore propose an additional grouping primarily for consumers, GUI for 
graphical user interface. GUI would include the following groupings and 
checkpoint:

Text, Color, Image, Animation and checkpoint 3.2.

This grouping would be applicable to current user agent technology like 
Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator and Opera.
