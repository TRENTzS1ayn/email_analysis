Jon,

Please consider this request to "freeze" the document before
going to last call. We are scheduled to go to last call on 
19 October (in two weeks)
and I think it is a mistake to 
continue to change the document up to the last minute. 
The editors require time to prepare the document for 
publication and to prepare other parts of the last call process.

Other than editorial changes, we should not be adding
requirements or checkpoints at this point. Doing so will
not allow proper time for reflection before the Working
Group agrees to send the document to last call, which means
"we are done".

Thank you,

 - Ian
