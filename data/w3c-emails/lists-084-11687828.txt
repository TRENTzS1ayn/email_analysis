1) Section G4 [1] talks about conformance for included SVG fragments. I
don't
   see any mention of rendering requirements for this case.

http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/CR-SVG-20000802/conform.html#ConformingSVGIncludedDocuments

2) I think it's not the SVG spec that should be concerned with how
rendering
   happens at the boundary around the SVG object - that's the realm of
the 
   englobing language (some languages may have different boundary
semantics).
