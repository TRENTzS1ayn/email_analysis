JRG: This should be 4.17 instead of 4.15, as noted above.

JRG: Great.  I included 3.2 explicitly, because I did not want to 
developers to think that the only 3.2 requirement was only for animations. 
I think this is editorial, just so it is clear to developers to satisfy 3.2 
for video and audio for the GUI label.
