Working group,
The SVG document referenced by Ian [1] does talk about scaling (zooming and 
panning) and conforming to UAAG 1.0. If we are only worried about SVG the 
scaling question seems like it is taken care of in the SVG 
specification.  The control over colors, doesn't seem to be taken care of 
in the SVG specification, so there would still be a potential hole for 
accessibility unless 4.3 and 4.4 could be slightly expanded to include 
"stylable graphics" like SVG.

The options for the group would be:
1. Consider adding the proposed checkpoints [2] or expanding the scope of 
4.3 and 4.4 to include "stylable graphics" and assume the scaling would be 
taken care of at least for SVG in the SVG document.   SVG scaling of fonts 
was raised as a PR issue[3], but not the more general issue of other 
graphic content in SVG so we have not havd a specific request from PR to 
address this issue, so process wise we would be considering a new 
requirement.  So for this to happen there would need to be strong support 
from the current working group to do this, otherwise it should be dropped 
as indicated in the next option.

2. Working group feels it doesn't have time to address the issue carefully 
or the issue is not important enough to consider before last call and the 
issue will be dropped.  In this case people in other working groups that 
the document has a dependency or from external reviewers could raise the 
issue during last call as part of their review if they feel strongly about 
it. The group then could respond to their concerns.

I urge people to comment to the list to these proposals, so that we can get 
a sense of what direction the group wants to take before 10 October 
meeting.  Let's try to use the list to help resolve these issues!

Jon
