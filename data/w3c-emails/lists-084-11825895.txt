AG::

Sorry, I am carefully ducking "the ultimate question."  I am not saying it
is sufficient or not sufficient.  

What I am saying is that what Ian found in the SVG specficiation does not
appear to require that the document containing the SVG Object make space
for the SVG object to get bigger.  If all we get when we zoom the SVG
button is a scroll region -- where the scroll bars will consume all the
space allocated for the button to begin with -- that's probably not usable.

I was not making a firm statement that an additional checkpoint is required
or is not required.  But I was asking that people decide if resizing the
graphic and forcing a reflow is important, how important, and consider if
that shouldn't be mentioned.

An alternative to a requirement to be able to resize graphics, including
their layout allocation would be to have something like the "always expand
ALT text fully" rule in IE.  Here the rule is that if the text in the SVG
buttons is requested to be larger, that the host document and application
resize the layout region allocated to the SVG object to accomodate.  Maybe
this is automatic per the specs as of today.  I am just suspicious of the
way layout is shared across formats as not well described in the format
specs, so I was not willing to say that "the format spec is sufficient"
until we had a clearer model from the Working Group of the functionality
desired.  Then we can give a little concerning what is required if what is
desired is hard but there is an easy alternative that basically works.
