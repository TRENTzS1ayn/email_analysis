[Len, Bruce: the reference thread is at

According to Bruce Bailey's report 

  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/2000OctDec/0012.html

if you can force the text up in size you have solved the P2 problem.  Icons
don't seem to be the same severity of problem.

This would sound as though, modulo a possible P3 gap, you are probably
covered as is.

I am copying Len and Bruce on this as I feel a bit over my depth.  I don't
have that good a background in low vision.

On second thought that bit about icons is not so strange.  Icons are analog
encoding.  This means you would expect them to degrade gradually on
low-pass filtering where all you get is an outline, more or less.  Text
doesn't look like it sounds.  You have to correctly identify the letters.
Fuzz text and all the letters without ascenders or descenders look alike;
that's an awful lot of them!  Symbolic codes have better error rejection
for low error rates.  That's why digital and FM before it deliver high
fidelity.  But like the little girl with the little curl; when they are
bad... watch out!
