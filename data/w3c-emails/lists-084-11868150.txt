1) I could imagine a checkpoint (though I don't think we should add it
at this point)
   that the user be able to control all colors in a document, within the
same range
   available to the author. The current UAAG 1.0 only covers
foreground/background 
   colors for text and not for graphical objects such as splines. Here's
why I don't
   think we should address this issue at this time: we have not had any
discussions
   at all about the usability or accessibility requirements of
overriding colors for
   portions of images or graphics. I don't think we should attack a new
problem 10
   days before going to last call. It can wait until another version.

2) SVG colors can be specified with CSS style sheets and so allow user
override of
   author and user agent defaults.
