Since the group has required support for a keyboard API, I don't think the 
we should allow any type of conformance if a user agent cannot support a 
keyboard API.  The group could address this issue in a future version of 
the document.

Currently the conformance section makes the following statement:
"Checkpoints that refer to the keyboard always apply. The subject must 
implement the standard API for the keyboard unless the operating system 
does not offer one."

I think we should state:
"Checkpoints that refer to the keyboard always apply. The subject must 
implement the standard keyboard API.  If an operating system or user agent 
does not offer or support a keyboard API, then the user agent cannot 
conform to these guidelines."
