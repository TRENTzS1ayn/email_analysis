1. Clearly state in the abstract the scope how built-in accessibility and 
compatibility with assistive technologies is the basis for improved 
accessibility:

2. I am not sure what a "series of strokes" means for rendering text in 
Guideline 1 introduction

3. Guideline 2 Introduction: Change "Web content providers" to 
authors.  Seems clear to me.

4. Checkpoint 2.1, what about META comments and other information in the 
HEAD block, is that part of the DOM? Is there anything in XML like the Head 
block that contains META information?

5. Checkpoint 2.3. In the note the third example need some more words, like 
"the user to"

6. Guideline 7 Introduction, 1st para, 2nd sentence: Use "efficiently" 
instead of "quickly"

7. Guideline 7 Introduction, 3rd para: add a reference to visual 
impairments need for direct access also

8. Guideline 8 Introduction: Add to list scollbars for position in a 
document, relationships among elements like tables

9. Guideline 11 Introduction: Change "mouse emulation key strokes" to 
"mouse emulation through key strokes"

10. Conformance section 3.7: Do we need to specify what level of WCAG the 
conformance claim must satisfy.  I suggest double-A, like UAAG.
