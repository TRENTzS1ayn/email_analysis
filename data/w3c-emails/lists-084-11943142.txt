I suggest some changes to the Abstract.

Old (29 September 2000):

"Abstract"

"The guidelines in this document explain to developers how to design user
agents that are accessible to people with disabilities. User agents include
graphical desktop browsers, multimedia players, text browsers, voice
browsers, plug-ins, and other assistive technologies that provide access to
Web content. Virtually all the requirements in this document apply to
mainstream graphical browsers and multimedia players. Many of the
requirements also apply to other user agents, such as text browsers, voice
browsers, and assistive technologies. Following the principles presented in
this document will help make the Web accessible to users with disabilities
and will benefit all users."

"Abstract"

"This document provides guidelines to help developers design Web browsers
that are more accessible to people with disabilities. Virtually all the
requirements in this document apply to mainstream graphical desktop browsers
and many of the requirements apply to browsers that have different or more
limited media presentation capabilities, such as text-only browsers and
audio-only browsers. A valid claim for conformance to this document is
expected to be a useful, though imperfect, indicator of accessibility. The
document places strong emphasis on communication with other software,
including assistive technologies. Although some known accessibility
capabilities (e.g., Braille support, visual object enlargement, some
navigation via speech output) are outside the scope of the document, some of
these capabilities can be met through assistive technologies. For many
people with disabilities, a conformant Web browser supplemented with such
assistive technologies is likely to provide an appropriate accessibility
solution."

Comment 1:

Since the document does not define a clear end-state of "accessibility", it
is not correct to characterize the document as telling developers "how to
design user agents that are accessible". We are mainly, if not "only",
telling them what direction to move in. 

Comment 2:

I use the term "Web browser" because I think that it communicates better. If
we just say that, then we don't have to confuse things with the definition
of user agent. This change sure seems to make things clearer.

Comment 3:

I think that it is critical that the Abstract properly make clear that we
recognize that there are known pieces of the accessibility puzzle that are
outside the scope of the document. 

Comment 4:

I avoided the term "built-in" accessibility features because I think that it
will lead to confusion about whether one means 'built-in to the browser' or
'built-in to the subject of the claim.'

"Abstract"

"This document provides guidelines to help developers design Web browsers
that are more accessible to people with disabilities. Virtually all the
requirements in this document apply to mainstream graphical desktop browsers
and many of the requirements apply to browsers that have different or more
limited media presentation capabilities, such as text-only browsers and
audio-only browsers. In some cases a Web browser that conforms to this
document will constitute an appropriate accessibility solution. In other
cases, the conforming Web browser must be supplemented by assistive
technologies providing capabilities that are beyond the scope of this
document." 

Comment 1:

This one is shortened.


There will be more to come soon (tonight or tomorrow) on scope and
limitations.
