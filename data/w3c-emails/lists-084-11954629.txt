1) The UA is required (in all cases) to implement a keyboard API (no
conformance
possible without this).

2) The UA is required to implement the standard system API for the
keyboard if
one exists. 

I think we shouldn't say "On that particular operating system, you can't
have any user agents at all that conform to UAAG 1.0 since there is no
standard API
for the keyboard." It does make it harder on AT developers to
communicate since
they don't have a standard to follow, but it is possible to have
combinations of software
that work together. For that reason -- it's not absolutely impossible --
I think that
conformance should be possible in case 2.
