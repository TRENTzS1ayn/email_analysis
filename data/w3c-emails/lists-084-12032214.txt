Re: Scope, Intro, Inside/Outside Analysis -- Correction

This memo corrects (and expands) a section of my memo entitled
"Scope, Intro, Inside/Outside Analysis".

It replaces Assumption #2 with three other assumptions 1.A, 1.B., and 1.C.

Old:

"2. Utility of Partial Coverage of All Accessibility Requirements"

"This document is based on the assumption that it is worthwhile to make 
progress in accessibility of user agents even though one cannot meet the 
access needs of every person with a disability. Some disabilities -- such as 
severe cognitive disabilities -- may cause accessibility barriers that 
cannot yet be overcome through modifications to either Web content or the 
user agents that retrieve and render Web content. While this document 
attempts to address the access requirements of major disability groups, it 
does not meet the access need of every individual with a disability."

New:

"1.A. Partial Coverage of Population with Disabilities"

"This document is based on the assumption that it is worthwhile to make 
progress in accessibility of user agents even though one cannot meet the 
access needs of every person with a disability. Some disabilities -- such as 
severe cognitive disabilities -- may cause accessibility barriers that 
cannot yet be overcome through modifications to either Web content or the 
user agents that retrieve and render Web content. While this document 
attempts to address the access requirements of major disability groups, it 
does not meet the access need of every individual with a disability."

"1.B. General Consensus About a 'Full Minimal' Rendering of Content"

"This document assumes that there exists general consensus about what may be 
termed a 'full minimal' rendering of Web content. Such a solution would 
specify the basic kinds of capabilities that are both important and feasible 
to provide given the state of technology and what is known about 
disabilities. Elements of such a full minimal rendering of content might be 
informally summarized as follows."
"a. Basic content types such as text, graphics, tables, animations, video, 
and audio ought to be presentable to people with disabilities in their 
'default' (or 'initial') renderings (i.e., audio objects as audio output, 
graphics as visually displayed objects, etc.).
"b. Multimedia presentations such as videos with sound and animations with 
sound should be presentable with auditory descriptions and captions."
"c. Text elements (including text equivalents) must be presentable as 
visually-displayed text, synthesized speech, and braille."
"d. Users ought to be able to control and/or configure major presentation 
characteristics of media (size, volume, fonts, replay, slow, color, etc.)."
"e. User agents ought to be able to communicate well with other software 
(including assistive technologies) so that it will be easy to add new 
capabilities."

"1.C. A Scope Less Than the Full Minimal Solution

"This document assumes that it is valuable and appropriate to establish 
requirements having a scope that is somewhat less than the full minimal 
solution to user agent accessibility challenges. For example, requirements 
such as braille display support, some navigation using synthesized speech 
output, some resizing and color-modification of visual objects are outside 
the scope of this document. Nevertheless, such capabilities can might be 
provided by assistive technologies, at least in the mainstream desktop 
environment."
