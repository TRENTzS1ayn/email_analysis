JRG: Comment

This is to vague on how a user agent is more accessible.  It is not clear 
when assistive technology will be need.

New:

"Abstract"
"This document provides guidelines to help developers design Web browsers 
that are more accessible to people with disabilities. Virtually all the 
requirements in this document apply to mainstream graphical desktop 
browsers and many of the requirements apply to browsers that have different 
or more limited media presentation capabilities, such as text-only browsers 
and audio-only browsers. In for people who can use the input and output 
devices supported by a conforming Web browser this document will constitute 
an appropriate accessibility solution. For users that cannot use the 
supported input and output devices (i.e switch input, voice recognition, 
speech, refreshable Braille) of the conforming Web browser, the browser 
will support for assistive technologies that provide the input and output 
devices that are usable by the user."
