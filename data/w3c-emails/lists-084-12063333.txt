"Accessibility Strategy"

"A user agent that conforms to these guidelines will be tend to be (a) 
directly accessible through _built-in accessibility features_ and (b) 
indirectly accessible through _compatibility with other software_ 
(especially assistive technologies) that can provide other important 
accessibility features that are beyond the scope of this document."

Jon Gunderson thinks the following would be clearer:
"Accessibility Strategy"

"A user agent that conforms to these guidelines will be tend to be directly 
accessible through the input and output devices supported by the user agent 
and indirectly more accessible through compatibility with other software 
(especially assistive technologies) that can provide support for other 
input and output devices that are not directly supported by the user agent. "
