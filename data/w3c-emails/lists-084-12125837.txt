The "standard" API doesn't come from the UA, only the OS. Therefore, if
the OS doesn't have one, I still think the UA should be able to conform
by providing at least one API for the keyboard. This means that ATs will 
be able to communicate, just not through a "standard" API (since there
isn't one).
