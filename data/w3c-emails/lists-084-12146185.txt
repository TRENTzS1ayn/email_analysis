Ian,
It seems like we are saying the same thing but with different words.  If a 
standard API for the keyboard is not available, the user agent developer 
could develop their own keyboard API and make sure it is available to 
assistive technology through a some type of exporting process.  Although 
this seems like a stretch of the current guidelines to me, as long as the 
group thinks it is ok we move forward with this assumption.
