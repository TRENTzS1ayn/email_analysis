Ian,
The differences in table navigation techniques is the result of the input 
and output technologies supported.  That is the primary reason we require 
support of assistive technologies, is to offer the user other ways to use 
the user agent.  I think that we need to be explicit to developers that 
they are required to make the input and output devices they support 
accessible to people who can use those input and output devices.  I think 
that it is important to state this to comsumers so that they have 
reasonable expectations on what a conforming user agent can provide 
them.  I think it is too ambiguous to say some things will be built-in and 
some things will be available through AT, with out a clarification of what 
is built-in and what is not.

Jon
