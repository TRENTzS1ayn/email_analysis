JRG: Basically you just want to add the second note.  I didn't see any 
other changes in 2.3.  I don't think we need the second note, we could use 
the second note for almost every checkpoint.

JRG: This option is unacceptable to me, we what the text as part of the 
interface for people who may not be able to see images or hear sounds.  An 
API is insufficient.

JRG: This is more acceptable to me and seems to make it clearer the text 
needs to be part of the user interface and not just an API.

JRG: I don't beleive 3.2 and 8.4 are considered repair checkpoints.  3.2 is 
about user choices of what content they want rendered and 8.4 is about 
creating an outline view of the document.  These are not repair functions 
in my mind.  I beleive the only repair checkpoint is 2.5.

JRG:

1. Point a is an implementation detail for the developer to decide.  From 
an accessibility stand point what difference does it make if it is done 
during load or a post load?

2. Point b: We already discussed this and the group found advantages and 
disadvantages to this approach.  Ian took an action item to add the 
discussion to the techniques document.  The group is not going to take any 
stand at this time.

3. Author supplied content is required to be made available through the 
DOM.  In this case there is no content available from the author.  Repair 
information from the user agent needs to be made available through APIs 
and/or the DOM if the developer sees it to their advantage for accessibility.

JRG:
Point a: From a accessibility point of view what difference does it make to 
the user with a disability?
Point b: Again see previous comments, but in this case I would say no, 
since an AT may support the language and should have access to the authors 
content.
Point c: Yes anythig rendered to the user must be available through an API.

JRG: This is not a repair checkpoint.  This was part of a WCAG requirement 
for image maps and other collections of images that result in a composite 
image.  The author intentionally using a null or "" equivalent to indicate 
that an image is part of a larger image.  One of the images in the set of 
images has equivalents describing the composite image.
