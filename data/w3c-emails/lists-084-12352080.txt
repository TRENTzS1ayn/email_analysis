  Ian,
  
  I agree that your wording is better. In this case less is more.

  Subject:  Proposed simplification of checkpoint 8.7
  
  
  
  Hello,
  
  In the 29 September draft  [1], checkpoint 8.7 reads:
  
    8.7 Provide a mechanism for highlighting and identifying
        (through a standard interface where available) the
        current viewport, selection, and content focus.
  
  I'd like to propose the following simplification:
  
  <NEW>
    8.7 Provide a mechanism for highlighting the
        current viewport, selection, and content focus.
  </NEW>
  
  Here's why:
  
  1) I'm not sure what "identification" means. I think it
     means "provide a selection mechanism", which is covered
     by checkpoint 8.6
  
  2) The new version of 8.7 is only about highlighting through
     the UI. Checkpoints 5.4 and 5.5 cover communication of selection
     and focus information through an API. Checkpoint 5.4 covers
     the "standard interface" requirement.
  
  Therefore, I think the change simplifies 8.7 and all requirements
  are still covered.
  
   - Ian
