Jon and Ian,

Could you ask what other API/features vendors would like the DOM API to
support? I am spearheading the requirements for DOM 3 in the WAI PF group.
The accessibility issues list I presented to the DOM working group is being
used as the base for the DOM 3 requirements document. One thing that has
helped me to create this list is based on our work with HPR 3.0 and using
the DOM. I would like to hear other requirements from vendors so that we
could extend this list.

Thanks,

Rich

as the means of accessing WWW content?

6. Indicate which of the following resources would help you in using or
deciding to use the DOM for accessing WWW content.

6.a Demonstration code?
6.b WWW based tutorial materials on DOM capabilities and programming
examples?
6.c Face-to-face workshop on DOM capabilities and programming examples?
6.d Access to people with expertise in DOM capabilities and programming?
6.e Any other resources that would help you?
