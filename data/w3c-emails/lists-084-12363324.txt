I would amend my earlier definition of "user agent" to make clearer that the
user agent (when referring to the subject of the claim) is about instances
of a "Web browser plus zero or more additional components". The mention of
the word "components" reinforces the concept of components as used in the
document. See my amended language and the original memo are attached below.

New (amended):

> "2. The subject of a conformance claim for this document, 
> i.e., software for 
> which a claim is made.
This subject will ordinarily consist of a Web browser 
plus zero or more additional components.
This is the most common use of the 
> term in this 
> document and is the usage in the _checkpoints_. A _conforming 
> user agent_ is 
> a user agent for which the claim is _valid_. In order to 
> emphasize this

> uses the term 
> 'subject' or 'subject of the claim'.>
