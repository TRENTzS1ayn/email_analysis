Jon,

As I think about it, I think the following checkpoints apply
to all user agents (whatever the content type rendered): 4.16, 4.17,
8.2, and 8.3 (details below). Checkpoints 4.16 and 4.17 are about
selection and focus (which are independent of content type). Checkpoints
8.2 and 8.3 are about links (which are also independent of content
type). Therefore, I think these checkpoints should be removed from
all content type label sets since they apply to all UAs. I think 
(but am not absolutely sure) that the way the checkpoints are 
written, they already take into account applicability (e.g., they
say "for graphical user agents...").

Checkpoints 4.16, 4.17, 8.2, and 8.3:

4.16 Allow the user to configure how the selection is highlighted 
    (e.g., foreground and background color, voice pitch, etc.). 
    For graphical viewports, offer at least three
    rendering options, including colors and fonts. 
    Allow the user to select from among the range of system colors and
fonts. 


4.17 Allow the user to configure how the content focus is highlighted 
    (e.g., foreground and background color, voice pitch, etc.).
    For graphical viewports, offer at least three
    rendering options, including colors and fonts. For graphical
viewports, 
    allow the user to select from among the range of system colors and
fonts. 
    The default focus highlight mechanism must be different from the
default s
    election highlight mechanism.

8.2 Render recently visited links in a distinct style and allow the user
to 
    configure this style. For graphical viewports, offer at least three 
    rendering options, including colors and
    fonts. Allow the user to select from among the range of system
colors and fonts.

8.3 Render in a distinct style those links that have been marked up to
indicate that 
    following them will involve a fee and allow the user to configure
this style. 
    For graphical viewports, offer at least three rendering options,
including 
   colors and fonts. Allow the user to select from among the range of
system colors 
   and fonts.
