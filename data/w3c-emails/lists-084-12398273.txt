Ian,
It seems to me they were included in your original proposal because they 
had minimal requirements for output for text.  Since these checkpoints had 
minimal requirements it seems that highlighting them in the labeled groups 
makes sense.  It seems that we are missing minimal requirements for speech 
rendering for 8.2, 8.3, 4.15 and 4.16.

Jon
