Here's my new reasoning: the selection (or focus) need not only be for
text. For instance, a selected image may have a border around it.
Similarly,
links may have text or non-text content. So for all four checkpoints,
the
content type doesn't matter.

I agree that we don't have minimal speech requirements for the four
checkpoints in question. However, as we resolved in a previous
teleconference,
I think that we should not refine our speech requirements any further
for
this document since there are other W3C WGs working on voice/speech
issues.
