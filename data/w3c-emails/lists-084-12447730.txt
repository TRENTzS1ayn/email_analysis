Hello,

The 29 September draft [1] includes definitions of "document
source" and "documetn source view":

 | In this document, the term document source refers to the 
 | data that the user agent receives as the direct result of 
 | a request for a Web resource. A document source view 
 | represents all or part of a document in a way that exposes 
 | the markup language(s) used to build the Web resource.  
 | A source view often presents textual representations of 
 | content. 

The term is only used twice in the document, in the note
after checkpoint 2.1:

 | A document source view is an important part of a
 | solution for providing access to content, but is not a 
 | sufficient solution on its own for all content.

and in the definition of "document object". Here's the proposal:

1) Delete the term "document source" from the spec
   and saying "document object" instead in the note after 2.1:

 | A document object view is an important part of a
 | solution for providing access to content, but is not a 
 | sufficient solution on its own for all content.

2) Create a new definition of "document object view" based on
   "document source view":

 | A document object view represents all or part of the
 | document object in a way that exposes the markup language(s) 
 | used to build it. A document object view often presents
 | textual representations of content.

3) In the definition of "document object" change:
 
    "This data generally comes from the document source..."
  to:
    "This data generally comes from markup..."

SUMMARY: 
 - The term "document source" is hard to define.
 - We can get along with out it and use terms we already define.

Thank you,

 - Ian
