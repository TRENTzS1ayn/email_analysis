Ian,
1.  We don't have minimal requirements for images on 8.2, 8.3, 4.15 and 
4.16.  It seems like we should say something about that.  I think we should 
have for these checkpoints more of a description of why some element types 
have minimal requirements and other don't.  What do you think?

2. The labels part of section 3.4 are informational in nature.  The current 
wording "Portions of the following checkpoints related to" seems to 
indicate that the checkpoint is not limited to certain element type.  I 
think that we should include elements that we want to highlight to 
developers for specific consideration on a checkpoint and in this case 8.2, 
8.3, 4.15 and 4.16. I think we could ask developers in last call if they 
think some should be removed or do they think they were helpful.

Jon
