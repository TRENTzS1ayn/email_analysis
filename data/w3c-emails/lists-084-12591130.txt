Any minority opinion that a group member wishes to have documented and 
included in the last call announcement needs to be sent to the list no 
later than 18 October.  If you are planning to submit a minority opinion it 
would please the chair and the editors to at least know the intention 
before 18 October in the preparation of last call materials.
