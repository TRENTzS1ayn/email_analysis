Al,
I think that the issue of having different representations of the same 
information and that they are all equally valid is an important point the 
guidelines should stress.  I support language (especially for checkpoint 
2.3) that emphasizes this concept in the guidelines.  I like Al's proposal 
for checkpoint 2.3[1].

Jon
