Hello,

I've put up a meeting page [1] for the November face-to-face
meeting at AOL in Washington, D.C. (linked from the WG home page).

Please register online before 2 November [2]. 

We will continue to fill out the meeting page
as we receive more information about the meeting. For now, 
Jon's primary suggestion is to fly to Dulles airport rather
than National since Dulles is much closer to the meeting
location.

 - Ian

P.S. This meeting does not yet appear on the W3C Member calendar.
We are awaiting final confirmation, after which I will ask
that the meeting be listed on the calendar.
