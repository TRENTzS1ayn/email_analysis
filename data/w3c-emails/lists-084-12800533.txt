Hello,

Here's an attempt to summarize at least two issues being raised
and my views:

 a) Issue 1: Can all equivalents be entirely symmetric? 

    I believe the answer to this is no, and that means that
    the next question is moot: "Should WAI require that all
    equivalents be symmetric?"

    [For the purposes of this email, sets of content A, B, and C 
    are "symmetric equivalents" if, with the appropriate 
    environment and software, they all provide exactly the 
    same browsing experience to some users. I suspect that there
    will be interesting commentary on this definition...]

 b) Issue 2: Should we use another word than "equivalent" to
    describe relationships that may not be symmetric for the
    user?

    No. Refer to proposal below.

ISSUE 1: Can all equivalents be entirely symmetric? 

Al writes:
  "The order [among alternatives] is often present, but it 
   comes in addition to the equivalency we care about, 
   not as an intrinsic part."

I disagree. Listening to a symphony is not the same as reading
a musical score of that symphony (probably for everyone, including
gifted musicians, since there is interpretation in performance).
I don't believe that there's a "symmetric equivalent" for a
recorded or live symphony. Therefore, if I compose a symphony,
any attempt to provide an equivalent will necessarily result in
an imperfect equivalent (or alternative if you prefer to avoid
the term equivalent here). I think there is a lot 
of content for which the author simply cannot provide a 
browsing experience that is "exactly the same" for some 
users (including some users with disabilities). Al writes:

   "there is some information that is represented in each
    [alternative] that is the same in both [/all]."  
    This relationship is symmetrical.  This relationship is 
    general. This relationship applies to an image and its alt text.

Yes, there will be "some information" captured in both pieces 
of content, but not all information (due to inherent differences
between visual data and human language). So I disagree that
the relationship is symmetrical. 

I propose that we should not attempt to apply a strict
mathematical framework when talking about "equivalence"
in WAI Guidelines. Or, please propose a definition
of "symmetric" that allows one to tell mathematically
that an image and its text equivalent are symmetric
in meaning.

ISSUE 2: Should we use another word than "equivalent" to
    describe relationships that may not be symmetric?


2a) If we use the term "equivalent", will we confuse people?
    
    We may confuse some people, but if we explain that
    we are not using the term in its strict mathematical
    sense, I think we will be ok. As Eric has pointed out,
    the dictionary supports a non-mathematical usage.

2b) Should we continue to use the word "equivalent"
    (which is already used without a requirement
     for symmetry in WCAG 1.0)? 

    I don't have particularly strong feelings about this,
    but I think we should keep the term at least until
    we have three Recommendations that use it in the
    same way.
    

PROPOSAL

1) State clearly in the definition of "equivalent" that
   we don't mean mathematical equivalence. We should state that:

   (a) where possible, equivalents should be symmetric
      (i.e., two sets of content should provide exactly
      the same experience to some users).

   (b) symmetry is impossible in some cases, and ordered
       relationships will result: authors must provide 
       "the closest you can get to equivalent".

2) Adopt most of Eric's proposed checkpoint 2.3 [1]. I think that Eric's
  "_equivalency and similar relationships_" introduces unnecessary
   ambiguity. I think it suffices to say in the definition of 
   "equivalent" that the goal should be true symmetry.

  [1]
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0092.html

3) Delete "equivalency target" from the document (since only used
   in the glossary based on Eric's rewrite of 2.3).
