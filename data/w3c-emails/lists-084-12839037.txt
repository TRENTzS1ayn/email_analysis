Just for preliminaries, let me say that I think we agree 100% on the
facts.? It
is just the theories, and how theory and logic plays in the application of the
checkpoint, that we haven't quite synchronized on.

Likewise for the proposed implementation in the document, there is 98%
agreement.? I have some wordsmithing to offer, but I think that may be
acceptable to you as a friendly amendment.

AG::

Nobody is asking the pairs to be exactly alike.? What is being asked is that
the pattern that they are checked against is symmetrical (common content in
different forms).? Matching that pattern is enough to trigger the user-control
requirements of checkpoint 2.3.? The rest, whether there are articulable
differences or orderings among the equivalents, does not factor in whether 2.3
applies or not.? Sometimes there are and sometimes there aren't.? The options
may be wildly different.? But in some cases, such as subtitles which are
all in
second languages relative to the audio track, there is no intrinsic pecking
order among the choices.? The purpose is to write a rule which fits the full
range of cases where we want it to apply.? 

The point is not that it is important to thump symmetry in the language of the
checkpoint.? The point is that the condition we wish to apply is "common
[information] content in different forms."? [Not _identical_ information
content in different encodings,]? Because there are valid cases of this rule
where there is no proper (intrinsic to the information) ordering among the
alternatives, it is good not to thump asymmetry as though it were true in all
cases.? I am just trying not to purge the rule of the appearance that it
depends on the existence of a prime/alternate polarization of the
relationship.? The rule applies more generally than this common case.? So we
should state the general rule.? 

The equivalency we are talking about is still pretty rough in many
instances.? 

But this is the point of the Webster quote that Eric gave us.? People talk
about plane figures as equivalent when they fail to be isometric, i.e.
identical, but still have the same area, for example.? The point is that
equivalent connotes a level of approximation or abstraction in the similarity
relationship, quite different from equality which would be equivalent in every
detail.? The term 'equivalent,' even in its generic, symmetric sense, does not
mean 'identical.'

So when I am told, "we shouldn't treat the equivalency as symmetrical because
it is not an identity," I don't really know where to turn.

Identity guarantees equivalency, but not the reverse.

Nowhere, in arguing that the language of checkpoint 2.3 should avoid implying
asymmetry in the equivalence relationship, am I suggesting that the
language of
2.3 should imply that all equivalents are equal.?

This is the whole point.? The order relationship that matters is one that only
the user knows.? That is why they have to have access to the controls.? The
rule that the browser follows cannot presume to know the ordering in the
user's
assessment.? So the browser threats the options as all available,
symmetrically, to the user without prejudice.

AG::

An imperfect match or imperfect correspondence.? Absolutely.? But a true
fit to
the symmetric, rough-equivalence relationship, still.

By the way, expert musicians can get more out of reading a score, even in
Braille symbology, than the tonedeaf or musical illiterate gets out of hearing
a live performance by a world class symphony orchestra.? The quality of the
experience is relative to both the user and the data.? You can only make
statements about the data in the absence of an observer by doing numbers games
across the demographics of potential observers.? It's an interesting game, but
not relevant here.? All we need is a statement of the tripwire for when the
User Agent has to give the user the option as to what version they are
presented.

You are confusing the full particulars of a given pair with the abstract
relationship that the pair is tested against, to see whether to kick in the
2.3
consequences.  But no matter; lots of others will be confused unless we
emphasize the roughness of the equivalence.  [read on...]

This mostly works for me.? Let me offer the following wordsmithing, however.

Do talk about "the other equivalent" or "the equivalent already displayed" or
some such language, as opposed to (A,B) distinguished names for different ends
of the relationship.

In separating people from a tendency to interpret the equivalency too
strongly,
we probably shouldn't talk about what we don't mean as 'symmetry.'? 'Equality'
comes closer to capturing it.? For example, we could say: 

"The equivalency can be pretty rough.? While the goal in providing equivalents
should be comparable functionality, to count as an equivalent something simply
has to offer a feasible alternative means of getting at some of the same
information."

Something more or less like that statement will, I hope, make what we
expect in
the way of equivalency clear.
