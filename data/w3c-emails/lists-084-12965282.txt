W3C has scheduled an all working group meeting in Boston from 26 February 
to 2 March 2001.  There will be an all day plenary session on February 
28th.  The user agent working group indicated interest in holding FTF and 
joint FTF Meetings at the meeting.  The working group needs to respond with 
the following information by 26 October:

1. What days does it prefer to meet (26-27 Feb) or (1-2 March)?
2. What working groups does it want joint meetings with (i.e. Mobile, Voice 
and DOM)?
3. How many people would attend?

We will discuss this at the telecon on Thursday.
