There has been an exchange of messages on the list recently related to the 
concept and definition of equivalency and its potential impact on the 
wording of some checkpoints, notably checkpoint 2.3.

My review of the issue is as follows:
1. No new requirements for UAAG have been requested in the current proposals
2. The proposals are basically on definitions and the concept of 
equivalency, including the concept of symmetrical and asymmetrical 
relationships between alternatives.
3. There are dependencies with other groups, notably PF and WCAG

Therefore I propose the following to move forward:
1. Keep current wording of all current checkpoints as resolved up until 12 
October
2. Put this issue on the last call issues list as soon as the document goes 
to last call
3. Ask for input and maybe even request some joint telecon time with PF and 
WCAG on this issue during last call
4. Continue discussion on the UA list
