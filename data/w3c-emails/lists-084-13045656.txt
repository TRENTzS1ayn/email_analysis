I would agree with Gregory. But, I want to offer yet another reason.

If triple a comploiance AAA, is meaningful, then it should be
required. Surely, defining three levels of compliance was not an idle
academic exercise. As Gregory notes, access to documentation is
critical. So, if the WAI believes in its own work, it should support it by
requiring that it be implemented.
