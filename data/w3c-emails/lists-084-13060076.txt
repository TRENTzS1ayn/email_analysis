I agree that we should support the use of WCAG triple-A compliance. But I
would prefer to see triple-A compliance (particularly in the case of WCAG) as
a requirement for triple-A conformance to UAAG, or perhaps double-A
conformance, rather than a requirement for single-A conformance. 

A double-A compliant tool is not making any claim that it is particularly
good for people with disabilities to use, just that it is possible to be more
or less effective using it.

A level-A conformant tool doesn't even make the claim that it is possible to
use it effectively (in the sense that we think of somebody being able to do
things in a "reasonable" amount of time and with a reasonable amount of
effort). It just claims that it isn't made impossible.

My proposal is therefore to resolve this by adding a checkpoint at Priority
level 2 or 3 (according to how importantly the groups rates ease of
documentation use as a precondition of effective use of a tool), more or less
as follows:

 Ensure that at least one version of the product documentation conforms to 
 at least Level Triple-A of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 
 [WCAG10]. [Priority 2or3]

  I would agree with Gregory. But, I want to offer yet another reason.
  
  If triple a comploiance AAA, is meaningful, then it should be
  required. Surely, defining three levels of compliance was not an idle
  academic exercise. As Gregory notes, access to documentation is
  critical. So, if the WAI believes in its own work, it should support it by
  requiring that it be implemented.
