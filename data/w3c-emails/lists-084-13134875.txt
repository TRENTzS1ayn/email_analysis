The argument that supports a P2 requirement is as follows.

Documentation, as Gregory has pointed out, and the group has recognised in
the initial checkpoint, is a vital part of the toolkit a user can bring in
theri attempts to make use of a piece of software. If that documentation is
easy to use, then it removes a substantial barrier to use of the tool.

  Actually, let me change that opinion: if we agree to this P3
  checkpoint at today's teleconference, I would support it. Otherwise,
  it will hold up going to last call and I will object to adding it.
