Gregory has registered a minority opinion on three issues the group reached 
consensus on.  The working group has resolved the issues in a previous 
telecons and through discussions on the list.  The group will not revisit 
these issues unless they are part of comments received from last call 
reviewers or directed to by the director of the W3C as part of his review 
of the document.  The minority opinions will be forwarded at Gregory's 
request with the last call announcement and reviewers can use the 
information in the consideration of their comments.

So at this time we do not need to discuss in the working group on how to 
resolve these issues.  Gregory's opinions were known at the time the group 
reached consensus and the group did not agree at that time on these 
particular opinions.  I should note that many of Gregory's other opinions 
have been adopted by the group and he has contributed immensely to the 
development of the guidelines.   As chair of the working I would prefer not 
to have minority opinions forwarded with the second last call document 
since I think it weakens the document in the process to move it to 
recommendation status and ultimately to actual goal of implementation by 
developers, but the process provides this type of relief to working group 
members who feel strongly about particular issues that were not resolved to 
their satisfaction.
