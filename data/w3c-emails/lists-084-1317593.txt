Dear all,

I have had meetings with some developers this week, most notably from
Internet Explorer and Real Player. With luck we will have a rough
conformance evaluation from each of those groups, but there were some
checkpoints that raised questions, so I am listing those here. (They have
the same order as in the checklist of the 25 january draft).

Charles

Checkpoint 2.2: For presentations that require user interaction within a
specified time interval, allow the user to configure the time interval

Does a pause function satisfy this?

Checkpoint 3.3: allow the user to turn on and off rendering of video

In a window-based environment, is it satisfactory to hide the rendering
window, or does there have to be control over the video rendering
separately to other parts (e.g. caption track)

Checkpoint 4.5: Allow the user to slow the rate of audio, video and
animations

In the case of animations, does this mean a requirement to step through or
slow the speed as well as being able to turn it off? (My own thought is
yes - if there is content in an animation it is important to step through
it).

CHeckpoint 7.2: For user agents that offer a browsing history mechanism,
when the user returns to a previous viewport restore the point of regard
in the viewport.

In a timed presentation does this mean return to the time that the user
was at (where possible - it wouldn't necessairly work in live streaming
for example)

Checkpoint 1.5: Ensure that the uesr interfaces provides information
through redundant output modes

This could be worded a bit more clearly.

Checkpoint 6.2: Conform to W3C specifications when they are appropriate
for a task

It is a bit unclear how to verify when the specification is appropriate to
the task. Is the requirement to conform to the specification, or is it to
use appropriate W3C specifications for graphics if you render graphics, or
is it both requirements? (Actually, if it means use W3C specifications
does it mean exclusively, or does it mean include handlig of those?)

Checkpoint 10.7: Allow the user to configure the User agent through a
profile

It is not clear what the minimum satisfaction is - allowing the user to
configure their name? The window size? at least both of those? Use a local
CSS stylesheet?

Checkpoint 8.4: Make available to the user information that will help the
user decide whether to follow the link.

Does this mean make available all the information the tool has? Or just
some of it?

Checkpoint 10.8: Provide default input configurations for frequently
performed tasks

There is by definition a default input configuration. The wording of the
checkpoint itself (rather than the additional information) should make it
explicit that what is required is a "simple, obvious, rapid method" to
activate the functionality.
