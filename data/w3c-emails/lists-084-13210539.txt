aloha, ian!

i do recall jon's argument, but it obviously failed to convince me that 
double-A compliance is sufficient, especially in light of the importance of 
documentation to users with disabilities, hence my objection...

this isn't a P2 or P3 issue -- it is a P1 issue, and if my objection holds 
up the document, that is an unfortunate, but necessary, evil, as incomplete 
and inaccessible documentation it is one of the most consistent complaints 
from users with disabilities, and more stringent requirements in this area 
are one of the most common requests that i field from users with 
disabilities as soon as they discover that i am actively involved in WAI 
work...

not a politic answer, i realize, but this isn't about politics--it's about 
accessibility...
