Hello,

I've published a new version of the UAAG 1.0 Guidelines and
Techniques based on recent edits and resolutions. I do not
expect this draft to change substantially before being sent
to last call (probably Monday). 

However, there is a substantial change to the document that 
deserves review, even if it does not affect the requirements (
of the document. Section 1.2 is no longer a summary of the 
principles from which the guidelines derived, but a discussion of 
the scope of this document. I have made every effort to rewrite this
section based on the following:

 a) The previous introductory text had become "stale" with
    respect to changes made to the guidelines. As written, it
    added little to the document and even seemed to get in the
    way of the guidelines, which are much improved.

 b) We resolved at the 12 October teleconference [3] to incorporate
    some edited version of what Eric and Jon have written
    about the scope of the document. The new section 1.2 is the 
    result of this resolution.

 c) The parts of the old section 1.2 that did not simply summarize
    the guidelines, notably those parts about installation, have
    been preserved and seem more in place in the new 1.2.

I would like to move this document to last call with only
editorial changes from this draft. However, if anyone has violent
objections to 1.2, please speak up before Monday 1pm Eastern Time.
I will attempt to integrate small editorial changes (typos,
small bug fixes) before going to last call. For more substantial
editorial proposals, please send them to the list, but I don't
think they will be incorporated until version of the document
after last call (and if they are editorial, it won't hurt if they 
wait). I will make available shortly the list of changes [4] in 
this version.

Thank you,

 - Ian

NOTES:
 a) You may not have access to the documents immediately. This
    is due to W3C mirroring.
 b) I haven't done any external link checking on this document;
    I will before going to last call.
