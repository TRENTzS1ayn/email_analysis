5.1 Provide programmatic read access to HTML and XML content by conforming 
to the W3C Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2 Core and HTML Specifications 
and exporting the interfaces they define. [Priority 1]

a. Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.0 for MS-Windows provides access to at 
least DOM level 1 through a COM interface. Once source of the 
implementation completeness of DOM level 1 specification can be found at:
http://xw2k.sdct.itl.nist.gov/dom/index.html

b. Amaya supports DOM.  No information on DOM level supported or exporting 
of the DOM to other applications
http://www.w3.org/Amaya/Activity.html

c. Mozzilla supports DOM level 1 and provides interfaces to other applications
http://www.mozilla.org/newlayout/dom-roadmap.html
http://www.mozilla.org/docs/modunote.htm

d. Opera plans on supporting DOM 2
http://www.opera.com/opera4/specs.html#javascript

e. A list of other DOM implementations can be found at, including DOM level 
2 implementations can be found at:
http://dmoz.org/Computers/Programming/Internet/W3C_DOM/

===================================================
5.2 If the user can modify HTML and XML content through the user interface, 
provide the same functionalityprogrammatically by conforming to the W3C 
Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2 Core and HTML Specifications and 
exporting the interfaces they define. [Priority 1]

a. Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.0 for MS-Windows provides access to at 
least DOM level 1 through a COM interface. Once source of the 
implementation completeness of DOM level 1 specification can be found at:
http://xw2k.sdct.itl.nist.gov/dom/index.html

b. Amaya supports DOM.  No information on DOM level supported or exporting 
of the DOM to other applications

c. Mozzilla supports DOM level 1 and provides interfaces to other applications
http://www.mozilla.org/newlayout/dom-roadmap.html
http://www.mozilla.org/docs/modunote.htm

d. Opera plans on supporting DOM 2, current implementations do not allow 
for modification of the DOM
http://www.opera.com/opera4/specs.html#javascript

e. A list of other DOM implementations can be found at, including DOM level 
2 implementations can be found at:

==================================================
5.3 For markup languages other than HTML and XML, provide programmatic 
access to content using standard APIs
(e.g., platform-independent APIs and standard APIs for the operating 
system). [Priority 1]

a. Accessibility plug-in for Acrobat PDF reader.  It allows embedded text 
to be rendered as text for magnification and translation to speech and 
Braille by assistive technologies.
http://www.adobe.com/access

b, Microsoft Office 2000.  It uses active accessibility for assistive 
technology to access content.
http://www.microsoft.com/enable/products/office2000/features.htm

======================================================
5.4 Provide programmatic read and write access to user agent user interface 
controls using standard APIs (e.g.,platform-independent APIs such as the 
W3C DOM; standard APIs defined for a specific operating system; and 
conventions for programming languages, plug-ins, virtual machine 
environments, etc.) [Priority 1]

a. Microsoft Internet Explorer for Windows. Supports active accessibility 
and standard controls.
http://www.microsoft.com/enable/products/IE5/features.htm

b. Opera for Windows.  Screen readers can access controls and text on screen.
http://www.opera.com/special.html

c. Microsoft Office 2000. Supports active accessibility and standard controls.
http://www.microsoft.com/enable/products/office2000/features.htm

========================================================
5.5 Using standard APIs, provide programmatic alert of changes to content 
and user interface controls (including selection, content focus, and user 
interface focus). [Priority 1]

a. Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.x for Windows. Supports active 
accessibility and standard controls.
http://www.microsoft.com/enable/products/IE5/features.htm

b. Microsoft Office 2000. Supports active accessibility and standard controls.
http://www.microsoft.com/enable/products/office2000/features.htm

c. Most browsers do this (NN, Amaya, Lynx, etc.)

==========================================================
5.6 Ensure that programmatic exchanges proceed in a timely manner. 
[Priority 2]

a. For information about Microsoft IE 5.0, refer to 
http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q179/2/30.asp
b. IBM Home Page Reader project uses marking DOM nodes to improve access 
using Microsoft DOM in IE

==========================================================
5.7 For user agents that implement Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), provide 
programmatic access to CSS style sheets
by conforming to the W3C Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2 Style 
Specification and exporting the interfaces it defines. [Priority 3]

a. Refer to Jackaroo (a Scalable Vector Graphics viewer) for DOM access to 
CSS 1 [CSS1].
http://www-sop.inria.fr/koala/jackaroo/

b. Microsoft Internet Explorer provides a partial implementation of the CSS 
style sheet module of DOM level 2
http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/c-frame.htm?/workshop/browser/default.asp

Checkpoints for user interface accessibility:

===========================================================
5.8 Follow operating system conventions that benefit accessibility. In 
particular, follow conventions for user interface design, keyboard 
configuration, product installation, and documentation. [Priority 2]

a. Microsoft Internet Explorer for Windows. Supports active accessibility 
and standard controls.
http://www.microsoft.com/enable/products/IE5/features.htm

b. Microsoft Office 2000. Supports active accessibility and standard controls.
http://www.microsoft.com/enable/products/office2000/features.htm
