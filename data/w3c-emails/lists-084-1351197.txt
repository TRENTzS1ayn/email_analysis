We need to distinguish between "browser company" and "AT company".  I feel
the "browser company" meets its part of the accessibility contract when it
provides information to the AT via the DOM.  If the AT doesn't utilize the
DOM, and that is the only [or best] method that "browser" provides, it is
still the AT's responsibility to provide the work around or implement the
DOM.  We can't go forward with accessible technology by always shackling
ourselves with legacy solutions.  The solution needs to be technically
accessible.  We can't continue to burden developers and authors with
redundant solutions either.  Redundant solutions cost TWICE as much.  Side
issues, such as whether some or when all AT's support it and whether the
user has the time/money/space/patience to upgrade both the browser and the
AT, should also be separated.
