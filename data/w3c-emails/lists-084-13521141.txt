** Summary

1.? For purposes of definition, the UAAG meaning of the Terms of Art "text
element" and "non-text element" should be "as used in WCAG 1.0, e.g.
Checkpoint
1.1."? Explanatory elaboration on the idea is OK to include so long as it is
clear that the WCAG is the definitive reference in case of questions as to
interpretation.

2.? Still, 'element' is _not_ a Term of Art even 'though the combinations
"text
element" and "non-text element" could be considered Terms of Art.  

3.  However, it would appear that they are terms of the Web Content art, and
_not_ User Agent art.  Help me: is there any requirement on the User Agent to
know what is and is not a "text element" in the checkpoints?  I thought that
the User Agent only needs to know what is, per the markup structure, a
presumed
equivalent for any element (sibling-sub-element in SWITCH in SMIL, ALT for IMG
in HTML, etc.)

** Discussion

1.? Do we have consensus that the purpose of using the terms "text element"
and
"non-text element" is to connect with the concepts of the WCAG, or with
concepts shared with the WCAG?

There is a general rule that should emerge in the WAI coordination-of-usage
practice.? This is that different Working Groups may need different special
meanings ("Terms of Art"), but that we will try to avoid a situation where
subgroups within the WAI use the same terms for different things.? If
different
meanings are needed between different groups, different terms will be used to
denote those meanings.

In this regard, we need to regard the international usage of English as a
virtual Working Group within the WAI for the purpose of applying the above
rule.? If there is a plain English word (in international usage) which
captures
the meanining needed, that should be used in preference to coining a Term of
Art.

--

Let's back off a bit momentarily to review some generalities.? What we need in
the WAI rules, and in particular in the User Agent rules, are things a) that
are effective for the user and b) that are readily doable by the User Agent.?
That is the existential stretch the UAAG lives in.

The problem of how to categorize ASCII graphics illustrates this well.? ASCII
Graphics is composed of text and a particular layout arrangement of the text.?
This could be interpreted as falling within the language "text and
presentation
properties of the text" that I penned.? So that shows the language I penned is
not clear enough in this case.? 

The user-centric definition "presentable comprehensibly in all of sight,
sound,
and touch" meets requirement a) of "effective for the user" very well but
requirement b) of "readily doable by the User Agent" less well.? To be readily
doable by the User Agent, ideally it would be stated in terms that are machine
interpretable on inspection of the data of the "document."? 

ASCII graphics are not a problem with regard to requirement b), because the
html:pre element that is used to mark them as layout-literal source is a clear
indication that interpreting the content as a _stream_ of characters will
_not_
preserve the comprehensibility of the intended message. 

Note how the WAI-PF working group enters into the plot, here.? It is the
long-range mission of PF to get the format definitions to capture distinctions
about content which are effective for the user in data encodings i.e. markup
which is readily intelligible to machine processing in the User Agent.? In an
ideal world, the format definitions bridge the gap between a) and b).? At
present, they only partially fulfil that mission.? Note in particular Len's
ideas about the potential effectiveness of a dictionary of classes suitable
for
use as values of the class attribute on elements in HTML; and Jon's input to
the XHTML 2.0 requirements that the markup language needs to support machine
discovery of the semantic structure within a document.

Yes, "text element" and "non-text element" are Terms of Art in the UAAG.? On
the other hand, attempting to improve on what the WCAG has done to define
these
Terms of Art without coordinating with WCA WG will only introduce confusion.?
The intent is to import or synchronize with the concepts employed in WCAG
Checkpoint 1.1.? The highest and best glossary entry therefore should make
this
clear; that the definitive source for this usage is as used in the WCAG,
although an informative gloss may be offered in the UAAG to make the document
easier to use.

Because the role adopted by 'element' in the Terms of Art "text element" and
"non-text element" fits well within a general natural-English sense of the
term, 'element' per se is not rendered a Term of Art just because it
appears in
those phrases which are Terms of Art.? The meaning is only special in the
specific combinations noted.? [See details for expansion on how another HTML
document cited in a html:londesc attribute is, in the appropriate user
frame of
observation, "part of the document."]

The term 'element' does not require a definition, although an explanation of
how it has been used may be valuable.? It is good to put entries in the
Glossary where people may mis-read the usage in the volume, even when the
entry
is not absolutely necessary to _define_ the intended sense of a term, or even
if the intended sense of the term is not a Term of Art.

But this probably means we need some way to write entries in the glossary as a
guide to the literal minded on whether a given entry is intended as a
'normative' definition of a Term of Art in the volume or is an 'informative'
comment elaborating on the natural usage employed.

Consider it this way.  A relevant question is "does the use of terminology in
the UAAG connect well with the concepts and terminology expressed in the
WCAG? 


Here both 'equivalent' and 'element' are implicated in the WCAG checkpoint
language "text equivalent for non-text element."  So I think it best we not
try
to close on 'element' entirely until we have checked with GL on how we align
with the ideas there.

I did not characterize this pervasive ambiguity as a problem.  Just a
situation.  I didn't propose to try to tie 'element' down to either sense,
just
use phrases for clarity where one must be sure to indicate one sense or the
other.

OK, we are now in Last Call.  No way to separate this glossary entry from the

AG::

I am confused.  The word 'element' by itself is not necessarily subject to
special meaning just because it appears in phrases or compounds which have, in
the compound form, special meaning.  Just because "they," the two compound
phrases, have special meanings, does not mean that either word used in them,
taken alone, should be viewed as having a special meaning.  No?

Yes.  You have outlined the difference clearly.  This is a very important
difference, and one that affects the definition of 'equivalent' as well.

The refrain that we hear over and over from the toolsmiths is "Just tell me
what I have to do."  

The UAAG guidelines properly tie each 'what' to a clear 'why.'  The 'why' has
to do with criterion a) above that it clearly makes a difference in outcomes
for users with disabilities.  But the 'what' language should as much as
possible be clearly "just plain what."   Don't invent mumbo jumbo for 'what'
they need to do when the only thing special is in the 'why.'  The term
'element' should be _descriptive_ of how a document goes together; not why you
need to do this or that with this or that element.  The _prescriptive_ tone
enters in the statement of the whole checkpoint, where the term 'element' used
in stating the 'what' of that checkpoint should be purely _descriptive_ in
tone.

To honor the "just tell me what we need to do" request, we should attempt to
describe the 'what' in language that the reader already understands, with
recourse to Terms of Art only when plain English absolutely fails us.  So far,
in the case of 'element' I am not finding there to be a need for a Term of
Art.  Maybe a glossary entry to clear away the risk that people among the
readership who have encountered 'element' as a syntax-technical term will tend
to read it that way.

What I have stated here is just the argument from effective communication --
i.e. good writing.  There is also the argument from Universal Design that I
have explained earlier to the effect that we should not introduce
access-pecular rules or terms where more general and equally implementable
rules or terms get the job done.  That also suggest that since the general
definition of 'element' fits what we need, we should not put language in the
glossary that makes it appear some special access-peculiar meaning is
needed to
understand what the User Agent implementer has to do.  It's actually simpler
than that.  We want them to immediately grasp how simple it is.

Yes, it is self-consistent to the point of circularity.  No help to the User
Agent implementer in understanding what _they_ have to do, which is make
available user choice (over inclusion in the presented view) concerning
whatever _the markup indicates_ may be an equivalence group.

There is no burden on the UA to know text elements from non-text elements,
actually.  Only to know what is viewed by the format spec as "where the author
should put the other equivalent."

AG::

Yes, I can see what I said could be misinterpreted as regards ASCII art in PRE
in HTML.

But I would not abandon the bottom-up approach if we needed to define "text
element" and "non-text element."  I would head in the direction of "A text
element is one which can be substantially understood from its character
content
alone, taken as a stream."  The point is to allow expendable fluff like FONT
tags in text elements, but not to include PRE because it requires a rigid
layout constraint to preserve the meaning of those characters.  Something
along
those lines.  But we don't need UAAG definitions for these phrases.  The
distinction is not something that the UAAG requires the User Agent to make
automated decisions about.  Just let the user get at all the equivalents, and
pick what is best for him or her.

Since they're not UAAG concepts at all, but WCAG concepts, we should leave the
defining to WCAG or ask WCA WG if we wish a clarification relative to WCAG
1.0.

That doesn't conflict at all with considering it 'part' of the document.  In
the user experience, which is indeed where the WCAG is applying its
terminology
of "non-text element,"
yes, a LONGDESC in a separate file is "part of the document."  

This is the main point about 'element' that bears cleaning up.  That it not
only doesn't mean exactly something marked with a pair of matching tags, it
doesn't have to exactly be in the same file.  The LONGDESC and SRC parts of an
IMG element are alike in this.

But cleaning up, if it is to be done, belongs in the WCAG.  This is a Web
Content notion, not something that is visible in the User Agent processing
directly.
