Mark,
The only real discussion about DOM in the current UA guidelines is for the
full implementation of DOM level 1 to provide access to the content.  This
is a big enough problem for the working groups and developers right now.
The idea of adding chrome to the DOM is an idea of interest to the current
UA group, but it really will not effect the current guidelines.  Our
biggest job right now is educating of AT developers of the DOM capabilities
and encouraging them to support the use of DOM to access content.  This
support should be based on having access to information they do not have
right now through other means or it will be easier to get the information
through DOM.
