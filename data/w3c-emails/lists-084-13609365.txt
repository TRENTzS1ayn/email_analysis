AG:: Al Gilman's comments from his memo
(http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0147.html)

EH:: Eric Hansen's comments from this memo.

AG::

** Summary

1.  For purposes of definition, the UAAG meaning of the Terms of Art "text
element" and "non-text element" should be "as used in WCAG 1.0, e.g.
Checkpoint 1.1."  Explanatory elaboration on the idea is OK to include so
long as it is
clear that the WCAG is the definitive reference in case of questions as to
interpretation.

EH::

I expect that during this Last Call period, WCAG members will indicate any
modifications that they feel would bring UAAG definitions into line with
their intent.

AG::

2.  Still, 'element' is _not_ a Term of Art even 'though the combinations
"text element" and "non-text element" could be considered Terms of Art.  

EH::

I prefer to think that there are different usages for a given term and that
each usage may be somewhat different in meaning. I believe that we need to
provide clarifying language if confusion might otherwise result. I think
that conventions in usage of certain terms are important to establish and
follow.

AG::

3.  However, it would appear that they are terms of the Web Content art, and
_not_ User Agent art.  Help me: is there any requirement on the User Agent
to know what is and is not a "text element" in the checkpoints?  I thought
that the User Agent only needs to know what is, per the markup structure, a
presumed equivalent for any element (sibling-sub-element in SWITCH in SMIL,
ALT for IMG in HTML, etc.)

EH::

In general, there is no requirement that a user agent know what is or is not
a text element, other than what can be readily inferred from markup. 

AG::

** Discussion

1.  Do we have consensus that the purpose of using the terms "text element"
and
"non-text element" is to connect with the concepts of the WCAG, or with
concepts shared with the WCAG?

There is a general rule that should emerge in the WAI coordination-of-usage
practice.  This is that different Working Groups may need different special
meanings ("Terms of Art"), but that we will try to avoid a situation where
subgroups within the WAI use the same terms for different things.  If
different meanings are needed between different groups, different terms will
be used to denote those meanings.

In this regard, we need to regard the international usage of English as a
virtual Working Group within the WAI for the purpose of applying the above
rule.  If there is a plain English word (in international usage) which
captures the meanining needed, that should be used in preference to coining
a Term of Art.

EH::

I think that I agree with those general statements.

AG::

--

Let's back off a bit momentarily to review some generalities.  What we need
in the WAI rules, and in particular in the User Agent rules, are things a)
that are effective for the user and b) that are readily doable by the User
Agent. That is the existential stretch the UAAG lives in.

The problem of how to categorize ASCII graphics illustrates this well.
ASCII Graphics is composed of text and a particular layout arrangement of
the text. This could be interpreted as falling within the language "text and
presentation properties of the text" that I penned.  So that shows the
language I penned is not clear enough in this case.  

The user-centric definition "presentable comprehensibly in all of sight,
sound, and touch" meets requirement a) of "effective for the user" very well
but requirement b) of "readily doable by the User Agent" less well.  To be
readily doable by the User Agent, ideally it would be stated in terms that
are machine interpretable on inspection of the data of the "document."  

ASCII graphics are not a problem with regard to requirement b), because the
html:pre element that is used to mark them as layout-literal source is a
clear indication that interpreting the content as a _stream_ of characters
will _not_ preserve the comprehensibility of the intended message. 

Note how the WAI-PF working group enters into the plot, here.  It is the
long-range mission of PF to get the format definitions to capture
distinctions about content which are effective for the user in data
encodings i.e. markup which is readily intelligible to machine processing in
the User Agent.  In an ideal world, the format definitions bridge the gap
between a) and b).  At present, they only partially fulfil that mission.
Note in particular Len's ideas about the potential effectiveness of a
dictionary of classes suitable
for use as values of the class attribute on elements in HTML; and Jon's
input to the XHTML 2.0 requirements that the markup language needs to
support machine discovery of the semantic structure within a document.

Yes, "text element" and "non-text element" are Terms of Art in the UAAG.  On
the other hand, attempting to improve on what the WCAG has done to define
these Terms of Art without coordinating with WCA WG will only introduce
confusion.

The intent is to import or synchronize with the concepts employed in WCAG
Checkpoint 1.1.  The highest and best glossary entry therefore should make
this clear; that the definitive source for this usage is as used in the
WCAG, although an informative gloss may be offered in the UAAG to make the
document easier to use.

EH::

I can see that for the sake of simplicity one would like to go back to one
definitive document (e.g., WCAG 1.0) and say that all else is informative
gloss. However, due to issues such as long lag times between different
versions of documents WCAG 1.0, UAAG 1.0, WCAG 2.0, etc., its hard for me to
think that this is necessarily practical. One almost needs yet another
document to indicate which definitions are most considered most definitive
at any given time. (I think that is an idea that we need to keep in mind as
we contemplate a combined glossary of terms for WAI). This problem is not
new in other domains (law, etc.). I do agree that there is a need for
coordination between groups so that usages will not cause confusion.

AG::

Because the role adopted by 'element' in the Terms of Art "text element" and
"non-text element" fits well within a general natural-English sense of the
term, 'element' per se is not rendered a Term of Art just because it appears
in those phrases which are Terms of Art.  The meaning is only special in the
specific combinations noted.  [See details for expansion on how another HTML
document cited in a html:londesc attribute is, in the appropriate user frame
of observation, "part of the document."]

EH:: 

I think that "element" has several usages, each of which differs somewhat in
meaning. I agree that we need to avoid confusing the reader. 

As an aside, I interpret this comment about longdesc as having reference to
something you have brought up before. As I recall, it was the idea that
peers of certain elements as needing to exist in the same "document".
Perhaps my comments are a bit out of context, but I wonder if the concept of
document is really that easily defined. For example, following your logic,
if document B specified by the longdesc attribute is 'part of the [original]
document' (i.e, document A), then the peer elements could exist in either
document A or document B (if I understand your earlier argument). Now
suppose that document B includes document C via longdesc and then document C
includes document A via longdesc. In essence, we have a loop or "donut" of
longdesc related documents. In that case both peers could exist in A, B, or
C. (I can't help but think that this would confuse a browser.) Frankly, just
focusing on the longdesc attribute I can imagine a whole tangle of
documents, all of them, part of the same "document". You evidently allow
documents linked by longdesc to be considered one document. Why rule out
other ways of linking documents? I am not saying that the concept of
"document" is not useful. I am just wondering out loud whether it can be
defined well enough to bear the burden that you wish to place upon it.

AG::

The term 'element' does not require a definition, although an explanation of
how it has been used may be valuable.  It is good to put entries in the
Glossary where people may mis-read the usage in the volume, even when the
entry is not absolutely necessary to _define_ the intended sense of a term,
or even if the intended sense of the term is not a Term of Art.

But this probably means we need some way to write entries in the glossary as
a guide to the literal minded on whether a given entry is intended as a
'normative' definition of a Term of Art in the volume or is an 'informative'
comment elaborating on the natural usage employed.

EH: As I think about it, I am inclined to do the following:

1. Include within each specification document the best glossary that we can
write.
2. Write a separate "Harmonization Note" (official document) that attempts
to harmonize usages of the terms between documents, pointing out which one
is considered most definitive at any given time.
3. Allow users of each specification to conform at a minimal level by
following the definition within that specification. 
4. Encourage users of a specification to consider additional information in
the 'harmonization' document.

Consider it this way.  A relevant question is "does the use of terminology
in the UAAG connect well with the concepts and terminology expressed in the
WCAG? 

Here both 'equivalent' and 'element' are implicated in the WCAG checkpoint
language "text equivalent for non-text element."  So I think it best we not
try to close on 'element' entirely until we have checked with GL on how we
align with the ideas there.

EH:: 

I am very happy to have GL comment on alignment and I agree that we should
strive for alignment. However, as I plan to detail later, I think that there
are other non-WCAG-related issues that would suggest that such issues go
beyond what could be decided by WCA WG alone.

I did not characterize this pervasive ambiguity as a problem.  Just a
situation.  I didn't propose to try to tie 'element' down to either sense,
just use phrases for clarity where one must be sure to indicate one sense or
the other.

OK, we are now in Last Call.  No way to separate this glossary entry from
the Last Call process at this point.

AG::

I am confused.  The word 'element' by itself is not necessarily subject to
special meaning just because it appears in phrases or compounds which have,
in the compound form, special meaning.  Just because "they," the two
compound phrases, have special meanings, does not mean that either word used
in them, taken alone, should be viewed as having a special meaning.  No?

EH:: 

I think that the contrast between 'term of art'/'special meaning' and normal
English meanings do break down a bit here. As we have seen in the definition
of 'equivalent', even normal English admits of fairly diverse meanings. Even
seemingly simple terms, like "text" that seem to have a normal English
meaning is really not that 'normal' once you scratch below the surface. For
example, usually I think of text as something to do with letters, numbers,
and punctuation that I can see on a page or computer screen, but when you
really look at UAAG's definition, you see that is does have a special
meaning -- something about 'sequence of characters from a markup language's
document character set (e.g., Unicode or ISO 10646).' A literal-minded
reader is wondering, what on earth does Unicode or ISO 10646 have to do with
letters, numbers, and punctuation? Furthermore, if the person thinks to look
up the definition of 'character' in the "Character Model for the World Wide
Web" (http://www.w3.org/TR/charmod/), they find that even this document
cannot provide a clear and definitive definition of 'character' ("Used in a
loose sense to denote small units of text, where the exact definition of
these units is still open.).

So I would just rather say that our glossary should document how we use
terms and if it is not clear which meaning of a term we intend, then we
should make it clear.

In UAAG, we have tried to avoid coining new terms. For example, checkpoint
1.5 formerly used the term "text message" But to avoid coining a new
compound term, the checkpoint was entirely rephrased to avoid the term ("1.5
Ensure that every message (e.g., prompt, alert, notification, etc.) that is
a non-text element and is part of the user agent user interface has a text
equivalent. [Priority 1] ", UAAG, 23 October 2000). 

By the way, it looks like the rephrasing was not carried through to the
definition of "Alert". This needs to be corrected. 

Old (23 October 2000, UAAG):

Alert 
In this document, "to alert" means to make the user aware of some event,
without requiring acknowledgement. For example, the user agent may alert the
user that new content is available on the server by displaying a text
message in the user agent's status bar. Refer to checkpoint 1.5 for
requirements about alerts.

New:

Alert 
In this document, "to alert" means to make the user aware of some event,
without requiring acknowledgement. For example, the user agent may alert the
user that new content is available on the server by displaying visually a
message in the user agent's status bar. Refer to checkpoint 1.5 for
requirements about alerts.

Perhaps Ian or others could suggest even better language that still avoids
coining a new term ("text message").

==

Thus, a goal that I think that we take quite seriously is that of not
coining new terms when existing ones will do.

AG::

Yes.  You have outlined the difference clearly.  This is a very important
difference, and one that affects the definition of 'equivalent' as well.

The refrain that we hear over and over from the toolsmiths is "Just tell me
what I have to do."  

The UAAG guidelines properly tie each 'what' to a clear 'why.'  The 'why'
has
to do with criterion a) above that it clearly makes a difference in outcomes
for users with disabilities.  But the 'what' language should as much as
possible be clearly "just plain what."   Don't invent mumbo jumbo for 'what'
they need to do when the only thing special is in the 'why.'  The term
'element' should be _descriptive_ of how a document goes together; not why
you
need to do this or that with this or that element.  The _prescriptive_ tone
enters in the statement of the whole checkpoint, where the term 'element'
used
in stating the 'what' of that checkpoint should be purely _descriptive_ in
tone.

To honor the "just tell me what we need to do" request, we should attempt to
describe the 'what' in language that the reader already understands, with
recourse to Terms of Art only when plain English absolutely fails us.  So
far,
in the case of 'element' I am not finding there to be a need for a Term of
Art.  

EH:: 

The important thing is clear communication. I am amenable to establishing
reasonable conventions for usage in order to make sure it is sufficiently
clear which meaning of element is intended. I expect that there will be
situations in which one wants to use the word "element" in the sense of the
super class of elements of which "text element" and "non-text" element are
sub-classes. The thing to avoid is ambiguity as to what meaning is intended.

Maybe a glossary entry to clear away the risk that people among the
readership who have encountered 'element' as a syntax-technical term will
tend to read it that way.

What I have stated here is just the argument from effective communication --
i.e. good writing.  There is also the argument from Universal Design that I
have explained earlier to the effect that we should not introduce
access-pecular rules or terms where more general and equally implementable
rules or terms get the job done. 

That also suggest that since the general definition of 'element' fits what
we need, we should not put language in the glossary that makes it appear
some special access-peculiar meaning is needed to understand what the User
Agent implementer has to do. 

EH:: 

The foregoing is a worthy goal. But I think it is possible to do both: (a)
preserve special-access meaning as necessary and (b) establish a clear
'minimal standard' or 'acceptable standard' about what the implementer has
to do.

AG::

It's actually simpler than that.  We want them to immediately grasp how
simple it is.

AG::

Yes, it is self-consistent to the point of circularity.  No help to the User
Agent implementer in understanding what _they_ have to do, which is make
available user choice (over inclusion in the presented view) concerning
whatever _the markup indicates_ may be an equivalence group.

EH::

As for whether the definitions provide "no help to the User Agent
implementer in understanding what _they_ have to do", that is role of
checkpoints like checkpoint 2.3 (in whatever form it finally takes). And, as
you indicate elsewhere in this memo, the user agent only needs to recognize
what is indicated by markup.

I am not sure what you mean by "circularity". My hunch is that what you see
as circularity is simply an outcome of the fact that my very brief summary
does not provide important implementation details. Yet I think that we have
tried to provide the implementation details that are essential and which are
within the scope of UAAG. For example, we do note how concepts like
equivalent are implemented in HTML and SMIL. 

"Each markup language defines its own mechanisms for specifying equivalents.
For instance, in HTML 4 [HTML4] or SMIL 1.0 [SMIL], authors may use the
"alt" attribute to specify a text equivalent for some elements. In HTML 4,
authors may provide equivalents (or portions of equivalents) in attribute
values (e.g., the "summary" attribute for the TABLE element), in element
content (e.g., OBJECT for external content it specifies, NOFRAMES for frame
equivalents, and NOSCRIPT for script equivalents), and in prose. Please
consult the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 [WCAG10] and its
associated Techniques document [WCAG10-TECHS] for more information about
equivalents." (definition of Equivalent)

Furthermore, I think that you have (in this memo) essentially agreed that
UAAG does not need to help implementers of user agents distinguish between
text elements and non-text elements; they should rely on other
specifications for that.

If there are implementation details that are missing and that you think
properly fall within the scope of UAAG, please publish them to the list.

Although I suppose that any single virtue can be carried too far, I think
that it is a worthy objective (among many) for UAAG to specify only the
minimum performance objectives and to leave other implementation details to
the Techniques documents or to implementers' own creativity.

AG::

There is no burden on the UA to know text elements from non-text elements,
actually.  Only to know what is viewed by the format spec as "where the
author should put the other equivalent."

EH::

In using the term "equivalence group", you are using a term that is not
defined in UAAG or WCAG. And you are using the term "other equivalent" in a
manner different than it is used in UAAG or WCAG. 

These statements hearken back to your earlier comments on checkpoint 2.3, to
which I have already responded in:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0092.html
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000OctDec/0103.html

If you wish to propose revised language for 2.3, then I suggest that that
you propose revised language to the list.

If you wish to coin new terms, especially as they relate to the concept of
equivalency, I suggest that you propose definitions for the terms.

Based on this and other memos, I think that you want to define a peer
relationship between pieces of content. Until better language is found, I
suggest the following definition, which seems to capture some of what you
are referring to.

"Peer (for content)"

"In the context of this memo, a 'peer' is content that, under some
circumstances, can serve essentially the same function, for some other
content. An equivalent and its equivalency target both qualify as peers for
each other."

EH:

AG::

Yes, I can see what I said could be misinterpreted as regards ASCII art in
PRE in HTML.

But I would not abandon the bottom-up approach if we needed to define "text
element" and "non-text element."  I would head in the direction of "A text
element is one which can be substantially understood from its character
content alone, taken as a stream."  The point is to allow expendable fluff
like FONT tags in text elements, but not to include PRE because it requires
a rigid layout constraint to preserve the meaning of those characters.
Something along those lines.  But we don't need UAAG definitions for these
phrases.  The distinction is not something that the UAAG requires the User
Agent to make automated decisions about.  

EH:: 

It is correct that UAAG has not required user agents to recognize
equivalents in the absence of markup from which their presence is indicated.

AG::

Just let the user get at all the equivalents, and pick what is best for him
or her.

EH:: 

I would translate your statement above as follows:

"Just let the user get at all the peers, and pick what is best for him or
her."

I would need to look at language for a revised checkpoint 2.3 before knowing
whether I agree or not. 

But I would strongly urge either using defined language in its defined ways
or proposing specific definitions for new terms that you wish to use. 

On the other hand, if you wish to _change_ the existing meanings of
equivalency-related terms, I think that is a bigger job and would require
quite a bit more coordination between groups.

AG::

Since they're not UAAG concepts at all, but WCAG concepts, we should leave
the defining to WCAG or ask WCA WG if we wish a clarification relative to
WCAG 1.0.

EH::

I am in favor of having concepts agreed upon by all groups. And I trust that
during the Last Call period the WCA WG will make it known if there are
discrepancies between UAAG 1.0 and WCAG 1.0 or WCAG 2.0.

AG::

That doesn't conflict at all with considering it 'part' of the document.  In
the user experience, which is indeed where the WCAG is applying its
terminology
of "non-text element," yes, a LONGDESC in a separate file is "part of the
document."  

This is the main point about 'element' that bears cleaning up.  That it not
only doesn't mean exactly something marked with a pair of matching tags, it
doesn't have to exactly be in the same file.  The LONGDESC and SRC parts of
an IMG element are alike in this.

But cleaning up, if it is to be done, belongs in the WCAG.  This is a Web
Content notion, not something that is visible in the User Agent processing
directly.

EH::

Our intention has been to have the definitions that are quite compatible
with WCAG. On the other handle, the implications of the definition of
element go well beyond the scope of WCAG alone and the discussion should
involve all groups.

I interpret many of your comments in this and other memos as pointing out
the need for rules or conventions about how to map equivalency concepts to
specific implementations (languages, formats, etc.).  This is a very
important theme and is right at the heart of what it takes to design a new
implementation, such as a new markup language or a revision of a old markup
language. If my interpretation is correct, then I basically agree with that
theme.

In the UAAG I think we have tried to be very careful about not
over-specifying on issues that should be handled elsewhere.
