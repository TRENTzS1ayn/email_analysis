You are being cheated by your ISP!!!

did you know your ISP will be making money from you even if you do not pay a single dime???

and more than that - did you know there is a service that will pay you for using a free ISP and for other member's use of their ISP??? 

did you also know that the registration is FREE???

did you also also know that this service is AVAILABLE INTERNATIONALLY???

if you knew all of that and you are happy with your current ISP please do not go to this address : www.goingplatinum.com/member/desperate
