Just a quick reminder and update.

Local Wine Events.com has now over twelve hundred events posted in just the third month online, almost entirely posted to the site by the wine industry itself.

We have had over seventy thousand hits in three months.

Robin Garr;

"Eric V. Orange's new Local Wine Events.com site is a place where organizations holding wine-tasting events and dinners around the world can post free public announcements about their events. It's a good concept."

If you have something coming up this fall, please post it to the site, www.LocalWineEvents.com

If you have a website and would like to trade links, please let me know. Please take a look at how my links work from any city page. I need to know where you are, your url and a brief description. Please don't just send me a URL. I would like a reciprocal link.

Also notice that the site has been expanded to include cities around the world. We have had a tremendous response from Australia.

That's all. Hope all is well.

Pass it on.
