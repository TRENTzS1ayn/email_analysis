Jon,

Home Page Reader 3.0 makes extensive use of the Document Object Model. This
is a big change from HPR 2.5 and it allows us to support dynamic changes to
the document due to dynamic page extensions such as those due to JavaScript
implementations.

Home Page Reader 3.0 also responds to standard input API.

Both of these are required in our guidelines.

It is also important that Henter-Joyce Jaws as an assistive technology uses
a DOM based technology to model web page they are trying to access.
