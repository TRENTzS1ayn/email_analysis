Question for the working group:

The above discussion makes it sound as though selecting among texts on the
basis of natural language is not "alternatives that have an impact on
accessibility."  Let's think about that.

Let us consider the following ideas and questions:

Text is regarded as presentable in sound (audio) because text-to-speech
technology is being treated as readily available for the user.

Text-to-speech technology is language-dependent.  The text-to-speech
transformer needs to know the natural language of the text, and is capable of
transforming selected languages.  

Is it true that text is only presentable comprehensibly as sound on the user's
system if it is in a language with which the user's installed text-to-speech
technology copes?

Is it true that it is not reasonable to expect the user to have text-to-speech
technology installed that can process all natural languages?

Is it reasonable, therefore to say as a matter of fact that selecting among a
range of texts which say substantially the same thing in different languages
_is an accessibility requirement_, because the user is reasonably likely to
have text-to-speech technology that will speak some languages and will not
speak others?
