AG::

I want to explore this a little.? 

On the one hand it is true that the symmetrical view, as Ian put it "looking
down on the range of choices, rather than sideways from one to another" is in
some ways a superior understanding of what is going on.? It deals better with
the fact that which one is better depends on who is the user of the moment.?
Which is better is not something that can be discerned from the content alone.

On the other hand, historically there have been a lot of people confused by
talking about 'equivalents,' here.? Mostly on the basis that the tend to
assume
'equivalent' should indicate a closer correspondence than what is often found
in our cases.? In our cases the correspondence can be pretty rough.? So
readers
may stumble a bit if we just say 'equivalent' in the sense of "conveys some of
the same information" and leave it at that.

The word 'alternative' gets used in both polarized and un-polarized or
symmetrical settings.? We talk about giving someone an alternative when we are
talking about giving them _another_ option; with implication that there is an
existing or status_quo option already.? But the word is also used in the
'looking down' sense as "having a range of alternatives to choose among."

In this particular situation (checkpoint 2.3), it is not necessarily important
to rub the reader's nose in either a looking-down or a looking-sideways
perspective on the situation per se.? Whether one views it as "there are
multiple options available" or "there is another option available" the
point is
that the user needs, at their choice, to be able to gain access to any of the
options.? Note that the checkpoint does not require symmetrical handling of
the
various options, in that various forms of unequal treatment are included in
the
list, any one of which is credited as meeting the checkpoint.

There are many situations in W3C formats where the options are treated
asymmetrically in the rules of the format.? The ALT attribute and OBJECT
element are conspicuous examples.? Then again there are other cases where what
the format offers you is pretty symmetrical, such as text versions in
different
natural languages.

So while talking about "an alternative or alternatives for something in the
current view" may not be precisely the highest and best theory for the
situation, it gets the user oriented adequately to understand what the
checkpoint has to say.? More or less.? So it seems.

Other thoughts?
