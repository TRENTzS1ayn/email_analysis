HB: Which one is better -- is also a function of current situation (too
bright or dim to see, too noisy, enforced quiet, too much vibration, etc.)
It is also a function of the available equipment, including assistive devices,
bandwidth, and conscious user choices currently in force. It is also a
function of user familiarity with whatever equipment is available, and the
assistive technology that is available thereon.

HB: Right: alternative content permits user choice, even though the user may
not be able to use all of the range of choices. We hope that some one or more
of those choices will suffice. For example alt-text and longdesc pointer (or
d link) are individually useful, and possibly a user may wish to get more
information that the longdesc or d links provide. Sometimes the need for
the expansion is only realized after the surrounding text has been absorbed,
and presumably found insufficient. That "progressive revelation" brings in
the sequential learning to whatever detail the user may wish. How the user
becomes aware of such alternatives is unclear.

HB: Agree, so prefer to not use "equivalents".

HB: For some users (and equipments for that matter), easy access is impossible
to some of the alternatives. Ian, are you asserting even such are required
to "each of its alternatives"?

HB: I do not expect a user to need access to all of its alternatives. I
believe what you mean is that the user has choice to use any or all of
the alternatives, each of which are self-sufficient to convey the information.

HB: "Current view" seems prejudiced toward visual. so does "current window".
How about "current context" or "content currently in consideration."
