After hearing all this I am wondering if it would not be better to have a
face to face on this?

Comments?

Sounds like a great idea for the agenda of the meeting. Rich, you
could present this topic and indicate current requirements. You
might also send to the UA mailing list a pointer to any materials
that are already available. Remember: the UA list is public and
if the info is Member-only, it probably isn't useful.
