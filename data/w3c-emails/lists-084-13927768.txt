Hello,

I've updated the meeting page for the AOL face-to-face meeting
16-17 November [1]. In particular:

1) There is now hotel information. There are no preferred
   hotels, and they are all apparently close to AOL. If
   we all choose the same hotel, we can carpool to the meeting
   (and won't require additional transportation for the meeting).
   I have not called around for prices. The meeting organizer
   didn't mention whether there was a special AOL rate (I'll
   follow up).

2) AOL will provide lunch. We should find a place to
   dine together on the 16th.

3) Don't forget to try to fly to Dulles since it's
   very close by.

Thanks,

 - Ian
