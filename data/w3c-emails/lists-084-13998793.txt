OK, I withdraw the question.

There is a potential UAAG question along the lines of "If there are
equivalents
with markup to indicate they are in different languages, is the User Agent
supposed to inform the user of the languages as shown in the markup?"  But I
see you haven't dealt with that in the checkpoints.

I was just trying to get clear that the range of options (alternatives,
equivalents, whatever we call them) that do appear in the documents are
sometimes things that would strike the casual observer as quite dissimilar
(like images and ALT strings) and sometimes things that would strike the
casual
observer as pretty much on a par (like a UN document with your choice of text
in any one of six languages).

This is not necessary for the definitive meaning of the checkpoint, as you
have
pointed out.  It could perhaps help us in understanding document usabilitity
issues -- what readers will understand easily and not so easily.
