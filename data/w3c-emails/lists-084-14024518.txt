Al,
The only checkpoint related to language is that if an unsupported language 
is encountered by the user agent it should notify the user of the language 
change if configured to do so.

2.7 Allow the user to configure the user agent not to render content marked 
up in a recognized but unsupported natural
              language. Indicate to the user in context that 
author-supplied content has not been rendered. [Priority 3]

We can include an example of languages also being part of an option for 
defined equivalents.  But this requires someone to submit techniques on the 
topic.  Would you be able to submit some techniques or do you know someone 
we can ask?

I assume this is not something that can be done with the ALT attribute of 
IMG, but is possible with OBJECT and maybe SVG technologies.  ALso how does 
the LONGDESC attribute support multiple languages, other than the resource 
of the URL including multiple languages?

Jon
