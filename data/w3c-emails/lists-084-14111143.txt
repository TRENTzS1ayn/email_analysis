To:"Hansen, Eric"<ehansen@ets.org>,"UA List (E-mail)"<w3c-wai-ua@w3.org>

I offer the following proposal based on EH [1] proposal:

<NEW>
2.3 For elements with an author specified equivalents, provide easy access 
to the equivalents through one of the following mechanisms:
(1) allowing configuration to render one or more of the alternatives 
instead of the element;
(2) allowing configuration to render one or more of the alternatives in 
addition to the element;
(3) allowing the user to select the element and then inspect its alternatives;
(4) providing a direct link to the alternatives in content, just before or 
after the element in document order.
[Priority 1]

Note: For example, if an image element in an HTML document has an 
alternative in the form of a text equivalent, provide access to the text 
equivalent through at least one of the following mechanisms (1) by 
replacing the image with the rendered text equivalent, (2) by rendering the 
text equivalent near the rendered image, (3) by allowing the user to select the
image and then inspect the text equivalent, or (4) by allowing the user to 
follow a link just after the text equivalent.
<NEW>

Rationale: This proposal does not use any new terminology and also adds 
that this is something the user agent needs to recognize as author supplied 
information similar to other checkpoints where we use the term.
