Al,
How about this:
<NEW>
2.3 For elements with author specified equivalents, provide easy access to 
all equivalents through one of the following mechanisms:
(1) allowing configuration to render one the alternatives instead of the 
element;
(2) allowing configuration to render one the alternatives in addition to 
the element;
(3) allowing the user to select the element and then inspect its alternatives;
(4) providing a direct link to the alternatives in content, just before or 
after the element in document order.

[Priority 1]

Note: For example, if an image element in an HTML document has an 
alternative in the form of a text equivalent, provide access to the text
equivalent through at least one of the following mechanisms (1) by 
replacing the image with the rendered text equivalent, (2) by rendering the
text equivalent near the rendered image, (3) by allowing the user to select 
the image and then inspect the text equivalent, or (4) by allowing the user to
follow a link just after the text equivalent.
</NEW>

JRG: Ian and Eric can help here with the final language

JRG: We could leave it at one, but the other options 3 and 4 already talk 
about access ti more than one.  An option could be to say "one of the 
alternatives " or something like that.
