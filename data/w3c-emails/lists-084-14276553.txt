AG:: consider options:

(1) allowing configuration to render another of the equvalents instead of the
element.
(2) allowing configuration to render another of the equivalents in addition to
the element.

or alternatively 

(1) allowing configuration to render one of the other equivalents etc.

AG::

consider option:

(3) allowing the user to select the element and [then | while it is selected]
inspect the remaining equivalents.

Here, the square brackets and vertical bar indicate a set of alternatives from
among which the reader may select any one.  As in meta-syntax often used.

>(4) providing a direct link to the equivalents in content, just before or
>after the element in document order.

AG:: likewise...

(4) providing a direct link to the [other | remaining] equivalents in content,
etc.

Let me try to make something perfectly clear:  The generally accepted sense of
'equivalency' is that it is mutual or symmetrical.  Anyone who thinks that the
Glossary of WCAG 1.0 changes this one iota is mis-reading the WCAG and its
Glossary. 

The present glossary entry for "equivalent (for content) in the Last Call
draft
of the UAAG is an unnecessary and destructive excursion outside the bounds of
reasonable use of technical English.  It should by all means be replaced.

The sense of Checkpoint 2.3 was perfectly clear in the previous language that
Jon offered.  

The sense of the "equivalent (for content)" in the glossary is ill-conceived
and unnecessary to make any of the UAAG clear.  There are enough clear
concepts
in standard English to explain what the checkpoints actually mean in
accessible
English without introducing tortured concepts such as this one.

We should not be twisting the checkpoints out of shape to accomodate that
thoroughly twisted definition.  We should get rid of it and plainly say
what we
mean.  As Jon did, before.
