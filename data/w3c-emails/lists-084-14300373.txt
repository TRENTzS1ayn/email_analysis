equivalency target;

Implementation Information:
Netscape Navigator 4.75 for Windows, Macintosh and UNIX
Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.0 for Windows and Macintosh
Opera 4.0 for Windows

(2) allowing configuration to render the equivalent in addition to the 
equivalency target;

the element that includes the non-text content. [Priority 2]
