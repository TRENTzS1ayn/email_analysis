Al,
Here is another try at the wording of checkpoint 2.3.  I hope this is more 
than just another circle.

<NEW>
2.3 For any elements with recognized equivalents, provide easy access to 
all equivalents through one of the following mechanisms:
(1) allowing configuration to render just one the alternatives from the 
available equivalents;
(2) allowing configuration to render at least two of the alternatives at 
the same time from the available equivalents;
(3) allowing the user to select the rendered element and then inspect its 
alternatives;
(4) providing a direct link to the alternatives in content, just before or 
after the element in document order.

[Priority 1]

Note: For example, if an image element in an HTML document has an 
alternative in the form of a text equivalent, provide access to the text 
equivalent through at least one of the following mechanisms (1) by 
replacing the image with the rendered text equivalent, (2) by rendering the 
text equivalent near the rendered image, (3) by allowing the user to select 
the image and then inspect the text equivalent, or (4) by allowing the user 
to follow a link just after the text equivalent.
</NEW>

<CURRENT>
2.3 Provide easy access to each equivalent and each equivalency target 
through at least one of the following mechanisms: (1) allowing 
configuration to render the equivalent instead of the equivalency target; 
(2) allowing configuration to render the equivalent in addition to the 
equivalency target; (3) allowing the user to select the equivalency target 
and then inspect its equivalents; (4) providing a direct link to the 
equivalent in content, just before or after the equivalency target in 
document order. [Priority 1]

Note: For example, if an image in an HTML document has text equivalents, 
provide access to them (1) by replacing the image with the rendered 
equivalents, (2) by rendering the equivalents near the image, (3) by 
allowing the user to select the image and then inspect its equivalents, or 
(4) by allowing the user to follow readily available links to the equivalents.
