hi David,
I have some concerns about 1.1. there are several things that one can do
with a mouse that are not possible from the keyboard in IE.
for example: saving a picture on a web page - with a mouse you click on the
picture then bring up the context menu and a host of commands are
available--these are not available to a keyboard interface without much
work. (yes, you can get the url from the source, then go to the specific
image and save it--tedious at best), another example is controlling an svg
image--I have played with the adobe svg plug in, many features are available
with the mouse (resizing, searching for text, etc.). these functions are not
available via the keyboard because you cannot get to the object on the web
page (the svg is not an active element.)

I think I have the intent of 1.1 correct.

Subject: implementation report for guideline 1:


Here is my best shot at taking on guideline 1.

   1.1 Ensure that every functionality available through the user
          interface is also available through every input API that is
          implemented by the user agent. This checkpoint does not
require
          developers to reimplement the input methods associated with
the
          keyboard, pointing device, voice, and other input APIs.
          [Priority 1]
MicroSoft Internet Explorer5.5 and MicroSoft Office2,000 provide this
functionality
   1.2 Use the standard input and output APIs of the operating system.
Do
          not bypass the standard output APIs when rendering
information.
          [Priority 1]
          IE5.5
   1.3 Implement the operating system's standard API for the keyboard
and
          ensure that every functionality available through the user
          interface is available through this API. [Priority 1]
ie5.5
   1.4 Ensure that the user can interact with all active elements in a
          device-independent manner. [Priority 1]
     ie5.5
   1.5 Ensure that every message (e.g., prompt, alert, notification,
          etc.) that is a non-text element and is part of the user
agent
          user interface has a text equivalent. [Priority 1]
