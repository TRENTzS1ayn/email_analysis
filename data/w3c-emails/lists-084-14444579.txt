HB: What are "recognized" equivalents? By whom? user or user agent?
Omit "all",  not all assistive technology can handle "all" the equivalents,
same problem as in the prior version where "each" was used.

<newer>2.3 For any elements with recognized equivalents, provide easy 
access to equivalents through one of the following mechanisms:</newer>

HB: "Concurrently", rather than "at the same time". The latter can be 
interpreted
as requiring time synchronization (of text, audio, video), such as through 
SMIL,
at some detail level, such as to the word, as we'd like to do in digital 
talking
books, but as a general requirement I believe this is asking too much.

<newer>(2) allowing configuration to render at least two of the alternatives
concurrently from the available equivalents.</newer>

>(3) allowing the user to select the rendered element and then inspect its

HB: Do we expect selection of each entire "rendered element" (such as 
parent container DIV for many children) to have an alternative?

How about:
<newer>(3) allowing the user to select any element that directly contains 
content,
and then inspect its alternatives;</newer>
