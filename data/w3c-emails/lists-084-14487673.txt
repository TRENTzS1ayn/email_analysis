I have read the plain-text version of the User Agent Accessibility 
Guidelines 1.0 / W3C Working Draft 23 October 2000, thinking primarily of 
braille as a means of access, and have not found any area that needs 
correction or expansion.  The express exclusion of braille rendering as a 
subject within these guidelines seems reasonable to me.

I encountered just two minor typos:

1. (2nd paragraph under "Guideline 1."):

2. (Note under checkpoint 8.6):

Congratulations on your thoroughgoing approach to an important topic.
