when you say "we", I'm not sure who you are referring to.  I think
you mean the UA group, and if correct, I agree that the UA guidelines/group
needs
to keep in mind the differing requirements of a UA  versus a AT developer.

I would also agree with this, but I wouldn't say that is the "only" way
a UA might be able to meet this requirement.  The UA should expose
all of its content, and using DOM would seem a "logical" method to do
so.

Again, I would agree, the AT (if they want to stay in business) will have
to provide access to the information in the UA.  "If" using DOM is found
to be the best method to do so, and the AT doesn't use DOM, then they may
or may not meet their responsibility. The UA group should provide examples,
source code, etc., to encourage DOM use.   But that is a decision best left to
the AT developer, not the UA group.

I'm not suggesting any of this...  I'm simply cautioning the UA group that
"how" we present using DOM or any other technology to the AT community
is just as important as the technology itself.
