Hello,

I just got off the phone with the woman who has been
trying to get us hotel rooms for the AOL face-to-face meeting.
She has secured rooms (I think at a Holiday Inn) at $109/night.
That's the AOL rate.

Apparently there are very few rooms available at this time
in the area and these rooms may be smoking rooms (although
we are trying hard to get non-smoking rooms).

I've reserved singles for the following people, the nights
of 15 and 16 November:

 Eric Hansen
 Denis Anson
 Rich Schwerdtfeger
 Gregory Rosmaita
 Ian Jacobs
 Jon Gunderson

Please let me know quickly whether anyone else needs a
room (or someone in the list doesn't).  I'll have more details
about the hotel once the reservations have been confirmed
to me by the person at AOL who's helping us out.

Thank you,

 - Ian
