Hello David:  You are corect about that, and I feel that this is beyond our
abilities to document.  This is an example, and should be treatted as such!

For the record, and I'm sorry that I didn't include it, the synthesizer I
used was DecTalk Access 32 software.

the configurability of jfw speecking rate is dependant on the
synthesizer used and is even marked up differently depending on the
synth/driver used.

I'm going to have to ask that someone else take a crack at adding to
checkpoint 4.10.

Here is what I have so far!



4.1 Allow the user to

configure and control

the reference size of rendered text with an option to override
author-specified and user agent default sizes of rendered text. Make
available the range

of system font sizes. [Priority 1] (

Here is what I can contribute to this checkpoint.

>From the pwWebSpeak help file:

heading 1. WebSpeak Display Options

To increase the character size of the display, press Shift+F11.

To decrease the character size of the display, press Control+F11.

To switch through the pre-set background display colors, press
Control+F12.

To switch through the pre-set foreground display colors, press
Shift+F12.





4.10 Allow the user to

configure and control

synthesized speech playback rate according to the full range offered
by the
speech synthesizer. The lower bound for this range must be at most 120
words

per minute. The upper bound for this range must be at least 400 words
per
minute. The user must be able to increase or decrease the playback
rate in
increments

of 5% of the current playback rate. [Priority 1]





techniques for 4.10



A. User agent reviewed: JFW version 3.70.47

Using the Voice option it is possable to increase or decrease the rate
of
the spoken text.

To do this: 1. Press INSERT+J

This brings up the JAWS program interface.

2. Press V to get into the voice menu.

3. At this point, you have 3 choices to effect the speech rate. G for
Global, J for Jaws cursor or P for PC cursor.

To change the rate globally, Press G for global and R for rate.



4. The rate can be varied from 75 to 650 words per minute.









B. pwWebSpeak



With pwWebSpeak, the changing of speech rate is defined in the
WEBSPEAK.KEY
file. The default is to use ALT+F to increase the speech rate, and
ALT+L to
decrease the speech rate.
