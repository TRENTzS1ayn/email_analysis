Hello David:

Here is the modified text.

by the
speech synthesizer. The lower bound for this range must be at most 120

of 5% of the current playback rate. [Priority 1]





techniques for 4.10



A. User agent reviewed: JFW version 3.70.47

Using the Voice option it is possable to increase or decrease the rate
of
the spoken text.

To do this: 1. Press INSERT+J

This brings up the JAWS program interface.

2. Press V to get into the voice menu.

3. At this point, you have 3 choices to effect the speech rate. G for
Global, J for Jaws cursor or P for PC cursor.

To change the rate globally, Press G for global and R for rate.

NOTE: the configurability of jfw's speecking rate is dependant on the
synthesizer used and has different speech rate settings
depending on the
synthesizer driver used.  In this example, the DecTalk Access32 Software was
used.



4. The rate can be varied from 75 to 650 words per minute.









B. pwWebSpeak



With pwWebSpeak, the changing of speech rate is defined in the
WEBSPEAK.KEY
file. The default is to use ALT+F to increase the speech rate, and
ALT+L to
decrease the speech rate.
