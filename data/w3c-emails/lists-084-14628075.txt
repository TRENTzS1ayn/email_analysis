Hello,

I'm forwarding an issue raised by Karl Dubost (of the W3C Team)
of the 23 October 2000 last call document.

1)  1.2 Use the standard input and output APIs of the operating system.

Issue: What if the standard input and output APIs "do the wrong thing"
       or lead to accessibility problems?

IJ: This seems very similar to previous questions about following
    system conventions. In the past, we've addressed this by saying
    something along the lines of "unless they cause known accessibility
    problems." One proposal is to add this. Another is to leave it
    as is and say that this is an OS problem.

Also, a suggested technique for 7.1:

   I suggest a double or triple mechanisms for navigation between
viewport.
        - You have multiple windows open, ex: ctrl + Alt + tab to 
          switch between windows
        - You have frames, ex: ctrl + tab to select the right frame.
        - You are in a frame or a window, ex tab to select the link or
the box.

   So, people will not have to pass all links of the first window/frame 
   before to have the right thing.

 - Ian
