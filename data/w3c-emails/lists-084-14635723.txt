I am preparing a material on "Equivalency" that will, I think, include a
section on Frequently Asked Questions. I think that might help clarify
things.

My comments are marked with "EH:"

EH: I think that the term 'equivalency target' is much simpler, cleaner, and
certainly better defined than the term 'primary content'.

EH: I think that I would phrase it otherwise. WCAG 1.0 requires text
equivalents for all non-text elements that is authored. In order to fulfill
this requirement, each author-provided non-text element must take the role
of an 'equivalency target' for which the text equivalent is the
'equivalent'. So each multimedia presentation, audio-only presentation, and
video-only presentation, image, etc., becomes an equivalency target for
which the content developer is to provide a text equivalent (as the
'equivalent'). UAAG 1.0 is required to render 'all content' and also to
ensure that there is a text equivalent for each user-agent-generated message
that is non-text content. Some day, the user him or herself might be able to
say, "Here is a non-text element that that I cannot understand. The author
did not provide a text equivalent. User Agent, generate me a text equivalent
for it so that I can understand it." The User Agent might then use a
combination of picture recognition, voice recognition, or other technologies
to produce a text equivalent (or some other kind of equivalent) based on
these user-specified 'equivalency targets'. But that is beyond the scope of
our current document.

EH: I am in favor of not doing things in UAAG 1.0 that would necessitate
significant changes in WCAG 1.0, notably the definition of 'Equivalent' and
the wording of WCAG 1.0 checkpoint 1.1. I have not raised these issues with
WCAG.
