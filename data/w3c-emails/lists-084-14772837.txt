Yes, but the WCAG has placed text in a unique role as the equivalent that you
must have.  Any technical defect which enables or defeats the function of text
as communication, as charset defects do, has a disproportionate impact on
those
dependent on the text for their access to the information.  For all the
reasons
that the WCAG singled text out in this way, this is an unequal hit to people
with disabilities, not an equal hit.

Speech users and all users with smaller-than-normal viewports are unequally
dis-abled by charset defects.  The rest of the users can work around the
effects of charset-related defects more easily, relying on the screen gestalt,
as Francois has described.

Charset information does not fit the pre-condition of this rule (affects
everyone equally).
