Bryan, 

I'm glad to hear that you are reviewing this document. Please note
that this document is *very stale* and we are actively working on it
today. Your input and updates are very welcome.

Please note checkpoint 9.2, which I think captures what you are saying:

 9.2 Avoid default input configurations that interfere 
     with operating system accessibility conventions. [Priority 1]

Ok.

Have you seen all of the keyboard requirements of Guideline 9 yet?
