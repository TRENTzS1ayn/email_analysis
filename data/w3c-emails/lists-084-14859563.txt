The document goes to great lengths to define the content categories mentioned
in this checkpoint.? This leads the reader _away_ from a clear statement of
the
actual requirement on the user agent software.? The UA checkpoint should be to
give the user show/hide control over recognized elective content where
elective
content is recognized by the UA in accordance with the format specifications.?
[Defining content categories is WCA scope, not UA scope.]

For example, SMIL uses the SWITCH contstruct to create elective content.? This
elective content construct is used to include captions, subtitles, overdubs,
etc. in the composite presentation in a way such that it is amenable to choice
or show/hide decision for each play of the SMIL presentation, taking into
account conditions specific to this one play of the content including system
capabilities and user choices.

The motivation for creating the elective content capabilities in the
formats is
to make it possible to include collated text transcripts, etc.? but the
content
is not identified according to the user-oriented categories presently
stated in
checkpoint 2.4 within the markup.? The UA checkpoint should use language that
describes things that the User Agent can recognize in the content, not more
natural-language concepts that can only be recognized by a human observer.

There are really two checkpoints involved here.

a) User control over elective content.? This can be combined with 2.3 with the
right wording.

b) Synchronized presentation where synchronization is supported by the
content.

Al
--
Usage in headers.? Comments in response to the last call request for comments
have been classified S1, S2, or E based on the following rough scale:

S1: Substantive matter of the first (highest) criticality or importance to the
mission of the document.? The standard set is ineffective, the document is
self
contradictory, etc.

S2: Substantive matter of a somewhat lower criticality.? The document is hard
to comprehend, does not align well with related WAI documents, etc.

E: Editorial matters.? Not regarded as substantive.
