[Checkpoint 3.2]

The concept of rendering content "silently" or "invisibly" is not defined and
unclear.? If the silent rendering causes events which trigger listeners at the
API interface, this may be a problem.? If there was a reason to include this
discussion, it does not belong in a note and it must be made clear.? If it can
be dropped, remove it.

Usage in headers.? Comments in response to the last call request for comments
have been classified S1, S2, or E based on the following rough scale:

S1: Substantive matter of the first (highest) criticality or importance to the
mission of the document.? The standard set is ineffective, the document is
self
contradictory, etc.

S2: Substantive matter of a somewhat lower criticality.? The document is hard
to comprehend, does not align well with related WAI documents, etc.

E: Editorial matters.? Not regarded as substantive.
