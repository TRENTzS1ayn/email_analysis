The discussion of selection, focus, point of regard as "User Interface
elements" is confusing.? Particularly when it comes down to describing user
control over "the styling of these UI elemenets."

For content focus, there is a user interaction state variable which is
expressed by a dynamic property or status attached to some content element.

In the case of selection, what the property can be true on at one time is more
complex; it is a content subset, not always an element nor content range per
se.

But the user interface feature is composed of defined content properties and
cardinality rules relating these content properties and [wiewport, window,
etc.] scopes within the user interface.? For example there can only be one
active focus in [some kind of scope].

The point is that being [in] the focus of [the viewport] at the present
time is
a semantic property of a document element reflective of the state of the user
interaction process.? This clears up the style control issues neatly.? These
semantic dynamic properties are part of what the user needs to be able to
observe concerning the state of the interaction process.? To ensure that the
user can distinguish these distinctions as presented by the styled content of
the display medium, the user must have control over the style rules used to
encode these [dynamic, semantic] properties in the display medium. be it
sight,
sound, or touch.

This affects checkpoints 4.15 through 4.17, checkpoints 8.7 and 8.8, and
possibly others.?

Usage in headers.? Comments in response to the last call request for comments
have been classified S1, S2, or E based on the following rough scale:

S1: Substantive matter of the first (highest) criticality or importance to the
mission of the document.? The standard set is ineffective, the document is
self
contradictory, etc.

S2: Substantive matter of a somewhat lower criticality.? The document is hard
to comprehend, does not align well with related WAI documents, etc.

E: Editorial matters.? Not regarded as substantive.
