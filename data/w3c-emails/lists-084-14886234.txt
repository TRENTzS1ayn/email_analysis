[checkpoint 4.13]? Say instead:

Allow the user to control the volume of synthesized speech, independently from
the volume of audio from other sources.

Rationale:

Saying "the synthesized speech volume" implies "the volume of _the_
synthesized
speech" and it is not clear that the second definite article is appropriate.?
There may be more than one source or track of synthesized speech.? Should say
something that equates with "the volume of _any_ synthesized speech," for
which
the suggested rewording is clearer.? Also, "independently from" is better
usage
than "independently of."

There appears to be something funny in the PDF extraction, where whitespace
gets inserted when link content abuts punctuation.? See e.g. end of third
paragraph under section 1.2.

Under Guideline 6, third bullet, where it says]

???? * W3C specifications are developed in a consensus process (refer to
?????? the process defined by the W3C Process Document
?????? [392][W3CPROCESS]). W3C encourages the public to review and
?????? comment on specifications at all times during their development,
?????? from Working Draft to Candidate Recommendation (for implementation
?????? experience) to Proposed Recommendation. [...]

There should be _no comma_.? The sentence with the comma is false.? The W3C
only invites public scrutiny once a public working draft is released, not "at
all times during their development."

The comma indicates a non-restrictive modifier, which makes the statement
false.

In section 3.4 it ignores section 3.3.? It should not.? For example, where it
says

???? * Conformance Level "A": all Priority 1 checkpoints are satisfied

It would better be excessively clear in tying in 3.3 with

???? * Conformance Level "A": all applicable (per 3.3) Priority 1 checkpoints
are satisfied
--
The Note in section 3.7 should be marked explicitly "Note in Draft" and not
just "Note" to indicate that this Note _will be removed_ when the document
attains its target status.

Usage in headers.? Comments in response to the last call request for comments
have been classified S1, S2, or E based on the following rough scale:

S1: Substantive matter of the first (highest) criticality or importance to the
mission of the document.? The standard set is ineffective, the document is
self
contradictory, etc.

S2: Substantive matter of a somewhat lower criticality.? The document is hard
to comprehend, does not align well with related WAI documents, etc.

E: Editorial matters.? Not regarded as substantive.
