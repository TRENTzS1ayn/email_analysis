The definition and use of priorities in this document is not consistent with
their use in WCAG 1.0.

For example, checkpoint 7.3 does not meet WCAG standards for Priority 1,
but is
rather in WCAG terms a Priority 2 (document effectively useless, not
completely
unusable).

This is a thorny issue, as it is not clear that the priorities and conformance
scheme in WCAG 1.0 is the best possible approach in this area.? But doing
something that looks the same but isn't the same has problems of its own.? 

This issue might benefit from some coordination outside the Working Group.

Usage in headers.? Comments in response to the last call request for comments
have been classified S1, S2, or E based on the following rough scale:

S1: Substantive matter of the first (highest) criticality or importance to the
mission of the document.? The standard set is ineffective, the document is
self
contradictory, etc.

S2: Substantive matter of a somewhat lower criticality.? The document is hard
to comprehend, does not align well with related WAI documents, etc.

E: Editorial matters.? Not regarded as substantive.
