This requirement, 

"Do not use color as the only distinguishing factor..."

does not belong in a note because it is a genuine accessibility concern and it
is not implied otherwise.

Notes should only be used to state things that, on rereading the text of the
checkpoints proper, is required already, but the note re-emphasized what was
already there.

Otherwise it needs to move up into the checkpoint, out of the Note category.
