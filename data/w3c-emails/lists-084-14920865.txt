[checkpoint 7.5 where it says]

?? 7.5 Allow the user to search forward through [427]text content that
????????? has been [428]rendered. The search must encompass all text
????????? within the viewport, both inside and outside the [429]point of
????????? regard. Allow the user to start a search from any selected or
????????? focused location in content. When there is a match, allow the
????????? user to search for the next instance of the text from the
????????? location of the match. When there is a match, move the
????????? [430]point of regard so that the matched text is in the
????????? viewport. Alert the user when there is no match. [...]

The use of 'viewport' in the early and later portions of this quote would seem
to be inconsistent.? In the first case, the viewport would appear to comprise
the whole canvas which is stretched out behind (including beyond the bounds
of)
the presently display within e.g. a scroll region.? However, the latter "move
so that the matched text is in _the viewport_ suggest the reverse, that the
viewport is what was called the _point of regard_ in the earlier sentence.

Usage in headers.? Comments in response to the last call request for comments
have been classified S1, S2, or E based on the following rough scale:

S1: Substantive matter of the first (highest) criticality or importance to the
mission of the document.? The standard set is ineffective, the document is
self
contradictory, etc.

S2: Substantive matter of a somewhat lower criticality.? The document is hard
to comprehend, does not align well with related WAI documents, etc.

E: Editorial matters.? Not regarded as substantive.
