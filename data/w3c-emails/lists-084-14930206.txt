Section 1.2 is based on a mistaken concept of "scope of this document."

The scope of this document is not what it actually covers.? It is what it is
chartered to cover.? This is defined in the deliverables clause of the Working
Group charter and reiterated here for the information of the reader.? The
document does not get to cherry-pick topics and propose a scope based on what
questions the group decided to answer.

So, the closing sub-paragraph is currently mislabeled.? The topic of this
section is not

"Accessibility needs that are out of scope"

but rather this section discusses

"Known limitations.

"Some functions that are needed for accessibility are not fully described in
this document.? Some of these that are known include:

<same list>..."

Usage in headers.? Comments in response to the last call request for comments
have been classified S1, S2, or E based on the following rough scale:

S1: Substantive matter of the first (highest) criticality or importance to the
mission of the document.? The standard set is ineffective, the document is
self
contradictory, etc.

S2: Substantive matter of a somewhat lower criticality.? The document is hard
to comprehend, does not align well with related WAI documents, etc.

E: Editorial matters.? Not regarded as substantive.
