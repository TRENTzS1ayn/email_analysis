Checkpoint 8.4

Where it says in the note

?????????????????????????? ... This checkpoint does not require that
????????? the outline view be navigable, but this is recommended; refer
????????? to [456]checkpoint 7.6. 

This appears to be legacy language left over from before the changes in 7.6
and
7.7.? It is quite unclear as it stands, in that checkpoint 7.7 _does_ require
that where there is structural navigation provided pursuant to checkpoint 7.6,
that this [8.4] outline view _does_ present the same selection of "important
elements" as are the destinations reached via the navigation capability.

Or I thought that was what we thought we decided when we put the "same
configuration" language in checkpoint 7.7.

self
