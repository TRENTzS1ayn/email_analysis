[This part of the document is a little unstructured.? Bear with me.? This
comment pertains to the final bullet in the inner bullet list in section 3.3.
where it says]

????????? + The checkpoint requires control of content properties (e.g.,
??????????? video or animation rate) that the subject cannot control
??????????? (e.g., the format does not allow it) or does not
??????????? [594]recognize (e.g., because the property is controlled by a
??????????? script in a manner that the subject cannot recognize).


This exception is dangerously broad.? This is a barn door through which any
and
all requirements could be waived.? It should be reconsidered.

Al
