Unlike graphic or braille rendering, speech rendering often requires 
hardware capability specific to the language.  Even for software 
synthesizers, English and Japanese, for example, are implemented as 
two different modes and Japanese synthesizers usually don't support 
any other languages.

Of course, it would be nice if user gets prompted when there is 
downloadable resource or is possible to select different resource 
available.

     Cheers,
Max
