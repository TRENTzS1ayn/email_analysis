I gather that for HTML, compliance cannot be asserted to an older
version of the language, e.g. to HTML 3.2 ?

For DOM, since lynx is closer to a command line filter than it is to a 
real interactive application, the connection to DOM is dubious.

Could a couple [lynx + some separate libDOM] meets the checkpoint ?
In which case, since a libDOM exists somewhere one click away from the
lynx download page, this would just be a packaging issue.
