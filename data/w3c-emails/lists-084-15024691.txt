you don't need a tv for this but you do need a connection to the
internet either through a lan or a phone line or perhaps cable or dsl.
I know we are all busy right now but if you have a few minutes even if
you don't have the ability to listen to a real audio file, the web
site below will be worth your time.  The freedom box is aimed squarely
at the blind and even better, it is aimed at those who are blind who
for one reason or annother, fear, financial hardship, lack of space,
lack of comprehensibility, laziness or just plain interest in the
cutting edge will not be interested in having a computer.

this new/emerging user agent  may just revolutionize the way we
interact with the world wide web as it talks to you and you talk to
it.  In June of this year,  it was just the dream of its creator who
was sharing it with me in my house one evening.  I grew excited but
had some doubts.  Now that it has begun to come together, it feels
like it has promice.
