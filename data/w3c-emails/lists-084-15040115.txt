Hello,

A few moments ago, the DOM Level 2 specification became
a W3C Recommendation (press release [1]). As described in the
introduction [2], the spec consists of 14 modules. The HTML
module did not become a Recommendation and was sent back to Working
Draft
status to fix some bugs with respect to current implementations.

We will need to discuss how the UAAG 1.0 should adapt
to this development (e.g., change our requirements
to DOM Level 1 HTML, change to DOM Level 1 HTML and then
when the DOM WG sends the HTML module to Proposed Recommendation
as the Advisory Committee to approve an update of UAAG as well, 
etc.)
