The difference is:
 - 7.3 Priority 1: Navigate active elements along with a lot of other
stuff that may
   not be active (e.g., during general structural navigation).
 - 7.4 Priority 2: Navigation of active elements only.

The former is P1 because it's a P1 requirement to have access to
everything. The latter is a P2 because it facilitates navigation with
additional filtering.
