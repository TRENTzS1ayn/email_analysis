Nor are the definitions in ATAG 1.0 the same as those in WCAG 1.0

I disagree: if you can't navigate to the active elements, how do you
activate them? That makes it P1.

I believe we used the Priority scheme in a manner largely consistent
with WCAG and that it worked quite well. Sometimes it's possible
to assign a priority on a "logical" basis (i.e., it's clear that
if you don't do this, access will be impossible). At other times,
there is more judgment involve (e.g., checkpoint 10.1 is a P1
for Level Double-A conformance of documentation to WCAG 1.0 because
the WG felt that two levels were necessary and didn't choose
a relative priority scheme. Or, checkpoint 6.1 is a P1 for *all*
accessibility since otherwise they may never be implemented --
the UAWG decided to "take the lead" here).
