Note: The WG has been favorable to eliminating
these provisions. We have already considered it once and decided 
to keep it (refer to issue 317 [1]). 

This exception clause seems, on the surface, entirely reasonable:
if you cannot do something because a format does not allow it, you
are not required to do it.

One way to narrow the scope would be to indicate which checkpoints
to which this provision is meant to apply.
