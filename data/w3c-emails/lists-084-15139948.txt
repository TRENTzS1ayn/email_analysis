Section 3.2 starts:

  "Developers are encouraged to adopt operating system conventions 
   and features that benefit accessibility to meet the requirements 
   of this document. However, if these features are not accessible, 
   developers must provide an alternative accessible solution."

Is that sufficient, in conjunction with:

   5.8 Follow operating system conventions that benefit accessibility. 
       In particular, follow conventions for user interface design,
keyboard
       configuration, product installation, and documentation. [Priority
2] 

If not sufficient, can you propose text?

Thank you,

 - Ian
