That is not how I read this wording.  There is no guarantee from the present
wording you quote, that where color is offered it will not be the only
distinction employed.  It merely requires that somewhere among the options
color will be employed.  This is where Eric's preference for the singular
would
be of help.  The loophole here is the fact that it is the aggregate of all the
options which must in aggregate contain colors and fonts;  This does not imply
that the option which involves color will at the same time involve some other
formatting property such as font.

In other words "OK, that's what you meant, but not what you said."
