Checkpoint 4.14?Allow the user to configure synthesized voice gender,
pitch, pitch range, stress, richness, and control of spelling, punctuation,
and number processing according to the full range of values offered by the
speech synthesizer. P2.

The list of options is too long and if all are supported at the same time
will add complexity and confusion to the user.  Complexity and ease-of use
needs to be considered.  For example:

1. Gender and Age settings are a superset of pitch, stress, and richness.
It would be complex and confusing to try to allow both settings.

2.  Spelling and punctuation is simple.

3.  Number processing is complex and dependent on the synthesizer.
Exposing a UI to the users would not add to the capability of the
synthesizer.
