Checkpoint 3.5?Allow the user to configure the user agent not to execute
scripts or applets. In this configuration, provide an option to alert the
user when scripts or applets are available. P1.

Plug-ins need to be added and further clarification needed.

1. Plug-ins needs to be explicitly added along with scripts and applets.

2. A technique or note needs to be explicit that it is acceptable to notify
the user on a per page basis.  Existing techniques imply that it must be on
an element basis, as in the following techniques statement:
"... Allow the user to stop and start the flow of changes made by scripts.
Prompt the user for confirmation of a pending change. ..."

3.  A technique or note needs to be explicit that notifying the user of the
availability of the script, applet or plug-in, does not imply that the UA
must know what the purpose of the turned-off script applet or plug-in is
for,  unless enough semantic information is supplied by the author.  See
WCAG technique of adding title attribute etc...
