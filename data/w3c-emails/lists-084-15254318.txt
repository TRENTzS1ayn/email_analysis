Hello,

> 4.11 ...
>         A person who can hear knows when the audio stops so they can
>         know when to move onto their next task. Turning off the volume
>         takes that cue away from the user who can hear and gives no
>         indication to the person who can't hear when audio is stopped.
>         On Macs, when volume is turned off, an audible tone is instead
>         represented as a screen flash. Should an equivalent "provide a
>         visual indication when audio ends (and begins?)" be added to

> Under UI checkpoints for guideline #4 ...
>         A regular access related guideline in UI styleguides is that
>         the size of the components should scale when the size of the
>         object it contains (e.g. a lable or graphic) changes. This
>         point doesn't seem to be reflected in any of the checkpoints in

>         checkpoint or crafting a new one specifically for it.
> 
> 5.4 ...
>         This reads like a UI not content related checkpoint. Recommend
>         making this more clearly a content checkpoint or moving it into
>         the UI section of checkpoints.
> 
>         Also recommend moving the example contained in the checkpoint

>         to match the style of the guideline's other checkpoints.
> 
> Under UI checkpoints for guideline #5 ...

> 8.5 ...
>         Does the current HTML/XML/? spec and language provide
>         mechanisms authors can use (and UAs can refer to) to provide
>         the information called for in this checkpoint or are they on
>         their own to figure how they provide (author) and where to go
>         to get this info (UA)? If no, consider removing this checkpoint
>         till support for where to provide it is available. Appologies
>         if this is answered in the techniques for this checkpoint, it
>         couldn't be verified because going there keeps crashing the

> 
> 9.7 ...
>         Saving user preferences is an important usability requirement
>         that every user has, it goes far beyond accessibility. Consider
>         bumping this checkpoint up to a P1.
