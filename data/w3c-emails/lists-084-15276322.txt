The "Status of this Document" in the front matter includes the following
statement:

"... This document is part of a series of accessibility documents published
by the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) of the World Wide Web Consortium
(W3C). WAI Accessibility Guidelines are produced as part of the WAI
Technical Activity. The ..."

which includes links to "WAI" and "Technical activity".  It would be more
useful to also provide a direct link to the "series of accessibility
documents published".  I believe the "Resources" page on the new WAI site
should remain stable enough that it could and should be referenced from
UAAG.

i.e., http://www.w3.org/WAI/Resources/
