Checkpoint 10.1?Ensure that at least one version of the product
documentation conforms to at least Level Double-A of the Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 P1.

The priority of this checkpoint is confusing.

How can it be a priority 1 to provide both priority one and priority two
level documentation?  Perhaps it would be clearer as a priority 1 to
provide priority one level documentation, priority 2 to provide double-A
level documentation, and priority 3 to provide triple-a compliant
documentation.

The nature of User Agents do not necessarily increase the need for higher
levels of accessible documentation than specified in WCAG.
