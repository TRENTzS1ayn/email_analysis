Checkpoint 6.2?Use and conform to W3C Recommendations when they are
available and appropriate for a task. P2.

Clarifications is needed, for example:

1. Checkpoint is somewhat recursive.  How can you conform to this
checkpoint without conforming to ALL the UAAG checkpoints first?

2.  Can a User Agent comply with a recommendation but not provide a user
interface that supports it?  For example, the UA may render ACRONYM and
ABBR, but not provide any user interface that notifies the user, allows the
user to navigate, expand or collapse, etc.

3.  Can a User Agent comply with a recommendation but not support all the
recommendation or specification?  For example, the UA may support SMIL, but
not all the attributes.  Although the techniques state: "Each specification
defines what conformance means for that specification.", that may need to
be added to the checkpoint note and further explained in the context of
user agents.
