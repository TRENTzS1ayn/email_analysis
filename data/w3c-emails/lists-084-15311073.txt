Checkpoint 7.4?Allow the user to choose to navigate only active elements.
If the author has not specified a navigation order, allow at least forward
and reverse sequential navigation of active elements, in document order.
P2.

Clarification is needed on the phrase "only active elements", for example:

1. 7.3 (p1) specifies "ALL" active elements,  among other elements, while
7.4 (p2) specifies "ONLY" among active elements.  Can a user agent comply
with 7.4 if it specifies a navigation scheme that only navigates among
active elements, but doesn't navigate to "all" active elements?  For
example, it navigates among links, image maps, form controls, LONGDESC, and
some, but not all element instances with scripts (event handlers through
the various "on" attributes)?
