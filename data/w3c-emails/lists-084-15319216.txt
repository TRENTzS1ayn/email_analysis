Checkpoint 7.6?Allow the user to navigate efficiently to and among
important structural elements identified by the author. Allow forward and
backward sequential navigation to important structural elements. P2

The wording needs further clarification, for example:

1. the phrase "identified by the author" seems to imply that the mark-up
supported has some additional way for the author to identify which
structural elements are important and which are not important to navigate
efficiently, other than the element itself.   Further down in the
techniques it use the phrase:
"...Instead, user agents are expected to construct the navigation view from
author-supplied markup. For those languages with known conventions for
identifying important components, user agents should construct the
navigation tree from those components, allowing ...",
which seems to imply that the mark-up is only supplied by the author, not
identified as being more or less important.  Perhaps it would be clearer to
delete the phrases "identified by the author" and "author-supplied" and
simply state the checkpoint as:
"Allow the user to navigate efficiently to and among important structural
elements. Allow forward ..."
and the technique as:
"...Instead, user agents are expected to construct the navigation view from
mark-up conventions.  For those ..."
