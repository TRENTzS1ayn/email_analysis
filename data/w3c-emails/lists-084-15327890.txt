I'm not sure that's really a problem here. If you're already trying
to conform to this specification, then you mean 6.2 for user
agents.

That depends on the requirements of the specification. In the case of
HTML, there is not specified rendering of ACRONYM and ABBR. So there
are no rendering requirements to conform to. There are semantics,
however.
So however the user agent renders ABBR, it at least knows that it is
used to mark up and abbreviation. The UA guidelines doesn't say how
to create user interfaces for markup languages. Only to conform to 
specifications.

That depends on the Recommendation. Each Recommendation specifies its
conformance criteria. We explicitly say "conform to" as opposed to
"implement" (and the glossary explains the difference).
