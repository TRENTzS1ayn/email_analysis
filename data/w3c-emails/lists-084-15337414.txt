The WG explicitly chose level double-A for this checkpoint (rather
than single-A and rather than a relative priority) because it was
considered very important that the user be able to overcome all
difficult and impossible barriers to using the UA's documentation.

WCAG doesn't specify what level of conformance is best for what
situations. The UA Working Group decided that Double-A was a
P1 requirement for conformance user agent documentation
We recognize that this is "skewed" in the sense that the mapping
is not single-to-single, double-to-double, etc. This was a conscious
decision of the WG.
