Hi Richard,

Thank you very much for reviewing the documents. I have some
comments below on your questions. I've incorporated your editorial
suggestions. Issues you have raised will appear in our issues list:

The key term here is "document object". If the repair content is
included in the document object, then it will be available through
the DOM. If the repair content is "just rendered" (or for any
reason not in the DOM) then it will not be available through the
DOM (to assistive technologies). This document does not require
that generated repair content (including repair text) appear
in the DOM.

This sounds like an authoring (read: WCAG) problem. How does
the user agent know that content A is redundant to content B
(and furthermore that the redundancy isn't for the express
purpose of promoting accessibility)?

Thus the requirement that the user agent alert the user that scripts
are available but not being executed. This should help the user guess
why there is no content available. I propose to add this scenario
to the techniques document as another piece of rationale.

Good point. I think the idea is to point people to information
about doing server-side redirects *instead of* client-side
redirects. I'll clarify that that this note is really for authors.

I'll add this to the issues list. Please also refer to
previous discussions on this topic (issue 264):

I'm not sure it's a special case since synth speech is not
necessarily "audio source(s) synchronized to play simultaneously".

We will discuss this as part of issue 357

Can you explain why this is? If the focus or selection is not
highlighted
somehow through speech, how does the user know what content is
focused or selected?

Not exactly, though they are related:

 4.18 is about focus changes (which may be disorienting)
 4.20 is about viewport changes (which may be disoriented for other
reasons,
   including the sheer number of viewports, or one viewport hiding
another).

Often, when a viewport opens, the focus shifts automatically to it.
That's
what 4.18 is meant to cover.

This issue was raised in the first last call (issue 111).
   http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#111

At their 10 December 1999 face-to-face meeting, the 
Working Group decided to leave this as a Priority 1 checkpoint
for a very specific purpose: to give authors the possiblity
of using "P3" WCAG requirements. The WG felt quite strongly
that if user agent developers don't take the lead in implementing
features that promote accessibility, then having P3 requirements
in WCAG will serve no purpose.

I'm not sure I understand yet.
Can you please provide us some implementation examples of this?

I'm not sure what "content only" means. Aren't links part of content?
Or do you mean a kind of "read-only" presentation where the user
cannot interact with the document? That seems un-Web-like to me....

I'll add to issues list.

Agreed. I think that the definition will probably evolve due
to issue #358:

Ok.
