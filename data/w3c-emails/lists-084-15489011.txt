I've added to the issues list.

Ok, we can add to techniques an example.

The requirement to resize non-text content has been explicitly
cited as an out-of-scope issue for this version of the
document. From section 1.2: 

  "This document does not in general address
   control of the size and color of rendered non-text content. "

Can you explain a little bit more the scenario you're referring to?
What case are you talking about where the user advances from task
to task based on audio cues (or knows to advance when audio stops)?
Would this be covered by checkpoint 1.5 : each message that is
a non-text element and in the UI must have a text equivalent?

I will add to the issues list.

It's in the section entitled "checkpoints for communication with other 
software", which seems better than either content or UI. Does that work?
