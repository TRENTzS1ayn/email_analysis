AG:: 

We are not communicating.? I am not claiming that we decided anything other
than the third point you just reiterated above.? So at least on that we
seem to
have the same recollection.

I do, however, claim that in the light of this decision, the "not required to
be navigable" language is misleading enough so that we should change it.?
It is
not enough, once one has said that, to have a bland "see also checkpoint 7.7"
at the end of the paragraph. 

Navigation of the points listed in the 8.4 outline summary does not have to be
provided by virtual-hypertext clickability, but those have to be navigable
points if 7.6 and 7.7 are satisfied.? So, the way I would describe it, this
outline _does_ have to be navigable if 7.6 is satisfied, Precisely _how_ one
navigates to the points 8.4 orients you to is implementation defined.? I would
be quite happy if it were modified to say 

"Although this checkpoint per_se does not require that this outline is
navigable, checkpoint 7.7 does require that if there is structural navigation
provided to meet checkpoint 7.6, that that structural navigation will get you
to the points in the document presented in the checkpoint 8.4 orientation to
page structure."
