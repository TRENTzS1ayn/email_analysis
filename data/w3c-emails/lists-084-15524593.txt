Hello,

I've updated the second last call issues list [1] for our meeting
this week. I documented 122 issues. Some of them will challenge 
us, but my impression after reading them is that the list
(while long, admittedly) is manageable. 

The very good news is that this heavy review came during last
call. This is much better than if it had come at Proposed
Recommendation. This means that if we handle the comments well,
we are very likely to have many fewer issues to address later on.

I recommend the following to help us process these comments
in a timely manner:

 - Please remember that we should avoid adding new requirements 
   at this phase. 

 - Closed issues should remain closed unless there is new 
   information to justify re-opening them. 

 - People can register their objections when they dissent
   and the Chair decides to "move on" nevertheless. The Chair
   has the right to have the WG move on despite dissent. However,
   if the Chair abuses this power (which I have never seen our
   fine Chair do), there are appeal paths available.

See you at the meeting on Thursday,

 _ Ian
