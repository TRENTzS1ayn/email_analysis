I suggest we keep the current minimum speech rate range.  But instead of 
using an English wpm information use:

Minimum low rate: 2/3 average speaking rate for supported language (120wpm 
for English, based on180wpm average speaking rate)

Minimum high rate: 2.5 times average speaking rate for supported language 
(450wpm for English, based on 180wpm speaking rate)
