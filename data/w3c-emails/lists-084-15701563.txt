I suggest that we do not change checkpoint 4.14 (other than for other 
resolved changes for adding language), but add the following note after the 
checkpoint.

[NEW]
Note: Many speech synthesizers confound the specification of voice gender, 
pitch range, stress, richness in named voice labels that use pitch range, 
stress and richness parameters to help create different voice sounds (i.e 
adult male, child female, robot voice).  When using these synthesizers make 
available the full range of voices.
