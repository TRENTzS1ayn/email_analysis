Hello,

During this Candidate Recommendation review period, please send
all reviews that may be publicly viewable to this archive and
I will incorporate them in the implementation report.

If you have reviews that must remain Team-confidential, please
send them to me personally and I will archive them in a
Team-confidential space.

Thank you,

 - Ian
