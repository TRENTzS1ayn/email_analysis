aloha, ian!

i am currently taking a whack at drafting LONGDESCs for the screen shots that i
sent to the UA list and which were incorporated into the techniques
document...  i will share the results with you, so as to lessen the burden upon
you, personally, as i know you are completely swamped with other matters...

i'm using the basic TR template as the basis for the LONGDESCs, and envision
them in a sub-directory (/longdesc), just as the images are stored (at least in
the archives) in an /image sub-directory...  i will post drafts in a temporary
directory at my web site, and solicit your opinion as i progress, as i know it
is important that the LONGDESCs conform not only to the W3C GLs for technical
reports and notes, but to the look and feel of the UAAG itself...

i'm also attempting to create audio files to illustrate the points made in the
documentation/descriptions of the images that i've sent to the list...  is
anyone at IBM SNS who has evaluated HPR against UAAG, or from ProdWorks who has
evaluated PWWebSpeak against UAAG, attempting to do the same?  if so, could you
please share strategies slash software used?  i think it only logical for us to
provide aural examples of aurally-oriented browsers -- screen shots of aural
browsers strike me as -- if not oxymoronic -- at least illogical...

as a side note, i tried to replicate the aural experience of a frameset in a
low tech manner in the description i sent to the list by transcribing JFW's
default action when encountering a frameset -- something which i hope will find
a place in Accessibility Topic 3.6, Frame Techniques, alongside the placeholder
for an audio file containing HPR's action when encountering a frameset ...

gregory.
