Hi Jon, 

I have completed the following action items:

> 
>     1.IJ: Ask Jason White for CSS implementation information for emacspeak

I ended up writing to T.V. Raman instead, who said that emacsspeak
implements
CSS2 ACSS. 
 
>     2.IJ: Publish new implementation report for the meeting

Done: http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-IMP-20001113/
 
>     3.IJ: Improve wording of note for 4.14 related to CSS reference

Proposed:

   Ranges of values for these characteristics may vary among speech
synthesizers.
   For information about these synthesized speech characteristics,
please refer 
   to descriptions in section 19.8 of Cascading Style Sheets Level 2
[[CSS2]].

However, refer to issue 361: 
  http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#361
