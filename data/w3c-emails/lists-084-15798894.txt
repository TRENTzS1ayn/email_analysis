Thanks for sending them in, Steven. I'll send more comments later.

RFC 2119  [1] says:
 
  "These words are often capitalized."

This will become clear when you read section 3 (which from comments
further
on it doesn't look like you've read yet). The answer is:

1) All requirements must be satisfied (subject to applicability)
2) It doesn't matter which component of a claim satisfies the different
requirements;
   conformance is for the subject of the claim as a whole.

Therefore, we have no need to distinguish between operating system,
browser, plug-ins,
or anything else - all you need to know is that the components in the
conformance claim
satisfy the checkpoints.
