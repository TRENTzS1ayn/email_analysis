Subject:  Group photo from face-to-face meeting



Hello,

I've put a photo [1] online of the group (minus Rich, who had
already left) of participants at AOL last week.

Back row from left: Ian Jacobs, Denis Anson, Eric Hansen, Jon Gunderson.
Front row from left: David Poehlman, Al Gilman, Debbie Fletter, Harvey
Bingham.

I've added a link from the minutes.

 _ Ian
