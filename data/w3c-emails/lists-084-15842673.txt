Confound means to me that they make it very difficult. Do you mean compound

  Note: Many speech synthesizers confound the specification of voice gender,
  pitch range, stress, richness in named voice labels that use pitch range,
  stress and richness parameters to help create different voice sounds (i.e
  adult male, child female, robot voice).  When using these synthesizers make
  available the full range of voices.
