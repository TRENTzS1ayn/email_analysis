Charles,
What happens is that the user agent can enumerate a number of voice labels 
that are typically made available to users as a list of voice 
options.  Each voice label has its own pitch range and other voice filter 
parameters that determine the "sound" and "accent" of the voice (i.e adult 
male, child female, robotic...).  Usually features like average pitch and 
speech rate can be adjusted within a voice label, but the other voice 
filtering parameters like pitch range, stress and richness cannot be 
adjusted within the label. Therefore the voice label confounds these later 
voice filter parameters since they cannot be adjusted manually, and 
typically if you allow the user to adjust these filters manually they can 
easily set filter parameters that result in unstable speech filters (i.e. 
noise rather than speech is generated).  But I would leave it to the 
editors to find the right words.

Jon
