EH::

What one captures (at least roughly) with the phrase 'available tri-modally'
is what in UAAG 1.0 (23 October 2000) is the definition of 'text element'.
What one is still missing is the 'equal access' provision of 'equivalency'
that would say: 'A text equivalent is content that is available tri-modally
AND in doing so fulfills essentially the same function as some other content
(the equivalency target) does for a person without any disability.' In other
words it is not enough that content is understandable is each of the three
modes. It is essential that the understanding (or communication function)
that is obtained in each of the three modes is essentially the same as that
which is obtained by a person without any disability who is accessing the
other content.

I think that what I am trying to do is maintain that distinction that is

EH:

To my understanding, 'equal access' necessarily involves a comparison
between (at least) one person with a disability and a person without a
disability. Consider some explanatory material regarding the section 508
regulations for federal (U.S.) procurement:

"Section 508 requires that when Federal agencies develop, procure, maintain,
or use electronic and information technology, they shall ensure that the
electronic and information technology allows Federal employees _with
disabilities_ to have access to and use of information and data that is
comparable to the access to and use of information and data by Federal
employees who are _not individuals with disabilities_, unless an undue
burden would be imposed on the agency."

EH::

I think that a better approach would be to simply give a few examples:
'e.g., images, animations, video, audio, ascii art, scripts, etc.' and then
refer them to WCAG 1.0. This might give WCAG a little more wiggle room in
their version 2.0.

EH:: 

As I considered the definition of alternative relationship, I was somewhat
surprised to find myself thinking that the linkage between alternative and
equivalent was important. But I do think that now.

I think that we are agreed that there is no existing specification that
requires that an 'alt' attribute have anything to do with disability access.
As far as I know, the same is true with analogous mechanisms in SMIL, etc.

I think that there may be a misunderstanding due to my bad wording. I will
try to clarify my intent.

My previous wording:

> > "An 'alternative relationship' is the set of alternatives 

Old (Eric's first proposal):

"Alternative; alternative relationship. An alternative is content that
resides in a location appropriate (according to specification) for the
content that serves the role equivalency target or equivalent. For example,
according to WCAG 1.0, in HTML, for an image that is an equivalency target,
an appropriate location for its text equivalent is between the quote marks
in the alt attribute (alt="").

New (27 November 2000 proposal):

"Alternative; alternative relationship. An alternative is 'pre-rendering'
content that is implemented using a mechanism that is prescribed for the
role equivalency target or equivalent. For example, according to WCAG 1.0,
in HTML, for an image that is an equivalency target, an appropriate
mechanism for implementing its text equivalent is between the quote marks in
the alt attribute (alt=""). It must be noted that specifications (HTML,
SMIL, etc.) may allow such mechanisms for any of a wide array of purposes,
many of which are unrelated to disability access."

What I am trying to do by restricting our use of alternative in the document
is to avoid an unlimited scope of things that user agent developers must
worry about. For example, suppose that I have a web page with a menu of four
options: a, b, c, and d. Each option or 'alternative' (general usage) has a
link to a different page. Do we really want user agent developers to be
required to provide the capabilities in checkpoint 2.3 for those options? I
think not. I believe that we only want them to focus on mechanisms that, by
specification, are those that _might_ be used for equivalents (i.e., for
disability access).

I must emphasize that this restriction in no way, shape or form is
attempting to modify or restrict the usages of specific mechanisms (e.g.,
'alt' attribute) to disability access. To do so is, I think beyond our
charter. It is only intended to help developers by narrowing the universe of
different mechanisms that they need to worry about.

Frankly, one of the top thoughts on my W3C mind over the last several days
is my thought that that phrase is not restrictive enough.

EH::

In a previous memo, I have outlined how the notion of equivalency could be
useful for language translations. However, to the best of my knowledge,
providing access to language translations was never regarded as an
accessibility issue per se. Therefore, the definition of equivalency as used
in the WAI docs should not be modified to yet better accommodate language
translations. However, it is perfectly permissible to use 'alt' attribute or
similar mechanisms for language translations. If we must use the word
'equivalency' when referring to language translations, then we need to
qualify the term to something like:

"Language Equivalency. A language equivalency relationship between two
pieces of content means that one piece of content with base natural language
'A' is able to fulfill essentially the same function (insofar as in feasible
given the state of technology and the nature of the languages) for an adept
user of that language as another piece of content with base natural language
'B' does for an adept user of that language. In the absence of markup to the
contrary, neither language is presumed to be the 'original' or more accurate
expression of the content."

I personally don't think that UAAG 1.0 should be obliged to deal with the
language translation issue. Such involvement might be appropriate for
version 2.0.

This may be okay, but I am not sure that it correctly characterizes the
mechanisms that we are referring to. For example, I don't think that there
is any such restriction on the use of 'alt' attribute. I think the specs a
pretty wide open. Furthermore, in the future there may be other
mechanisms... I think it much more direct and accurate to simply say that we
are focusing on mechanisms identified as proper (permissive, if not
exclusive) for equivalents and equivalency targets. Such an approach does
not attempt to reinterpret or modify existing specs (HTML, SMIL).

I don't think that I can fully articulate my concerns. But I think that one
issue is that since (at this moment) user agent can only recognize
_alternative relationships_ and must _infer_ the existence of 'equivalency
relationships', then the handling of empty alt attributes needs to be part
of the _inference_ processing. In other words, this issue needs to be
addressed at the stage in which one is evaluating the alternatives and
determining whether to count them as an equivalency relationship or not.
Perhaps this should be a special case of the checkpoint 2.3.A that I
proposed below.

Old (23 October 2000):

2.6 Allow configuration so that when the author has specified an empty text
equivalent for non-text content, the user agent generates no repair text or
generates repair text as required by checkpoint 2.5. [Priority 3] 
Note: An empty text equivalent (e.g., alt="") is considered to be a valid
text equivalent in some authoring scenarios. For instance, when some
non-text content has no other function than pure decoration, or an image is
part of a "mosaic" of several images and doesn't make sense out of the
mosaic. Please refer to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0
[WCAG10] for more information about text equivalents. Refer also to
checkpoint 2.5.

EH:: 

As nearly as I can recall, the working group seemed to be of the opinion
that issue of what gets rendered "first" should be considered distinct and
separate from the issue of whether something is an equivalent or an
equivalency target. Thus, the equivalency relationship should not, in
itself, characterize either the equivalent or the equivalency target as
being more preeminent or more worthy of being presented "first". I have
attempted to respect that distinction, which means that, as you suggest, it
is fine for other mechanisms (markup languages and style sheets) to
determine what is presented first.

I believe that checkpoint 2.3 should focus on what it says -- 'equivalents'
and 'equivalency targets', regardless of what those other mechanisms (markup
languages, style sheets, etc.) say about what is presented first. In other
words, checkpoint 2.3 does not speak to what gets presented 'first'.
Nevertheless, based on existing conventions for presentation, typically, the
equivalency target (i.e., the alternative that is inferred to be the
equivalency target) will be presented 'first' and the equivalent (the text
in the alt attribute) will be presented second. But our checkpoints are not
intended to interfere with or prescribe such things.

Thus, the focus of this proposed checkpoint is on the equivalency role, not
on the issue of what is presented first. To reiterate, the working group has
wished to treat the issue of equivalency role as a distinct and separate
issue than the issue of what gets presented first.

I personally don't think that it is necessary to have a checkpoint like 2.3
addressing things that are presented first versus second, etc.

EH::

One of the purposes of this checkpoint is to reinforce the idea that
sometimes the heuristics in 2.3.A might be wrong. For example, someone may
have intended for an image to serve as a non-text equivalent for a text
(that is the equivalency target). Although given the currently available
mechanisms, an author might be considered unwise in trying to use the IMG
and 'alt' mechanism to do this. Perhaps at this stage this, checkpoint is
not essential, but I think that it does help fill in the picture.
Furthermore, I am thinking that few people are likely to object to a
rational checkpoint of this kind at the Priority 3 level. (At least they
should not at an earlier stage of progress...!)
