Hello,

Per my action item [1] assigned at the AOL face-to-face meeting
about issue 339 [2], I have spoken to the Director about how
to proceed with DOM requirements in light of the fact that the DOM
Level 2 HTML module did not advance to Recommendation with the modules.
The Director thought the following proposal was a reasonable way
to address this issue:

1) That we not include DOM HTML requirements in UAAG 1.0 since:

   a) the DOM Level 1 HTML module apparently has some bugs (hence
      the delays in DOM Level 2 HTML: they want to fix the bugs).

   b) we do not want to require DOM Level 1 HTML support only
      to turn around and require DOM Level 2 HTML support in 
      a few months (in a UAAG re-release).

2) Each time the UAAG 1.0 advances to a higher level of the
Recommendation
   track:

   a) Tell the Advisory Committee that we intend to "piggy back" the
      DOM Working Group's Proposed Recommendation for the DOM Level 2
      HTML module. We intend to ask the Advisory Committee to approve
      a revision to UAAG 1.0 to include additional HTML DOM requirements
      at the same time they approve the DOM Level 2 HTML module.

   b) Indicate our intentions in the spec as well.

3) If the Advisory Committee approves the revision, we republish
   UAAG 1.1 (or something similar).

 - Ian
