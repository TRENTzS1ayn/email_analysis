I think for checkpoint 4.12 we could use some of this language of digital 
talking books for the minimum speech rate range.  We could say the minimum 
requirement is from 50% of the average speaking rate for a language (i.e. 
180 wpm for English) to 250% of  the average speaking rate for a 
language.  Provide at least 10 geometrically increasing rate settings 
within the range provided.

This is related to issues 401, 402.
