Hi Kitch,

Checkpoint 4.7 (captioning positions) has a clear interest in the
applicability provision related to control of format properties since
you may not be able to move captions in some formats (e.g., when the
caption is "burned" into the video). So I was just giving a heads-up
that if we change or delete the applicability provision (as the result
of another issue), we need to make sure that 4.7 says something about
formats.
