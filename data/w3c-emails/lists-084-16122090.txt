Thank you Jason, Gregg, and Wendy.  I will incorporate your
editorial suggestions and add other issues to our issues list.

I think that we should definitely create an executive
summary as a separate document (possibly linked from this
document). However, I don't think that lack of an executive
summary should stop us from advancing to Recommendation.

Added as issue 449:

I think this is editorial. I propose including a reference
to the (Draft) Note entitled "How People with Disabilities
Use the Web":

   http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/PWD-Use-Web/Overview.html

I would rather have this document published as a TR Note
before we refer to it. I have written Judy Brewer to find
out the publication schedule.

I don't see any references to ATAG in section 1.2 [1]. There
is a reference to AERT already. The only reference to ATAG10
is in the "Related resources" section.

Editorial. I am a little reticent to add the proposed phrase
since that would shift focus from what is expected to what
is possible. I'd rather repeat the whole modified sentence
in section 3.

Editorial. I will remove the emphasis.

Editorial. I propose that we change "almost every platform"
to "many platforms".  People may make conformance claims
about user agents on mobile devices, but that is not our
target audience.

Editorial. Proposed change from Eric Hansen:

   synthesizers, and braille displays."

Editorial. As a result of our resolution to issue 345 [2],
we will be modifying this checkpoint fairly significantly
and I believe that it will be much easier to use and
understand. I will account for your proposal in our rewrite.

Yes.

We discussed this as part of issue 323 [3] at our recent
face-to-face meeting. We resolved to "Change 1.2 to require
implementation of available standard accessibility APIs, and
where these APIs do not provide required functionality (by
this document), support standard device APIs."  Would this
address your issue?

"standard accessibility APIs" would include Java.

Is that entirely true? I thought that the virtual machine's
job was to interpret byte code, but that you could write
programs to do whatever you want. I am not a Java
programmer...

I will add this discussion to the issues list as issue 450:

Yes, we designed checkpoint 5.4 to allow for this case,
which is why it reads: "Provide programmatic read and write
access to user agent user interface controls using standard
APIs (e.g., platform-independent APIs such as the W3C DOM
..."

I agree with you. I don't think that 1.4 is (any longer) a
special case of 1.1. I propose to delete that sentence.
 
> 14. 2.1 and 2.3 seem very redundant or that 2.3 is a technique of 2.1.

Editorial.

The important difference between checkpoints 2.1 and 2.3 is
that checkpoint 2.3 requires access to equivalent
information in context. The user must have "easey" access to
equivalents. Checkpoint 2.1 is only about the global
requirement for access to all content. I propose to add
language to the Note after 2.3 to explain the difference
would be useful. Al Gilman sent me private email on this
topic recently, in fact.

> apply to applications.

We don't specify in this document how the document object is
constructed (in fact the definition says that it may come
from a variety of sources).  If part of the document object
is rendered as a user interface (e.g., form controls), and
that is considered "an application", then checkpoint 2.1
covers that content. Can you explain what type of
applications you don't think are covered by 2.1?

Can you provide examples of other cases? I will add this
as issue 451: 
  http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#451

Note: We do distinguish "content [not] recognized as
style" in checkpoints 4.5 and 4.6. We have been asked to
clarify that phrase as part of issue 398.
  http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#398

I will add this as issue 452:
  http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#452

Here are some comments on these options:

1) The WG established that the minimal requirement was to
   turn off timing and require manual interaction from the
   user. Allowing the user to specify time interval
   multipliers (5, 10, etc.) seems like more work for the developer.
   If you limit the menu to two or three multipliers, you
   may not meet the user's needs and you run the risk of the
   granularity being so chunky as to make the presentation
   less usable. Allowing the user to specify an arbitrary
   multiplier seems like a big demand on developers.

2) Issue 360 is also about this checkpoint. We decided at the AOL
   face-to-face meeting to reduce the scope of this checkpoint
   to timing that is recognized from markup, not scripts.

> 18. 2.3 last item in note could be easier to understand. Perhaps "4. by
> providing readily available links to the equivalents"

Editorial. We used to say "easy access" (which sounds like
"readily available") and we decided to state more
specifically that the link needs to be just before or after
the rendered content. I think the wording of this checkpoint
may change as the result of other issues, but I'm not sure
that "readily available links" is specific enough to satisfy
earlier reviewers' requests for specificity.
 
> 19. Why are checkpoints 3.1 and 3.8 separate?  They seem
> redundant.

Checkpoint 3.1 is about background images specifically - the
accessibility issue is that users may not be able to
perceive content (e.g., text) above a background image. This
is a P1 issue. Checkpoint 3.8 is about images in general,
and the accessibility issue is more related to potential
confusion caused by too much visual information. The WG has
repeatedly maintained that this is only a P2 accessibility
issue. (Refer, for example, to discussions on this topic
at 19 April 2000 teleconf:
  http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2000/04/wai-ua-telecon-20000419.html)
 
> 20. Could checkpoint 3.5 be more general,

As part of resolving issue 364, we agreed to add "plug-ins"
to this list. I will add your proposal as issue 453:
  http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#453

http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2000/11/minutes-20001116#issue-364

In the previous last call document, these were P3 requirements:
   http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WD-WAI-USERAGENT-19991105/

At the 20 January face-to-face, we raised the priority of
these checkpoints to P2.
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JanMar/0152.html

I will add the question of the priority of these checkpoints
as issue 454:
  http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#454

Editorial.

There are two cases here:

1) Some requirements have to do with positioning in space,
   and therefore we limited their scope to graphical
   viewports. These include checkpoints 4.7 4.21, and 9.9.

2) Some checkpoints include minimal requirements for
   graphical viewports (4.16, 4.17, 4.19. 8.2, and 8.3) 
   related to colors and fonts. The WG did not choose to
   include minimal requirements for other types of viewports
   (I believe for at least two reasons: lack of experience
   and these were not the target user interfaces).

I propose addressing this by including a sentence in the
section on the "scope" of this document.
 
> 23. Guideline 4 Shouldn't the last word be "presentation" instead of
> styles. 

Editorial.

In this document, we only use the term "presentation" to
mean "a collection of information, consisting of one or more
Web resources, intended to be rendered simultaneously, and
identified by a single URI" (that's part of the
definition). 

I think "rendering" might be a better term in this light.
I will add this as issue 455:

Yes, refer to issue 398.
  http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#398

We will be modifying the wording of this checkpoint
(including the minimal requirements) based on issue 328:
   http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2000/11/minutes-20001116#issue-328

Requirement: Allow the user to configure playback rate 
             according to the range offered by the speech synthesizer. 

The following will be informative only:
  - Rate depends on language 
  - Provide some example ranges for English and other languages 
  - Tell developers that for ease of use, need to have
    granularities for control (e.g., big jumps or small
    jumps, ability to change rate on the fly). 

I believe that these changes will subsume your issue.

> 26. Checkpoint 4.17 the "for graphical viewports" is repeated twice with
> different requirements. Are these alternatives?

Editorial. I can merge the two sentences.

> 27. Isn't 5.3 similar to 1.1?

Checkpoint 5.3 is about the exchange of information about UI
controls (e.g., input and output). Checkpoint 1.1 is about
device-activation of user agent functionalities (input only,
through keyboard, mouse, voice, etc.).
 
> 28. 6.1 could use an example

Editorial. I don't think this is necessary since the Note
clear states where this information may be found: "The
Techniques document [[UAAG10-TECHS]] provides information
about the accessibility features of some specifications,
including W3C specifications."
 
> 29. Why is 7.6 a priority 2? I expected it to be P1.

The following requirements are P1:
1) 2.1 Access to all content
2) 2.3 Easy access to equivalents
3) 7.1 Navigation to all viewports
4) 7.3 Navigation to all active elements.

More convenient access to content is considered a P2
requirement on top of these. This would include checkpoints
7.5 and 7.6.

> 30. Is 8.1 too HTML specific?

Do you have a counter-proposal? I don't think it hurts to
have a table-specific requirement (tables are complex,
important, etc.). The checkpoint doesn't call out HTML
specifically, either.

We discussed this checkpoint as part of issue 353
  http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2000/11/minutes-20001116#issue-353

We resolved to include the following requirements:

 - P2: The default highlighting mechanisms required by 
       the document (for selection, focus, etc.) must 
       not rely on color alone. 

 - P2: The default highlighting mechanisms .... must differ
       from each other and not by color alone. 

I hope that this re-expression of the requirements addresses
your concern.

Need more information. 

I'm not sure I understand the comment. Checkpoint 9.8 is
about which functionalities must have bindings. Checkpoint
9.2 says don't interfere with system bindings. Checkpoint
5.8 says use system conventions for bindings. 

Combining these requirements suggests that all conforming
user agents on the same system will have the same minimal
set of bindings and those bindings will be in line with
system conventions. We don't go so far as to require
specific bindings.

Need more information. 

Section 3.2 is about using OS features as part of
conformance claims. I'm not sure I understand your
comment. Also, do you have an alternative conformance scheme
to suggest? Please note that the Working Group has worked
extremely hard to come up with this conformance scheme and I
don't think the WG will readily change it without a very
concrete counter-proposal.

Editorial. Do you have a URI? I think that the definition of
assistive technology in this document is not a critical
issue and doesn't affect conformance. It's merely
informative.

Thank you,
