Mark,
Developing a tool to demonstrate timely access on different plateforms
would be very useful, but as your early e-mail stated would take some
resources.  I am not sure the working group has the resources to do this.
We could maybe ask the ER group to develop this tool.  We want in the
techniques document the interfaces and strategies that these types of demo
programs would use, so we can at least point developers in the direction of
the technical meaning of timely.  

I am not sure how to specify absolute or relative timing specifications,
like how many CPU cycles or less than 1 micorosecond response time.  Any
ideas or techniques to help make this checkpoint more explicit are wlecome.
