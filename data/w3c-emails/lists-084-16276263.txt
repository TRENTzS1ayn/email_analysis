But they can claim conformance with "any conforming Java VM".

[and good reasons why this can be a problem]

In actual fact it makes life a bit painful for the developers. Basically, if
there isn't an API they have to make one. If there is, they have to use it.
So if they start working on a system without one, and they make their own,
and then a later version of the system introduces a standard one, they cannot
conform for the later versions of the system until they change to it. Which
gives them a strong incentive to work with the developers of the underlying
OS's, but doesn't just leave a requirement as vague as "work with some other
folks"
