Hello,

After some discussion with Charles, it would seem that people have
different interpretations of checkpoint 5.4. The question seems to
be: Do UA developers have to provide access to ATs even when there
are no standard (system) APIs for doing so?

1) For access to content, the answer is you have to implement the
   DOM, so there is no issue.

2) For access to UI controls, checkpoint 5.4 says:

    Provide programmatic read and write access to user agent 
    user interface controls using standard APIs ...." 

   Does this mean:
   
    - You must provide access using standard APIs.
    - You must provide access, and you must use standard APIs 
      (when they exist) to do so?

If the interpretation is the latter, then I think Wendy's question
is answered: UA developers must always use some API. (Talking with
AT developers to create a good one is, in my opinion, out of scope
for this document though a good thing to do.)

Added as issue #457
