I think the conformance section needs to be conservative here.  If there 
are no standard I/O or accessibility APIs then the user agent cannot claim 
conformance with this document.  This sounds like a closed box situation 
that wendy[1] brought up earlier and I suggested that a different set of 
guidelines is needed in this situation.
