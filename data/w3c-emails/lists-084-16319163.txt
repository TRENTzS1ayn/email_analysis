This gets to be an issue - it is not how I interpreted that document over
the last months. I don't see that it is a problem to allow conformance
claims, but there is the difficulty implied for developers taht I alluded to
before.

  I think the conformance section needs to be conservative here.  If there
  are no standard I/O or accessibility APIs then the user agent cannot claim
  conformance with this document.  This sounds like a closed box situation
  that wendy[1] brought up earlier and I suggested that a different set of
  guidelines is needed in this situation.
