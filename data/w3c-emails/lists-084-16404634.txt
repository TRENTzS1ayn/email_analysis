If no element has focus when the window opens, then there would be no 
element that would need to be highlighted. There are requirements for 
configuration of focus management as new windows open (Checkpoint 
4.18).  The compliance problem is if an element did have focus and was not 
highlighted by the styling selected (checkpoint 4.17) by the user.
