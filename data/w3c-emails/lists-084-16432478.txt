The following is a proposed modification to checkpoint 4.17 related to 
Issue #405 to address the case of focus and selection styling on the same 
element.

[OLD]
4.17 Allow the user to configure how the content focus is highlighted 
(e.g., foreground and background color, voice pitch,
etc.). For graphical viewports, offer at least three rendering options, 
including colors and fonts. For graphical viewports, allow the user to 
select from among the range of system colors and fonts. The default focus 
highlight mechanism must be different from the default selection highlight 
mechanism. [Priority 1]

select from among the range of system colors and fonts. The default focus 
highlight mechanism must be different from the default selection highlight 
mechanism.  If an element can simultaneously be part of a selection and 
have focus, the focus styling should have priority over the selection 
styling when rendering the element. [Priority 1]
