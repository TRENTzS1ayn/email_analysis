Cindy,
It was great to meet with you on Tuesday.  I have couple questions for you.

1. Other than the SMIL specification, are there any other formats used for 
captioning that allow the user to specify the position and styling of 
captioning information?

2. Are there any SMIL players that have actually implemented the captioning 
features of SMIL?


Thanks for your help,

Jon
