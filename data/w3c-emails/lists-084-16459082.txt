Sorry.  I just added the new part about focus and selection.  This would be 
the proposal for all the changes:

<NEW1>
4.17 Allow the user to configure how the content focus is highlighted 
(e.g., foreground and background color, voice pitch, etc.). For graphical 
viewports, offer at least three rendering options, including colors and 
text decoration (underline, overline and line-through). For graphical 
viewports, allow the user to select from among the range of system colors. 
The default focus highlight mechanism must be different from the default 
selection highlight mechanism. If an element can simultaneously be part of 
a selection and have focus, the focus styling should have priority over the 
selection styling when rendering the element. [Priority 1]
</NEW1>

I didn't include blinking as on of the required values for text decoration 
because I didn't think it would be useful to people with disabilities.

Jon
