Yes, the window that has focus does need to be highlighted. As far as I know,
this feature is noramlly provided by Operating systems, but for example in
some X window managers the default is to highlight the focussed wnidow
without bringing it to the front. In others the default is that the front
window has focus.

  I think it is possible for no window or element to have focus. However, if
  keystrokes are being delivered to some window, then that window has focus,
  even if no element within it has the focus. Does the window that receives
  keystrokes need to be highlighted? Is it the case that different keystrokes
  will be delivered to different windows, so that there is no unique focus?
