Can you explain why this is the case? If I understand correctly, the
goal
is to have an idea where one is when a new window opens. It sounds like 
an implementation detail that ATs use the focus to orient the user. They
could use, for example, the document title instead when the focus has
not been set. Is it easier for people using *today's* screen readers?
