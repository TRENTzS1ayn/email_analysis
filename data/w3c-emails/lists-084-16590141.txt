[Warning:? I am not taking a position on which proposal is better.? But I had
to get my two cents' worth in on some aspects of this area of the guidelines.?

What is the origin of that last sentence?

What if the focus styling and the selection styling are easily combined?

Maybe it is true that it is more important to know that you are in the focus
than that you are in the selection.?? But in the natural course of events
it is
ususally easy to apply both effects at once to communicate focus+selection as
the state of some of the content.? As a matter of general usability (and PWD
usability in particular), I would not want the 'priority' of focus over
selection to be invoked unless there were a real problem with applying both
effects at once.?

Jon's proposed wording did not introduce any such requirement.? He merely said
that when the two states collide, which one should win in the "virtual
cascade"
of style rules.? But see above.

AG::

That is very much how I had been thinking about it: that it is too complicated
to save the user from themself if they actively introduce an ambiguity in
styling among these states.? But that the shipping defaults should be well
differentiated.? In a rich enough output medium the best design is to guide
the
user toward using different degrees of freedom so that the respective effects
always combine gracefully.? But the user should ultimately have full
control to
work around their own specific problems.? In doing so they may apply strange
styling in the combined cases.
