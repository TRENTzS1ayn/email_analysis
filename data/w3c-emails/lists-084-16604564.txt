Wendy,
I am aware of UXL and Rich has been alluding to this technology or some 
variant as something since it could be represented in a DOM.  This is one 
of the issues that I want to bring up with the DOM working group.  If the 
user interface (chrome) is based on XML how can it be referenced in DOM for 
assistive technologies and can this be standardized?

Jon
