JRG: This issue of discrimination of selection and focus was raised during 
last call: Issue #405
http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#405

In terms of priority the colors or other attributes that over lap would 
give priority for final rendering to focus.  If people decide to use the 
same values for focus and selection, that is there choice and the priority 
will not make any difference.

JRG: It really doesn't make a difference to me if they are together or 
separate.  Just so it is clear what the requirements are.

JRG: I only require this in the default configuration.  People can still do 
as they please or the user agent may decide that is a good feature, but I 
did not think I was requiring for every configuration.

JRG: What I was trying to say, but not very well apparently, is that the 
focus values should override selection values if there is ever a situation 
that the two would apply to the same element.  There would not be a need 
for "mixing" the two values into a new value.

<NEW_JON>
4.17 Allow the user to configure how the content focus and current 
selection are highlighted (e.g., through foreground and background 
color,  voice pitch, etc.). The default highlight styles must not rely on 
color alone. The default focus and selection styles must also differ from 
each other, and not through color alone. If text decorations (e.g., 
underlining,  strike through, over-line) or border styles are used as a 
highlight mechanism, the user must be able to configure them according to 
the range of text decoration or border styles available on the system.  If 
selection and focus can simultaneously occur on the same element, the focus 
style should be have priority over the selection style for rendering the 
highlight for those elements.
<NEW_JON>

1. I don't think we want to encourage font or font weight as a highlighting 
mechanism, since it encourages dynamic page reformatting and 
disorientation.  Even bolding a character can cause page automatic 
reformatting.  Let's stick with text-decoration (CSS) and border (CSS) as 
the preferred techniques, since they do not cause auto reformatting.

2. Focus style should have priority over selection style.  No mixing, just 
priority.
