Please note my concern on this point. The UA should be allowed or
encouraged
to mix them if it can. The priority should only be an issue if it
can't. The
CSS algorithm (pick one style) is bad human engineering in this
situation.
Lots of the relevant screen effects mix fine.

I think that my input on this point is consistent with what Greg
Lowney said.
Greg says that the default focus and selection styles should be
mixable and be
mixed when something is both focused and selected.  That is a good
idea.  We
don't necessarily have to make it a requirement, but we sure shouldn't
make it
disallowed.

It's one thing to say that the UA is not required to mix them and when
it
can't
it should use the focus style. It's another to say that the UA should
not mix
them but just use the focus style. To me the latter is writing rules
that
degrade the communication effectiveness of the tool, which is not our
goal,
last I checked.
