Al,
Basically from my point of view, if there is choice between using selection 
or focus color use the focus color.  If there is a choice between selection 
and focus border styles use the focus border style.  If selection uses 
border styling and focus doesn't use border styling there is no conflict 
that the priority rule would need to decide on.  In this case the selection 
border could still be rendered on an item with both selection and focus.

Is this what you want to say?

Is there a way that this can be more clearly stated in the checkpoint?

Jon
