That's a little more specific than I wanted to say, but it is very similar.

I would want to give the User Agent free rein to invent creative ways to
combine the selected effects.  If the User Agent developer decides to punt on
combining certain effects, then they can resort to the priority and favor the
presentation effects associated with focus.

[NEW]
4.17 Allow the user to configure how the content focus is highlighted 
(e.g., foreground and background color, voice pitch,
etc.). For graphical viewports, offer at least three rendering options, 
including colors and fonts. For graphical viewports, allow the user to 
select from among the range of system colors and fonts. The default focus 
highlight mechanism must be different from the default selection highlight 
mechanism.? If an element can simultaneously be part of a selection and 
have focus, the focus styling should have priority over the selection 
styling when rendering the element. [Priority 1]
[/NEW]

[just take that last sentence]

If an element can simultaneously be part of a selection and have focus, the
focus styling should have priority over the selection styling when rendering
the element.

[Maybe it could say]

When some content is both focused and selected, the user agent should give
priority, if needed to resolve a conflict, to the focus styling over the
selection styling.

[What do others think?]
