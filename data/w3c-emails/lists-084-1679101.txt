The IBM Accessibility Center (formerly IBM Special Needs Systems) has
developed a set of IBM Accessibility Guidelines, one each for
software,
the Web, Lotus Notes, hardware and Java. See
http://www.austin.ibm.com/sns/guidelines.htm.
Each guideline contains checklists and links to rationale, techniques
for
implementation and methods for testing compliance. They have short
sections
on related subjects, for example, screen readers and the Microsoft
Object
Inspector tool for MSAA in the Software Accessibility Guideline,  and
Home
Page Reader and Bobby in the Web Accessibility Guideline.

These documents were prepared for IBM developers who need to
understand
what they must do to make their products accessible.  All the
guidelines
include extensive references to related documents, such as the Web
Content
Accessibility Guidelines published by the W3C Web Accessibility
Initiative
and Windows Accessibility Guidelines published by Microsoft.

This is the first release of the expanded IBM Accessibility Guidelines
which we expect to update periodically. We would be grateful to have
your
comments. Please send those comments and suggestions directly to me,
thatch@us.ibm.com, or Shannon Rapuano, shannont@us.ibm.com.
