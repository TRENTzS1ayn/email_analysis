In verifying this checkpoint it is difficult to know how to interpret
"timely". Is there a way we can better describe the user need, and therefore
improve the verification?

As Mark suggests, describing the techniques that can be used (on one
platform, for one kind of User Agent!!) is not sufficient for a checkpoint. I
think there is a user need that this timeliness requirement satisfies, and I
think we need to make it a lot clearer what that is.

  MN:  Please refer to the Tech DOC.,  COM is *not* limited to
  out-of-process only.  The Browser Helper Object (BHO) is an
  in process DLL, which uses COM to communicate and interact
  with IE in a very fast manner.  It does not suffer any system
  scheduling problems when run in this manner.

  MN:  Without invertigating the methods used, I'm not sure you
  can make any conclusions based on this.   For example, injecting
  keyboard information at the device driver level using a virtual device
  driver in Windows (Vxd) can be much slower than  injecting
  keyboard information using the Win32 keyboard API.  It
  also could just be poorly written code.

  MN:  I'm not following this statement at all.  Using a BHO, I have
  access to all the information in IE's DOM.   Where does MSAA play
  a role?

  MN:  I think the issue of "in-process", "out-of-process", etc., is beyond
  the scope of the UA group.  All the methods ought to be listed, as in the
  Tech. DOC., and it is up to the AT developers to decide what works
  best for their product/market.
  
  MN:  I realize the UA group is trying to define "timely", and that is
  why I suggested developing a reference prototype/platform about
  two weeks ago.
