Thanks Charles.

My comments below.

The note in the checkpoint says it does. Was the question whether
that really addresses the issue?

My first reaction is that hiding does suffice (the issue is distraction,
isn't it? Not one of performance where you might want to stop the
processor from handling video). If the caption is part of the video
(i.e., a single track with both), I don't know how you could still
have the captions if you turn off the video. If there are separate
tracks, you should be able to view captions alone.

Yes. One question: do you think it's a violation of a spec (e.g.,
GIF) to control the rate of the animation? Note that our applicability
clause would cover this case; the user agent doesn't have access to
the properties of the content (i.e., might not be able to regulate the
speed).

If the technology doesn't allow, then the requirement wouldn't apply.
Otherwise that's a good point and should be mentioned in the techniques.

Any suggestions?

I think it's both. I propose this clarification:

   "Use and conform to W3C specifications when they are 
    available and appropriate for a task."

We could drop the conformance part, but the whole reason we're
pushing them is that they promote interoperability and have
accessibility
built-in. If you don't conform, what's the point? I do recognize that
conformance is hard in some cases. It makes that the conformance part
is P2. 

As to the exclusive part, I don't think that's implied. However, for
checkpoint 11.1 we do make the clarification that there must be "at
least one"
version of the documentation that's accessible. We might make a similar
clarification in the checkpoint or a note after.

That is true. A couple of ideas:

1) Demote to P3 and the text as is.
2) Identify the key requirements, for example presentation and input
   configuration.

Since it's a P3, why not all of it?

I propose the following clarification:

1) I think "a default input configuration" makes more sense than
"default
   input configurations" since there is only one default. Even if
several
   modes may be covered (voice, keyboard, etc.), there's still only 
   one default input configuration.

2) Every browser comes with a default configuration. What are we
   requiring exactly?

   I propose that 

    a) Either we drop this checkpoint, or
    b) We make the requirement much more specific. For example:
       "Ensure that the default configuration allows the user to
navigate
        content and user interface controls simply, obviously, and
        quickly."
