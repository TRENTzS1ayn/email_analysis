[Note for U.S. readers new to the thread.  This is from a European study.
The 'trolley' is the shopping cart in a retail website.]

This is an absolutely stunning clue.

In all the fighting about whether 'Back' should be a scripted button on the
page or a browser function, I had not previously heard this.

To make hypermedia browsing accessible to the iOpener customer base, we
have to understand that "undo link traversal" is a special case of "undo"
in the user's total experience.  We need to make sure that all these
flavors of "undo" blend smoothly so that the user is not surprised by what
they do.

It's not just clicks that we need to sort out over the subprocess or layer
stack to see who gets to handle them.  It's 'undos' too.  And the user
doesn't want to know there is a difference.
