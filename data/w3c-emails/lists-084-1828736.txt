I believe 5.5 should be at least priority 2 due to JavaScript.

Programmatic write access as priority 3 is correct since DOM 1 does not
provide for this on all elements. This should be bumped in later releases
of the UA guidelines.

I will voice my concern again about requiring DOM 1 over DOM 2 because DOM1
does not provide for a standardized event model. This is bad. I do however
appreciate the timing issue related to DOM 2's acceptance.

Subject:  PROPOSAL: User Agent Issue 190: Reduce the scope of 5.1 to say
      "write access only for that which you can do through the UI."




I propose the following to resolve issue 190:

Current checkpoint:

5.1 Provide programmatic read and write access to content by conforming to
W3C Document Object Model (DOM) specifications and exporting interfaces
defined by those specifications. [Priority 1]

I suggest we use five checkpoints in this section to describe access to web
content:

5.1 Provide programmatic read access to all content using the interfaces
specified in the W3C Document Object Model (DOM level 1) and exporting
those interfaces to other applications . [Priority 1]

5.2 Provide programmatic write access to the value attribute of form
controls using the interfaces specified in the W3C Document Object Model
(DOM level 1) and exporting those interfaces to other applications .
[Priority 1]

5.3 Provide progammatic support for the event model and methods for form
controls and links using the interfaces specified in the W3C Document
Object Model (DOM level 2 CR) and exporting those interfaces to other
applications . [Priority 2]

5.4 Provide programmatic write access to all element of the W3C Document
Object Model (DOM level 1) and exporting those interfaces to other
applications . [Priority 3]

5.5 Provide progammatic support for the event model and methods for all
elements using the interfaces specified in the W3C Document Object Model
(DOM level 2 CR) and exporting those interfaces to other applications .
[Priority 3]
