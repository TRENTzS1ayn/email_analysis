I agree with Rich that access to event triggers is at least priority 2 -
these are important functions that a browser needs to provide access to. And
until they do, content authors will need to produce a whole raftof nasty
hacks to get around browser problems, which is not a good situation - only a
percentage of authors will do so, and there will continue to be an access
problem until a goodsolution is implemented.
