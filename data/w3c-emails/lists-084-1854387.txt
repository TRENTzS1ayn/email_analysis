aloha, jon!

while i agree with rich and charles that 5.5 should be at least a priority 
2 checkpoint, isn't programmatic support for the event model key to 
successfully tailoring an AT to work with any UA which supports the W3C DOM 
Level 2 by providing access to the event model?

so wouldn't that make it not just at least a priority 2, but an outright 
priority 1?

jon, did you originally accord it a p3 because of turn-around timing issues 
vis a vis the implementation of DOM2 by industry?  if so, perhaps we do 
need to consider some sort of priority level that reflects that quote this 
will be the best (read: required) way to do this when the following comes 
to pass unquote...  reopening the priority issue isn't a route that i 
particularly want to travel, but in this instance, at least, perhaps valid...
