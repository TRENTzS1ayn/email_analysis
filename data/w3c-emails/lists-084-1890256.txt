Hello gang:

Here are mark's comments reguarding issue  167.

  21.MQ: Ask Mark about meaning of comment raised in Issue #167 
>
1.  SECTION 2.3 - When switching synthesizer based upon natural languages, the
> UA may incur significant processing delays that can hinder understanding
> (e.g.., "The greeting 'Good Day' is expressed as <span lang="fi">Hyv??
> P?iv?</span> in Finnish, <span lang="fr">Bonjour</span> in French, ...").


2.> Further, announcements of language switching can interfere with the
> presentation. The user should be able to configure whether or not
language switching is active (I.E. turning language switching off), and
specify whether announcements indicating the language switches
> are to be announced.
