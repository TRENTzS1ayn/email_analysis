Using the ER group sounds like a good idea.  We are also continuing to
plug away with ideas on browser access, perhaps something we create
might serve part of this purpose.  I'll keep you/group posted on that
front.

As for the Techniques DOC.,  I think it alreadys does a good job of
pointing out several of the interfaces and strategies (even source code)
which one could use to access the UA in a timely manner.  It would be
nice if we could strengthen the cross platform areas a bit more.

I for one don't believe we (e.g., UA group) can or should specify
"absolute" timing
specifications.   I'd rather, from a developer standpoint, understand
the pros/cons of the various methods and be challenged to create and improve
on these.

That is what the fun part of software development is all about ;)
