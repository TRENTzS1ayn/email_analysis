Check point
4.14 Allow the user to configure how the content focus is highlighted (e.g.,
foreground and background color). [Priority 1]

Techniques:
The user can configure how content focus is highlighted by using the :active
pseudo-class of cascading style sheets for html elements.

for example

A:active {background: blue; color: yellow }

would cause links that are activated via the tab key will appear with a blue
background and yellow text.

in the future when :focus pseudo element and "outline" border is supported
in browsers then

textarea:focus { outline: thick black solid; }

would cause textareas that have keyboard focus to appear with a thick solid
black outline(border).
