For presentations that require user interaction within a specified time
interval, allow the user to configure the time interval (e.g., by allowing
the user to pause and restart the presentation, to slow it down, etc.).
[Priority 1]
Techniques:
* Render time-dependent links instead as a static list that occupies the
same screen real estate. Include (temporal) context in the list of links.
For example, provide the time at which the link appeared along with a way to
easily jump to that portion of the presentation.
* Provide easy-to-use controls (including both mouse and keyboard commands)
to allow users to pause the presentation and advance and rewind by small and
large time increments.
Note that when a user must respond to a link by pausing the program, then
activating the link, the time dependent nature of the link does not change,
since the user must respond somehow in the predetermined time.  The pause
feature is only effective in conjunction with the ability to rewind to the
link, or when the pause can be configured to stop the presentation
automatically and require the user to resond before proceding, either by
responding to the user input or by proceding with the flow of the document.
(See below.)
* Allow the user to navigate sequences of related links that vary over time.
* Provide a mode in which all active elements are highlighted in some way
and can be navigated sequentially. For example, use a status bar to indicate
the presence of active elements and allow the user to navigate among them
with the keyboard or mouse to identify each element when the presentation is
moving and when it is paused.
* Allow the user to to stop and start the flow of changes to content. Prompt
the user for confirmation of a pending change.
