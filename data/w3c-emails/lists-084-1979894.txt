The DOM event model is an ongoing discussion in the WAI/PF. We are going to
submit requirements to the DOM working group regarding the event model for
DOM 3 in March.

The reason I put it at P2 was because DOM 2 is not out yet. I also share
some device independence issues regarding the DOM 2 event model.

If some developers could start adopting the DOM 2 event model, it should
reduce the time it would take to get the desired DOM 3 event model
implemented and also ATs would have something to go from.

We ought to be pushing for P1 with DOM 3 in the UA assuming the correct
changes are made between the DOM and PF working groups.

hi Jon and all

I agree that all elements ought to understand and implement
the appropriate event model, so for the UA, I don't see my
next comment changing the UA process at the moment.

However, I'm not in favor of making this a priority 1, since I'm not
a fan of the event model within DOM 2.  This is an on-going
(I hope ) discussion on the PF/DOM working group lists.

After the events/event model are understood, this checkpoint
may need re-visiting.
