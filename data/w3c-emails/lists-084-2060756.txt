Hello,

I'm just reading User Agent Accessibility Guidelines recommendation
candidate, and there seem to be some things I'd like to comment.

Guideline 2

It may happen that some elements overlap (both due the user agent
malfunction, or the authors intention, or an unusual configuration of user
agent - larger fonts etc.). In such case, there should be a way to separate
such elements and see their contents unoverlapped.

Guideline 7

In framesets, the frame can have an attribute "scrolling" set to no. The
user agent should provide the way to see a contents which didn't fit in an
area set for that frame.

Embedded objects (Java applets, ActiveX comtrols, plugins etc.) take control
over keyboard and it's impossible to move focus by keyboard to elements
positioned behind such objects. Example: Using TAB, I get to the Java applet
containing two buttons. Now while pressing TAB, I'm cycling between those
two buttons, and there's no way to access a link which is placed below that
applet.

Solution: There should be a way to switch focus between objects (frames in
framesets, iframes and embedded objects in a document) in different way than
cycling between single elemets (links, form entries, etc.), also by
keyboard.

Guideline 10

Some frames are made large enough to view their contents with "standard"
configuration. however, in some times a user has "non-standard" config, so a
user should be able to command user agent to ignore some frame attributes
("scrolling", "resize" "border", for example).

I know that I'm not supposed to provide such kind of feedback, but these
things I'm encountering and not all authors of a content like my mails
asking them to remove a directive "scrolling=no" from their framed pages.

Best wishes.

Tomas Valusek
