Note, cross-posted to PF and User Agent.

There are two types of events in the current draft of DOM2 - there is an
abstract layer, which includes mutation events and some basic user interface
events such as actvate, and gain/lose focus. In my opinion it is reasonable
to implement these events as they are likely to form the basis of a
device-independent event model.

THere are also subclassed user interface events that are device
(mouse) specific. Implementing these is a mistake, or at best a sop to
backwards compatibility - a better model is to provide a path whereby these
are remapped by a user agent to the "new" model, where possible.

I agree with Mark that we are not in a position to require conformance to
DOM3, since at this stage the requirements haven't been set, and it is
impossible to justify it as an accessibility requirement on that basis,
beyond the existing requirement to use W3C specifications where available and
appropriate.

  can somone point me to where this *discussion* is taking place within
  WAI/PF???   I would very much like to be apart of this...
  
  who are "we" when you say "We are going to submit requirements to the DOM
  working group"

  at present, I'd encourage developers to avoid the event model of DOM 2,
  assuming of course something more useable and robust appears for DOM 3, which
  would probably save the developers both development cost and grief!

  it is unrealistic to push any priority over a document or spec. that isn't
  even yet written in my opinion.
