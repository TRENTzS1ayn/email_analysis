The DOM exposed by Internet Explorer and the Java Access Bridge From Sun.

Yes, but more user agents need to  provide one.

It took about 500 hours of development time to get our current
implementation working properly.  Much of this time was spent making
internal design changes to allow JFW to work with text from a DOM, not
just from the screen.  Accessing the DOM was reasonably simple.

At this point, we really don't need the help because the work has been
done.  I'll respond from the standpoint of someone new getting into
the process.

Yes, if these people are closely tied to the internals of the products
implementing the DOM.

Looks fine except for the point about user agents and assistive
technologies communicating in a timely fashion, which appears to be a
 Priority 2.  I think it should be Priority 1.
