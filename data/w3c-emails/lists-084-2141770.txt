Charles,
1. Given your suggested device independent conditions on the implementation
of DOM level 2 event model, would it be prudent to recommend the DOM level
2 event model implementation in the user agent guidelines?

2. Is it possible to put these types of conditions of implementation in the
guidelines?

Jon
