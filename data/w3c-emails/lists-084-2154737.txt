Keeping up the cross-posting - better to have the widest circle of critics

1. For implementing the DOM events models (which effectively is part of
implementing DOM, so there is a side-issue of how much of DOM do we
require) I think we should say that if it is being implemented then it must
include the new User Interface event set. (As I discussed on this post, I
think it is important to implement an event set, but there is one in HTML
already that does not explicitly require W3C DOM, although the best way to
run scripts and make them accessible is probably through DOM)

2. I think it is perfectly possible to recommend this kind of thing in the
guidelines. Not only that, I think it is important. A similar case is with CSS - I
think we should say clearly and unambiguously that we recommend the CSS2
cascade and NOT the (conflicting) CSS1 cascade - after all, that is why we
argued so vociferously to change it in CSS2.

  Charles,
  1. Given your suggested device independent conditions on the implementation
  of DOM level 2 event model, would it be prudent to recommend the DOM level
  2 event model implementation in the user agent guidelines?
  
  2. Is it possible to put these types of conditions of implementation in the
  guidelines?
