I moved this thread to PF - I don't think it has an impact on UA. (Although I
could be wrong...)

  Charles, I agree that we need to step back and look carefully at this
  again, and yes it is frustrating.  However, I'm now concerned that
  we only have half of the puzzle.  Creating a device independent
  event model (as per below) and then placing it inside DOM is a mistake in my
  mind.  Especially without evaluating all the other options, and
  conerns.    The i18n group weighed in heavily at the end of DOM2
  in regards to the keyboard events, for example.
  
etc..
