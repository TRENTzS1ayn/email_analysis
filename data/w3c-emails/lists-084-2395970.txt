Charles, I understand that you are concerned about Mouse Events, but they
are in DOM 1 event though they don't specify how to deliver them. Which,
leaves it up to the UA developer to whip up whatever feels comfortable.
Meanwhile, we wait another year for all the other AT features in DOM 2 to
shop up in DOM 3 and then another 6 months to year to see them show up in a
product.

Sorry to be blunt, but as an AT developer I am not in favor of waiting
another year and half for the W3C to get its act together.

I don't like mouse events either. Why don't we specify DOM 2 without the
mouse events for starters? Can we say in the UA guidelines to use DOM 2 but
that device dependent events are not endorsed by the UA group?

Lets stop saying what we don't like and come up with a suitable interim
solution. Punting and going back to DOM1 is not the solution.

Subject:  Re: PROPOSAL: User Agent Issue 190:




I agree with Mark - there is no need for the Mouse events in DOM2. (with
the
possible exception of mousemove.) There is a clear proposal for what to do
to
match the legacy event triggers in HTML 4 with the new DOM events. If we
say
to developers "use that approach in DOM2" then we are encouraging them to
get
it right. If we say "go for it - put in the activate methods but don't
expect
anyone else to take them seriously either" then we are encouraging them to
propogate things that do not work, and we then have to explain to them how
to
fix two lots of problems (as well as why there isn't a key events set but
why
keyboard access is still critical).

Changing the names is neither here nor there. And I don't think anyone has
expressed dissatisfaction with the propogation or the mutation events
(other
than the problems raised by Gregory, which properly belong in UA and WCAG,
about magically submitting things). Having a device-dependent set of
prefabricated events in the DOM is just a little like giving matches to
children with a history of lighting fires, along with the lecture on why
not
to do it. Or like putting a big warning that Smoking Kills You on every
cigarette packet - for a tobacco company.

  No. What I am saying is that the device dependecy exists in the HTML DOM.
  For example, HTML DOM contains mouse events. We all agree that device
  dependency is bad. What DOM2 does give you is a standard event model for
  developers to write to even though the event names may change. Changing
  event names is less of an impact than writing the entire event model from
  scratch and I would like to get people writing from a standard event
model
  for:

  - event propagation
  - document mutation  (the mutation events are good)

  The problem is that if we say to developers "use DOM 1" they will be
using
  HTML DOM 1 plus the device depencent events anyways because they have to
  (They still have to support things like JavaScript). What they will not
be
  doing is supporting standardized mutation events and DOM event
propagation
  in DOM 2. These elements of DOM 2 are not likely to change in DOM 3 even
  with our changes for device independence.

  DOM 2 will also provide for:

  - DOM CSS and DOM Style Sheets which can help assistive technologies such
  as low vision and reading disorders
  - Iterators which will reduce increase performance when AT's need to
access
  elements in the DOM

  am I understanding you correctly in that the fact that there isn't any
  difference with HTML, that makes DOM2 events OK?    DOM2 device
  dependencies
  are not OK in my mind.  the i18n group made the right choice to pull
  the keyboard events and I wish they'd removed the mouse events
  from DOM 2.

  I'm assuming DOM 3 will provide somekind of feedback here as well.
  Mutation
  events in this case, are nothing more than the data model informing the
  view/controller of changes.  While MS may have done this via the
  "kindness of Microsoft's heart" as you say, it doesn't hurt that mutation
  events
  like "download begin, download complete, etc." exist for the ability of
  scripting, DHTML and COM/CORBA/XPCOM to take advantage of, especially
  for an interface built on the fly.

  I still maintain that DOM 2 is not something the UA group should push
  too strongly, and I'm hopefull that DOM 3 will correct some of these
  problems, as well as not be to far off.
