"DOM2 does give you is a standard event model" and is "*exactly* the problem
in my opinion.   When the standard event model inside DOM included user input
events, that's when things broke.

as I've already tried to point out, following the MVC model, the model or
"data"
will have actions or events, if you wish to call them that, which do
propogate, and
other events, including mutation events within DOM.  These actions or events
serve many purposes, including maintaining the data structure and integrity,
support iterators and parent/child/node relationships, etc.,  as well as
maintaining
sync. with the view/controller model.   As Charles already stated, no one
has "expressed dissatisfaction" over this.

again, mutation events and event propagation are not the issue.

Style sheets and CSS are good things, and where we've already determined
what is best solution, we should support that (like the cascading issues)

I still maintain that DOM 2 is not something the UA group should push
too strongly.
