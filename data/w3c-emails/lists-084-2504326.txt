This is just a reminder to the working group on the goal of the telecon
tommorrow.  We have asked assistive technology developers to join the
meeting for the following purposes:

1. Explain our view of why DOM is the preferred method to access WWW content

2. Listen to their comments on the UAGL DOM recommendation for access to
content

3. What types of support would help them use the DOM to access content

4. Receive feedback on the rest of the Guideline 5 checkpoints

Some of the people coming to the call are already planning on using DOM for
some things, and others have little or no knowledge about the DOM.  So I
would like us to be careful at the telecon not to discuss specific
technical requirements of a particular version of DOM, since many attending
will have little to contribute to the topic.  I would like to keep the
discussion more general to the capabilities of DOM, which may have general
references to particular DOM versions.

The 23 February meeting will be useful in sorting out the list discussion
of DOM implementation in UAGL.  We will announceit to the AT developers so
they may participate.

Thanks,
Jon
