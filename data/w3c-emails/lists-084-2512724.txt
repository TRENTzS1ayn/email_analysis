Jon,

I'm sorry I just realized you wanted this information early.  Sorry about
that.

Unfortunately, I'm not going to be able to give you much information.  I
have not looked over the DOM specifications.  I started to and realized
there is a ton of information.  At this point all of us at GW are totally
focused on CSUN.  It would take a couple days of my time to really give all
this the time and energy it deserves and I just don't have two free days at
this point.

So I will answer your questions the best I can based on the fact that I
have not read up on all the documentation and specifications.

We currently rely on MSAA 1.x.  Unfortunately, 1.x isn't capable of
handling all aspects required to get full interaction with web pages.
Hopefully 2.x will be better suited for these needs.  So we are actually
using a little of the document object model of IE as well as MSAA.

Our current implementation is very good.  But if we are going to be
handling dynamic HTML and other up and coming technologies, we need to work
on improving MSAA.

The only other approach we are using is simply our OSM.  So in Netscape for
example, we can only report what is on the screen which has many problems.

Unfortunately no.

n/a

ABSOLUTELY!

Somewhat helpful.

Probably not.

>6.d Access to people with expertise in DOM capabilities and programming?

Sure.

>6.e Open ended question for you to indicate any other resources that would

The best types of resource we can get is GOOD documentation and sample
programs which demonstrate all aspects of DOM.

Unfortunately, I don't have the time to devote to this prior to CSUN.
