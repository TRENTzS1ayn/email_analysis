OK. So what do you suggest assuming we don't punt and go back to DOM 1?

I am also not happy with things like Mouse events in the state they are in
DOM 2 and would like to see them tossed. What other features of DOM 2
should we change.

I believe we need to:

- take as much of DOM 2 as is acceptable
- Exactly identify the elements that are not supported (and target these
for DOM 3) and indicate these to the UA group
- Work on cleaning up the appropriate DOM 2 event issues in DOM 3 (PF task)
- Determine what new features we need in DOM 3 (PF task as well)
