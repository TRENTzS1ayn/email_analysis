Hello,

As part of our Candidate Recommendation plan of action [1], we proposed
to improve our documentation of how well deployed user agents satisfy
the guidelines. In order to update the implementation report (latest
version 26 Jan 2000 [2]), please send any additional information you
have about how user agents satisfy the checkpoints, preferably with
links to evidence of implementation. In particular, we could use
information about Mac implementations.

Thank you,

 - Ian
