This PDF is mostly image based too.

Probably the result of a scanning capture: it recognized the black on
white text (which is 
real text in the PDF) but not the black on color text: it's just a
series of little gif words.

Net result: the gif is 320Kbytes, the PDF 3200Kbytes... and there's
about 32K of text content.
