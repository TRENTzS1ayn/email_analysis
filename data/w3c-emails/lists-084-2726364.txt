To address this point in particular, I propose that we add a checkpoint
whose language echos that of Candidate Rec [1], checkpoint 5.2:

   Provide programmatic read and write access to content using standard
   APIs  (e.g., platform-independent APIs such as the W3C DOM, standard 
   APIs for the operating system, and conventions for programming 
   languages) [Priority 1] 

Then, the checkpoint requiring DOM for access to content would be an
important
special case of this checkpoint (and both would be priority 1). A note
would
indicate that for XML and HTML, satisfaction of the DOM requirement
would meet
the more general checkpoint.
