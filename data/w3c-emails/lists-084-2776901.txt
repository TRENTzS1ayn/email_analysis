Hello Tomas,

I'm not sure we can do anything about the case of the user agent
malfunctioning. I think the requirement that you're making is
covered by checkpoint 2.1 and some checkpoints in Guidelines 3 and 4. 
Were you proposing an additional requirement, or were you thinking
that this should be in the Techniques Document as advice to
developers?

(Refer to the definition of "scrolling" [1] in HTML 4.01).

That sounds like a good technique to me. But I'd put it in Guideline
2 (access to content).

What browser are you using? It sounds like a bug in the browser that
doesn't let you access all of the active elements in the documnet.

Again, that sounds like good technique material for Guideline two
on access to content. I don't believe the user agent would be
in violation of the HTML spec if it ignored some attributes in an
attempt
to provide access to content.

On the contrary, your feedback is welcome. Thank you for helping us
improve the document.
