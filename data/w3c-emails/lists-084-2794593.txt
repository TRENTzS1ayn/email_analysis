Working Group Memebers,
I would like the UA working group members to review the DOM level 2
specifications for Wednesdays meeting.  We will be discussing which modules
(listed below) we want to specifically recommend in the guidelines to
improve accessibility.  It is clear we probably want to recommend Document
Object Model Core and Document Object Model HTML as Priority 1.  There are
six other modules to consider.  There has been considerable discussion
about the event module on the list.  There are also modules related to CSS
that may be important.  Rich has mentioned the Transversal module for
efficient access to DOM modes.  

I will send a more detailed agenda tommorrow.

Jon
