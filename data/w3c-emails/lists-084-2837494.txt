This proposal relates to the Current Checkpoint 5.1 and 5.5 in the 28
January Draft of the user agent guidelines.

Current checkpoint 5.1 (28 January 2000 draft)

5.1 Provide programmatic read and write access to content by conforming to
W3C Document Object Model (DOM) specifications and exporting interfaces
defined by those specifications. [Priority 1]

The following checkpoints would replace the current checkpoint 5.1 

5.a Make available content information available to other technologies
through an API [Priority 1]

Rationale: This is a broad checkpoint that covers access to all content,
including non-XML and non-HTML based content rendered by user agents.
Issue was raised during last call by Philippe Le Hegaret.  Other
checkpoints in this section would be important special cases of this
checkpoint.

5.b Provide programmatic access to XML amd HTML content by conforming to
W3C Document Object Model (DOM) level 2 Core and HTML module specifications
and exporting interfaces defined by those specifications. [Priority 1]  

Note: Important special case of Checkpoint 5.a and that the timing
efficiency of exchanging information through the exported interface is very
important

Rationale: This checkpoint covers basic access to HTML and XML content by 

Other issues for proposed checkpoint: Should/could this require most read
access and only some write access based on cmments from Operasoft

5.c Provide programmatic access to style sheet content by conforming to W3C
Document Object Model (DOM) level 2 StyleSheet and CSS modules
specifications and exporting interfaces defined by those specifications.
[Priority 2]  

Note: Important special case of Checkpoint 5.a and for access author
specified information for alternative rendering, such as auditory style sheets


 5.d Provide programmatic access to style sheet content by conforming to
W3C Document Object Model (DOM) level 2 Event module specifications and
exporting interfaces defined by those specifications. [Priority 2]  

Note: Important special case of Checkpoint 5.4 (28 January 2000 WD) and for
access to changes in the document, notification of user actions and
simulation of events by assistive technologies.

============

I suggest we remove the current Checkpoint 5.5 Ensure that programmatic
exchanges proceed in a timely manner. [Priority 2] and just add that this
information to the notes in the above proposed checkpoints.  While the
group seems to know what this is when we see it.  We cannot seem to come up
with a definition of a functional requirement.  Therefore I propose
removing this checkpoint and discuss this issue as important parts of other
checkpoints in this section.  We would leave in the current techniques in
the techniques document.
