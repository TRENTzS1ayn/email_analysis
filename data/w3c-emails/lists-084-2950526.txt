David,
My preference is that we talk about the timing of exchanging of information
and the synchronization/control of event notification issues in the
checkpoints that deal with the exchange of information and notification of
events.  I thnik this is the simplest way to deal with the issue and still
make developers aware of the issues.  I think we should state the issues as
an important part of implementing these checkpoints and include known
techniques in the techniques document.  But Ian wants to propose a
checkpoint to the group and we will wait and see what he or other group
members come up with during the next week.

Jon
