The following are the 13 open issues from CR that have not been resolved.
Please review to see if I have missed any issues.  I have broken the timing
issue up into 2 separate issues (#201 and #205) and I have added an issue
for DOM specification with is independent of read/write access to DOM (#190
and #206).  Details can be found at:
