Here is a list of possible minor improvements for the Techniques 
Document [1] "work in progress." There are no substantive changes 
here, only very minor suggestions. If these notes don't help or come 
too late for your schedule, please feel free to ignore them.


Comments:

You might consider spelling out "user agent (UA)", "graphical user 
interface (GUI)", "user interface (UI)", and "assistive technology 
(AT)" early in the document. The first use could be linked to the 
Glossary, and their acronyms could be added there. Outside the Status 
section, UA first appears in 5.6, GUI in Guideline 1, UI in 10.3, and 
AT in Appendix 5.

Except for the Note at the end of 7.6, references to HTML 4.0 and 
[HTML40] may need to change to 4.01 or to HTML 4. Those instances are 
not listed here.

Mac OS is two words as far as I know; (MacOS appears twice).

Contractions are slightly colloquial for a formal specification. For 
example, "doesn't" could read "does not", and "isn't" could read "is 
not".

I didn't understand the numbering scheme for Checkpoint 7.3 (contains 
2.7.1 and 2.7.2), Checkpoint 10.1 (contains 2.10.1, 2.10.2, and 
2.10.3), and Checkpoint 10.4 (contains 2.10.4).


Specific Items:

 From here on, items are identified by a section number, checkpoint 
number if applicable, and a paragraph or list item number. A quote 
and suggestion then follow. Comments are in brackets [].

1. par. 1
"...as an aid to developers seeking to implement the
     Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines."
[Not sure here but maybe that means:]

     User Agent Accessibility Guidelines.

Examples of not using the standard input devices are:
[The first two (of five) examples are about "not using" standard 
input devices, but the last three are not. Maybe the list could be 
divided into two groups, with one group introduced as:]

2. Guideline 1 - Checkpoint 1.3 - Techniques - list item 2
     If a text equivalent (specified via "alt" or "title" in
     HTML) is available and not null for the element (like
     INPUT or IMG in HTML) that has an associated client-side
     map, indicate the presence of a map in text (e.g., "Start
     of map") plus the text equivalent and the number of areas
     in the map.
[That sentence makes sense but is quite long. Could it read:]
"...A text equivalent (specified via "alt" or "title" in HTML)
     may be available for an element (like INPUT or IMG in HTML).
     If the equivalent is not null and the element has an
     associated client-side map, indicate the presence of a map
     in text (e.g., "Start of map") plus the text equivalent and
     the number of areas in the map.

2. Guideline 4 - Checkpoint 4.15 - Techniques - list item 2 and par. 2

I'm not sure if that was intended.]

"...The following image shows the table of contents view
     provided by Amaya. The table of contents view provided by
     Amaya can be navigated and..."
[You could maybe eliminate a repetition:]
     The following image shows the table of contents view
     provided by Amaya. The table of contents view in Amaya
     can be navigated and...

"...In the Amaya browser [AMAYA], users may access attribute
     values as follows: Place the cursor at the element in
     question, open/swap to the structure view. You are shown
     list of attributes and values. Another technique: select
     the element (press escape in Linux), then the attributes
     are all available from the attributes menu.
[A few minor changes:]
     In the Amaya browser [AMAYA], users may access attribute
     values ["with two techniques"?]. By placing the cursor at
     the element in question, users can open or swap to the
     structure view where one is shown a list of attributes
     and values. By selecting an element (press Escape [or "ESC"?]
     in Linux), attributes are all available from the attributes
     menu.

"...Using DOM and operating specific accessibility API to
     expose frame information provides one means for assistive
     technologies to provide alternative control of frames and
     rendering of frame information."
[Could one repetition of "provides" be changed? Possibly:]
     Using DOM and operating system specific accessibility APIs to
     expose frame information provides one means for assistive
     technologies to give users alternative control of frames and
     rendering of frame information.

[could read:]

"...For example, if the LEGEND element has been used to
     identify a FIELDSET of radio buttons, each of which has a
     LABEL element ([HTML40], section 17.9.1) associated with
     it, as "Connection Rate", identify the radio button as it
     receives content focus as "Connection Rate: Radio button
     X of Y: 28.8kpbs", where "Y" represents the total number
     of radio buttons in the grouping and "28.8kbps" is the
     information contained in the LABEL associated with the
     radio button with content focus."
[That sentence is clear but too long. Maybe try three sentences:]
     For example, the LEGEND element might identify a FIELDSET
     of radio buttons as "Connection Rate". Each button could
     have a LABEL element ([HTML40], section 17.9.1) stating
     a rate. When it receives content focus, identify the radio
     button as "Connection Rate: Radio button X of Y: 28.8kpbs",
     where "Y" represents the total number of radio buttons in
     the grouping and "28.8kbps" is the information contained
     in the LABEL.
