Hans,
The CSS and StyleSheet modules in DOM level 2 allow people to access and
manipulate the style sheets associated with HTML (both linked and inline)
and XML (apparently only allows linked styles).  The actual attributes used
to render a particular node I believe are part of the attributes collection
available in DOM Core and HTML modules.  DOM core and HTML are level 1 so I
think this satisfies your concerns.  So I think putting the CSS and
Stylesheet module implementation at priority 3 is OK in relation to issue
of knowing what is actually being rendered.

Jon
