Hello,

Issue 195 [1] states that reviewers of the Candidate Recommendation [2]
had difficulties understanding the wording of checkpoint 1.5:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  1.5 Ensure that the user interface provides information through 
      redundant output modes. [Priority 1] 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Therefore I propose this clarification:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  1.5 Ensure that the user interface presents information through
      more than one output mechanism.
    
  (Note afterwards):
      For example, alert the user to an event with a graphical
      cue, and an audio cue, and a text message on the status bar.
      Refer also to checkpoint 5.4.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Also, we can add to the techniques document that the user may want 
to configure the output modes.

 - Ian
