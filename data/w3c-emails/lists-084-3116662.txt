Ian,
I would suggest that, rather than saying "one output mechanism" we say "one
sensory modality."  To a programmer, one output mechanism might suggest
displaying on the screen and printing on the printer.  The intent is to have
multisensory information, and this would make it more clear.

Subject: Proposed clarification of Checkpoint 1.5

Hello,

Issue 195 [1] states that reviewers of the Candidate Recommendation [2]
had difficulties understanding the wording of checkpoint 1.5:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  1.5 Ensure that the user interface provides information through
      redundant output modes. [Priority 1]
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Therefore I propose this clarification:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  1.5 Ensure that the user interface presents information through
      more than one output mechanism.

  (Note afterwards):
      For example, alert the user to an event with a graphical
      cue, and an audio cue, and a text message on the status bar.
      Refer also to checkpoint 5.4.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Also, we can add to the techniques document that the user may want
to configure the output modes.

 - Ian
