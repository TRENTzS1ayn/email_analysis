aloha, ian!

you wrote, quote:
Thanks for sending these, Hans. By the way, I verified with Philippe Le 
Hegaret that content generated by style sheets does not appear in the DOM tree
unquote.

not even in the CSS Extended Interfaces?
http://www.w3c.org/TR/CR-DOM-Level2-19991210/css.html#CSS-extended

isn't that how the DOM would getPropertyCSSValue for counters defined by an 
author via a stylesheet?  (2 such interfaces spring to mind: 
CSS2CounterIncrement and CSS2CounterReset) -- like pseudo-elements, these 
are classified as "generated content", aren't they?
http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/generate.html

and, if the CSS Extended Interfaces for DOM Level 2 are providing 
information about CSS2-defined cursors, surely they could also be extended 
to include the content defined using :before and :after...

rich, is this something to put on the Protocols & Formats' requirements 
request list for CSS3, or am i barking up the wrong tree?  i certainly hope 
not, as i'd hate to have to rely on son-of-the-off-screen-model in order to 
obtain the content for :before and :after pseudo-elemental text...
