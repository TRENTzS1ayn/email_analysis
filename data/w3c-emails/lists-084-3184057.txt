Kelly,

The HP form uses the onChange event with respect to the list box (SELECT
element) to trigger the submission of the immediately enclosing form.
First off, the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines indicate that you
_should_ be able to stop this once and for all by a browser setting, and
not have to "Alt down-arrow" each time to make each list box safe.  Not
that this is available yet.

Second, I do not understand why the onChange behavior is being fired even
before you close the list box.  The onChange event for the SELECT element
should not fire until you close the list with the focus on a selection
which is different from the selection that was in effect when you opened
the box.  

But the accelerators which function as discombobulators in eyes-free mode
keep on creeping in more and more.

This is just a rough idea of what is going on.  I hope someone active in
the User Agent working group will be able to clarify this further.
