aloha, chris!

yes, i know that there is nothing in the CSS2 rec that mandates that a user 
start from ground zero, but if one wants to add pseudo-elemental text, 
there isn't a property sheet driven slash wizard type mechanism that allows 
one to do so...

there are, however, interfaces (such as those available in Opera 3.6x and 
MSIE 4x and 5x) that allow you to reference a local stylesheet, but no 
extant mechanism to walk someone through the process, which was my point 
about those who have no interest in learning the CSS syntax and grammar, 
but who simply want to tailor the presentation slash rendering of content 
to best fulfill their needs...

i didn't mean to imply that the CSS rec mandates that one must construct 
one's own stylesheet using a plain text editor, but the fact of the matter 
is, if one wants to take full advantage of CSS, that is currently the only 
alternative to downloading a "core stylesheet"
