JRG: I think this was the practical meaning of the original checkpoint.  
Even though 5.2 talks about programmatic access, if the original information 
is a graphic or a sound, the AT will only get the graphic or sound 
reference.  So a message dialog box in screen reader sounf like graphic, 
graphic and OK button.  If the graphics were images conveying the message.  
Without some type of text equivalent the screen reader my have programmatic 
access, but the programmatic information will not have the information in a 
form it can translate to speech.  I think that Checkpoint 1.5 is really the 
analog of WCGL requirements for alternative equivalents, except that here we 
want alternative redundency.

JRG: This seems to contradict item 3 of your requirements.  This seems to 
say if you use any sounds, then all messages must use sound.
