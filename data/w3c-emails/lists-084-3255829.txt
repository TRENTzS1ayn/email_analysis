New proposal based on my last e-mail:

<LAST CALL> 
1.5 Ensure that all messages to the user (e.g., informational 
messages, warnings, errors, etc.) are available through all output 
device APIs used by the user agent. 
</LAST CALL>

How about this:

<NEW PROPOSAL> 
1.5 Ensure that user agent-initiated messages to the user 
(e.g., informational messages, warnings, error messages, etc.) 
have redundent text equivalents for graphical and auditory information. 

Note: This does not require descriptions of images or sounds, but a
redundent text message of the information the graphic or sound was trying
to convey to the user.
</NEW PROPOSAL>
