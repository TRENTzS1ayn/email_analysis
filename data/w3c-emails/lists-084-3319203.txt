In http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-UAAG10-TECHS-20000128/
article 4.16: 
there is an (implicit HTML) markup example of <a target="_new"> 

To make a long story short, replacing "_new" 
with "_blank" in the example, would be a good change.

To keep a long story long:
In HTML the value of target must begin with a letter [a-zA-Z]
unless it is a reserved name starting with an underscore. "_new" 
is not one of these reserved names.
See: http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/types.html#type-frame-target
where it says:
"6.16 Frame target names
Except for the reserved names listed below, frame target names 
(%FrameTarget; in the DTD) must begin with an alphabetic 
character (a-zA-Z). User agents should ignore all other 
target names."

Nir.
