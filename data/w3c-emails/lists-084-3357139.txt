Nir,
Thanks for comments.
In general the guidelines do not tell developers not to do something.  What
we do say is that they should conform to open standards that are accessible
like the ones available from the W3C and then in the Web Content Guidelines
for authors to use correct markup.  If a user agent wants to extend the
functionality through some proprietary markup, we don't say not to do it.
This could lead to a long list of items that would be beyond the capability
of the working group to manage.

Jon
