Here is how I would interpret that language.  Hope this helps.

Please consider "server-side redirects" to refer to this case.
"Server-side" in this case because the server has to know something to make
the redirection happen.  It happens on the server side of the user agent,
without parsing any document content beyond the headers communicated
between the HTTP implementations in client and server.  If redirection only
is desired, the server should use 3xx and not a Refresh header, no?

The third case is what I would expect is meant by "client-side"
redirection, i.e. from within the document without touching HTTP headers.

See interpretation above.  I don't object to having the doucument language
tightened to say technically correct things, though.

By all means fix the example.

The suggestion as to content practices is worth noting here, but as a note
with a link to the applicable part of the WCAG.

There are two issues, to me:

One is user control of the implementation of Refresh.  I think that is
covered in checkpoint 3.8 of the UAAG.

The second is the use of Refresh with a delay of zero seconds in a META
element to emulate redirection.  This is a content issue, see WCAG
checkpoints 7.4 and 7.5.
