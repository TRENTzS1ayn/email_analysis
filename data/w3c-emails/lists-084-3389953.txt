I do not see how what you say is related to my message.

As far as I understand the example explained how to support 
wrong markup i.e. target="_new". The explanation is in contradiction to 
the HTML recommendation that refers explicitly to this markup error 
with "user agents should ignore" this "target name". So one possibility
is to that the guidelines should note that the new recommendation 
from W3C is in contradiction to HTML4.01. Also I would like to know why 
changing HTML4.01 is needed. 

I think that this was not the intention of the guideline.
The intention was to show a possible way to support correct 
markup, such as target="foo" or target="_blank". So I suggested 
to change the example to have correct markup, as I think was intended.
 
Regards,
Nir.
