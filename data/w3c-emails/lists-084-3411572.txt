Re: Points for Today's Telecon

I am unable to attend the phone meeting today but here are a couple of 
comments.

#1. I am in favor of the proposed resolution for issue CR#204 as given in 
today's version of the agenda for the 1 March telecon:

CR#204: Add collated text to Checkpoint 2.6 and 4.8 or create a new 
checkpoint at lower priority
http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#204
Proposed Resolution:

1. Add collated text to checkpoints

#2. One should keep in mind that the reference to caption in checkpoints 2.6 
and 4.8 is compatible with the possible WCAG requirement for "captions for 
audio clips" as well as captions for the auditory track of movies and 
animations. I think that this is OK to keep the UA document open to that 
possibility. Furthermore, I don't think that the UA document should make 
reference to the term captions in any way that contradicts that 
interpretation.
