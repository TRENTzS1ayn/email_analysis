   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JanMar/0253.html

  12.RS: Take timely and synchronization issues to WAI PF. Get input
from
         MSAA developers as well. Craft email to PF WG with Ian 

   RS: I've been working this from another angle.


NEW ACTION  DB: See if "MS Developer Accessibility Guidelines" can be
made
      available as HTML.

2) Update on ftf information.
 
   IJ: We can meet at RF and D in New Jersey. If we get the issues
       resolved and the document ready, we'll have the meeting
       on 10-11 April.

   JB: Possibility of additional teleconf on Friday?
       (Some people can't attend)

3) Issue 190
   http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#190

   Proposed: Split 5.1 into:
     a) Read-only for XML/HTML DOM 2 core
     b) Write for ui controls available through content.

   IJ: I think that "b" is fairer than full write since that
       means that you can do through API what you can do through
       the UI.

   RS: Javascript can change menus on the screen. Is there an 
       accessibility issue that ATs be allowed to do the same thing?

   MN: Why is this not covered by 2.1?

   JG: I think 2.1 is primarily UI.
 
   GR: In my post on NOFRAMES, I quoted the HTML 4.0 spec: 
       (talks about configured not to display frames).

   DP: What do we lose if we don't allow write access to the
       full core spec?

   JG: Not clear.
  
   DP: What about "Begin Table/End Table"? Are those written
       in the document tree by the AT, or added by the AT?

   IJ: If they are walking the DOM (and not getting info from
       graphical rendering), then don't need to write. AT can
       prepend itself.

   Resolved: Split 5.1 into:
     a) Read-only for XML/HTML DOM 2 core
     b) Write for ui controls provided through content.

   Action Ian: 
     - Make this change.
     - Add a cross-reference from 2.1 to 5.1 and say in
       5.1 that this is a special case of 2.1

4) Issue 194
   http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#194

   Proposed:
      1. Only for synchronized multimedia
      2. Includes both space and time

   DP: Problem of streaming media. It's possible for downloadable
       media. 

   IJ: I think that the applicability clause and a comment in the
       techniques document could clear this up.

   DP: If a multimedia presentation stops when you leave the page,
       then you should be able to return to it. 

   IJ: I don't know why disorientation doesn't apply to multimedia.

   GR: I agree. 

   Resolved:
     - Add an examples of multimedia/time to "point of regard"
     - Add a technique for multimedia tools about:
       a) If the presentation stops when you leave a presentation,
          bookmark and return. Distinguish running in "background"
          from paused.
       b) Comment about inapplicability for streamed media.

   Action Ian: Add these to techniques document.

5) Issue 195
   http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#195

   JG: Question of what exactly is meant by 1.5. Is this a UI
       checkpoint or an API checkpoint?

   Proposed 1) Ensure that user agent-initiated messages to the
               user are available through all output channels
               supported through the UI.
      
   Proposed 2) Provide a text-equivalent in the user interface
               for every non-text user interface component. 
               (Based on WCAG 1.1).

   DA: What about the case where the UA emits a beep?

   JG: Message on the status bar.

   IJ: Components work in tandem: the sum of the components
       around a given functionality must be accessible together
       (and have a text equivalent).

   GR: Problems of access to colors. 

   IJ: Not a problem: Either text is there for everyone, or
       you can query. But you can't make the color alone accessible
       to all people.

   Proposed 2) Ensure that every functionality available through the
               user interface is represented in the user interface
               as text. 

   DB: For IE colors, nicknames should be available for main colors.
     
   MQ: Allow users to name colors that they create....

   Proposed 2) Ensure that every functionality available through the
               user interface is represented in the user interface
               as text. 

   IJ: Note that I'm talking about functionalities. Also, note that
       that text needn't be available at all times; just available
       at some time.

   RS: What about basic colors?

   JG: What if we scale this back to messages.

   IJ: Note that we push to P2 the general case of user interface in
5.6. 
       Do Windows guidelines talk about text equivalents of non-text
       controls?

   DB: Yes, talks about item names.

   Questions: 
     - How much has to be available through the UI? 
     - Just for messages? For all UI components?
     - Does text meet the expectations of the WG?
   
   DP: The reason we talked about messages was that they are
       transient. Maybe not available through an API. 
     
   Resolved:
     Ensure all non-text messages (e.g., prompts, alerts, etc.) 
     available through the user interface are also represented 
     in the user interface as text. 

   Action Ian:
     - Ensure that techniques for this checkpoint talk about status bar.
     - Incorporate proposal.
     - Add rationale: if you're deaf blind you might need this
       (Braille display).
