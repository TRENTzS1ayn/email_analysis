http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JanMar/0253.html 

12.RS: Take timely and synchronization issues to WAI PF. Get input from
MSAA developers as well. Craft email to PF WG with Ian 

RS: I've been working this from another angle. 

ACTION DB: See if "MS Developer Accessibility Guidelines" can be made
available as HTML. 

Announcement: Update on ftf information.

IJ: We can meet at RF and D in New Jersey. If we get the issues resolved
and the document ready, we'll have the meeting on 10-11 April. 

JB: Possibility of additional teleconf on Friday? (Some people can't attend) 

Issue CR#190: Reduce the scope of 5.1 to say "write access only for that
which you can do through the UI."

http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#190 

Proposed: Split 5.1 into: 
a) Read-only for XML/HTML DOM 2 core 
b) Write for ui controls available through content. 

IJ: I think that "b" is fairer than full write since that means that you
can do through API what you can do through the UI. 

RS: Javascript can change menus on the screen. Is there an accessibility
issue that ATs be allowed to do the same thing? 

MN: Why is this not covered by 2.1? 

JG: I think 2.1 is primarily UI. 

GR: In my post on NOFRAMES, I quoted the HTML 4.0 spec: (talks about
configured not to display frames). 

DP: What do we lose if we don't allow write access to the full core spec? 

JG: Not clear. 

DP: What about "Begin Table/End Table"? Are those written in the document
tree by the AT, or added by the AT? 

IJ: If they are walking the DOM (and not getting info from graphical
rendering), then don't need to write. AT can prepend itself. 

Resolved: Split 5.1 into: 
a) Read-only for XML/HTML DOM 2 core 
b) Write for ui controls provided through content. 

Action Ian: 
- Make this change. 
- Add a cross-reference from 2.1 to 5.1 and say in 5.1 that this is a
special case of 2.1 

Issue CR#194 : In a timed presentation does checkpoint 7.2 mean return to
the time that the user was at in a previous MM rendering 

http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#194 

Proposed: 
1. Only for synchronized multimedia 
2. Includes both space and time 

DP: Problem of streaming media. It's possible for downloadable media. 

IJ: I think that the applicability clause and a comment in the techniques
document could clear this up. 

DP: If a multimedia presentation stops when you leave the page, then you
should be able to return to it. 

IJ: I don't know why disorientation doesn't apply to multimedia. 

GR: I agree. 

Resolved: 
- Add an examples of multimedia/time to "point of regard" 
- Add a technique for multimedia tools about: 
a) If the presentation stops when you leave a presentation, bookmark and
return. Distinguish running in "background" from paused. 
b) Comment about inapplicability for streamed media. 

Action Ian: Add these to techniques document. 

Issue CR#195 (Candidate Recommendation): Problems understanding checkpoint 1.5 

http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#195 

JG: Question of what exactly is meant by 1.5. Is this a UI checkpoint or an
API checkpoint? 

Proposed 1) Ensure that user agent-initiated messages to the user are
available through all output channels supported through the UI. 

Proposed 2) Provide a text-equivalent in the user interface for every
non-text user interface component. (Based on WCAG 1.1). 

DA: What about the case where the UA emits a beep? 

JG: Message on the status bar. 

IJ: Components work in tandem: the sum of the components around a given
functionality must be accessible together (and have a text equivalent). 

GR: Problems of access to colors. 

IJ: Not a problem: Either text is there for everyone, or you can query. But
you can't make the color alone accessible to all people. 

Proposed 2) Ensure that every functionality available through the user
interface is represented in the user interface as text. 

DB: For IE colors, nicknames should be available for main colors. 

MQ: Allow users to name colors that they create.... 

Proposed 2) Ensure that every functionality available through the user
interface is represented in the user interface as text. 

IJ: Note that I'm talking about functionalities. Also, note that that text
needn't be available at all times; just available at some time. 

RS: What about basic colors? 

JG: What if we scale this back to messages. 

IJ: Note that we push to P2 the general case of user interface in 5.6. Do
Windows guidelines talk about text equivalents of non-text controls? 

DB: Yes, talks about item names. 

Questions: 
- How much has to be available through the UI? 
- Just for messages? For all UI components? 
- Does text meet the expectations of the WG? 

DP: The reason we talked about messages was that they are transient. Maybe
not available through an API. 

Resolved: Ensure all non-text messages (e.g., prompts, alerts, etc.)
available through the user interface are also represented in the user
interface as
text. 

Action Ian: 
- Ensure that techniques for this checkpoint talk about status bar. 
- Incorporate proposal. 
- Add rationale: if you're deaf blind you might need this (Braille display).
