Can you email me at danson@miseri.edu or call at 570-674-6413 after the
meeting to arrange for a review of 5.0 for conformance?  Or, I'll be at
Microsoft next week for the Microsoft Accessibility Advisory Counsel through
the Accessibility and Disabilities Group.  Maybe I can just pick it up.

Denis
