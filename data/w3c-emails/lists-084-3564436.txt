I apologize for missing today's meeting. I was on a conflicting
conference call. I wanted to comment on issue CR#204. Here are
the minutes from today's call followed by MR: and then my comments.

9) CR#204: 
   http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#204
   Add collated text to Checkpoint 2.6 and 4.8 or create a new
   checkpoint at lower priority 

   Proposed Resolution: 

   1.Add collated text to checkpoints
     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JanMar/0343.html 

   MK: If it's not synchronized, no problem.
   IJ: Is this more burdensome than a caption?
   MK: Same as caption.
 
   Resolved: Adopt Eric's proposal.
   Action IJ: Review Eric's proposal by Friday.

MR: a text transcript would be the same content as the captions, but
without synchronization. A collated text transcript includes both the
captions (of the audio information) and the text of the description
(of the visual information). I thought we had resolved not to include a requirement on UAs for either kind of transcript because the current W3C
spec for SMIL does not support the identification of those elements. 
See minutes from 22 December 1999 at:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/1999OctDec/0741.html

Authors can and should provide transcripts anyway, however the UA
doesn't yet have a means to work with them programmatically.
