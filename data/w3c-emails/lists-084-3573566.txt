Regarding the issue of going "back" to a specific time in a multimedia
presentation, the minutes from Wednesday's telecon suggest that this is
impossible in a streamed presentation. I disagree. It is impossible in
a live stream, since the stream always contains the live material, but
if a completed presentation is available as a stream, as many are,
it should be possible for a UA to bookmark a specific time in the stream
and restart streaming at that point. So I think we only need to comment
that this checkpoint is inapplicable to live streaming media.

Portions of minutes below.

Issue CR#194 : In a timed presentation does checkpoint 7.2 mean return to
the time that the user was at in a previous MM rendering 

http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#194 

Resolved: 
- Add an examples of multimedia/time to "point of regard" 
- Add a technique for multimedia tools about: 
a) If the presentation stops when you leave a presentation, bookmark and
return. Distinguish running in "background" from paused. 
b) Comment about inapplicability for streamed media.
