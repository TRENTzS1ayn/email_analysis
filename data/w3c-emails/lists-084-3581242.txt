IJ:
At the 2 March telconf [1], the Working Group decided to adopt
your wording (refer to issue #204). Part of the rationale
for adopting the proposal now was that adding collated text transcripts
did not seem to be any more burdensome than the existing requirement
to support captions.

IJ: 
  Is there any reason to put "both synchronized and
  unsynchronized" in the checkpoint? Can that be left
  part of the definition of collated text transcript?


IJ: The WG adopted this proposal at the 2 March teleconf.

IJ: The WG did not discuss this at the 2 March teleconference.
   However, using the same logic applied at the teleconference
   (that there is no extra burden on UAs - these are just
    additional types of text equivalents), I think that
    this change also makes sense and I would support it.

IJ:
You defined "audio presentation" in an earlier email [1], but this
definition does not appear in the document or your current proposal.

IJ: 
 1) The WG wanted to distinguish these requirements for speech.
 2) And the WG considered that the key requirement of 4.5 was  
    the ability to slow, whereas for 4.9, one might also
    want to speed up.

IJ:
Please refer to the resolutions of issues 205 [1] and 190 [2].
In short, the WG decided to include a read-only DOM requirement
and a write requirement for that which can be done through the
UI. Also, the WG decided to refer specifically to these DOM
Level 2 Modules: core, html, and css (a new P3 checkpoint).
