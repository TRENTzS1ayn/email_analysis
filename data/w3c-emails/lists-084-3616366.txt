Hello,

I discussed the conformance provisions of the guidelines 
(Candidate Rec [1]) yesterday with Dan Connolly and have
made one addition and some editorial changes, listed below.

The old version of "Well-formed conformance claims"
required only the version number and operating system,
but not, for example, the name of the product or the vendor.

I propose the following new text:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
A well-formed claim must include the following information:

   About the guidelines: 
     -  The guidelines title/version: "User Agent Accessibility
Guidelines 1.0". 
     -  The URI of the guidelines:
http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/CR-UAAG10-20000128. 
     -  The conformance level satisfied: "A", "Double-A", or "Triple-A". 
     -
  The checkpoints of the chosen conformance level considered 
         not applicable. Claimants should use the checklist
[UAAG10-CHECKLIST] for
         this purpose. 
  About the subject of the claim: 
     -  <NEW>The vendor name.</NEW>
     -  The <NEW>product name</NEW> and version number. 
     -  The operating system name and version number. 
  Properties of the claim: 
     -  The date of the claim. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Later on in the section "Validity of a claim", I've
made a strong link between the second bullet and the "subject
of the claim" (which is named in the previous section):

<BLOCKQUOTE>
   A conformance claim is valid for a given conformance level if:
    1.The claim is well-formed, and 
    2.The subject of the claim satisfies all the applicable 
      checkpoints for that level. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>


Please let me know if there are any objections to these changes.

   - Ian
