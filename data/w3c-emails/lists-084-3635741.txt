I object. This says "requires", which I don't think we agreed to.
I though we agreed that in-process communication should be 
highlighted as a technique. I propose the following edit:

<PROPOSED>
This checkpoint is designed to reduce delays that an assistive
technology user might experience due to communication overhead.
Timely exchange is import for preventing loss of information,
a risk when changes in content occur faster than the
exchange with the assistive technology. One effective technique 
for providing timely access is to allow assistive technologies to run 
in the same process space as the user agent, thus eliminating
inter-application communication delays.
