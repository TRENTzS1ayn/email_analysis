Ian, I think you are close but I like to still see a concrete example.

<PROPOSEDRICH>
This checkpoint is designed to reduce delays that an assistive
technology user might experience due to communication overhead when
accessing
parts of your application such as your DOM.
Timely exchange is import for preventing loss of information,
a risk when changes in content occur faster than the
exchange with the assistive technology. One effective technique
for providing timely access is to allow assistive technologies to run
in the same process space as the user agent, thus eliminating
inter-application communication delays.

I object. This says "requires", which I don't think we agreed to.
I though we agreed that in-process communication should be
highlighted as a technique. I propose the following edit:
