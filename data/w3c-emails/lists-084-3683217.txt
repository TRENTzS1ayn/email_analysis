  I object. This says "requires", which I don't think we agreed to.
  I though we agreed that in-process communication should be 
  highlighted as a technique. I propose the following edit:
  
  <PROPOSED>
  This checkpoint is designed to reduce delays that an assistive
  technology user might experience due to communication overhead.
  Timely exchange is import for preventing loss of information,
  a risk when changes in content occur faster than the
  exchange with the assistive technology. One effective technique 
  for providing timely access is to allow assistive technologies to run 
  in the same process space as the user agent, thus eliminating
  inter-application communication delays.
  </PROPOSED>
