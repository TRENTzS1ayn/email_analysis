Madeleine,
I talked to Ian about this issue.  While there is currently not any markup
that allows authors to indicate explicitly collated text.  It may appear in
a future recommendation of SMIL or some other technology and until that
time the reference to collated text in the checkpoint will not mean very
much (see applicability clauses of a checkpoint).  But to make the document
forward looking, collated text was included.  

Do you think that there should be mark up in the future to indicate
collated text transcriptions?

Do you think that with our current applicability clause it is alright to
include it now?

Thanks,
Jon
