JRG: While there is currently no know markup to the User Agent working
group for an author to indicate collated text, it may be available in the
future.  The applicability clause allows developers to not have to
implement this feature until markup is available to recognize collated text.

JRG: The working group discussed this issue at the 10 February Telecon and
came up with the same conclusions as to the difference between 2.2 and
4.5/4.6.  I think the e.g. should be a little cleare by adding the word
"automatically" before the word pause.  This I think would help clarify
that the user agent is stopping the presentation based on recognizing
content that offers user input.

JRG: I think this is a good move.

JRG: Yes.  I think though that we should have a statement in the techniques
document saying that developers should check the markup that they support
to see which alternative equivalents they need to support.  For developers
creating prorietary markup that they should support accessibility features
in their markup.
