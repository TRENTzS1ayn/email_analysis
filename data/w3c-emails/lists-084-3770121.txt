I think that the "In process" must not be mentioned or at best be mentioned in the techniques document (not in the guidelines). 
Letting an AT in process is a potential security hole! Also, for the Macintosh, there are no seperate process-spaces and therefore is in process less meaningful.

Note to checkpoint 5.5: This checkpoint is designed to promote the use of
APIs which provide efficient exchange of information between user agents
and assistive technologies.  Notably in multi-tasking operating systems
this requires the ability to access the DOM and other Accessibility APIs in
process.  In process communication eliminates the time delays which occur
with out-of-process communication between applications.  The time delays
can result in slower response to user actions or potentially the user
missing important information.
