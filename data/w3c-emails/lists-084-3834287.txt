I'm really sorry that I only bring this "in process" argument to attention now. I understood that the mention of "in process" would never make it to the checkpoint-text (or notes with it). 

Shouldn't we have techniques in the techniques document?

The argument:

"In process"  IS an effective technique. It has an important downside. If the AT crashes "in process" it crashes the UA. The AT can also have the UA crash by (inadvertently?) corrupt internal data of the UA. I am (almost) sure this is not what a UA is willing to do.

A way to a solution?

The "in process" technique leads to three performance improvements:
1) No process switching needed
2) No waiting until the next process switch is needed
3) No copying of data needed (reaching other process's memory is not possible on Win32 platforms. I am not sure but I believe it is possible on the Macintosh)

Point 3 can be solved by using shared memory (is a technique). I am aware that shared memory can be corrupted when it is writable. 

Point 2 can be solved by giving higher (or equal?) priority to the AT-process-threads or explicitly allowing a switch by the UA. I am aware that the AT could starve the UA.

Point 1 can ONLY be solved by going "in process". It has the disadvantages of data corruption AND the AT taking all the CPU time AND corruption of internal UA-data.

Bottom-line.
In process is a technique that has great efficiency and a big downside. I personally think the downside is too big to even recommend this technique. It still is a technique and should (if mentioned) be mentioned in the techniques document.

Hans,

1. Would a clause that said:

"One effective technique in operating sytems that use separate process
spaces for providing timely access is to allow assistive technologies to
run in the same process space as the user agent, thus eliminating
inter-application communication delays"

2. Do you have any examples of what techniques would be useful on a
Macintosh operating system to support inter-process communication?

Thanks,
Jon
