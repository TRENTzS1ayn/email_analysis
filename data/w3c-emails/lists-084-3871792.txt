I agree with the proposal. I would prefer to say in the techniques that
developers should pay close attention to working drafts in general, and
particularly those that have advanced as far as candidate recommendation.

  Hello,
  
  In the Candidate Rec of the UAAG 1.0, checkpoint 6.2 reads:
  
     "Conform to W3C specifications when they are appropriate 
      for a task. [Priority 2]."
  
  The WG has already resolved [2] to change the wording to:
  
      "Use and conform to W3C specifications when they are 
       available and appropriate for a task." 
  
  I propose changing "specifications" to "Recommendations".
  This would narrow the scope of the requirement. It would not
  prevent user agents from conforming to additional levels
  of documents, but would only require conformance to
  Recommendations. Furthermore, we should note in the Techs
  document that developers should pay close attention to
  Candidate Rec drafts.
  
  I would like to discuss this at the 9 March meeting. Please
  voice any objections before then.
  
  Thank you,
  
   - Ian
