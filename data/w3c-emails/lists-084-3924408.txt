aloha, charles!

consider your agreement seconded...  cognizance and monitoring of candidate 
recommendations, drafts in last call, and working drafts in general should 
also be stressed in the techniques documents of all of the WAI GLs, 
especially as they all depend upon the forward-looking WCAG which is, 
perforce, rife with "until user agent..." clauses...  only by monitoring 
the evolution of technical reports (and following up by reading associated 
notes), will developers be able to erase those words from WCAG...
