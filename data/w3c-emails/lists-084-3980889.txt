I propose the following note for Checkpoint 5.5:

<PROPOSED>
This checkpoint is not about absolute time specifications, but about
developers using and supporting APIs that result in the timely exchange of
information betweeen user agents and assistive technoloiges. This
checkpoint is designed to reduce delays that an assistive
technology user might experience due to communication overhead.
Timely exchange is also import for preventing loss of information,
a risk when changes in content occur faster than the
exchange with the assistive technology.
