Ian,
I would just suggest adding the phrase "and other information needed for
accessibility." to the end of the note.

<REVISED>
For example, the programmatic exchange of information required by 
other checkpoints in this document must be efficient enough to 
prevent information loss, a risk when changes to content or user 
interface occur more quickly than
the communication of those changes. The techniques for this checkpoint
explain how developers can reduce communication delays, e.g.,
to ensure that assistive technologies have timely access to
the document object model and other information needed for accessibility.
</REVISED>
