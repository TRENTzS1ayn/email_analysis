As does the 28 January CR draft [1]:

9.2 Prompt the user to confirm any form submission triggered indirectly,
    that is by any means other than the user activating an
    explicit form submit control. [Priority 2] 

As does the 5 November Last call draft [2]:

9.3 Prompt the user to confirm any form submission triggered indirectly, 
    that is by any means other than the user activating an
    explicit form submit control. [Priority 2]
