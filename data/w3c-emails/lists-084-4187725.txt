Can John help reconstruct the decision process for this?  Was the
requirement transmuted from 'allow the user to require this behavior by
mode setting' to 'just do it this way' as the result of a deliberative
process?

I did not understand the requirement to be that visual users must forego
the Windows-standard behavior, here; but that rather users need protection
from this in some interaction modes, notably eyes-free, hence the concept
of a mode switch.   But I have been abset from a lot of the discussions and
may not be up to date.

The mode concept may have been thought too complex to believe users will
ever actually use it.  Or that is my rough take on Chaals's 'cognitive'
question.
