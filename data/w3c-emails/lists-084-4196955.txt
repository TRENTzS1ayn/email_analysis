continues to play in the background.

visibility="hidden" allows a blank place holder box to be rendered in place
of the video on the screen while retaining the layout of the page.

Support the 'display' property in CSS ([CSS2], section 9.2.5). Using
display="none" removes the rendering of the video completely and may cause
the layout of the page to be changed.
