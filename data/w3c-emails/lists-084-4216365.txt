New Jersey 10/11 April. 

Action IJ: Put up meeting page for ftf. 

3) Ian summary of where we are in the PR process.

4) Review of list of changes:

http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/wai-ua-wd-changes.html 

EH: Comments on word "automatic" in 2.3. Is this necessary? 

JG: My main concern is that people understand that the UA pauses itself. 

EH: Ok. 

HB: What about breaking sync? 

CMN: There are cases when you can't do anything about it, e.g., real world
events. 

HB: What about auction events? 

CMN: You can't slow down the real world. The requirement doesn't apply. 

GR: Auction houses notify through color changes &ltfrown> critical events. 

Checkpoint 2.6 

a) Added collated text transcript 
b) Moved note to checkpoint, added "author-supplied" synch cues. 

MK: Sounds ok to me. 

MQ: What about adding the word "indexing"? 

HB: Indexing in the sense of marking time? 

MQ: Marking time. 

Checkpoint 4.7: 

MK, EH: Ok. 

4.16: Allow the user to configure viewports, prompts, and windows opened on
user agent initiation. 

IJ: We could harmonize wording with that of 9.2. Use "not explicitly done
by the user." 

DP, CMN: Yes, 

GR: I think that the focus is to allow the user to configure whether or not
the UA. "Allow the user to configure whether the user agent will
automatically open a
viewport, prompt, or window. 

EH: That's a new requirement. 

CMN: There are other configuration issues. 

GR: It's one thing to control the size/position of something once created
and another to talk about suppressing the creation. 

IJ: As I recall, we agreed in Austin to put all of it in 4.16. 

CMN: I agree with Gregory - there are two separate requirements. 

GR: I propose to split the checkpoint: 
a) Allow the user to configure the visual rendering. 
b) Allow the user to configure alert mechanisms used on opening. 
c) Respect user settings when opening windows. 

IJ: Sounds like three: 
a) Suppress spawning AND/OR prevent focus shifting. 
b) Configure alert of spawning. 
c) Style the user interface. 

IJ: I don't think "respect user settings" get us much. 

Action IJ: Add to definition of Configure that users should be able to save
settings. 

JG: How does all this relate to focus changes (4.15)? 

IJ: Why are spawned windows an issue if there's no focus change and you're
notified? 

GR: Yes, 4.15 and 4.16 are related. 

RESOLVED: 
1) MOve note after 4.16 to 4.16 techniques with some clarification. 
2) Link from 4.16 techniques to 4.15 techs. 
3) Reword 4.16. 

Action Ian: Send proposal to list to clarify. 

Checkpoint 5.1

Action IJ: Add a reference to the XHTML Recommendation. 

Action IJ: For 5.1, add a technique to take into DOMs defined by other
specifications (e.g., SVG). ------ 

Checkpoint 5.8: 

HR: Ok 

RS: Ok. 

Checkpoint 6.2:

Bug: Ian forgot to add "available" 

Action IJ: 
- FIx bug 
- Explain what a W3C Rec is in the techniques document. 

Checkpoint 8.4:

Group: Ok. 

Checkpoint 9.4: 

Action IJ: change "portion" to "proportion" 

Checkpoint 10.7: 

Action Ian: Add "in" a profile. 

Other comments

CMN: Is minority objection propagated? 

IJ: Yes. 

GR: In the definition of documentation, it doesn't talk about updates. 

IJ: That's in 1.2. 

GR: Things that are supplemental, but provided by the vendor. 

Action IJ: Add something about with the product or available elsewhere. 

GO TO PR?

IJ: Any objections to going to PR? 

Group: None.
