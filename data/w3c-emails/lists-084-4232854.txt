Hello,

Per the teleconf today [1], here's a proposal to clarify 4.16.

<OLD>
4.16 Allow the user to configure viewports, prompts, and 
     windows opened on user agent initiation.
</OLD>

<PROPOSED>
4.16 Allow the user to configure viewports, prompts, and 
     windows that open indirectly, that is by any means other 
     than the user opening them explicitly.
</PROPOSED>

Note the similarity to the wording of 9.2:

  9.2 Prompt the user to confirm any form submission triggered 
      indirectly, that is by any means other than the user 
      activating an explicit form submit control.


Please voice any objections this afternoon (New York time).

 _ Ian
