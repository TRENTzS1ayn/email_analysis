Hello,

For the record, here is a tally of the results of the survey
of assistive technology developers about the DOM.

Five assistive technology developers returned the survey and the
following is a summary of the results.

  Question 1. What techniques do you currently use or plan to use to
access and
  process Web content for alternative or enhanced rendering for people
with
  disabilities?

     * Parse own HTML: 1 (will be using Microsoft DOM in next release)
     * IE or Java DOM: 1
     * Use accessibility APIs of operating system(i.e. active
       accessibility): 3

  Question 2. Are you familiar with the W3C Document Object Module
(DOM)?

   Yes: 3, No: 2.

  Question 3. If yes to question 2, are you familiar with APIs you can
use to
  access the DOM implementations of current user agents (i.e. Microsoft
  implementation of the DOM in IE 4.0/5.0)?

   Yes: 3, No: 2

  Question 4. If yes to question 2 and 3, do you think the DOM will meet
your
  needs for access to Web content?

     * 100%: 2
     * 90-95%: 1
     * Do not know: 2

  Question 5. If yes to question 3 and 4, how complex and resource
intensive is
  it to use the DOM to access Web content?

     * High: 0
     * Medium: 1
     * Low: 2
     * Do not know: 2

  Question 6. Indicate which of the following resources would help you
in using
  or deciding to use the DOM for accessing Web content. Respond to each
  question with a yes, no or don't know.

     * Demonstration code? Yes: 5, No: 0
     * Web based tutorial materials on DOM capabilities and programming
       examples? Yes: 5, No: 0
     * Face-to-face workshop on DOM capabilities and programming
       examples? Yes: 1, No: 2, Not sure: 2
     * Access to people with expertise in DOM capabilities and
       programming? Yes: 5, No: 0

   Open ended question for you to indicate any other resources that
would
   help you?
     * The best types of resource we can get is GOOD documentation and
       sample programs which demonstrate all aspects of DOM: 2 responses
     * Improved implementation of DOM in user agents: 2 responses

  Question 7. Could you please review and comment on current version of
the W3C
  Web Accessibility Initiative User Agent guidelines, especially the
  checkpoints related to Guideline 5: Observe system conventions and
standard
  interfaces?

    Comment 1

     I believe one confusing issue for assistive technology developers
     will be the use of MSAA and other OS accessible APIs versus
     document object models and the W3C DOM. Other than creating an OSM,
     today document object models are the primary way to get text
     content, and MSAA and accessible APIs are the primary way to get UI
     information. However, today's document object models are
     application/document specific and accessible APIs are operating
     system specific. If the W3C DOM architecture adds access to UI, and
     accessible APIs add access to any type of document content and its
     presentation, application developers will have to implement both
     DOM and accessible API interfaces, and assistive technology
     developers will have to choose between these two types of standard
     interfaces, which both have their limitations. Do we need both of
     these standard interfaces or is there a way that the W3C can work
     with the OS vendors to develop one standard interface that will
     provide access to document content and UI across all document and
     application types?

    Comment 2

     Looks fine except for the point about user agents and assistive
     technologies communicating in a timely fashion, which appears to be
     a Priority 2. I think it should be Priority 1.

    Comment 3

     The guidelines seem quite complete. I did not see any omissions in
     my read-thru.
