Working Group,
I would just like to congradulate all the working group members, past and
present, who have helped in developing the user agent guidelines and bring
them to this point.  We have reached an important milestone in going to
proposed recommendation and look foreward to your continued contributions
in moving the document to a recommendation.  

I would like to offer a special thank you and congradulations to Ian Jacobs
our staff contact for all his hard work and insights in editing the UA
documents and for his skills in guiding us through the W3C recommendation
process.  

Jon
