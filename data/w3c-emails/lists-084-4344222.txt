Charles,
I think it would be of great interest for inclusion in the next version of
the techniques document to indicate one method for using the DOM to notify
assistive technology of user agent and user initiated events in the
document.  If you do not have time right now, we could see if someone else
would be willing to do this.

Let me know,

Jon
