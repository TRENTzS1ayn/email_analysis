It would probably be more sensible for an AT programer who is familiar with a
particular DOM implementaiton (IE, Mozilla, etc) to do it properly. And no, I
don't think I have time currently

Actualy I ahd understood something different about hte action, which was to
do with the new event model proposed for DOM that allows for a more complex
and flexible way of setting up active element behaviours. But I believe that
is not being included in the current document.

  Charles,
  I think it would be of great interest for inclusion in the next version of
  the techniques document to indicate one method for using the DOM to notify
  assistive technology of user agent and user initiated events in the
  document.  If you do not have time right now, we could see if someone else
  would be willing to do this.
  
  Let me know,
