Subject:  Request to Review Appendix on Loading AT




Rich,
Could you review the Appendix: Loading assistive technologies for access to
the document object model in the revised UA Techniques document?

http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-UAAG10-TECHS-20000310/#loading-at

Ian has done some extensive editing and he would like to make sure that the
informtion in the appendix is accurate.

Thanks,
Jon
