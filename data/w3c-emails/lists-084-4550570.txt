Phil,
Checkpoint 2.1 can be satisfied through providing access to all content
through the built-in user interface or through an API (DOM).  It is the
intention that all information be available through the DOM or some other
interface for non-HTML or non-XML documents.  It was not the intention to
have all the content of a resource available through the user interface,
since information on element attributes like class or id are not really
useful to most users and do not improve accessibility.  The guidelines may
need to be clearer what content needs to be available through the user
interface.

As to whether having a source view mode would satisfy this checkpoint is an
interesting question.  My first impression is that it seems to solve the
checkpoint in a legal perspective, but it doesn't seem to quite honor the
spirit of the checkpoint in making all content accessible in a usable way.
I'll take this back to the group.

Thank you for your comments.  They only help make a better document.

Jon
