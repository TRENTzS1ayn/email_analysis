For the UA Guidelines' Proposed Recommendation Last Call, these are a 
few minor editorial comments for the Guidelines [1], Checklists 
[2,3], and Techniques [4] "work in progress."

Three notes on style:

1. Personally (and I did not list them here), I try to eliminate 
"slash/pairs" when possible; this joining/construct may mean 
something for "and/or", but choosing the most pertinent term, or 
combining terms with hyphens or conjunctions strikes me as a more 
precise way to express a pair of ideas.

2. Contractions seem a bit colloquial for a formal specification. If 
you agree, the one instance each of "can't", "hasn't", "don't" could 
read "cannot," "has not", and "do not."

3. I wasn't sure if you wish to cut down on markup overhead by 
eliminating links to the glossary from the checkpoints, so I didn't 
list those links. For many of the checkpoints, glossary items are 
anchors without class .dfn-instance markup. For example, in 2. 
Guideline 1 checkpoint 1.1, API is <a href="#def-api">API</a> but in 
the paragraph before the checkpoints, API is <a href="#def-api" 
rel="glossary" title="Definition of  Application Programming 
Interface (API)"><span class="dfn-instance">APIs</span></a>.

 From here on, a section number is followed by a paragraph or list 
item number, then a quote, and then some idea of a suggestion. 
Comments are in brackets [].

Techniques
----------

At least the first time it's mentioned, "Internet Explorer [IE]" 
maybe could say "Internet Explorer for Windows 95, Windows 98, and 
Windows NT [IE-WIN]". There is a Macintosh version (5.0 ships this 
month) and I presume Windows and Unix versions.

2. Checkpoint 1.2 - list item 4

2. Checkpoint 1.2 - list item 5

     language may result in the user receiving messages from
     servers that do not have a match to this single language
     although they have acceptable other languages to the
     users."
[could read:]
     Automatic setting of Accept-Language as the operating system
     language may result in the user receiving messages from
     servers that do not have a match to this single language
     although they do have other languages acceptable to the user.

[If "value" is singular, then "these" would be "it."]

"...An internal TH in a row surrounded on either side by TDs
     has no means to specify to which (row or column) that TH
     overrides what existed to its left or above it."
[Sorry I couldn't follow this one. Maybe remove the parentheses? 
Could "overrides what existed to its left or above it" mean "labels 
cells to its left or above it"?]

3.5.4 last list item
"...A TH with "colspan" set needs to be included in the list
     of TH for the N-1 columns to the right of the column in
