Ian,

I would say that the source view would meet this requirement only if two
other conditions are also met:

1. The source view itself is accessible to assistive technology.  If the
viewer that is used for source view does not allow complete keyboard
control, or does not expose the text in a fashion that is visible for a
screen reader or braille display, the condition is not met.

2. The "source view" feature somehow places the point of reguard at the
relative portion of the page that you are trying to get access to.  In a
multipage document, a user with cognitive limitations should not be placed
at the top of the document and expected to find the information about a
table that is several screens away.  In complex markup, this can present
profound challenges even for the person who is experienced in reading HTML.
For the typical end user, you might as well show the code in an encrypted
format for all the good you have done.

Denis

I believe that, while not an ideal solution, a source view would meet
this
requirement. A navigable source view would be better, but still forces
people
to read the markup, which is not very desirable.

Last Call issue 111 [1] was about introducing a relative priority scheme
(for checkpoint 6.1, implement the accessibility features of supported
specifications). The issue was raised by Charles [2] in light of the
Authoring Tool Guidelines experience. The UA Working Group, at the
Austin face-to-face meeting in December 1999 [3], decided to leave this
checkpoint a priority 1 checkpoint for several reasons:

  1) If user agents only implement P1 and not P2 and P3 accessibility
     features, no authors will be able to use the P2 and P3 features.

  2) The UA Working Group did not want to introduce a relative priority
     schema for a single checkpoint, arguing that it would complicate a
     system that some developers might already find challenging.

  3) The WG argued that non-conformance to specifications was one of the
     most important barriers to accessibility, and therefore it was
considered
     a high priority to implement all, not just some, of the
accessibility
     features of the supported markup languages.

While these arguments were used for checkpoint 6.1, I believe that
they also apply to checkpoint 2.1.

Yes, but not very well.

As Jon points out in a later email [4], we do not use the term "render"
since
content may be available through an API. There is a cross reference
from 2.1 to guideline 5 for that reason.
