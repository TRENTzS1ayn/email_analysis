I think it minimally satisfies the requirement of making content
available. We include no specifics about how content must be rendered
(e.g., that alt content for an image be made available inline, in the
same geometric area as an image, a click away from the image, in
a tool tip, etc.). I wouldn't expect a user to have to read through
the encoding of a raster graphic. However, I think that providing
text in a view, even if it's surrounded by markup tags, allows users
access to that information and thus minimally satisfies the
requirement of making (text) content available. I agree that
not all attribute values are useful, but since we don't specify
that only those for humans need to be available to the user (since
it may not be specified clearly in the markup language which are
for humans and which are machines), I think it's "safest" to ensure
that they are all available.

I strongly agree that a source view is not an ideal solution,
however, I think it meets the requirements of a minimal solution
to the issue of availability of text content.

1) When rendered through the user interface, the information has to
be rendered for human consumption (and thus the GIF code doesn't
count, but text as part of a source view would).

2) When made available through an API, we don't care what the
data looks like.

We may need to clarify this.
