IJ: You requested information about the number of controls in a form,
but your example is a linearization of the structure of the form, which
is very different. I am a little nervous about exploring natural
language 
solutions to descriptions of structure. I personally would find it 
difficult to hear the English-language linearization of anything more
than a simple form. I think I would find more useful a structured
navigation mechanism with the ability to query an element for title
information or other metadata. 

Please elaborate on whether "the number of controls in a form" would
meet your needs or whether you want structured information presented.

IJ: I don't this technique belongs in the section on loading. It sounds
like a navigation technique that could be generalized to something like:
"Alert the user when navigation has led to the beginning or end of a
structure
(e.g., end of a list, end of a form, table row or column end, etc.)"
