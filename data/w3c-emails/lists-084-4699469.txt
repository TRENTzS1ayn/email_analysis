Thanks Susan!

I will integrate all of these. A couple of your comments reveal
minor bugs in the document production mechanism (e.g., point 3
below is a script issue, as is the duplication of checkpoint 5.3
in the checklist).

Thanks for your willingness to do a second review unprompted!!

I will incorporate all of your points. I've deleted most
of your comments in this reply, but left a few for comment.

I haven't made any changes here, but will review.

Script bug that's been fixed.


I've made a global change of "header" to "heading" for H1 - H6. The
term "header" should now only be used for HTTP headers and table
headers.

I've changed to "Techniques document" globally.

ok.

I've added a references section to the checklists, so this will work.

Ok. I should probably add version information for each piece of
software. Hmm, Todo...

Yes.

icccm.ms. I've added that it's troff format.

Now http://www.microsoft.com/enable/dev/guidelines/software.htm.
Too bad the MS Webmasters are breaking links. <frown>

Document markup bug. You're right, and it will be there.

This is a tricky one and we've had this comment before. I don't
want the TOC to read "Section 2.1" for Guideline 2. I'd rather it
be "Section 2, Guideline 1". However, putting the word "Guideline"
in each entry of the TOC makes it kind of long, so only the
number appears there.

Suggestions welcome. We could put "G1" or something like that...
