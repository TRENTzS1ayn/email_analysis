Thanks for alerting me to this, David. We're playing with it but haven't
yet figured out how to code the audio descriptions to be turned on and off.
They don't seem to be using either a SMIL 1.0-like attribute (similar to the 
system-captions attribute) or the SMIL-Boston attribute systemAudioDesc.

Also, we noticed that they made captions and audio descriptions mutually
exclusive by using radio buttons to choose between them. Anyone besides
us think it would be useful to have independent control over the two
features?
