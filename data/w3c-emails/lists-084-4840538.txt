Not just yes, but !@#$ yes, as Love would say <grin>.

We need your consensus to prod PF into taking the position that _all_ of
these things belong as 'bag' semantics where a multiple selection is
possible in the base-level definition, and the "pick only one" behavior is
not the base definition but an overlaid default, which can be rolled back
by the right kind of user intervention.

For a concrete scenario (just one stab):

The person wishing both captions and audio descriptions has some hearing
loss but not total; and also enough vision impairment to use a screen
magnifier.  The captions are necessary because in this cinema_verite the
dialog is in barely decipherable grunts, while the audio descriptions are
articulated with a bell-like tone that needs no text alternative.  So the
user processes the dialog in audio+caption+magnifier and catches up with
what the magnifier leaves out by the audio descriptions in audio.

[The generic answer is that "both" ususally involves a scenario with a user
with functional impairment, but not total functional loss, in two modes.]
