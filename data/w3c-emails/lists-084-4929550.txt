DOM Level 1 and 2 address the second layer : the document tree. This is
the DOM Level Core. The content generated or suppressed is, from your point
of view, part of the third layer.
DOM Level 2 address some parts of the first layer : associated Cascading style
sheets
(with DOM Level 2 CSS). DOM Level 2 HTML gives access to the content of sub
document
in objects and frames only if the sub document is XML or HTML. You don't have
access to the
content of images or HTTP Headers.
DOM Level 3 will address the third layer: the rendered content. We call "Views
and Formatting" this 
future module (see [1]):
 "The abstract structure and value of the document content is modelled by the DOM
core. The physical characteristics and state of the presentation will be modelled
by the views and formatting module.
