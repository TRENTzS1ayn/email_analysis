JRG: I like this concept being clearly stated in the guidelines and I think
it is an important part of 2.1 that is not covered somewhere else in the
guidelines.  I share Ian's concerns with this change and will think about
it some more.

JRG: I don't really think Checkpoint 2.1 has anything to do with source
view.  If you provide a source view it should be accessible.  But I don't
think a source view in of itself makes a user agent more accessible to the
typical user.
