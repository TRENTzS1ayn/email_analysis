MN:  "Ensure that the user has access to all renderable content
available through  the user interface  -or - Ensure that
the user has access to all alternative equivalents
through the user interface."   either of which seem to me
like a sub-set of the current 2.1.  I'd rather leave 2.1 as
is, and if people see the need, make one or both of these special
cases of 2.1, like we've done with other checkpoints?

MN:  agree with a, b, and c.

MN:  I think you have the definitions in order, source->DOM tree->
rendered 'view', and i'm ok with "rendered content" as supposed to
be "what the user gets".
