The documentation for SAPI is available in HTML, but it is a part of the 
Software Development Kit (SDK)[1] as a local resource.  There does not 
appear to be a similar resource for SAPI on the Web.

The requirement should be to allow the user to user to set parameters 
anywhere with in the range of the synthesizer and that the user agent 
should provide information on the ranges available.
