Open Action Items

    1.IJ: Produce a new draft that folds minimal requirements into the 
checkpoints. Should be ready about 7 July.

    2.IJ: Pick up GR's action item to send out a request for information on 
speech synthesizer mins/maxes for various articulation capabilities (as we 
did for speech
      rate).

    3.IJ: Draft a preliminary executive summary/mini-FAQ for developers. 
(No deadline.)

    4.GR: Look into which checkpoints would benefit from audio examples in 
the techniques document.

    5.GR: Pursue speech synth ranges for other properties than speech rate.

    6.GR: Re-examine the orientation checkpoints and see whether they can 
be clarified to account for control of rendering of audio (and possibly 
other content) on
      load.
