this checkpoint needs several characteristics:
1> what the lowest speed <min> should be:
2> what the fastest speed should be this is min or max of fast and slow.
this should not limit developers to those limits as long as thos limits are
available because:
2> access is not achievable without controll of the full range of the
engine.
4> we need an incramental part heresuch as it must be possible to step
through the rate at 5 percent incraments so that individuals who need
incraments can have them.  the current state of the technology makes
controll necessary and we must provide as much information for guiding this
as is possible.

I have no way to express this in a clear checkpoint but it is necessary to
get them all in.
