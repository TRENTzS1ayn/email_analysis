Summary

Resolutions

    1.Meeting time lengthed to 2 hours for subsequent telecons, will will 
check to see if we could meet an one half hour earlier
    2.Synthesized speech rate checkpoint remains at priority 1, minimum 
requirement for speech rate is to provide access to the full range of 
speech rates supported
      by the synthesizer, with a minimum requirement that the combination 
of speech engines available support a range of 100 wpm to 400 wpm with a 10 wpm
      increments.

Open Action Items

    1.IJ: Produce a new draft that folds minimal requirements into the 
checkpoints. Should be ready about 7 July.
    2.IJ: Draft a preliminary executive summary/mini-FAQ for developers. 
(No deadline.)
    3.GR: Re-examine the orientation checkpoints and see whether they can 
be clarified to account for control of rendering of audio (and possibly 
other content) on
      load.

New Action Items

none

Completed Action Items

    1.GR: Look into which checkpoints would benefit from audio examples in 
the techniques document.
    2.IJ: Pick up GR's action item to send out a request for information on 
speech synthesizer mins/maxes for various articulation capabilities (as we 
did for speech
      rate).
    3.GR: Pursue speech synth ranges for other properties than speech rate.
