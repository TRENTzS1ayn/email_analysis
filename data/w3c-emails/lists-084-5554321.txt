Hello,

I have published the 7 July 2000 UA Guidelines [1] and
Techniques [2] documents. The full list of changes is
online [3] and included as text below.

ATTENTION: This is a very important draft and I entreat
the entire Working Group to review it. We are nearing
last call again and will be ready to go after we resolve the
remaining open issues. We only have about 12-15 checkpoints
with minimal requirements left to resolve, and there are proposals
out for all but two of them. I hope to go to last call in the
next few weeks. Please review this draft!

NOTE: 
  Due to mirroring issues, some links may be broken temporarily.

ABOUT THE CHANGES:

The primary changes concern folding minimal requirements
into the checkpoints. There were two parts to this
exercise:

 a) Folding minimal requirements that the WG has
    discussed and which are recorded in "Determining
    Conformance to the UA Guidelines" [4].

 b) Folding in requirements that were in Notes into
    the checkpoints. The WG did not discuss this prior
    to this draft, although I did send an alert [5] to the WG
    in April about this. Please consider this draft my
    attempt to clarify exactly what is required by each
    checkpoint. The remaining note information should only
    include examples, references, and clarifications about
    the scope of the checkpoint (e.g., what the checkpoint
    does not mean).

Here's what did not get done in this draft:

 - Review/refinement of multimedia terms (refer to issue 289)
   http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#289

 - Additional minimal requirement proposals not yet reviewed by
   the Working Group.

 - Some techniques proposals that have not yet been incorporated.

I hope that you like this draft and that you agree with me that
it's the right direction for the document.

 - Ian

  General changes

     * Added link to WAI Technical Activity statement.
     * 1.3 How the guidelines are organized. Two important change:
         1. It is now stated clearly that the notes after the
checkpoints
            are only normative. All normative information is moved into
            the checkpoint text itself. The Notes are distinguished from
            the checkpoint text in two ways: markup (DT v. DD) and the
            notes begin with the word "Note".
         2. After the discussion of checkpoint organization, there is
            discussion of minimal requirements.
