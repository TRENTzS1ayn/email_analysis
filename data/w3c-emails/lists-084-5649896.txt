1. In the example of FRAMES only one of the frames would be available, but 
a list of frames that are part of the current document would be maintained 
by the user agent.  The user could access and display the frame they want 
visible.

2. In the case of something like a source view the user could switch the 
source view and the rendered view.

Maybe is the issue is more making some viewports visible and some not 
visible.  The siwtching is making a viewport visible or not visible.

>Does that mean open but iconified?

In a graphical interface the views could be listed in a menu called "views" 
or "windows" for example or in a pop list that includes the view 
titles.  The visible view could be selected by the user.
