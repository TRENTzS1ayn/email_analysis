To make checkpoint 2.3 more explicit, I suggest the following changes:

<OLD>
2.3 If content available in a viewport has equivalent alternatives, provide 
easy access in context to the alternatives.
</OLD>

<NEW>
2.3 If content available in a viewport has equivalent alternatives, render 
the alternative equivalents next to the primary content in the user 
interface.  If it is not possible to render the alternative equivalents 
next to primary content, provide a one step command to access the equivalents.
</NEW>
