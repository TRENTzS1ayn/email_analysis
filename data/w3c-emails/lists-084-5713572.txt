To make the minimum requirements for checkpoint 4.14 simpler, I suggest the 
following change to limit the scope of the checkpoint to only changing 
colors and border style:

<OLD>
4.14 Allow the user to configure how the content focus is highlighted 
(e.g., foreground and background color). [Priority 1]
</OLD>

<NEW>
4.14 Allow the user to configure the color and border used to highlight 
content focus. Make available the range of system colors and the border 
styles specified by CSS. [Priority 1]
</NEW>
