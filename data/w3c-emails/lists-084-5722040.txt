To make the minimum requirements for checkpoint 4.13 simpler, I suggest the 
following change to limit the scope of the checkpoint to only changing colors:

<OLD>
4.13 Allow the user to configure how the selection is highlighted (e.g., 
foreground and background color). [Priority 1]
</OLD>

<NEW>
4.13 Allow the user to configure the color used to highlight a selection. 
Make available the range of system colors. [Priority 1]
</NEW>
