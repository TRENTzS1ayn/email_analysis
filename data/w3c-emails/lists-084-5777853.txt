I don't know what "next to" means. What if styling is used (or must be
used)
to reposition it? What does next to mean in an international context?
What if there
is more than one equivalent? 

I imagine a much better UI (e.g., that of amaya) where information is
available through
consistently designed context-sensitive menus (that are accessible). I
actually prefer
not altering content if we can avoid it.

P.S. I'm sending these comments late at night, after a ftf meeting,
without a lot of thought.
