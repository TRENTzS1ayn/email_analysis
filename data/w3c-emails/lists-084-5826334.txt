I agree with Ian - this proposal goes too far into the detail of User
Interface implementation.

  I don't know what "next to" means. What if styling is used (or must be
  used)
  to reposition it? What does next to mean in an international context?
  What if there
  is more than one equivalent? 
  
  I imagine a much better UI (e.g., that of amaya) where information is
  available through
  consistently designed context-sensitive menus (that are accessible). I
  actually prefer
  not altering content if we can avoid it.

  P.S. I'm sending these comments late at night, after a ftf meeting,
  without a lot of thought.
