John,
substitution is a good idea but shouldn't we make it possible to make it
happen rather than just substituting?
 
Charles,
How about this then:

<NEW1>
2.3 If content available in a viewport has equivalent alternatives, provide 
access to the alternative equivalents by either substituting the 
alternative equivalent for the primary content, rendering the alternative 
as part of the primary content (both at the same time) or providing a link 
to the alternative equivalent from the primary content.
<NEW1>

Jon
