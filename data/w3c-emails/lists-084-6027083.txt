AG::

I myself would not let the browser vendors hide behind the specification as
far as error recovery is concerned.  It is reasonable for the users to
expect the browser to handle more errors and handle them more gracefully
than just what is specified in the format specification.  

I have always felt that the UAAG had a right/duty to define the
HTML-processing behavior required for cross-disability usability.  And to
go beyond what is provided in the HTML specification where necessary to
define this.  We have an obligation not to override what the specification
_does specify_ without good reason; but where the HTML spec _fails to
specify_ things, such as behavior for out-of-spec pages, it is entirely up
to the UAAG to decide what is appropriate and required.

Yes, we have to be careful to only ask for what is important.  On the other
hand, the principle being raised in this issue is a bad principle.  If web
browsers hadn't performed lots of error recovery that makes life easy for
authors and nominally-abled users, we wouldn't have the immensely popular
web we have today.  'Repair' was part and parcel of making the Web a game
all could play.  So asking for a few well-selected repairs that help people
with disabilities where they need help should be fair game.  It is not
undue burden or anything at all out of the ordinary.
