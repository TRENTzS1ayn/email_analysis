Hello,

This email is part two of a series of emails about issues raised
about the 7 July UA Guidelines [1] during an evaluation of 
MAC IE 5 [2] conducted with the lead developer, Tantek ?elik. 
Refer to part one [3] of this series for issues raised about Guidelines
one through seven. This email covers issues raised in Guidelines
8, 9, and 11.

While these are issues that could be raised during a last call
review, some of them are directly related to our efforts to
establish more precise requirements, and so I am sending them
as part of the process of refining and clarifying the document.
The issues follow my signature.

Below, I summarize the seven issues that were raised.

 - Ian

P.S. I hope to send the results of the review of Guideline 10
in the near future.

ISSUES

Issue 1) Checkpoint 8.8 reads: Implement selection, content focus, 
         and user interface focus mechanisms. Implement them according 
         to system conventions per checkpoint 5.8. 

  Proposal: Add a clarification that this checkpoint is about the
  semantics of these mechanisms (selection, focus) and not their
presentation.
  Their presentation is covered in checkpoint 8.9. 

Issue 2) The definition of "recognize" needs review. I don't have a
proposal
  right now. 

Issue 3) Define set of explicit submit controls for HTML
  Checkpoint 11.2 reads: Allow configuration so the user is 
  prompted to confirm any form submission not caused by explicit
  activation of a form submit control.

  Proposal: Add to the Note following the checkpoint that in HTML 4,
  the only explicit controls are INPUT type="submit" and type="image",
  and BUTTON type="submit".

Issue 4) Change percentage back to proportion.
  Checkpoints 9.4 and 9.5 used to say "proportion" and now they
  say "percentage". I propose that was return to "proportion". For
  example, saying that 1 Mbyte of 10 Mbytes has been transferred 
  is just as useful as saying 10% has been transferred, and it is also
  gives size information. 

  Proposal:
   a) Change "percentage" back to "proportion"
   b) Give two examples of indicating proportion: percentage and "X of
total Y".

Issue 5) Definition of "stalled". Checkpoint 9.4 reads:

   9.4 When transferring content (e.g., a document, image, audio, video, 
       etc.) indicate what percentage of the content has been
transferred 
       and whether the transfer has stalled.

   Issue: What is the definition of "stalled"? What is the length of
time
   before the transfer should be considered stalled. 

   Proposal: Specify that user agents should refer to specifications
   of underlying protocols (e.g., tcp/ip) that may specify timeout
parameters.
   I am not familiar with these specifications, so any advice (notably
URIs)
   would be appreciated.

Issue 6) Does relative position of the viewport include horizontal
position?

   Proposal: Yes. In fact, the dimensions depend on the viewport. An
audio
   viewport would not (I believe) have this issue since the output is
one
   dimensional.

Issue 7) General advice about implementation of optional features of a 
   specification.

   Proposed: Add the following statement to the spec (as a Note to
   either to checkpoint 6.1 or 6.2):

      "Developers should not implement an optional feature of
       a specification if that feature may pose accessibility
       problems and if the user cannot turn off the feature
       in the user agent."
