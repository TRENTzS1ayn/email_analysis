JRG: I agree

JRG: Our use of recognize seems to also mean "interpret", if that helps 
with a definition

JRG: Yes I think this would help clarify the HTML 4 case.  In the case of 
scripting though the user agent will also know that the script is 
requesting a new document using the "location" property (NN) or method with 
3 types of methods (IE) of the windows object.  In this case the user agent 
does not know if this  function was called as part of an explicit user 
request or if the script is generating the page change without explicit 
user notification.  The script writer currrently would need to design there 
code for only explicit user activiation.

JRG: Seems reasonable to me.

JRG: The user agent will typically issue a dialog box warning or render a 
web page if access to the resource is not available.  This would seem to 
suffice for me.

JRG: I I think horizontal is very important for people with visual 
impairements.  Many times they increase font size and information formatted 
in table columns disappears off the right hand side of the screen.  Many 
users don't know the information is there and the horizontal scroll bars 
are important to give people information.

JRG: It seems reasonable to me, but what test do we give developers to know 
if it will affect accessibility?  Is there an example of an optional feature?
