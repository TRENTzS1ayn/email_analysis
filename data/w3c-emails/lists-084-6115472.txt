Snipped anything where I would have said "me too", and scattered comments
into the rest.

  JRG: Yes I think this would help clarify the HTML 4 case.  In the case of 
  scripting though the user agent will also know that the script is 
  requesting a new document using the "location" property (NN) or method with 
  3 types of methods (IE) of the windows object.  In this case the user agent 
  does not know if this  function was called as part of an explicit user 
  request or if the script is generating the page change without explicit 
  user notification.  The script writer currrently would need to design there 
  code for only explicit user activiation.
  
CMN There are two issues here - submitting information that hasn't been
completed, which was the original motivation for this checkpoint, and being
shifted without knowing why, which is covered by requirements such as turning
off auto-refresh, although the various possible javascript techniques for
doing it cvould be incorporated into the techniques document, along the lines
of Jon's suggestion.

CMN no clues on this one.

  JRG: I I think horizontal is very important for people with visual 
  impairements.  Many times they increase font size and information formatted 
  in table columns disappears off the right hand side of the screen.  Many 
  users don't know the information is there and the horizontal scroll bars 
  are important to give people information.
  
CMN definitely agree. For text a better option is often to be able to wrap,
but people do nasty layout tricks that can work out messy with that, and you
can't wrap an image anyway, as a rule.

  JRG: It seems reasonable to me, but what test do we give developers to know 
  if it will affect accessibility?  Is there an example of an optional feature?
  
CMN A feature which determines whether it is possible to do, or to
"view" something which is required or suggested by WCAG. (This is another
case where relative priorities would be helpful, if you can bear the extra
complexity).
