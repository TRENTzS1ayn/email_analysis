JRG: There is currently no special handling of MAP in the user agent 
guidelines.  Access to things markup as MAP would be covered under the 
techniques for a number of checkpoints.  But most notably:

7.6 Allow the user to navigate efficiently to and among important 
structural elements identified by the author. For markup languages with 
known semantics, allow forward sequential navigation to important 
structural elements. For other markup languages, allow at least forward 
sequential navigation of the document object, in document order. [Priority 2]

8.4 Make available to the user an "outline" view of content, composed of 
text labels for important structural elements              (e.g., heading 
text, table titles, form titles, etc.). The set of important structural 
elements is the same required by checkpoint 7.6. [Priority 2]

What would people think about adding the following priority 3 checkpoint in 
the User Agent guidelines, that would be an important special case of 7.6.

"Provide one step access to the list of links that have been identified by 
the author as navigational links [Priority 3]"

in HTML this would be links contained in the MAP element.
