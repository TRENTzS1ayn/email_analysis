I am quite likely alone in my particularly pharisaical interpretation of
what was agreed to in the joint meeting as regards "use MAP for related
groups of links."  The clause "when you need to add a grouping element" was
probably a loophole that I was perceiving and quite possibly nobody else.

I did bad things for the WAI interest in a similar way when the namespaces
Rec went by and I placed a stricter interpretation (less constraining) on
what it said than the proponents understood.  Their interpretation was what
they promoted in public as for example on xml-dev and that leaves us with
the conflicts exposed on xml-uri.  I should have dealt with what they
thought the language meant, and protested more strongly at the time.

As you can tell from my message to the CG, I think that the best way to
seek a good agreement that we can stick with into the future is to take
Wendy's hint and view this as "in the light of what has transpired in UA
since, it is worth revisiting this question."  Hope this works for people.
