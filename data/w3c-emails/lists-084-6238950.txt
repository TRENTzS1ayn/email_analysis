For the configuration checkpoint 10.4 Allow the user to change the input 
configuration. [Priority 2]

The user be able to reassign any function available as a one, two and three 
step operation to a one step operation. One step operation includes the use 
of modifier keys (i.e alt-H, ctrl-Z, M).

An example a three step operation is changing font size in Internet Explorer:
1. Alt-V to select the view menu
2. X to select text size
3. Then selecting one of the text size options

The user could make any or all of the font size options in that sub menu a 
single step operation.

For example:
1. Changing to the lasrgest font size could be assigned to control-L.
2. Changing to medium font size could be assigned to alt-M.
3. Changing to smallest could be assigned to S.
