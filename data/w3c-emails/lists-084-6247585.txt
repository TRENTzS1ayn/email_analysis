On a three key device, or even a 6 key device, the user probably can't afford
to make all font control options single-step.

But otherwise, yes.

  For the configuration checkpoint 10.4 Allow the user to change the input 
  configuration. [Priority 2]
  
  The user be able to reassign any function available as a one, two and three 
  step operation to a one step operation. One step operation includes the use 
  of modifier keys (i.e alt-H, ctrl-Z, M).
  
  An example a three step operation is changing font size in Internet Explorer:
  1. Alt-V to select the view menu
  2. X to select text size
  3. Then selecting one of the text size options
  
  The user could make any or all of the font size options in that sub menu a 
  single step operation.
  
  For example:
  1. Changing to the lasrgest font size could be assigned to control-L.
  2. Changing to medium font size could be assigned to alt-M.
  3. Changing to smallest could be assigned to S.
