Subject: Font size for Alt text display

| I note that in IE5, NSN and Amaya there is no way I can find to enlarge
| the font size of the text so presented (as a tool tip.)

You can, at least for IE. Just right-click on the Desktop and choose Properties
| Appearance | Element | Tool tips (I don't use the English version of Windows,
so I'm only guessing what these are called in English).
