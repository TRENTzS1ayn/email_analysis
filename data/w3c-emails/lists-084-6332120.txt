I'm not sure what your concerns are here. The wording of this checkpoint
was designed to make clear that "this checkpoint always applies on
systems with a standard keyboard API."

I believe that when we're done, the checkpoints in Guideline 3 will 
be about configuration whether to run on loading. The checkpoints in G4
will be about control once loaded.

Yes, I guess so.

As I recall, that is our intention.

Note that this checkpoint does not require user agents to suppress
the rendering of individual frames. If a viewport opens to render
a frameset, then the user can request that no other viewports open.
The checkpoint does not require the user agent to render fewer than
all the frames in a frameset.

Access to NOFRAMES is covered by 2.1 (access to all content) and
I believe also 2.3 (easy access to alternative content). I think
we should indicate near checkpoint 2.3 (e.g., the techniques) that
NOFRAMES is an indicator of alternative content and user agents
should allow users to have easy access to it in lieu of the frame
rendering. Some user agents give access to NOFRAMES with a 
"turn off support for frames" setting.

Yes, I think so. So the checkpoint could read (with an additional
clarification):

   For each state in a viewport's browsing history, restore
   the point of regard associated with that state when the user
   returns to it in the viewport.
