Hopefully, this is a proper way to ask a question about using HTML.  One
thing that has bothered me about HTML and most of the applications that I
find within IBM is that the cursor is never positioned in the correct place
as I encounter a panel.  One of my colleagues said he has been through the
spec for HTML4 and cannot find a way to control the cursor when the panel
has multiple input fields.  With a single input field, the cursor seems to
be placed in that field.

Any advice on how to accomplish this will be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.
