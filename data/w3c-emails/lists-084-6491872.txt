No.  These concepts are well-posed enough, even if HTML elements don't sort
neatly along these lines.

In fact, I would try to clarify my earlier remark.  The syntactic
distiction between markup and marked-up content is perfectly clear.  What I
was trying to say is that some people think of metadata as semantically a
different class of stuff from data.  That is what I was claiming is
illusory.  The meta-distinction is a byproduct of the view or packaging,
not in the semantic meaning of the data.  

In the case of HTML some markup [counting style rules in a stylesheet as
markup, loosely] is clearly presentational and some, such as DIV is clearly
structural.  Now, of course, there is markup like FRAMESET and TABLE which
are both.  This markup has both layout and structural semantics in one
element type.  So at least in HTML it is possible to talk about markup with
presentational semantics and markup with structural semantics, but it is
not possible to partition the set of element types into two groups which
are purely one and purely the other.

Hope this is responsive to your question.

Al
