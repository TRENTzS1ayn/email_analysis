al, I think you have captured the escence of our intent.  in ie, if you
uncheck play sounds, no sounds are played automatically but here again, we
don't have the opportunity to know that a sound exists if it is a background
sound and thus play it as a stand alone sound file.  the last thing I want
is for an unexpected sound to come blaring! out of my speakers in an
inappropriate place and or time not to mention the load increase.  take for
example one I created at:
http://www.clark.net/pub/etowski/
it is large and plays only once but takes a long time at 33.6 to load and in
ie for some reason it is jerky on my win.95 box so I'd rather not hear it. 
it is a wav.  midis don't pose this issue for me but I am sure they might
for some.
Thanks.
