IJ: 
My understanding has been that information conveyed through style sheets
(or their markup equivalents) is intended for a particular rendering
only and is "disposable" with respect to other renderings. Of course,
we require that the raw style sheet be available to the user (as part
of all content). Refer to our discussion about the "W3C Working Draft"
background image and lack of alt text from 1999.

We ask user agents to allow users to turn off background images because 
they can get in the way. However, we don't require more control 
than that (e.g., the ability to inspect the image as Lynx provides)
since
background images are disposable and don't require additional control.
Of course, it's possible to abuse style sheets; the author could insert
the entire document with the 'content' property. But this is an
authoring
problem, and I don't know whether we should make additional requirements
on user agents based on bad authoring practices.

IJ: 
That is the part that I don't agree with. Do users need to rewind
or slow down sounds that are used purely for decoration? 

Are authors required to provide a text transcript for background sounds 
that have words? We have said that authors are not required to provide
alt text for list bullets because they are graphical decoration for
structure encoded in markup (refer to discussion on the WCAG 
list from Nir in 1999 [5]). I think that we should require user
agents to provide adequate control over content rendering, but I think
we don't need to require maximum control over content whose role
is only decorative.

[5] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/1999AprJun/0077.html

On a related note: Should we require user agents to allow users to
rewind and slow down beeps or other short sounds (even "You've got
mail")?
Those sounds may be part of the native user interface or part of
content.
These sounds have a function: convey a message about an event. We
require
that these messages be made available as text in the user interface
(checkpoint 1.5). Are we also requiring stop, start, pause, rewind,
advance, and slow down of this audio? If not, why not? In this case,
the information is not purely decorative. 

The fact that some piece of audio content has a text equivalent doesn't
mean that the user agent shouldn't provide control over the audio. Thus,
I'm not arguing that as soon as an auditory track has an associated 
text transcript, additional control is not required. But I don't think
users need to be able to rewind beeps. 

Refer to comments from Eric Hansen about "short sounds" not being
part of audio presentations ([6], [7]).

IJ: Is that an authoring problem? Or just because one can't draw
the line. If it's an authoring problem (i.e., encoding non-decorative
information in style) then I don't see why the user agent developers
should have to implement more control.

What about the ability to inspect background images separately? That
is not currently required by the UA Guidelines. Except that checkpoint
2.1 requires access to all content. We do not have a requirement that
the user be able to navigate to and inspect all referenced content.

Thanks for the comments Al!
