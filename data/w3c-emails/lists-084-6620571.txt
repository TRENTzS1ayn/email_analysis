Link is not in the UAAG glossary. By these I presume you mean the subset of
active elements that in some browsers is navigated through without activation
by tab or shift-tab

Note that other structural elements can occur (nested, or recursively) within
table, form, list. So going forward or back from the next specific kind of
structural element depends on its containing structural element.

In anticipation of XML applications, the list of such element types is
open-ended. That suggests that a user style sheet be able to select which
among the element types should get keystroke mapping. I expect that DOM
navigation provides adequate capability here that we should leave to it
the tools that allow DOM wanderings through hierarchy and siblings.

In a table, keypair-augmented up/down arrows might be interpreted as 
prior/next row, and augmented left/right arrows as prior/next cell.

In a FORM, are some elements more equal than others? Does the type text
attribute value of the INPUT element type have special needs?  one of
     "(TEXT | PASSWORD | CHECKBOX | RADIO | SUBMIT | RESET |
      FILE | HIDDEN | IMAGE | BUTTON)"
used to specify the kind of widget is needed (and hence possibly different
means of local navigation. How is non-visual accommodation made?)

>11. next active element

Combine with next/prior link? (or do you mean links as targets, whereas
active elements contain hrefs?

>12. stop loading

This should work in conjunction with some loading progress indicator?

Do we have a means to edit that address bar? to query its content?

I prefer this, as implemented in NSN, to the limited choices of MSIE.
I believe it should affect font size of tooltips as well.

>18. page search

Do you mean, search for string in current page, or search for page containing
some pattern, from some domain of pages?

Where do we indicate we expect to be able to have DOM-based navigation? And
attribute query therein?

I would add means to  select a particular track or step to prior/next track.
Also I would add means to fast forward and fast reverse (or go to particular
time within track.)

[I'm currently trying to memorize some music as sung on a CD, and those are
the most important controls I use. Audio Station 32 makes this quite
convenient, with track selection or stepping to prior or next. During track
play a display shows current time position from the start of the current 
track.
A linear slider shows position within the track. Its adjustment stops
play to allow fast-slews to the desired time, shown on the display.
Bookmarks to such starting positions mid-track would also be useful.]
