This is a crossover issue - the navigation is applicable, and the requirement
to control time-variant presentations. There are a buynch of techniques to do
this. I would suggest looking at the relevant parts of Accessibility Features
of SMIL - http://www.w3.org/TR/SMIL-access I think - by our own Ian Jacobs
and Marja-Riitta Koivunen...

Cheers

Charles
