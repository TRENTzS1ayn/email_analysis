As I posted in my earlier message [1] I think the only way to prevent 
disorientation is not rendering the text and indicate the absence of 
rendering.   Remember this is only a priority 3 checkpoint.

I suggest:
<NEW>
2.7 Allow the user to configure the user agent so that content recognized 
as an unsupported natural language is not rendered (suppressed) to the 
user.  Instead the user agent must indicate the absence of the original 
content in context (e.g., with a text message or with an icon, analogous to 
the common "missing image" message)

Note: For example, if the user agent does not have a font available to 
render Japanese, render "[Japanese text]" (in an appropriate natural 
language) instead. Or use an accessible icon that indicates an unsupported 
language.
</NEW>
