Summary of Results of WAI User Agent Telecon for Thursday, 20 July 2000

Resolutions

    1.Issue 289: Accepted resolution for definitions of audio, video and 
multi-media proposed by EH. IJ will update document for consistent use.

    2.Issue 257: For checkpoints 4.13, 4.14, 8.2, 8.3 add cross links to 
checkpoints 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4 and require one additional styling for 
these checkpoints.
      Note: Styling changes for selection need to occur after the 
completion of the selection operation to not interfer with pointer based 
selection of information.

    3.Issue 257: New wording for checkpoint 2.3: "If content available in a 
viewport has equivalent alternatives, provide access to the alternative 
equivalents by
      either substituting the alternative equivalent for the primary 
content, rendering the alternative as part of the primary content (both at 
the same time) or providing
      one step access to the alternative equivalent from the primary content."

    4.Issue 257: Accept wording for checkpoint 10.8: "Ensure that the 
default input configuration allows one step activation of frequently used 
functionalities. " and
      use list of functions given for 10.5 as the list of frequently used 
functions

    5.Issue 257: Accept changes to checkpoint 2.7 proposed by Ian
      http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0080.html
