Summary of W3C WAI User Agent Telecon 24 July 2000

Resolutions

    1.Issue 298: Checkpoints should only express minimal requirements, not 
more (where possible). Resoloved.

    2.Issue 257: Minimum requirement for checkpoint 10.4: Allow the user to 
change the input configuration. [Priority 2]
      Ian will propose a new checkpoint based on:
         1. Do not require the user agent to override standard system input 
configuration

         2. Must be able to remap functions with keyboard bindings that are 
available in the default input configuration

         3. In the keyboard case the minimal support is for mapping to a 
modifier plus single key

         4. May want to require the user agent to include as part of its 
list of keyboard functions the minimum set of functions currently listed in 
checkpoint 10.5

    3.Pending the definition of the scope of functions outlined by Ian for 
checkpoint 10.4, Gregory Rosmaita would like to proposed the same set of 
functions for the minimal requirement for checkpoint 10.5

New Action Items

    1.IJ: Better terminology for single key and single key with modifier

    2.IJ: Repropose 10.4 based on today's telecon

Completed Action Items

    1.KB: Propose rewording of checkpoint 2.7
