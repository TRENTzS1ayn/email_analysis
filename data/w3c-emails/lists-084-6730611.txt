How about "advance [one] viewport" and "retreat [one] viewport"?

Text following these short names would explain that [one] reflects a
step-size through the content which defaults to the scope of a viewport but
may (it is preferred to) be user-configurable.

There needs to be some sort of thought to how this relates to the
pwWebSpeak interface where one can step by a browser-defined phrase-sized
chunk.  This is the most scientific definition I have seen yet of an
audio-display viewport.  So there are issues of two devices attached to
different viewports and which is the master viewport in terms of defining
this step advance through the bulk content.
