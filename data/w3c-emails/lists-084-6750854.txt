I just want to note that we have no requirement on the
user agent to implement a bookmarks feature. Having a P1 requirement
to provide single command access to such a feature is problematic
for me. Unless we add a P1 requirement to implement such a feature.
Most of the other bindings in the proposed list have corresponding
checkpoints (e.g., navigation of active elements). 

So, I think we need to make the requirement explicit
in order to determine the appropriate priority level. I don't think
that single command access to a P2 required functionality should
be P1.
