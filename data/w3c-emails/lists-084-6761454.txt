I'm almost ok with that. I still think that we need to allow
the user agent developer to provide access through the UI
rather than in content. Here's a shot:

 <NEW_UI>
 2.3 If content available in a viewport has equivalent alternatives, 
   provide easy access to the alternative equivalents 
   through at least one of the following mechanisms:
    - Allowing configuration to render alternative 
      instead of primary content.
    - Allowing configuration to render alternative in addition to
      primary content.
    - Providing a direct link to the alternative in content,
      just before or after the primary content.
    - Allowing the user to select the primary content and then
      inspect its alternatives.
 <NEW_UI>

Notes:

1) I put back the word "easy" since that helps understand the
   rationale.

2) I hesitate to put four techniques in a checkpoint, but if 
implementing any one of them would mean that the UA met the
requirement, then I'm ok with that level of specificity.
