Hello,

Per my action item from the 24 July UA teleconference [4], please
consider this proposed revision to checkpoint 10.4. This proposal
relies on the definitions of "single command input" and "double
command input" from another proposal sent earlier today [5].

In the 7 July draft [2] checkpoint 10.4 reads:

<OLD>
  Allow the user to change the input configuration.
</OLD>

I propose the following detailed modification based on
our conversation at today's teleconference:

<NEW>
   10.4 Allow the user to change the input configuration as follows:
     - If the user agent default input configuration offers a binding
       to a functionality for a given input method (e.g., keyboard,
voice, 
       etc.), allow the user to reconfigure that binding for that
       input method. If a single command binding is not available
       for a functionality (refer to checkpoint 10.5), 
       the user agent must allow the user to assign a double 
       command binding.
     - The user agent is not required to allow the user reconfigure
       bindings that have special meaning in the operating system
       (e.g., access to help).
</NEW>

Here's a breakdown of how the input method
checkpoints of the 7 July Guidelines make requirements
about (1) the set offunctionalities to which the user 
must have access and (2) what the user agent must do to provide
easy access to those functionalities and (3) configurability.

A) Requirements of checkpoints 1.1 and 1.3:
   Functionalities: all must be available.
   Ease of access:  no requirements specified
        (i.e., as long as the functionalities are available through 
         the API, it doesn't matter how many keystrokes it takes to
         get at them.)
   Configurability: no requirements specified.

B) Requirements of checkpoint 10.4:
   Functionalities: all must be available.
   Ease of access: single keypress, voice command, etc.
   Configurability: Required. No constraints on the set of input
commands.         

C) Requirements of checkpoint 10.5:
   Functionalities: some must be available (refer to list [2]
         that the WG resolved to adopt at the 13 July
         teleconference [3], though there have been comments on 
         this list since then). 
   Ease of access: anything beyond single keypress, voice command, etc.
   Configurability: Required. No constraints on the set of input
commands.

At the 24 July teleconference, we discussed the following possible
changes:

Change 1) For 10.5: Augment the set of required functionalities 
          to all functionalities. If this is done, 10.4 and 10.5 can
          be combined since 10.5 would make more stringent
          requirements than 10.4 and they would otherwise be
          identical.

Change 2) For 10.4 and 10.5 (presumably):
          Diminish the set of input commands the user agent would
          have to make available for configuration as follows by
          not requiring the UA to allow configurations that would
          interfere with system conventions. (Note that this is
          different from forbidding such configurations; we're only
          saying the UA doesn't have to allow the user to override 
          system conventions).

Change 3) For 10.4: Diminish the set of required functionalities 
          to those which have bindings in the UA's default
configuration.
          Thus, if a keyboard binding is offered to the user for a given
          functionality, the user must be able to override it.

The above proposal combines changes 2 and 3 for checkpoint 10.4.
