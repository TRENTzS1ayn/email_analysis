The list of functionalities one must be able to activate with
a single command includes adding a page to one's favorites. But
the UA Guideilnes does not require that the UA implement
a favorites mechanism. If we require a binding to a function
then that implies that we also are requiring the function.
Unless the applicability clause is invoked. And that has not
been made clear.

Therefore, choose one of the following:
1) Add a requirement to have a favorites functionality.
2) Remove the functionalities related to favorites from the
   list of required bindings.
3) Indicate clearly that some of the bindings only apply if
   the feature has been implemented (e.g., history mechanism,
   favorites, mechanism, etc.). Also indicate that some of 
   the bindings are for functionalities that are required by
   the UA Guidelines (e.g., navigation to active elements).
