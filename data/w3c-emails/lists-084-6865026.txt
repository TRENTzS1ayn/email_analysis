I've a bit of a problem with this because if the link alternative is chosen
it might mean that the fascility is broken.  As I understand it, the primary
expectancy is for choice so we could narrow the number of items to two if we
keep the link option by listing the configurations as one other alternative
rather than three?

Ian,
I am OK with this, how about anybody else?
