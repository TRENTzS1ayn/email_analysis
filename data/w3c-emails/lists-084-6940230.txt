Lynx creates a whole range of links to things that it generates - the history
file is a link in the history file, based on a temporary file. There are
links to recent status messages, and various other things added to documents.

Mechanically it is pretty trivial - find a place to put something, add a link
to it, and if the user activates the link, show it to them. Netscape does the
same thing with various special URI's - about: and javascript: (I have never
tried to make them links in a document, but in theory they should work - does
someone want to test this?

  We could say "allow configuration for one of the following:"
  1) Render alt instead
  2) Render alt alongside
  3) Render link
  4) Provide accses through the UI.
