Actually, it is trying to determine if sounds that work like this need to
offer the user the full range of controls identified for a soundtrack, or
if the option to turn it off suffices.

One posible rationale for why "just turning it off" might be considered
sufficient is that the sound is presumptively decorative.  A sub-argument
on this hypothesis it to try to "determine if said elements should be
considered decorative etc."

You raise the possibility of another possible argument -- that we don't
want to lay a lot of requirements against the implementation of stuff that
isn't in the W3C specification to begin with.

I don't know if <EMBED> counts as "any other markup" because it does match
"proprietary elements like <BGSOUND>."  But I believe that this is another
way to insert a sound with a similar effect.
