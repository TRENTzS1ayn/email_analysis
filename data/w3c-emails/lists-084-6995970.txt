I think the concept of "single command" as proposed by Ian [1] is a unique 
concept to the keyboard and I proposed that like checkpoint 1.3 that 
checkpoint 10.5 be only about the keyboard.  I propose that we say that 
checkpoint 10.5 is a special case of both checkpoint 10.4 and checkpoint 
1.3.  This way we can use the term "single command" to mean a more generic 
command in checkpoints we talk about configuration and single command would 
include concepts like a speech utterance, key press with or without a 
modifier key, or clicking an object with a mouse.  In checkpoint 10.5 we 
can use the term "single key press" and make it clear that this is without 
a modifier key.

What do people think?
