This is interesting. I wondered yesterday (when writing the email)
whether single command should be w.r.t. the keyboard only. However, I
thought that one could (logically) justify preferring shorter phrases
just as one prefers shorter key combinations.

I don't think the term "single command" that has variable meanings
(e.g., key press with or without modifier) is useful. What is the
difference, at that point, between "Ctrl-X" and 
"Ctrl-X Ctrl-Y Ctrl-Z"? What is the boundary of a single command?

I understand the desire to have easy, simple, direct access. However,
I don't think that "single command" is any more precise. And, as I
mentioned, I think using the term "single" in two contexts is dangerous.

In conclusion, I think that making 10.5 for the keyboard only is
an interesting option that I could live with. But I don't want to use
the term "single command" in the document.
