Ian,
I would like to see if there could be a way to remove the phrase "single 
and double" from you proposal for checkpoint 10.8 and just say "single 
command".  Single command would be relevant to voice, keyboard and 
pointing.  I propose that this could be done if we make 10.5 only about the 
keyboard, since the terms "single" and "double" used in your proposal seem 
to be trying to compensate for the modifier key issue for the keyboard.  In 
10.5 we can the specifically use the term "single key" in 10.5.  I don't 
like the complication of defining "single" and "double" command.

Jon
