hi Ian, Jon, and others...

see comments at MN below:

MN:  I'm probably out of step with the group, but like to add a
comment on this. I think the concept of "single command" should not imply or
be retricted to " a single keypress" when referring to a keyboard, nor
to a single "utterance" when referring to a voice input system, etc.

While it will be more difficult to define, I'd suggest that a "single command"
encompass "a-singular-user-input  to  a-user- agent-action".   For
example, if the user types "control+ h" (presses the control and
then types the _h_ key [could also use StickyKeys to do this]), to navigate
to the next header,  this would be an example of a "single command" even though
it required two keys to be pressed.  Likewise, in an audio interface, I
might say/voice "next header", a short utterance of two words, but still a
"single command".

If we really *want* to  describe keyboard input in this manner, I'd rather
see this
"single command" defined in terms of "none, one, or more modifiers combined
with a single non-modifier key" press.  That gives you several options:

x
ctrl+ x
shift+ctrl+x

but not

ctrl+x, ctrl+y

where x and y are any non-modifier key...

Another example:

In IE, I can type "alt+f" to open the file menu, and then "p" to print.
I'd consider
this two commands.  Or, I could type "ctrl+p" to print, which I'd consider
one command.  (some people might call these accelerator keys, others short-cut
keys, etc.)


If we are describing voice input, then this "single command" is whatever
the utterance required per user agent action.  For example, "open file menu",
"page up", "print", etc.   There isn't a direct link between number of words
and "single command".

In either keyboard or voice input case/example, a good user interface will
allow the user to reconfigure the bindings for frequently used keys/voice
command or utterances, such that these types of distinctions between what
is a single command and what else, quickly becomes blurred.  Also, again
in the keyboard model, keys can and do get remapped based on the "element"
or GUI component with keyboard focus.

therefore, I'd suggest backing away from this a bit :

- single command or single input command is "device dependent", meaning
you either make, for example,  checkpoint 10.5 very generic, or you make it
very specific

- single command or single input command is not directly related/limited to a
single key press or a single word utterance, but "could" be user configured
as such via a checkpoint like 10.8



>2) What's the maximum number of keypresses that can be
>   considered to constitute a single command?
>   Is "Ctrl-X Ctrl-O" a single command? What about "Ctrl-x x"?

MN:  see previous....shouldn't be linked to number of keypresses..



>3) How do various OS facilities (such as StickyKeys)
>   fit into the problem? If combinations of modifier keys and

MN:  doesn't in my opinion

MN:  related, see above...
