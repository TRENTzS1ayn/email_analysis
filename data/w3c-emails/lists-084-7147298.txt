IJ: My understanding is that some users require single key press access
and have trouble with keys + modifiers or motion around the keyboard.
For these people, the single command qua a-singular-user-input doesn't
work. 

Also, as you indicate that it's more difficult to define the concept
that you have touched on. I don't think it's worth the effort since
I think we can get along without it. 

I like Jon's suggestion that 
one checkpoint should address the keyboard-specific needs indicated
above (motion across the keyboard + keys in combination) and
that this checkpoint only be about single key press access.

After that, I think that the other checkpoints can be specified
without recourse to a hard-to-define concept.

IJ: Exactly! That's why I am more and more convinced that we should
avoid the concept that is so difficult to define.
