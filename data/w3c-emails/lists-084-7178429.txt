- The default font is the one the user agent chooses if no one else
  has specified anything.

- The author may specify font information as well.

- I'm saying that the user should be able to configure what
  font family should be used for all text. There needs to be
  an option to allow the user to say one of:
   a) If the author has specified a font family, use that. If
      not, use my font family (over the UA's default), or
   b) Always use my font family over the author's specified
      font family or UA default font family.

Netscape 4.73 allows me a little more control: The choice of
two font families: one for fixed-width fonts and one for 
variable width fonts. I don't really know how the UA distinguishes
the two (it can be done in CSS, but I don't know how it works
in the HTML FONT element case).
