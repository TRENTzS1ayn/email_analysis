No. Here's why:

1) Some events cause no change in the UI. For example, an executed
script
   that does a calculation and changes content but does not change the
UI.

2) Other events cause changes to the UI. Since those changes are obvious
   to a user of the native UI, we don't require the UA to provide
   redundant indication of the change in the UI.

3) We require that all events be broadcast through an API. 

4) We make accessibility requirements on the UI, such as checkpoint
   1.5, which requires that messages have text equivalents in the UI
   that may be used by ATs. 

5) No, we are not requiring that ATs do anything.
