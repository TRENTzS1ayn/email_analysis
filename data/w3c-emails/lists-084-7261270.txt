An event that doesn't cause a change need not be notified - I am thinking
about changes to the document (am I on the right tram here?).

A change to the UI may not be obvious to somebody using a serial access mode
on a large document (50 characters opf braille doesn't give a very big
picture of 90 lines of document. And the UA guidelines are a fair bit longer
than 90 lines, as is the checklist.

  No. Here's why:
  
  1) Some events cause no change in the UI. For example, an executed
  script
     that does a calculation and changes content but does not change the
  UI.
  
  2) Other events cause changes to the UI. Since those changes are obvious
     to a user of the native UI, we don't require the UA to provide
     redundant indication of the change in the UI.
  
  3) We require that all events be broadcast through an API. 
  
  4) We make accessibility requirements on the UI, such as checkpoint
     1.5, which requires that messages have text equivalents in the UI
     that may be used by ATs. 
  
  5) No, we are not requiring that ATs do anything.
