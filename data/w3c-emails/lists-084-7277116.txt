Charles,
My understanding is that 9.3 is about controlling the style or type of 
notification of a viewport or content change. If I switch the focus to a 
different frame, how does the border window indicate the frame with 
focus.  If a script changes the rendered content, does the user agent 
automatically scroll the changed content into the current view port.  These 
are the types of issues this checkpoint is designed to cover.

This checkpoint has a pretty weak techniques section.  It needs to improve!

Jon
