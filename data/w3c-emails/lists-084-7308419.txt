I believe we have clearly chosen to move away from the offscreen
model world, and our DOM and other standard API requirements state
so clearly. Do we need to say more?

In the 7 July Guidelines (and other versions) we say at the end of 1.2: 

<BLOCKQUOTE>
So that desktop browsers can make information available 
to assistive technologies, they must communicate through
standard interfaces. An architecture that makes possible 
programmatic access to content and the user interface will
benefit assistive technologies, scripting tools, and 
automated test engines. It will also promote software 
modularity and reuse.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Furthermore, we say in section 1.7 (Conformance:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Note: These guidelines aim to make conforming user agents
accessible. This includes the accessibility of the user 
agent's user interface in addition to the accessibility 
of Web content. When used in conjunction with assistive 
technology, conforming user agents are expected to be
accessible to most users with disabilities; in some cases,
accessibility is "completed" by the use of an assistive technology.
Some user agents may not conform to these guidelines but still be
accessible to some users with disabilities.
By following the principles of this document,
developers of all user agents (not just conforming user
agents) should improve the accessibility of their products.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Should we state that we expect ATs to implement the
standard interfaces required by the document?

In Guideline 5, we state:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Using interoperable APIs and following system c
onventions increases predictability for users
and for developers of assistive technologies.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

We might also say something there.

I don't think we need to add anything to the document,
but we could make an additional statement if the WG
wishes.
