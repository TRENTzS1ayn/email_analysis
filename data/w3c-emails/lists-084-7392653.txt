Discussion

  Consensus in the WG that this is a good thing! <grin>

0. Glossaries

HB: I'm preparing a merged glossary from all 3 Guidelines.

1.Issue 257: Proposed checkpoint 10.4
     
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0135.html

  /* Ian reviews two axes for 10.4 and 10.5 */

  GR: I think that having a minimal set is a bad idea.

  IJ: Note that the proposal for 10.4 is to say:
   a) You must allow the user to override all default bindings
   b) You must support at least this set of (20) bindings.
   c) Single key ok and double key minimal. (Make this for keyboard).

  KB: Note that even if not configurable, must be keyboard accessible.

  GR: If we are going to set a baseline for functionalities is
      to look at the definition of HTML conforming UA.

  Resolved for 10.4:
   1) Override UA default config
   2) No requirement to override system conventional bindings.
   3) Baseline set of functionalities as suggested by JG.
      (part of next issue).
   4) Baseline configurability for keyboard: single key or
      system modifiers plus single key (note about sticky keys here).
   5) Add cross-ref to 1.3.

2.Issue 257: Use the same set of functions in 10.4 as the minimal set 
  of functions in checkpoint 10.5 and make 10.5 only about the keyboard
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0126.html

  About 10.5:

  1) Proposal: Make this checkpoint only about the keyboard.
     This makes "one key press" easier to explain. The idea
     is that this requirement is really about someone who has
     issues with keyboard actuation.

     10.5 Allow the user to configure the user agent so 
          that the user's [preferred one-key operations]
          may be activated with a single key.

     EH: If you happen to be accessing the Web via telephone,
     what about then? 

     GR: Or through a mobile device.

     JG: People could be using a bat keyboard (you type in chords).
 
     EH: If the UA is operating on a super-small device, what
     happens?
 
     JG: We don't have examples of mobile devices yet in our
     techniques.

     IJ: Refer to definition of single command: single key
       w.r.t. a mode.

     EH: Why is this different from a hierarchical set of
       menus?

     GR: Opera has a forms mode.

     MQ: Alt-F enters "File mode".
 
     EH: This is like the topic of multimedia - you don't know
     where it stops. I think we should focus on a standard condition
     for user agent operation - typical desktop operation. I think
     this is the basic intent.

     IJ: Sticky keys would be the same: that's two strokes.

     IJ: Sounds to me like the following DO NOT meet single key
     requirement:
      - Sticky keys
      - Key combinations
      - Special modes (e.g., form navigation mode, file menu mode)
      - We're not going to worry about small keyboards (with 
        few keys).

     GR: We need to ensure that programmers understand that we're not
     talking about key codes, but key strokes.

     EH: So yes, we are talking about key presses, not characters.

  2) Should the set of functionalities be the same as for 10.4?

    IJ: I hesitate due to the potential size of the set.
    GR: I have concerns if some essential functionalities 
        (the list of 20).

   Proposed: 
     - Checkpoint 10.5 is only about the keyboard.
     - Binding requirement: single key press. 
     - Set of functionalities: at least the "list of 20",
       up to the set for which the UA has default keyboard bindings.
     - Configurability: user needs to be able to have N single
       key bindings.
 
     IJ: What is the size of N?
     GR: Depends in part on the number of keys available. 
     TL: It's difficult to define "N" when you don't know the
         devices and parameters. 
        1) First of all, the interface has to be keyboard accessible.
        2) What you can do with a keyboard you should be able to
           remap, without interfering with the OS.
        3) List of 20 fine with me.
        4) If you go beyond the list of 20, you get into parameters
           that depend on device, character set, etc.
     HB: There is also the mnemonics that differ according to
         natural language.
     TL: You can find out the range of "N" at run-time.
     GR: Warning: Accessibilty reqs still important when you use
         software not in your native language: we need to take into
         account I18N.
     
   Resolved: 
     - Checkpoint 10.5 is only about the keyboard.
     - Binding requirement: single key press. 
     - Set of functionalities: at least the "list of 20",
       up to the set for which the UA has default keyboard bindings.
     - Configurability: user needs to be able to use "most" single
       keys available on their keyboard. (Add Note about why we don't
       say how many: I18N conditions to consider, also keyboard
       device considerations).
     - 10.4 is a special case of 10.5 and here's way:

  Action IJ: Incorporate in next draft.a

3.Issue 308: Definition of "single command"
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0134.html

  IJ: 
   a) I think that we don't need it.
   b) I think that it's hard to define.
   c) Having similar (but different) terms with "single" is confusing.
   d) I propose that we don't use it.

  Resolved: Don't use "single command". 

  Action IJ: Incorporate in next draft.a

4.Issue 290: Understanding the phrase "turn on/off"
  http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#290
  (and Issue 287: Proposed clarification to checkpoints 3.3, 3.5, 3.6 )
  http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#287

  IJ: Axes
   1) Level of control: Global v. element-level.
   2) Configuration v. Control.
   3) On-load v. once-loaded.
  
  IJ: I think G3 is about Global, Configuration, On-load.

  GR: G3 and G4 need to cross-reference each other. I think
  there's a difference between blinking an animated.

  IJ: For a requirement not to render audio, is our G4 requirement
  over global volume sufficient?

  GR: Most UAs don't let you control bgsound independently.

  Resolved:
    - Guideline three will be about Global, Configuration, On-load.
    - Adopt Ian's proposal in principle
     
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0022.html
    - Add a sound checkpoint to G3 (not play on load all audio).

  Action IJ: Incorporate in next draft.a

10.Issue 296: Proposed to add "control" to checkpoints 4.2 (font 
  family), and 4.3/4.4 (colors).
  http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#296

  IJ: Retracted. 
  IJ: Refer to new proposal:
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0157.html

  JG: Once you've imposed your preferred colors, for example,
  there's not a compelling accessibility argument to have 
  dynamic control.

  IJ: Second part of proposal was to increase requirements
  on 8.2, 8.3, 4.13, and 4.14.

  GR: Note that global configuration to override author
  styles need to take into account other checkpoints (e.g.,
  selection highlighting must remain distinguishable
  if the user imposes a global text foreground color).
 
  EH: Element-level control could be a non-P1 requirement.

  Resolved:
   - Adopt Ian's proposal
     http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0157.html
   - Increase requirements of 8.2, 8.3, 4.13, and 4.14: to color, font
     characteristics (which ones?) and something else.
