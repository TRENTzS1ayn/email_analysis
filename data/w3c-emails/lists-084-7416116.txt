Resolutions

    1.Resolved 10.4: Minimal requirement is the user to override default 
input bindings, default command bindings need to include a minimal set of 
functions
      (applicability applies), do not need to allow override of system 
keyboard bindings, and for keyboard bindings must provide modifiers and a 
single key or better

    2.Resolved 10.5: Same as 10.4, but only about the keyboard and require 
a single keypress, number of keys available for single key must be most.

    3.Resolved Issue 308: Based on resolution of 10.4 and 10.5 we do not 
used this term

    4.Resolved Issue 290: Understanding the phrase "turn on/off" and Issue 
287: Proposed clarification to checkpoints 3.3, 3.5, 3.6 (on/off video, 
blink, etc.):
      Guideline 3 is about global configuration of rendering a type of 
content on load and Guideline 4 is about control of things that are rendered

    5.Resolved Issue 296: Proposed to add "control" to checkpoints 4.2 
(font family), and 4.3/4.4 (colors).
      Do not need "control" for 4.2 and 4.3/4.4, configuration is sufficient
      Global changing for all elements, do not need to allow element by 
element control
      Control and configuration is needed for font size
      For 4.13, 4.14, 8.2 and 8.3 need to add explicit requirements for 
configuratio of font family, font size and colors.

    6.Resolved Issue 297: Style v. content and background sounds.
      Add checkpoint for sound played on load for next working draft in 
guideline 3
