Eric,

Thank you for taking the time to construct this compelling missive!
I wouldn't have expected any "less" from you. <wink>. I've
included the email in its entirety after my signature.

I have some comments and questions about some of your
more salient points:

1) Primary content is "content (meaning #1)
   that is intended for people without any disability 
   who are operating under standard conditions." One thing I like
   about this definition is that the content's format doesn't 
   matter. Text can be primary content and a video can be 
   alternative content.

2) Distinguishing primary from alternative content sheds
   light on some (WCAG) requirements on authors. For example,
   I agree that there should not be a P1 requirement to
   provide a text equivalent for another (non-text) 
   equivalent.

3) For reference, here's Eric's revised WCAG checkpoint 1.1:
    "Ensure that every non-text element that, 
     under standard conditions, would result in primary 
     content has a text equivalent [Priority 1]."

Comments and questions:

1) Are the only types of content primary and alternative?
   Your definitions suggest that this is the case. What
   is the default when there are no stylistic or semantic
   indications (in a spec or in metadata) to distinguish
   primary from alternative content? I think that in 
   the absence of style and semantic information, you 
   have to consider generic XML content either entirely
   primary or entirely alternative. Either case is 
   problematic. 

2) I have a problem with this reformulation of 1.1. Content is
   primary based (in part) on author's intention. Your 
   formulation of 1.1 suggests that content could become
   primary independently of the author's intention, just
   based on the user side conditions. If content that 
   started primary doesn't end up primary, what is it?
   If primary is established from the author's vantage 
   point, it sounds like it's either primary or it's not,
   independent of the user's operating conditions.

3) What about alternatives of alternatives? Suppose I
   use nested OBJECT elements in HTML to say "Include
   this video, or if not, this image, or if not this
   other image, or if not this text." Is the first
   image only an alternative? Or is it a primary in
   some other context (having two alternatives)?
   The author has intended the image to be an
   alternative (in some sense) and therefore would
   not be required to provide a text equivalent.
   There may be shades of primary. 
   Would that be confusing?

Basically, I would like to try to keep the notion of
primary content but I want it to only make sense from the
author's point of view. Does the model still work if 
primary content is always primary content and there's
no WCAG 1.1 requirement for text equivalents
for content that "results in primary content"? In other
words, the author has to provide a text equivalent for
any non-text primary content. Why does that break?
The assumptions about standard conditions and available
technology are good ones, but can they be constrained
to the author's side and the author's determination
of what is primary content?

I don't think that the user agent should be required to 
recognize content as being primary, but the user agent
must be able to recognize alternatives; these are peer 
alternatives. Why should the user know what is primary
(notably when what is most important to the user may
not be primary to the author)? Does it benefit the
user in any way to know what's primary? 

Your proposed checkpoint 2.1b for UAAG requires user
agents to "make avilable all primary content as well
as all W3C-required equivalents". Is there any need
to single out the primary content? 

[By the way, Dan Connolly has said that we blew it
by calling two pieces of content "equivalent" if 
their relationship is not symmetric. As Eric points out,
the equivalence relationship is often imperfect and 
one-directional. Would we be better off using a term like 
"text alternative" with the understanding that the
text alternative is supposed to fulfill the same 
function?]

I have to think more about all of this. I think
there are some very interesting points in your proposal,
but I'm having trouble with blurring the lines between
author's intent and the user environment.

Cheers,

  - Ian

> ====
> 
> Problem 3: An Endless Development Loop
> 
> Our current approach appears to require alternative content for all content,
> which results in an endless loop. (I don't think that it was intended.) For
> example, under the current phrasing, WCAG checkpoint 1.1 ("Provide a text
> equivalent for every non-text element...") may put the Web content developer
> into an endless development loop. Suppose that we have multimedia
> presentation (mmp1). We need to provide auditory descriptions (synchronized
> with the auditory track), captions (visually-displayed-text equivalent that
> is synchronized with the visual/auditory tracks), and a collated text
> transcript capable of being output visually, auditorily, and tactilely (via
> Braille). Yet when we play mmp1 with some combination of auditory
> descriptions, captions, and collated text transcript, that constitutes
> another multimedia presentation which we will call simply "mmp2" (actually
> it may constitute even more than one multimedia presentation). Now because
> mmp2 is a multimedia presentation, it needs auditory descriptions, captions,
> and collated text transcript, which are more complicated than those of mmp1,
> since, for example, the audio is more complicated due to auditory
> descriptions and the visual track is more complex due to captions. The
> process continues to mmp3 an so on _ad infinitum_.
> 
> One obvious way to prevent getting caught in such an endless loop is to
> clarify by saying that Web content developers _only_ have to develop
> accessible "alternative content" for "primary content" that is inaccessible.
> 
> 
> Problem 2: Failure to acknowledge or respect the content author's _intent_
> in determining whether content is considered "primary" or "alternative".
> 
> The guideline documents express some allegiance to understanding the
> "function" of content (see the definition of "Equivalent"), but fails to
> acknowledge the important role of the _Web content author_ in designating
> the function of content. For example, at a minimum, the Web content author
> ought to be able to designate whether a specific content element will serve
> to produce "primary content" or "alternative content". My criticism may seem

> an assumption.
> 
> Yet, let us consider an example in which that assumption is incorrect.
> Suppose that the Web content author has developed an instructional module
> that teaches the role of various accessibility-related elements (prerecorded
> auditory descriptions, renditions of text equivalents, renditions of
> linearized tables, etc.). The developer wants to show examples of each of
> the elements and he wants the examples to be available for all users (both
> with and without disabilities). In this case he should be able to show
> accessibility elements (e.g., visually displayed "alt-text", visually
> displayed longdesc file contents, prerecorded auditory descriptions,
> captions, visually displayed collated text transcripts, etc.) and designate
> them as _primary content_. Under my proposed definitions, any of these that
> are non-text elements (meaning that they _cannot_ be sensibly rendered as
> visually displayed text, synthesized speech, and Braille) must have a text
> equivalent provided since they are primary content. Almost all of these
> probably already have text equivalents and so do not need them added. But
> let us assume that the auditory description lacks a text equivalent and a
> text equivalent (e.g., text transcript) must be provided. 
> 
> Unfortunately, there is no standardized machine-readable way for a Web
> content author to make a claim about which content is "primary" and which is
> "alternative". Sometimes I wonder whether the current WAI guideline
> documents tend to incorrectly assume that the key to the distinction between
> primary and alternative content lies in component type (e.g., primary =
> multimedia presentation; alternative = captions, auditory descriptions,
> collated text transcript) rather than in the specific communication purposes
> of content, for which the stated intent of the Web content author would be a
> highly relevant clue.
> 
> Benefit 1: Fits with regulatory emphasis on comparability between people
> with disabilities and people without disabilities.
> 
> Benefit 2: Fits with definition of Equivalent.
> 
> Please note that this definition fits perfectly with the definition of
> "equivalent" in WCAG 1.0, which also uses persons without any disability as
> a reference point:
> 
> Content is equivalent to other content when both fulfill essentially the
> same function or purpose upon presentation to the user. In the context of
> this document, the equivalent must fulfill essentially the same function for
> the person with a disability (at least insofar as is feasible, given the
> nature of the disability and the state of technology), as the primary
> content does for the _person without any disability_. (from the definition
> of Equivalent, emphasis added)
> 
> I would point out that there is a huge benefit it the conceptual simplicity
> of having two important terms -- "equivalent" and "primary content" --
> clearly linked in this way. Conversely, I think that failure to link the
> terms in such a clear way injects "noise" into the conceptual framework.
> 
> Benefit 3: Reinforces the Unidirectional Relationship Between "Original"
> Content and Its Equivalents
> 
> Please note that the distinction between primary and alternative content
> builds upon and reinforces the "unidirectional" relationships between the
> two pieces of content in the "equivalency" relationship. In most situations,
> the original content will be primary content (i.e., for people without any
> disability) and the equivalents will be alternative content (i.e., for
> people with a disability). It is important to keep in mind that if content A
> is an equivalent for content B, then that does not necessary mean that
> content B is an equivalent for content B. (If I am correct, cases in which
> the relationship would be true in both directions are generally trivial or
> very rare.)

> SUMMARY OF BENEFITS

> I believe that adopting the main suggestion this memo will significantly
