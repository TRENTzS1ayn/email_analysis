Hello,

Checkpoint 10.8 of the 7 July UA Guidelines [1] reads:

    10.8 Ensure that the default input configuration allows 
         easy activation of frequently used functionalities. 
         [Priority 3] 

In considering the minimal requirements for this checkpoint
we can break it down into two parts:

1) The set of "frequently used functionalities".
2) The definition of "easy activation".

This checkpoint does not make any requirements about
the size of the default input configuration (i.e., how
many bindings must be offered).

In light of resolutions from yesterday's teleconference [2]
related to checkpoints 10.4 and 10.5, I'd like to propose
that checkpoint 10.8 be modified as follows:

  <NEW>
    10.8 Ensure that the default input configuration includes
         bindings for the following functionalities (subject
         to applicability considerations): [insert modified
         list of 20 [3] here] [PRIORITY 2]
  </NEW>

Notes:

1) Since the checkpoint only talks about the list of functionalities,
   and the list of 20 is also the minimal list for two other 
   priority 2 checkpoints (10.4 and 10.5), I propose that we 
   elevate 10.8 to a Priority 2 checkpoint. This modification allows us
   to cross reference 10.8 from 10.4 and 10.5 for the list of 20 
   functionalities.

2) I have removed the part about "easy access" in the reformulation. 
   This is because checkpoints 10.4 and 10.5 (as resolved yesterday) 
   impose a limit on binding complexity in the case of the keyboard 
   (modifiers plus single key or single key alone). Checkpoint 10.4
   does not impose a binding complexity limit for other types of
   input, however.

3) This proposal supersedes a previous proposal I sent about 10.8 [4].

In short:

1) We gain for the keyboard, requiring easy access at a P2 level
   (by combining 10.4, 10.5, and 10.8).

2) We lose a P3 requirement for easy access for other input 
   modes (e.g., voice, graphical user interface). 

Another option is to make this change and include a P3 checkpoint
(essentially the old 10.8) for input modes other than the keyboard. 
However, I don't think that this is necessary because just requiring
the "list of 20 functionalities" in the default UA input configuration
is probably a pretty good guarantee that they will be readily available
(i.e., not buried).
