Hello,

I've published the 28 July 2000 UA Guidelines [1] and
Techniques [2] documents (refer to the list of changes [3],
which have been quoted below). 

The issues list [4] and Determining Conformance
to the UA Guidelines [5] are up to date. The latter indicates
which checkpoints have not yet had their minimal requirements
finalized; it is based on an earlier draft, but corresponds
closely in checkpoint numbering to this draft.

I implemented Eric's proposed multimedia definitions in this
draft, but did not yet re-read the document to see whether
all the terms are used consistently in the document (This
is on my todo list).

I incorporated some editorial changes that are also on the
issues list but are so benign that I incorporated them in
this draft. These are:

  a) Rewrote checkpoint 7.2 to try to clarify.
  b) Added a statement to the definition of active element
     about when elements may be inactive
  c) Added a note to checkpoint 8.8 to clarify that it's about
     semantics, not rendering.

Happy reading,

 - Ian

CHANGES:

Versions WD-UAAG10-20000728 and WD-UAAG10-TECHS-20000728

  General changes

     * The word "presentation" is no longer used to mean rendering.
     * Added Tim Lacy to active list of WG participants.

  Changes to Guidelines

     * Guideline 1: Added some information to rationale based on [7]G1
       comments from Eric Hansen.
     * Guideline 3: Made some changes to prose of guideline to account
       for [8]proposal to make G3 about global configuration only. Added
       cross references from checkpoints in G3 to checkpoints in G4.
       Refer to resolution at [9]27 July teleconference.

  Changes to Checkpoints

     * 2.6: Added a Note that this is a repair checkpoint.
     * 3.2: New. Added per [10]27 July teleconference.
     * 3.1, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5: Now about configuration to not render
globally
       per [11]27 July teleconference.
     * Edited Also, deleted the applicability part (about using font
       families) based on a [12]4.1 request from CMN.
     * 4.9: Volume control of synchronized sources. Refer to resolution
       of [13]13 July teleconference.

after
       checkpoint.
     * 8.2, 8.3: Rewritten to make sense for a set of links (not just a
       single link) and to make the minimal rendering reqs per the
[19]27
       July teleconference.
     * 8.8: Added a note that this checkpoint is only about semantics,
       not presentation (refer to [20]issue 301).
     * 10.4: Modified per [21]27 July teleconference. Note: The
       checkpoint does not refer to a minimal list of functionalities
yet
       since there is a [22]proposal for changing 10.8.

       teleconference. Also added requirement that default focus
       highlight be different from default selection highlight

  Changes to Glossary

     * To definition of active element, added a sentence about elements
       that are sometimes inactive (refer to [25]issue 298).
     * Added a paragraph about "levels of configuration/control" to
those
       defintions.
     * Implemented [26]Eric's multimedia terms. However, I did not
review
       the impact of this change in the document.

  Changes to References

     * Added WEBCHAR for terminology.

  Changes to Techniques

   While there were a few changes to the techniques document, they are
   not really worth documenting.
