I would add to the list of active elements anything with an event trigger.

Div is a container element in HTML.

in SVG use and image are effectively container elements, and text can be.

  Hello,
  
  As part of determining the minimal requirement [1]
  for checkpoint 7.6 (navigation to important elements),
  I sent a proposal [2] to include a list of the important
  elements for known languages (e.g., HTML, SMIL) 
  in the Guidelines (though it may be more appropriate to
  have markup language specific information in the Techniques
  document). Here is a first draft at lists for HTML, SMIL, and SVG.
  
  For HTML (drawing from the HTML 4.01 table of elements [3]):
  
    a) Active elements: A, INPUT, BUTTON, OPTION, TEXTAREA
    c) Headers: H1-H6
    d) Frames: FRAME, NOFRAMES
    e) Container elements: FIELDSET, OPTGROUP
    f) TABLE, FORM, P, ADDRESS
  
   Question: Should media objects be included (OBJECT, IMG)?
             What about lists? DIV?
  
  For SMIL  (drawing from the SMIL 1.0 DTD [4])
  
    a) Active elements: a, anchor
    b) Container elements: par, seq, switch
  
   Question: Should media objects be included?
  
  For SVG (drawing from the 29 June SVG Draft DTD [5]):
    a) Active elements: a
    b) Grouping element: g
  
   Question: Should shapes be included (e.g., rect, circle, etc.)?
  
  For MathML [6]?
  
  Comments welcome (and I expect there will be some),
  
   - Ian
  
  P.S. This proposal is pertinent to checkpoints
       7.6, 7.7, and 8.4 in the 7 July 2000 draft [7].
