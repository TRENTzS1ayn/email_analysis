8.1 Make available to the user the author-specified purpose of each table 
and the relationships among the table cells and headers. [Priority 1]

Original:

Note: For example, provide information about table headers, how headers 
relate to cells, table summary information, cell position information, 
table dimensions, etc. Graphical user agents may satisfy this checkpoint by 
rendering a table as a two dimensional grid and by ensuring that users can 
find headers associated with cells. Refer also to checkpoint 5.3.
Note: This checkpoint is an important special case of checkpoint 2.1.

Proposed expansion:

Note: For example, for tables of data with meaning beyond the immediate 
context,
provide an explicit caption to identify the table purpose. The more complex
the table, the more clues to table structure are needed. Provide other
information summarizing table structure, including any table head and foot 
rows,
and possible row grouping into multiple tbody, colgroups, head cells, how they
relate to data cells, the grouping and spanning of rows and columns that
apply to qualify any cell value,  cell position information, table dimensions,
etc. Graphical user agents may satisfy this checkpoint by rendering a table
as a two dimensional grid and by ensuring that users can find headers
associated with cells. In HTML, XHTML, or other XML applications using that
table model, use any author-supplied axis lists of idrefs to the cell axis
to set a category of axes. and headers attribute values to supply
author-designated HTML thead and tfoot information from being repeated when
deriving non-visual representation of long tbody contents from a screen
representation, where the thead and tfoot contents are static, with whatever
vertical space is left for tbody scrolling. Refer also to checkpoint 5.3.
Note: This checkpoint is an important special case of checkpoint 2.1.
