  Review of 28 July Guidelines

   No comments on [12]28 July Guidelines

     [12] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2000/08/WD-UAAG10-20000728/

  [13]Issue 298: Inactive elements

     [13] http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#298

   IJ: What happens when an element becomes in active? Proposed adding a
   statement that at times certain active elements may become in active
   (ie. not part of tabbing order).

   Resolved: Definition of active element should include clarification
   about situations where active elements are inactive.

  [14]Issue 300: Proposed edits to checkpoints about link information
(8.6,
  8.7)

     [14] http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#300

   Resolved: Delete checkpoint 8.7 per [15]proposal from Ian.

     [15]
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0067.html

   IJ: resource size requirement may require HTTP request.

   IJ: propose provide resource size

   IJ: add a clarification of the meaning of follow a link

   EH: If a resource has been retrieved wouldn't the browser know the
   size.

   IJ: Does IE save that information, size information?

   TL: would need to check

   EH: Are we tied to a specific implementation? What about the day when
   movies are common?

   IJ: This is a html centric view.

   EH: Is there some command, a pre-query that could pick up the size .

   IJ: I believe with http you can do that.

   IJ: I would be okay not deleting size and clarify it in techniques.

   Action IJ: Re-propose 8.6 to clarify note (to be informative) that
   retrieving resources is not required. (Propose leaving size, move
note
   into check point and in techniques talk about "the head method" Add a
   note that author defined stuff is not definitive.

   TL: Knowledge base article on how head method is used to test broken
   links. Open URL call, from DOM

  [16]Issue 301: Clarification about meaning of checkpoint 8.8 (focus /
  selection)

     [16] http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#301

   IJ: State clearly that this is about semantics.

   Resolved: Adopt [17]proposal from Ian.

     [17]
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0068.html

  [18]Issue 304: Change percentage back to proportion.

     [18] http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#304

   Resolved: Change back to proportion and indicate in note or
techniques
   that you can use percentage per [19]proposal from Ian.

     [19]
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0068.html

  [20]Issue 305: What is definition of "stalled"

     [20] http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#305

   IJ: How do you define stalled. IT is some kind of TCP/IP error

   TL: Time out based thing

   HB: is it presumed that stalled always resumes?

   TL: in http transfer it fires an "i'm done" there is not much
   robustness in terms of restarting a connection. To my knowledge http
   transfers not recoverable.

   Action Tim: Send a list of possible failure modes and reword of 9.4
to
   include a generalization of failure modes and consider that this may
   refer to resources that are included recursively.

   IJ: what kind of indication is required when some of the referenced
   resources are not retrieved. There should be some indication that
some
   resources are not available.

   EJ: if you have a page with movies, should it indicate that the
movies
   are

  [21]Issue 306: Does requirement for relative position of a viewport
include
  horizontal position?

     [21] http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#306

   Resolved: include horizontal position per [22]proposal from Ian.

     [22]
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0068.html

  [23]Issue 307: General advice about implementation of optional
features of a
  specification.

     [23] http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#307

   IJ: if a spec has an optional feature to it, (ie. a user agent not
   required to implement) and there is a risk that this feature could
   pose an accessibility problem. we should say that users should be
able
   to turn off this feature. Add a note to 6.1

   Resolved: tell developers to implement features accessibility, or
   provide a way for users to turn it off optional features if there is
a
   chance that the feature will not be accessible. Refer to [24]original
   proposal from Ian.

     [24]
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0068.html

   Still on call: Dick, Harvey, Ian, Rich, Kitch

  [25]Issue 307: For those checkpoints which talk about sets of
elements,
  provide definitive set for html?

     [25] http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear.html#307

   IJ: What are the important elements? If we know what they are for
html
   we should just say it. Sent a list of 16 or so elements. To meet 7.6
   need to provide navigation to these elements.

   RS: What about new standards coming out?

   IJ: should we be listing these for known mark up? Should this be in
   guidelines or techniques?

   RS: Probably should be in techniques

   IJ: We need to make clear in the guidelines that the list is
   available. You should be able to know what to do to conform with only
   the guidelines. If it is a normative list it should be in the
   guidelines.

   RS: Include in minimal requirements.

   IJ: The minimal requirements are no longer separate from the
   checkpoints.

   IJ: everyone should review list of important elements

   Resolved: include definitive list in techniques and link to it from
   guidelines. Refer to [26]list proposed by Ian. Account for proposed
   additions in list.

     [26]
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2000JulSep/0187.html

   Action IJ: In next draft include this list in the techniques
document.
