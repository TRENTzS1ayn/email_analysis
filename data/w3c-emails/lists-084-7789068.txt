I believe that the lists are at least as important as the paragraphs.
So I'd include both the containers and individual items:
     <dl> and its <dt> and <dd>,
     <ol> and its <li>
     <ul> and its <li>.
Lists are one of the ways to make accessible text alternatives for
otherwise inscrutable tables.
