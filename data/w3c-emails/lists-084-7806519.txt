perhaps we should consider content to be all content and allow content to be
rendered according to the mode needs of the user this way, all ppossible
renderings of content could be chosen from and we would not have to figure
out for the user which is the prefered content.  code doesn't distinguish
this.  all we should need to do then is provide a mechanism where users can
choose what they want from among the various content elements for a
particular piece of content.
