JRG: My feeling is that adding accessibility features to an existing 
product through some type of service pack installation is an acceptable and 
important way to improve accessibility and potentially claim 
conformance.  In this case any claim to conformance must clearly state what 
service pack releases or plug-ins must be installed with the product.

New versions of the product though should install the "accessibility" 
service pack features or plug-ins as part of the standard 
installation.  Accessibility features may not be enabled in the default 
configuration, but the user would not be dependent on installing a service 
pack or plug-in to get the accessibility features.  Accessibility features 
should be designed with the thought of improving the usability of the user 
agent for all users, so any new features for accessibility should help 
people without disabilities. Including the accessibility features in the 
standard installation is very important in public access sites, like 
educational and library settings, where the user may not have operating 
system permissions to install service packs or plug-ins or even understand 
that this needs to be done to get accessibility features.

Of course new and improved accessibility features can be part of updates, 
plug-ins and service packs, but if the user agent already conforms then the 
new and improved features will probably not affect the conformance of the 
user agent.
