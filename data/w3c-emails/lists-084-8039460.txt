How does this work for checkpoint 1.1: 

   1.1 Ensure that every functionality available 
       through the user interface is also available 
       through every input API implemented by the 
       user agent.

This checkpoint is requiring capabilities that may not be intended
for users without any disabilitly. The user interface is meant
for users, and this checkpoint is designed for communication with
other software, which a UA may not do otherwise. The same goes
for the DOM checkpoints; this document requires an implementation
of the DOM, whether or not the UA already chose to implement the
DOM for all users.

[snipped more good stuff]

Doesn't this contradict the checkpoints such as 1.1 that require
communication for the purpose of interaction with ATs?

Yes.

Yes.

[snipped]

I would like to remove the explicit list from the guidelines and
move to techniques in some form if your expression of applicability
can be improved after discussion.

Yes, this makes sense.

I don't agree here. I think that we can use the term (which we use
elsewhere in the document, so why avoid it here?), which links to
a definition.

I think I agree with this. See my other comments on conformance [1]

Ok.

yes.
