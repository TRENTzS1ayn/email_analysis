I talked to Denis Anson this weekend about the conformance issues discussed 
at the last UA telecon.  His first reaction is that he doesn't see a 
problem with developers using add-ins or other supplementary techniques for 
a product to conform to the UA document, as long as they are clearly 
documented.  I am going to raise this issue with the coordination group 
tomorrow to get additional input for the group to consider.

Some of my additional thoughts/questions:
1. We have said for other issues that people can do something poorly 
(usually a usability problem), but still conform to the guidelines.  This 
may be another case where ideally (from my perspective) accessibility 
features required for conformance should be part of the standard 
configuration.  If a developer chooses not to include any or all 
accessibility features as part of the standard configuration, but does 
provide and document other components needed for compliance that would seem 
to technical satisfy the conformance requirements.

2. My biggest concern is the issue of universal design, where features for 
people with disabilities are considered different than for other 
people.  The more general approach to a conformance statement seems 
sanction the different type of thinking.  I am not sure if is the purpose 
of the UA group to promote the universal design approach to accessibility 
or just accessibility in any form.

In any case I will raise this issue for discussion with the CG group.
