Judy,
I would like to include the discussion of a topic that was discussed in the 
last UA telecon.  It relates to conformance to the UA guidelines.  In 
trying to resolve issue 294: "Native support and downloadable 
modules".  The discussion centers on the issue of whether accessibility 
features needed for conformance to the UA guidelines need to be part of the 
default configuration or the developer can claim conformance through use of 
additional modules that are installed separately.  The specification of 
additional modules would need to be part of any conformance claim.

Some working group members feel that while it is desirable for the default 
configuration to conform, it shouldn't be required of a developer.  The 
developer would though need to provide and document carefully the modules 
that are needed to conform to the UA guidelines.

Other working group members are concerned with the more general conformance 
approach, since it maybe difficult for users with disabilities to obtain or 
understand that additional modules are needed or even available to improve 
accessibility.  In secure public computing sites like libraries or 
educational settings it may require technical expertise or network 
permissions to get modules loaded.  These issues though could be considered 
technical details for improving accessibility.

I am interested in the CG thoughts and how other working groups have dealt 
with similar issues.

Thanks,
Jon
