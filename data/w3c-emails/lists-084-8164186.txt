AG::

The Web Content Guidelines group applied the broader approach to
conformance at times when they justified decisions by saying "It works with
Lynx, and Lynx is available free, so that is good enough."  It is not
necessary that the user have to expend zero effort to make the solution
work.  In "reasonable accomodation," 'reasonable' cuts both ways.  It is
not necessary for the UA builder to go to inordinate lengths to remove the
last iota of consumer difficulty.
