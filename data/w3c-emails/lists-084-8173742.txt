I discussed Issue 294 related to using modules for satisfying conformance 
requirements in the CG meeting today.  Len Kasday and Al Gilman felt that 
the use of modules for conformance purposes was OK, as long as the modules 
are named in any conformance statement.  Of course they would prefer to see 
it as part of the standard installation.

I suggest that we resolve this issue by adopting the proposal to allow 
developers to conform to the UA guidelines using a combination of user 
agent modules and that the specification of the combination of modules be a 
required part of the conformance statement.  The details of where the 
modules come from do not need to be a part of the requirement (i.e. CD-ROM, 
Web, Disk).  I think that there should be additional verbage to encourage 
developers to make accessibility features part of the standard installation 
of the product.

The authoring tools working group has already adopted this approach in 
their conformance statement for the authoring tools guidelines, so we would 
be consistent with they specifications for conformance.
