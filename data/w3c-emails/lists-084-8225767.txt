IJ: Yes, I agree:

1) Anyone can make a claim.
2) Each claim must identify product or plug-in version. Each claim
   should provide information about where to get those components.
3) User agent developers should make available user agents whose
features
   allow conformance with little or no extra effort from the user beyond
   standard installation.

To bolster point three, we could define a profile that people could
name in a conformance claim. For instance, suppose that one conformance
profile is "Level Double-A Default Installation" which means that
if you install the software following the default settings, you will
get a Double-A conforming UA. There may be other profiles that interest
people (e.g., Level-A when used with this speech synthesizer) but
I would not propose trying to standardize too many. If people are
most interested in knowing whether the UA will conform out of the box,
would we make it easier on people to provide them with a known profile?

EH: I also agree. I have a few other suggestions that I hope to make later.

IJ: Thanks Jon!

EH: Yes, thanks!
