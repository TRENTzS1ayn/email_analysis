Unless there is further comment to the list regarding the proposed wording 
for checkpoint 7.2, the following wording will be added to the next draft 
of the guidelines:

   7.2  For each state in a viewport's browsing history, restore
    the point of regard associated with that state when the user
    returns to it in the viewport.
