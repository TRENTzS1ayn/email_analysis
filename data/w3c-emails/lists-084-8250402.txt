Unless there is further comment to the list regarding the proposed wording 
for checkpoint 8.6, the following wording will be added to the next draft 
of the guidelines:

     8.6 To help the user decide whether to traverse a link,
     make available the following information about it:
     link content, link title, whether the link is
     internal to the local resource, whether the user has
     traversed the link recently, whether traversing it
     may involve a fee, and information about the type, size,
     and natural language of linked Web resources. The user
     agent is not required to compute or make
     available information that requires retrieval
     of linked Web resources.
