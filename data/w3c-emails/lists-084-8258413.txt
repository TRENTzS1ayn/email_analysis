Unless there is further comment to the list regarding the proposed wording 
for checkpoint 2.3 the following wording will be added to the next draft of 
the guidelines:

2.3 If content available in a viewport has equivalent alternatives,
    provide easy access to the alternative equivalents
    through at least one of the following mechanisms:
     - Allowing configuration to render alternative
       instead of primary content.
     - Allowing configuration to render alternative in addition to
       primary content.
     - Providing a direct link to the alternative in content,
       just before or after the primary content.
     - Allowing the user to select the primary content and then
       inspect its alternatives.
