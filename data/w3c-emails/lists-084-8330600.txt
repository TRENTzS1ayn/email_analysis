I would go further to say that this is an editorial clarification
and I will add it to the next draft (with a note that the WG has
not confirmed this proposal). Since we have not specified to date
which particular level of WCAG conformance is required, it follows
that the minimal level is WCAG Level-A. 

If there is any opposition to Level-A being the minimal level
of conformance for this checkpoint, please speak up.
