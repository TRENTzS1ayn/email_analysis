Well, I would vote for a relative priority as used in ATAG. It seems odd to
have a triple-A tool where the documentation has removed the absolute
barriers, but not the significant impediments, to using the documentation.

  I would go further to say that this is an editorial clarification
  and I will add it to the next draft (with a note that the WG has
  not confirmed this proposal). Since we have not specified to date
  which particular level of WCAG conformance is required, it follows
  that the minimal level is WCAG Level-A. 
  
  If there is any opposition to Level-A being the minimal level
  of conformance for this checkpoint, please speak up.
