I have two comments:

1) I think Eric's proposal is a clarification of the current
implications
   of checkpoint 11.1. Therefore, I think it can be incorporated as
   an editorial change.

2) I think Charles' comment raises a new issue for this checkpoint.
   We have had two previous issues about relative priority 
   checkpoints (Issue 267 [1] for checkpoint 11.2 and Issue 111 [2]
   for checkpoint 6.1). 

   In both of those cases, we did not choose a relative priority
   scheme and both checkpoints remained P1. For checkpoint 6.1,
   it was felt that authors would never use P3 features unless
   UAs supported them. And for checkpoint 11.2, it was felt that
   knowing about UA features that promote accessibility
   (whatever their priority) was critical to using the tool.
  
   Checkpoint 11.1 is slightly different; it's about the
   documentation itself, not features being supported or
   documented. 

   I understand Charles' point, and I could live with a relative
   priority checkpoint here. However, I would prefer just leaving
   it a Level-A requirement and keeping the document simpler.
   I would not be in favor of choosing Level Double-A just because
   it's in the middle.
