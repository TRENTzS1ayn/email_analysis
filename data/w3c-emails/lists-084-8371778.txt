Hi Eric,

I will address those points not mentioned below separately.

I will try to take the following comments into account in the upcoming
draft:

Your suggestion 4 was considered at one point. We did not include
a checkpoint for the following reasons:

1) Support for basic presentation features affects all users, therefore,
   it's not a requirement for an accessible user agent.

2) We do require conformance to implemented specifications, and those
   specifications say what to do in the way of presentation,
interaction,
   etc.
