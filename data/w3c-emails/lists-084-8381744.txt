Actually I would propose having three checkpoints. it is Priority 1 to have
documentation that meets level-A of WCAG. It is Priority 2 to meet
double-A. and so on. (That's all relative priorities are, but if they are the
only one it is simpler to make it three checkpoints I suspect.)

  I have two comments:
  
  1) I think Eric's proposal is a clarification of the current
  implications
     of checkpoint 11.1. Therefore, I think it can be incorporated as
     an editorial change.
  
  2) I think Charles' comment raises a new issue for this checkpoint.
     We have had two previous issues about relative priority 
     checkpoints (Issue 267 [1] for checkpoint 11.2 and Issue 111 [2]
     for checkpoint 6.1). 
  
     In both of those cases, we did not choose a relative priority
     scheme and both checkpoints remained P1. For checkpoint 6.1,
     it was felt that authors would never use P3 features unless
     UAs supported them. And for checkpoint 11.2, it was felt that
     knowing about UA features that promote accessibility
     (whatever their priority) was critical to using the tool.
    
     Checkpoint 11.1 is slightly different; it's about the
     documentation itself, not features being supported or
     documented. 
  
     I understand Charles' point, and I could live with a relative
     priority checkpoint here. However, I would prefer just leaving
     it a Level-A requirement and keeping the document simpler.
     I would not be in favor of choosing Level Double-A just because
     it's in the middle.
