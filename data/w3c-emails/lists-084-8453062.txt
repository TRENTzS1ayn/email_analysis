How about the following relative expression of the checkpoint:

  Provide a version of the product documentation that 
  conforms to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 
  1.0 [WCAG10]. [Priority 1 for Level A conformance, Priority 2
  for Level Double-A conformance, Priority 3 for Level Triple-A
  conformance.]

1) This isn't too long or complicated.
2) The implication is that if you want to be a level Double-A
   conforming UA, your documentation has to conform to WCAG 1.0
   level A. If you want to be a Triple-AAA UA, your documentation
   has to be Triple-AAA WCAG.

   I think that the real implication there is that there will
   never be any Triple-AAA user agents...

3) The best documentation is no documentation (i.e., the
   user interface is so good you don't need any)!
