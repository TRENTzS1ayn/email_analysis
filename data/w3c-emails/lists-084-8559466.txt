My comments preceded by IJ:.

Eric, I'm surprised that you have focused on applicability this much.
I thought it was on the way out...

My primary concern with your comments is that they seem to change
significantly the intended scope of the document. Please bear in 
mind that this document does not attempt (nor has it ever attempted)
to include requirements for user agents so that a conforming user
agent on its own would meet the needs of all users with disabilities.
Some of your proposals below suggest to me that you wish it did include
these requirements. More details follow.

IJ: We require in the claim that you indicate how many checkpoints
    you consider don't apply. So we have accounted for this to a certain
    extent.

IJ: I don't consider that the possibility that someone might abuse the
guidelines in this way means that there's a problem with the Guidelines. 
We cannot design a document that is devious-proof.

IJ: That is interested. I am a little concerned that too many terms
will confuse people, but let's suppose that we have a single label 
for the case where all checkpoints are considered applicable.

IJ: Please refer to the new language in sections 3.2 and 3.3 of the
18 August draft and say whether you think that the text suffices.

IJ: We used to say "independent" and "dependent" user agent. We deleted
those terms when we decided to stop trying to craft a conformance
mechanism
to suit all user agent types. I am not convinced yet that this
distinction
is necessary. I'd rather consider user agents as modules, without
hierarchy
if possible.

IJ: I think it's a mistake to set a maximum number. I think it does
make sense to tell people that a bunch of inapplicable checkpoints is
a bad sign of ... applicability of the guidelines. Until the 18 August
draft, we had text to that effect. From the 28 July guidelines [1],
section 1.7:

   This document has been designed to promote the accessibility 
   of general-purpose graphical user agents. While many of the 
   principles set forth in this document apply to other classes 
   of user agents, including assistive technologies, many of the 
   checkpoints do not. As the number of applicable checkpoints 
   decreases for a piece of software, the likelihood increases 
   that the guidelines are not an accurate gauge of the accessibility
   of that piece of software.

I prefer this kind of warning to a hard and fast limit.

IJ: That is because we very consciously chose to avoid requiring this
type of
dependency in a conformance claim between one vendor and another. Our
recent discussions about claims address the "right" to make such a
claim, but we have in the past not wanted to "require" interdependencies
(even while the actual interoperability is a good and important thing.).
If this document is aimed at developers of general purpose user agents,
then they should not "suffer" because assistive technology developers
are not holding up their end of the "bargain", due to say, a business
decision. In short, we decoupled vendors intentionally, after getting
confirmation from assitive technology vendors that the DOM and
other standard interfaces did in fact meet their needs and they were
interested in requiring that those APIs be implemented. That is as
far as we wanted to go.

IJ: It may not be. However, we have chosen (so far) to not require
vendor
A's general purpose user agent conformance to depend (indeed, fluctuate)
based on the presence of, say, three interoperable products in the
market.
It is important that those products exist (otherwise we will have failed
in promoting accessibility). However, in terms of the *scope of this
document*, we have chosen not to include an interoperability
requirement.

IJ: But these are important to everyone! Why would a user agent not do
these things - its only purpose is to implement specifications for
these content types.

I don't believe that it is based no our checkpoint 6.2 that requires 
conformance to applicable W3C specifications: markup, style, graphics,
etc.
What more would you wish to say than this?

IJ: I would STRONGLY (read: STRONGLY) object to adding these as
checkpoints to the document at this time. You are, in essence, asking
that a general purpose user agent (the focus of this document) also
be a specialized user agent for all of the functional limitations you
cite.
That would be an ENORMOUS change in the document, and inappropriate at
this
stage of the document's development. 

I would not object at all at including this or similar text as
informative
material to educate readers, i.e., to explain that this is the goal
of the sum of software that a user may require for access. However, many
of these functionalities exceed the scope of this document.

suggested. Please explain why this should be added.

IJ: I thought you were going to say that the "role" was, for instance,
graphical user agent, SVG viewer, SMIL player, etc. That would be
useful, and perhaps even important to consumers to understant.

IJ: Why does it matter to count a user agent as a single user agent?
I don't want to get into the implementation details of the fact that
emacs may be implemented by a server and a client, for instance.
