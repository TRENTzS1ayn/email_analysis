I think the simplest requirement is to go for WCAG double-A conformance for
documentation as a Priority 1 requirement. I think a slightly more elegant
solution, and one that may be even easier to defend, is the proposal outlined
by Ian. So my preference is to adopt Ian's proposal, or failing that to adopt
Jon's.

Note that I do not believe that there won't be anything meeting triple-A,
although I don't think that we will see one next week (sadly). If making a
triple-A tool were not something that can and should be done, there would not
be much point working to specify it.

  How about the following relative expression of the checkpoint:
  
    Provide a version of the product documentation that 
    conforms to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 
    1.0 [WCAG10]. [Priority 1 for Level A conformance, Priority 2
    for Level Double-A conformance, Priority 3 for Level Triple-A
    conformance.]
  
  1) This isn't too long or complicated.
  2) The implication is that if you want to be a level Double-A
     conforming UA, your documentation has to conform to WCAG 1.0
     level A. If you want to be a Triple-AAA UA, your documentation
     has to be Triple-AAA WCAG.
  
     I think that the real implication there is that there will
     never be any Triple-AAA user agents...
  
  3) The best documentation is no documentation (i.e., the
     user interface is so good you don't need any)!
