Small editorial suggestion.

Old (18 August 2000):

Recognize 
A user agent is said to recognize a piece of information when the user agent
developer has designed it to handle that information. A user agent clearly
recognizes those features of markup or style languages that it implements
and the semantics of the user interface controls that it provides. User
agents may not understand everything the author has encoded in content, such
as the semantics of XML elements unknown to the user agent, whether the text
and title of a link accurately describe the linked resource, or whether a
script is calculating a factorial. A user agent does not recognize
everything that a script does, even though it may implement the scripting
language. However, it will recognize some information encoded in scripts,
such as code to open a viewport or retrieve a resource from the Web. The
Techniques document [UAAG10-TECHS] lists some markup known to affect
accessibility that should be recognized by user agents. 

New: 

Same as Old except remove the word "clearly" from the second sentence.
