Eric,
There is a difference between a user agent being accessible to a person 
with a particular type of disability and conforming to the guidelines.  The 
guidelines are designed to make technologies more accessible out of the box 
and provide a means for assistive technologies to access the 
functionalities of the assistive technology.  The group has spent a lot of 
time on this issue and been over ALL of the arguments and issues that you 
have raised below. The consensus of the group is the current conformance 
statement.  For more severe disabilities assistive technologies are often 
required and it was the consensus of the group that:

1. User agents must provide accessibility for the input and output 
modalities they support.
2. User agents must be compatible with assistive technologies for 
modalities they do not support.

For people that can use the input and output modalities supported by the 
user agent then a conforming user agent should be more accessible to 
them.  For people with disabilities who cannot use the native input and/or 
output modalities of the user agent must support assistive technologies to 
provide access to the functionalities of the user agent.  Therefore many 
people will only be able to use a conforming user agent with an assistive 
technology.  There is no requirement that a user agent developer show that 
they are compatible with a particular assistive technology.  The line is 
drawn in the sand, through conformance, that they have done there part in 
making their product accessible through assistive technologies.  It is up 
to AT developers to do their part to use the features of the conforming 
user agent to provide alternative input and output capabilities.

The group has spent a considerable amount of time on the conformance issue 
and unless new information is brought to the group, we will not open it up 
for discussion.
