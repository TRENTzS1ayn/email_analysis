Hello,

Checkpoint 7.5 of the 18 August Guidelines [1] begins:

    7.5 Allow the user to search for rendered text content, 
        including rendered text equivalents. 

The definition of "rendered content" is "that part of content
rendered in a given viewport (whether visual, audio, or tactile)."
This definition limits severely what type of search would
be required through an audio viewport since there is very little
content rendered aurally at any given moment.

To fix this problem, I'd like to propose a model that seems
to work for both two-dimensional and one-dimensional viewports:
  a) A viewport does not reveal all rendered content at once.
  b) The search requirement is for content that is rendered 
     through the viewport, even though that content may not
     be available in the user's point of regard.

I don't have a proposal for new wording yet. Perhaps it is sufficient
to add such a clarification in a Note after the checkpoint.

Thanks,

 - Ian
