Ian,
One comment in suggestion 1 is that there is a hope by many of the
participants of the working group that current assistive technologies will
try to conform.  This would allow assistive technologies to work in
combination with other assistive technologies to create "new" assistive
technologies.  We will have to wait and see if this really happens, but I
would not want the guidelines to insinuate that they are not for assistive
technologies.  Newer assistive technolgies are being built around DOM
technologies and will make it easier for ATs to conform, since this is
usually their biggest concern.

Jon
