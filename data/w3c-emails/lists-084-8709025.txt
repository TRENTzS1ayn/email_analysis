Yes, if I understand what you mean.

The short explanation is:

1) This document is not meant for ATs, it's meant for graphical
user agents intended to work with ATs.

2) This document does not prevent AT developers from claiming
conformance.
But based on the requirements of the document and what we heard from
AT developers (e.g., about implementing the DOM) that's unlikely to
happen.
