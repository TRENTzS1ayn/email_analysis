Ian's summary seems accurate.

I would like to emphasize that many of the issues, including some of those
not cited by Ian in his summary were partially, if not fully addressed by
making clear that the scope of the "the subject of each checkpoint is the
subject of the claim" (whether that subject be a composite or singular user
agent). This goes a long way in resolving what I perceive as ambiguity of
the meaning of terms like "user interface" in very key checkpoints such as
checkpoints 1.1 ("1.1 Ensure that every functionality available through the
user interface is also available through every input API implemented by the
user agent.") and 2.1 ("2.1 Make all content available through the user
interface. [Priority 1]"). For example, it was not clear to me, and might
not be to other readers, whether the user interface of the braille or speech
output devices were to be included as part of the user interface being
referred to. This clarification will help people understand that the user
interface being referred to is that of the subject of the claim rather than
that of the assistive technology (unless of course some assistive technology
is part of the claim and adheres to UAAG checkpoints).

This clarification makes a much clearer boundary between (a) the user agent
that is the subject of the claim and (b) assistive technologies.
