Ian,

One option to make applicability clearer would be to add an applicability 
clause to checkpoints in section 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4.  For example:

[CURRENT]
Checkpoint 4.1 Allow the user to configure and control the reference size 
of text with an option to override author-specified user agent default text 
size. Make available the range of system font sizes.
[/CURRENT]

[NEW]
Checkpoint 4.1 If user agent supports graphical rendering of content, allow 
the user to configure and control the reference size of text with an option 
to override author-specified user agent default text size. Make available 
the range of system font sizes.
[/NEW]

The main disadvantage of this is increasing the length of the checkpoint.

I think we had considered this option a long time ago with these types of 
checkpoints, what do you think about this approach now?
