Ian,

One concern I have about checkpoint 7.5 is that renderings of text elements 
(including text equivalents) do not necessarily look like "text" (i.e., text 
characters).

For example, our tacit if not explicit definition of a text element as 
something that can be rendered and understood in three modes: 
visually-displayed text, synthesized speech, and braille.

But that is only a MINIMUM REQUIREMENT for a text element. In a fourth or 
higher mode it could be displayed as virtually anything (text, a graphic, a 
movie, an animation, or virtually anything, etc.). Conversely, an element 
(i.e., parcel of pre-rendering content) that is a non-text element (i.e., 
fails to render properly in any of the three modes), might actually be 
readily displayed visually (or otherwise) as text characters.

My understanding of the term "text content" is that this is pre-rendering 
content. We really ought to clarify what we mean by "text content" (or 
"non-text content") in this document. We have not discussed, to my 
knowledge, whether the term "text content" is an assertion that it is 
composed of one or more "text elements" (possibly including text 
equivalents). My inclination is to assume that non-text content is composed 
of one or more non-text elements and that text content is composed on one or 
more text elements, keeping in mind that "text element" denotes tri-modal 
(at a minimum) sensible output.

I am not sure that the phrase "rendered as text characters" is too limiting 
or not when we consider written languages such as Chinese.

<NEW BY ERIC>
7.5 Allow the user to search text content that is rendered as text 
characters. The search must [or should?] encompass all text within the 
viewport, both inside and outside the point of regard. Allow the user to 
start a forward search from a location in content selected or focused by the 
user. After a match, allow searching from location of the match. Provide a 
case-insensitive search option when applicable to the natural language of 
text. [Priority 2]

Add to Techniques:

1) When the point of regard depends on time (e.g., an audio
viewport), the user must be able to search through
content that _will be_ available through that viewport. This
is analogous to content rendered graphically that is
reachable by scrolling.

2) The user must be allowed to search among rendered
text equivalents that are presented as text characters, as these are part of 
rendered text content.

Thanks!

serial   renderings]

Hello,

Here's a proposed new checkpoint for 7.5:

<NEW>
   7.5 Allow the user to search within all rendered text content
       accessible through a viewport, including rendered
       text content outside the point of regard.
       Allow the user to start a forward search from a location
       in content selected or focused by the user.
       After a match, allow searching from location of the
       match. Provide a case-insensitive search option when
       applicable to the natural language of text. [Priority 2]
</NEW>

Add to Techniques:

1) When the point of regard depends on time (e.g., an audio
viewport), the user must be able to search through
content that will be available through that viewport. This
is analogous to content rendered graphically that is
reachable by scrolling.

2) The user must be allowed to search among rendered
text equivalents, as these are part of rendered text
content.
