The minimum requirements for checkpoint 9.3, a priority 3 checkpoint, have 
been moved to other checkpoints and therefore I resolve that we remove the 
checkpoint in the next working draft.  If you have a proposed minimum 
requirement for this checkpoint that is not already part of another 
checkpoint, please send it to the list.  We also have a very weak 
techniques section for this checkpoint.
