The group has always stated that many types of scripting behaviors cannot 
be recognized by the user agent.  The timing of a presentation through 
scripting based timer functions and manipulation of the content is a 
behavior that cannot usually be recognized by a user agent.  To make this 
clear in the document Ian has updated the glossary definition for recognize 
and will be adding a statement in the techniques document.
