AG::

It is not clear that such a change would be an improvement.  

'Prompt' is used to good effect in 9.2.  Substituting 'notify' here would,
in all probability, decrease the likelihood that readers understand this
point.  The language in 9.2 is clear and says the right thing as of the 18
August Draft.  

If we wish to reduce the variety of terms used in this area, then in 3.8
replace the phrase

"indicate when the user has not yet refreshed content."

with

"notify when new content is available, based on the automatic update
schedule."

But, in guideline 1.5 it helps to use a variety of terms because the reader
may only recognize one of these as describing their case, but the rule
applies to a broader category than is indicated by any single term in
common use.
