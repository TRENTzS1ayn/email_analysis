I think that I agree with Eric's assessment about the
relationship between 2.5/2.6 and WCAG 1.1. I am not sure about adding
"recognized" in front of "non-text content" since we would end up
saying "recognized video" or "recognized captions" everywhere. This, to
me, is still an editorial issue: include "recognized" in every
checkpoint,
or factor it out? I am favorable to stating once in the applicability
section (which means we could/should remove "recognize" from each
checkpoint's
text).
