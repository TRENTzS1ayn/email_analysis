JRG: The note needs to be changed, since the alt="" could also saying that 
the image is redundant with another image.  For example, when a single 
visual image is constructed of a set of samller images.  One of the images 
could specify the alt text and the others would not need to be 
identified.  Suggested change:

Note: Authors may provide an empty text equivalent (e.g., alt="") when one 
is required by specification, in this case the alt information is redundant 
with information from another image. Please refer to the Web Content 
Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 [WCAG10] for more details. Refer also to 
checkpoint 2.5.

Techniques for checkpoint 2.6"

JRG: I think we can move the word redundant to the applicability section.
