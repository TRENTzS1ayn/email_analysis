Hello,

I realize that this issue may be reopened based on comments
from Al Gilman [1]. However, I would like to propose adding
to the list currently in the 18 August guidelines [2] the 
following elements:

1) APPLET (since we included IMG and OBJECT)
2) LINK (when it's rendered, since it may behave like the A element).
3) IFRAME (in addition to FRAME and NOFRAMES).

 _ Ian
