Hello,

The UAAG 1.0 includes requirements to slow video, audio, and
animations (checkpoint 4.5 of 18 August Guidelines [1]). For
an implementation report, and in support of our decision to
choose the detailed minimal requirements that we did, I would
like to document any software currently supporting this feature.

Thank you,

 _ Ian
