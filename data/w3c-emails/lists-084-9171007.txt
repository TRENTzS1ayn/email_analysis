Hello,

Please consider the following editorial changes 
(reference: the 18 August Guidelines [1])

1) Delete the following sentence from checkpoint 1.1:

   "The device-independence required by this checkpoint 
    applies to the functionalities described by the other 
    checkpoints in this document (e.g., installation, 
    documentation, user agent user interface configuration, 
    etc.)."

  Comments:
   a) The intent is redundant with the first sentence of
      the checkpoint.
   b) This could be edited and moved to the note after
      the checkpoint: device independence is implicit
      in all the other checkpoints since covered in 1.1.

2) Delete the word "device" from checkpoint 1.2:

    1.2 Use the standard input and output <DEL>device</DEL> 
        APIs of the operating system. Do not bypass the standard output
        APIs when rendering information.

   The resolution to issue 255 [2] for this checkpoint reads:
    "Use the standard input and output APIs of the operating system."

3) Change second sentence of checkpoint 1.3 to talk about when 
   checkpoint doesn't apply rather than when it does:

   <OLD>
   This checkpoint always applies on systems with a standard 
   keyboard API.
   </OLD>
   
  <NEW>
  This checkpoint does not apply when the operating system does not
  have a standard keyboard API
  </NEW>

4) Clarify statement in section 3.8 on user interface by default:

  While the following paragraph is true:
 
  "Each checkpoint requirement must be satisfied by making 
   information or functionalities available through the user 
   agent's user interface unless the checkpoint explicitly 
   states that the requirement must be met by making information
   available through an Application Programming Interface (API)."

  it would be more precise to add "These checkpoints are labeled
  'checkpoints for communication with other software.'"
