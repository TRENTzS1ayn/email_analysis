HB: I like that, but would edit: "start, stop, pause, resume, fast advance, 
and
fast reverse content that is audio, video, or animations, or several of these."

HB: Note: Stop interrupts either fast advance or fast reverse. A useful
side-effect during the fast motion is the audio and/or video flash-by, 
since significant clues to position are recognizable, even though the 
detail is not.

HB: I have recent experience with the convenience of fast backing up and
going forward within a song as well as stepping forward and back song-to-song
in an audio CD. I can do this both with a portable CD player, and with the
PC software Audioplayer 32, that simulates that interface. Both show
song number, and once started playing the time from start of song.
Both provide fast slew within a song, in either direction. So does my
hardware CD player.

HB: I made a crib-sheet identified all the start times within each song 
where I
had a part, and the words there.

HB: While memorizing the parts I needed to sing, I'd regularly slew to the
desired start time, listen (and sing), then slew back to that start time.
I'd repeat this process within a song till I knew my part, only listening
to that small segment I was learning.

HB: The VCR-type controls imply a linear medium. Stopping before finished 
works,
but it is a nuisance to accurately position. I do not believe the intent of the
WG was to only consider linear medium.

HB: Continuing my experience above, I also had an audio tape of just the songs
we were learning. I had no track and time from start indicators in my car. I
found I could use fast forward and rewind, guessing the time, using as an aid
the fast audio, and repositioning by "counting the seconds" at the fast rewind
rate to position for repeating a segment.

HB: The CD example of being able to select a particular song track is more
convenient than if it were limited to the linear medium, either VCR-type or
audio tape.
