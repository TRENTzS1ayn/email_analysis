editoprial question I think. I presume you mean a standard API for a
keyboard, rather than an API for a standard keyboard. It might be argued that
my mobile phone doesn't have a "standard keyboard" but I presume there is in
fact an API following some kind of standard for the keyboard it dfoes
have. (The browser on it is a WAP browser by phone.com, who I believe have
since changed their names.) In order to switch it to voice input/output I
would need to be able to use the input and output APIs with appropriate
assistive technology. Technically it should be perfectly feasible, but I am
not sure if the required APIs can be accessed except in pre-shipped
hardware. An intersting case is the Ericsson range of mobile phones which
must provide some kind of API for input at least, since they sell a keyboard
that can be plugged in.

Cheers
