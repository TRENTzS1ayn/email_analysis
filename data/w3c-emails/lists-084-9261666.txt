A patent was recently issued on a method for (among other things) scanning 
web pages by voice.  Details are on the www-voice list:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-voice/2000JulSep/0015.html

I'm the inventor.   AT&T (who was my employer when I did the work) holds 
the rights.    The AT&T rep to w3c, Lorrie Cranor, and I coordinated so 
you're getting just this one posting here.

Please post any general discussion, when appropriate, to the 
www-voice@w3.org list to keep in in one place.  (That's the public list, 
not the wg list).

(Note: you'll need to subscribe to www-voice for your posting to be 
accepted.  Instructions from http://www.w3.org/Voice/ are as follows:

    To subscribe send an email to  www-voice-request@w3.org with the word 
subscribe in the subject line
    (include the word unsubscribe if you want to unsubscribe)
