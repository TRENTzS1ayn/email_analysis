It is my opinion that we need a structured navigation checkpoint.
We have merged a number of past checkpoints into this one and removing
it would leave a gap in the spec. I think that your proposal of
removing the list of elements is reasonable, but other checkpoints
(7.7 configuration of 7.6, and 8.4 outline) depend on this list as
part of their minimal requirements. We would have to rework the
lot of them.
