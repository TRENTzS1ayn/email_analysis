Hello,

I got motivated today and have published the 1 September 2000
UAAG 1.0 Guidelines [1] and Techniques [2]. The primary changes 
since the 18 August draft were:

a) Edits to applicability
b) Deletion of old checkpoint 9.3
c) Edits to checkpoints 10.4, 10.5, and 10.8 to
   incorporate required default bindings.
d) Checkpoint 11.1 requires WCAG 2.0 Level Double-A conformance
e) Added some requirements to checkpoint 4.12 for support of
   speech synth properties
   
The full list of changes [3] has been updated and is quoted below.
