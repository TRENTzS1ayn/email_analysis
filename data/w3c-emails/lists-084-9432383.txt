I understand that adding requirements for the implementation of 
audio, graphics, and video would be consistent with the direction
we've been moving and would allow us to delete another applicability
provision. Considering your comments below from a different angle:

a) We clearly want the document to apply to user agents that 
   render both visual and audio information. 

b) Would we be satisfied with audio rendering alone or visual
   rendering alone? I am inclined to say yes to both of these 
   cases, as long as information is available to assistive 
   technologies and the claim states which checkpoints are considered
   inapplicable. 


Suppose that the user agent does not have a graphical
user interface and only renders audio content. The following
checkpoints would not apply: part of 2.4, 3.1, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.9,
4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, part of 4.5 and 4.6, 4.7, and 10.9.
This means that 12 full checkpoints and parts of 2 checkpoints 
would not apply out of 81 total checkpoints (around 15%). 

Suppose that the user agent does not handle audio. The
following checkpoints would not apply: part of 2.4, 3.2,
part of 4.5 and 4.6, 4.8, and 4.9. 
   
In both cases, add three more inapplicable checkpoints 
if the UA doesn't do speech synthesis.

This is not the definitive list of inapplicable checkpoints,
but I conclude after a cursory review that we've done a pretty
good job at organizing the document and designing requirements
that are independent of content type except when content type
is part of the requirement. I also think that when more than
80% of the checkpoints apply, that's good enough to be a useful
indication of the applicability of the document to the subject
of the claim.

We have not spent much time discussing tactile rendering. I don't
think we would object to a claim of conformance by a user agent
that offered a tactile rendering and user interface in conjunction
with either audio or visual rendering, or both. I don't think 
we intended to allow conformance by a user agent that offered only
tactile rendering, even if the user agent implemented the DOM.

False.

First, there is no need for an explicit statement that the checkpoints
in question are applicable because all checkpoints are applicable
by default. From section 3.4:

     At each conformance level, the user agent must satisfy 
     each checkpoint required for that level unless:

Four applicability exceptions follow, but I don't believe the DOM
to fall under any of them. Thus, the user agent must satisfy the
checkpoints of guideline 5. The DOM API must be implemented for 
access to all content, however the rest of the (composite) user 
agent is implemented (as modules).

False.

True.

Now show me the completed checklist that indicates which checkpoints
you consider that the text reader satisfies or helps to sastisfy.

What specifications does text reader implement? Does it communicate
with other software? Does it have a user interface? Does it have
documentation? Is it configurable? As long as these questions apply
to the component, then I believe the requirements apply as well.

Here's another way to ask the question: Should we have a document
that allows Lynx to conform (providing that Lynx implements the DOM)?

Yes. Refer to previous UA evaluations [1]: IE, Amaya, HPR,
HAL+IE/NS/Opera,
NN, PWWebSpeak, and RealPlayer.

As we wrote then:

  "This review will help us correct weak points of the 
   guidelines and fill in gaps where required."
