JRG: The working group has discussed this issue and it is not the intention 
of the working group to exclude any user agent.  I believe the statement is 
to read as that the group wanted to be sure that graphical user agents are 
thoroughly covered by the document.  I don't think we need this restriction 
or has the group decided to do so.

JRG: Right no rendering media is required, so a voice or Braille browser 
could conform to the document.

JRG: In previous e-mails I have said that the group has not decided to make 
media specific guidelines.

JRG: The guidelines are intended to provide a line in the sand for 
developers.  If you do this your technology will be compatible with AT 
developers.  We have had meetings and participation with AT developers who 
have agreed to the line in the sand.  The basic precept is that for the 
input and output modalities that a user agent supports directly that they 
must do so in an accessible way.  For other modalities, they must be 
compatible with assistive technologies.

JRG: False.  If you do not export the DOM, you cannot comply.

JRG: No.  Any claim must support implementing and exporting the DOM.  There 
will always be disabilities that will require some type of assistive 
technology that is very specialized.

JRG: Yes, they must satisify the applicable checkpoints and provide 
accessible interface to other assistive technologies.

JRG: One of the goals of the guidelines was to NOT require user agent 
developers to do this, at least not for conformance purposes.  Mainstream 
developers just need to do there part to claim conformance and if I am 
understanding you question for graphical user agents this means begin 
compatible with voice, braille and other assistive technologies based on 
the requirements in the guidelines document (line in the sand the 
guidelines draw).
