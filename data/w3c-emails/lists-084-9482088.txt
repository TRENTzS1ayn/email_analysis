As we move closer to last call we will want to put together a list of 
invited reviewers and start contacting them to get a commitment to review 
the document.  An initial list based on our previous last call reviewers 
can be found at:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2000/09/reviewers-last-call-2.html

Please review this list and comment on any information that needs updating 
or additional reviewers we would like to add.  Please send comments to the 
list.

Thanks,
Jon
