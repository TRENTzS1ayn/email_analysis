  JRG: The working group has discussed this issue and it is not the intention 
  of the working group to exclude any user agent.  I believe the statement is 
  to read as that the group wanted to be sure that graphical user agents are 
  thoroughly covered by the document.  I don't think we need this restriction 
  or has the group decided to do so.
  

CMN I agree with Jon here.

  JRG: The guidelines are intended to provide a line in the sand for 
  developers.  If you do this your technology will be compatible with AT 
  developers.  We have had meetings and participation with AT developers who 
  have agreed to the line in the sand.  The basic precept is that for the 
  input and output modalities that a user agent supports directly that they 
  must do so in an accessible way.  For other modalities, they must be 
  compatible with assistive technologies.

  JRG: False.  If you do not export the DOM, you cannot comply.
  
CMN: Actually I think it is true that a given component need not export the
DOM so long as the composite agent does.

  JRG: No.  Any claim must support implementing and exporting the DOM.  There 
  will always be disabilities that will require some type of assistive 
  technology that is very specialized.
  
CMN I agree with Jon and Eric in the rest (aside from the open-ended bit,
which I haven't checked carefully yet.
