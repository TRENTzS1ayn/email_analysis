The Digital Talking Book Standards Committee has addressed a number of
issues for those user agents that expect to address digital talking books.

3. Reading at Variable Speeds

It should be possible to read the digital talking book at speeds that are 
faster than or slower than the normal listening rate. This variable speed 
feature is necessary to enable playback at a speed that is comfortable and 
efficient for a wide range of readers. Three times the normal "real-time" 
rate should be possible, and the slowest speed should be around 1/3 the 
real-time reading rate.

The device should offer the user the option of "Time-Scale Modification" 
(TSM), that is, the capability to maintain constant pitch while the 
playback speed is varied. This feature should be optional, however, so that 
the user can choose to have the pitch change as the playback speed changes. 
The TSM system should not produce audible chopping, burble, or 
reverberation and should not skip over significant units of sound at high 
playback speeds.
