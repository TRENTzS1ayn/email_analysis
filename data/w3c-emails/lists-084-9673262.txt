Judy Brewer is submitting charter renewals of most of the WAI groups for 
approval by the W3C advisory committee.  The user agent working groups 
charter will be one of the charters submitted for continuation.  Ian Jacobs 
has drafted a new charter based on a review by Judy Brewer and it is 
available at:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/charter-20000510.html

The most notable changes form the previous charter is the extension of the 
working group duration to October of 2002 and changes to the scope of the 
document.

Please review the document and send comments to the list of any concerns 
that you have.  The document will be forwarded to the advisory group within 
the week.
