Well, in audio the viewport is essentially defined by the point of regard. In
a braille system the viewport may be a little larger. In a graphic
screen-based system the viewport can be much larger (depending on things like
font size - for 60 point font there isn't a lot of space, but for 6 point

  Hello, 
  
  Checkpoint 9.1 in the 1 September draft [1] reads:
  
     9.1 Ensure that when the selection or content focus changes, 
         it is in a viewport after the change. [Priority 2]

  only. I have trouble making sense of this requirement for audio
  viewports. (What does "in" mean in that context?).
