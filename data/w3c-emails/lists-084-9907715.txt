I would just like to remind people of the extra UA telecon today at 1:30 
EST.  I would also like to make the following agenda changes:

1. Add to the discussion a proposed all W3C working group meeting in late 
February in Boston

2. Remove from discussion issue 315: definition of text and non-text.  It 
was resolved last week.

The updated agenda can be found at:
