I STRONGLY OPPOSE THIS PROPOSAL. The WG long ago chose not to include
a table navigation checkpoint and I don't believe that this issue should
be reopened at this point. Refer to issue 160 [1]

I don't like this ISO-HTML specific checkpoint. Why doesn't SVG have a
container
model? What is the "g" element? 

Can this just be a technique? Is there a URI to the ISO-HTML spec?
If a URI isn't available (or if the ISO spec costs money) I am not
excited about including it.

Ok.

We have already decided that this navigation mechanism is best handled
by
assistive technologies. I strongly object re-adding this requirement.
