36.JA: Review SMIL players to find out which ones support positioning of
captions.

Thanks to Goeff Freeed at WGBH, I found ONE!
Quicktime Pro ($40) - the user, through the use of an initial dialog box,
can drag all visible tracks anywhere in the player window. However, you must
download movie first, then you can manipulate the visible tracks.
