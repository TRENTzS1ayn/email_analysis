    1.WG: look for user agents that implement mouse events like mouse over
with the keyboard.

Latest HPR beta does not. HPR does provide the links that appear in the
menus, but not in the order in which they appear on the screen. for example
tabbing through links moves across menu buttons at the top of the screen,
when reaching the end of those, it then proceeds to read all of the pull
down menu items starting from the first item of the first menu. It reads all
of the pull down menu items from top to bottom from left to right. When
finished with pull downs, it then returns to reading viewable
(non-pull-down) links on the page.
