David, I am a developer with IBM on the HPR 3.0 project.  I assume
your
question is how we handle mouse over's on elements.

Microsoft IE 5.5 is our underlying technology.  If a sighted user
moves the
mouse
over a page element with mouse over javascript, the script will
execute.
However, we do not provide any special features which provide an
analogous capability to users who do not us a mouse.

Rgds, Kip Harris.

In the user agent guidelines working group of the w a i, we are
discussing guideline and checkpoint implementation.  we are looking
for information on how assistive technologies in this case if
implemented hpr3.0 handles scripts attached to elements?  if not,
please let us know?
for more information on this issue, please refer to:
http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#392
as you know, I cannot test this personally and I am sure we will all
know in a couple of weeks but we'd like to move forward with our
guidelines.

Thanks for any and all assistance.
