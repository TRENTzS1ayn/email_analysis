Greg,
In your comments [1] to the W3C user agent working group you suggested that 
checkpoint 7.3 should have stronger minimum requirements.  The working 
group also feels the same way and has struggled with this issue for a long 
time, but has not been able to come up with a better minimum requirement 
that we can reach consensus on. This issue is currently logged as issue 414 
[2].

The working group would like to consider any proposal you would like to 
make for changing the minimum requirement, otherwise the issue will be 
considered resolved with no change.

Look forward to hearing from you and thanks again for your comments,

Jon
