=============
Announcements
=============

DP: How does WCAG 2.0 affect us?

JG: Inclusion of accessibility features in other specs.

IJ: Early in process. One way will impact later: minimal
user agent requirements.

    1.Next User Agent face-to-face meeting in Boston on 1-2 March 2001

Discussion

    1.Update on glossary group formed in WCAG
    JG: Not much news.

    2.Update on joint meeting with DOM working group
    JG: Talked with Philippe Le H?garet about DOM and UAAG.
        Apparently a lot of what we want will not be in DOM 3
        (e.g., access to selection through DOM API). 
        PLH did think that accessibility features clauses could
        be included in the DOM spec, so we would need to develop
        them.

    3.Update on joint meeting with CSS working group
    JG: Ian and Bert Bos and Jon talked about CSS and UAAG.
    IJ: Some issues we discussed:
     - The UI module (actively being worked on).
     - The behavior module (not much going on there).
     - ACSS module (interest in with Voice WG, no one working on).
     - Style for selection/focus? (part of the UI module)
     - Increased conformance requirements 
            * Allow users to create user style sheets.
     - CSS object model? (not much awareness)
     - Documenting accessibility features of CSS3 in the CSS3 spec.

IJ: Note that final rule re: section 508 published today:
    http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/508standards.htm

=============
Issues
=============

IJ: Note that we only have five people here today.
JG: People may object to decisions, but they could have 
    attended the call.
 
4.Issue #415: Definition of active element: too broad (checkpoint 7.4)
    http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#415

IJ: Is the focus always used to identify active elements?

JG: There are two focus concepts - programming focus and event
    handling v. point of regard.

IJ: Is an active element one that may take focus?

JG: Note that selection is defined by user. Active elements
    are identified by authors.

IJ: I understand that in a general way, one way to interact
with the document is to copy selected text to the clipboard. That
is user interaction with the document.

Resolved:

 - No change. Selection is not used to identify active elements.

   Respond to reviewer that selection is not part of determining what
   an "active element" is, since the definition states that what
   constitutes an active element derives from the format
   specification. Selection is a user agent functionality, not defined
   by the format specification.  Another way to say this is that
   authors provide active elements, and what is active depends on
   format specs. That's different from what the user agent offers.

 OPTIONAL Action IJ: Put a note in the definition of active element
 that this does not include selection.

5.Issue #416: Add requirement: To select text with the keyboard?
    http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#416

Resolved:
  - No change. Selection is a functionality covered by checkpoints
    1.1 and 1.3. This is already in the techniques document.

  Action IJ: Include selection and focus in note after 1.1 as
  examples of what must be done.

6.Issue #417: Checkpoint 7.5: Add to min reqs to not start searching 
from beginning without alert
    http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#417

Resolved:
  - Add a min requirement to 7.5 (an edited version of the following):
    "If the user agent allows the search to wrap back to the beginning
     of content, alert the user before wrapping back."
  - Don't require prompting.

7.Issue #418: Checkpoint 7.5: Search should include alt text.
    http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#418

 - Resolved: No change.
   You don't want to search on "alt" text this unless 
   it's rendered, otherwise this will be disoriented 
   (this already discussed and built into current wording). 
   This is already stated in the techniques document.

EH: Is invisible/silent content considered rendered content?

JG: No. Don't want this to be part of search requirement.

IJ: Invisible and silent have effects on other content (as opposed
to 'display:none', which causes content not to be rendered at all).

Action IJ: Evaluate whether silent or invisible rendering has
an impact on checkpoints other than 7.5 (search).

8.Issue #419: Checkpoint 8.3: Recommend removing font as minimal 
requirement
    http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#419

Resolved: 
 - The highlighting of fee links is not temporary, it's a static
   rendering option (unlike selection and focus). The checkpoint says
   that a fee link is recognized through markup. There is no reflow
   necessary.
   
 - Per the face-to-face meeting, the default styling must not
   rely on color alone, must be different from the default styling
   of selection and focus, and must not differ from them in color
   alone.

9.Issue #420: Checkpoint 8.3: Add config requirement to prompt for 
confirmation when activating a fee link
    http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#420

JG: For form submission, the issue is disorientation. In this case,
you know that following the link will involve a fee (due to
highlighting requirement). 

IJ: There are authoring issues here: following a link confirms a
credit card purchase, but the user agent can't recognize that link as
such.

Resolution:
 - This a good idea to improve usability.
 - This issue (inadvertent payment) is not strictly an accessibility
   issue (everyone is subject to this problem).
 - The current highlighting requirements provide "warning" to the
   user, thus an additional prompting requirement is not considered
   necessary today by the WG. The WG will consider this in future 
   versions of the UAAG.
 - There are some authoring issues here in any case, and WCAG should
   include requirements related to inadvertent payments.
 - This is not a pervasive problem today on the Web in terms of
   *user agent responsibilities*, so not urgent to address 
   with a prompting requirement in UAAG 1.0.

10.Issue #421: Checkpoint 8.6: Clarification about intent required.
    http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#421

 JG: This checkpoint should be part of Guideline 5. 

 JG: Is there an accessibility dependency on selection?

 /* We couldn't come up with one */

 JG: Is there an accessibility dependency on focus?
     ATs rely on the focus. But I can't imagine a user
     agent that doesn't implement focus.

Resolved:
 - Move second sentence of 8.6 to Guideline 5 as a P1 requirement
   (already the case). Use wording consistent with checkpoint 5.8.

Proposed (but NOT resolved):

 - Delete requirement to implement selection as part of 8.6 
   (there are no accessibility requirements that rely on 
    selection).
   IJ: Note that, if implemented, other requirements related to
   selection apply.
