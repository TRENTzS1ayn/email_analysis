You can find HTML and PDF versions of an article describing
the access benefits of the transition to XML --see

Summary: 

The WWW is presently transitioning toward a data-centric architecture; content
-and its semantics- is encapsulated in XML ([W3C98]) pages designed to be
served in a manner most appropriate to a given client. This opens up
significant opportunities in generating high-quality spoken feedback from
richly encoded WWW content. Though XML is still in its early stages of
wide-spread adoption, some of the benefits to come can already be seen
today. Many sites now offer access to both presentational HTML, as well as the
underlying data. Examples include historical stock charts, driving directions,
and other useful information.

Emacspeak now exploits the availability of such semantically encoded content
to provide a richer end-user experience. This article introduces some of the
data acquisition techniques used in Emacspeak and focuses on the end-user
experience when interacting with such structured information.
