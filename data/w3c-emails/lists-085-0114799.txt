Why not provide a checkpoint at P2 that provides for more powerful methods of
navigation (my candidates would be backward sequential, page up, and page
down, with Lynx as the implementation example).

  Greg,
  In your comments [1] to the W3C user agent working group you suggested that
  checkpoint 7.3 should have stronger minimum requirements.  The working
  group also feels the same way and has struggled with this issue for a long
  time, but has not been able to come up with a better minimum requirement
  that we can reach consensus on. This issue is currently logged as issue 414
  [2].

  The working group would like to consider any proposal you would like to
  make for changing the minimum requirement, otherwise the issue will be
  considered resolved with no change.

  Look forward to hearing from you and thanks again for your comments,

  Jon
