as I originall read this it was for ui as well as content.  It seems
that it is only for content as Ian Pointed out to me so that being the
case, I'm not sure we can require p2.

Ian,
I like the new checkpoint.  How do you feel about making the
requirement to
conform to WCAG 1.0 at a P2 requirement.  I would use the same
argument for
P2 as the group used to make documentation conformance a P2 level.

Jon
