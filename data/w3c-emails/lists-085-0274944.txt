JRG: I don't think UAAG is that interested in notepad conforming, we are 
interested in user agents that render more complex documents.  If all that 
web browsers did was render text content this would be an issue, but since 
the technologies that we are interested (i.e. PDF and other variants) I 
suggest we need the higher standard of WCAG compliance that are applied to 
W3C specs.

JRG: I think what we would be saying is that the potential of the web 
should be at least double-A conformant content.  If user agents can only 
render single-A compliant information then the potential of the web is only 
single-A compliant content.  The potential of the web should be in my 
opinion triple-A compliant content, so the requirement to allow the 
rendering of at least one double-A compliant content language is a 
compromise between requiring single-A (impossible) and triple-A (easier to 
use).  I think the potential to access content that is not difficult 
(double-A) for people with disabilities is important and the argument used 
for at least one double-A conformant version of the documentation.
