It sounds to me like this line of reasoning places the
entire burden of ensuring support for WCAG-conformant content
on checkpoint 6.2. But there are lots of other checkpoints
(P1 through P3) that are there to support WCAG-conformant authoring.
Checkpoint 6.2 just says: To even get the ball rolling, the UA
has 
to implement formats capable of supporting accessible authoring
to begin with.

If we impose Level Double-A conformance to WCAG in checkpoint
6.2, that means that it will be impossible to create a UAAG
conforming browser for formats that only support Level-A
WCAG authoring. Suppose there were a WAI document entitled
"Format Accessibility Guidelines". There would be no
point in this document having a Level A conformance since no
user agent could do only Level A and conform to UAAG 1.0.
Since we don't have a "Format Accessibility Guidelines" today,
we are relying on an indirection, by saying "formats that
allow WCAG conformant authoring." This suggests strongly to
me that if we require WCAG Double-A conformance, then we
render meaningless WCAG's Level A, and I don't recommend that.

That's not what 6.2 says. 6.2 only talks about the potential
for accessibility. The other checkpoints for *actual content*
address issues of rendering, navigation, control of style, etc.
