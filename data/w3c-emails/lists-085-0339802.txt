Note:

I made some other changes so that the model works as a series
of successive filters. This was tricky for content labels,
which do not subtract checkpoints but add them. For the moment,
my "solution" is that by default, a well-formed claim indicates
"All" (same idea for input modalities). It's not ideal, but it
does mean that by default all checkpoints are in scope.
