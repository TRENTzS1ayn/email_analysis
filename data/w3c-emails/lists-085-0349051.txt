This line of reasoning says in fact that a double-A compliant browser must
implement specifications that allow double-A conformance to WCAG, but makes
no requirement at all to reach single-A, since the underlying checkpoint is
priority 2.

  It sounds to me like this line of reasoning places the
  entire burden of ensuring support for WCAG-conformant content
  on checkpoint 6.2. But there are lots of other checkpoints
  (P1 through P3) that are there to support WCAG-conformant authoring.
  Checkpoint 6.2 just says: To even get the ball rolling, the UA
  has
  to implement formats capable of supporting accessible authoring
  to begin with.

  If we impose Level Double-A conformance to WCAG in checkpoint
  6.2, that means that it will be impossible to create a UAAG
  conforming browser for formats that only support Level-A
  WCAG authoring. Suppose there were a WAI document entitled
  "Format Accessibility Guidelines". There would be no
  point in this document having a Level A conformance since no
  user agent could do only Level A and conform to UAAG 1.0.
  Since we don't have a "Format Accessibility Guidelines" today,
  we are relying on an indirection, by saying "formats that
  allow WCAG conformant authoring." This suggests strongly to
  me that if we require WCAG Double-A conformance, then we
  render meaningless WCAG's Level A, and I don't recommend that.

  That's not what 6.2 says. 6.2 only talks about the potential
  for accessibility. The other checkpoints for *actual content*
  address issues of rendering, navigation, control of style, etc.
