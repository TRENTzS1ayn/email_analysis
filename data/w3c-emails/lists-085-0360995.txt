Going back to the 21 January draft (for the sake of a convenient document)
the checkpoint says that these mechanism, where they exist, should be
implemented usign standard mechanisms, so that users can find them in a
familiar manner. I think that is what they should say still, and i think it
would eb easier to find them if they stay where they are.

The standard things they need to do are to meet OS/system requirements for
user interface (i.e. be readily identifiable by looking at them) as well as
being programmatically exposed.

more  or less...

cheers

  Some of the issues that were raise on the 21 December teleconference:

  1. Checkpoint 8.6 implies that a user agent must implement selection and
  focus to conform to the guidelines.  While these features are widely used
  in most user agents, it was not the intention of the group to require a
  user agent to implement selection and focus.  If a user agent does not
  implement these for anyone, why do they need to be implemented for a person
  with a disability?  In practice most user agents support at least focus,
  and many support selection.  But some technologies like a multi-media
  player may never implement selection, but could be very accessible.

  2. The second sentence in 8.6 deals with implementing standard focus and
  selection methods that are usable to assistive technologies.  This
  requirement seems to be more a part of guideline 5.

  Proposal:

  1. Delete current checkpoint 8.6 based on the removal of the requirement to
  implement selection and focus.
  2. Add a new checkpoint to guideline 5 relating to implementing accessible
  focus and selection methods at a priority 1 level.

  [NEW]
  5.x  Provide programmatic access to selection, content focus, and user
  interface focus mechanisms using operating system APIs that support
  accessibility [Priority 1].

  Note: This checkpoint is an important special case of checkpoint 5.4.  Some
  operating systems have specialized APIs that are designed for communicating
  some types of information to assistive technologies and these should be
  used when available, other operating systems will require using the
  standard operating system APIs that support communication with assistive
  technologies.
