JRG: Checkpoint 6.2 is currently a priority 2 checkpoint so user agents can 
still conform with UAAG at single-A level without including this checkpoint 
as part of its conformance.  I think it is important to separate what the 
author provides from what the user agent is capable of rendering.  A user 
agent that can render WCAG double-A content will help authors who decide to 
provide either single-A or double-A WCAG conformant content.  But if the 
author can only author WCAG single-A content, the author will not no choice 
in providing double-A compliant materials that a user agent could 
render.  The user agent is the limit on how accessible content can be and 
therefore I think the limit should be, at a Priority 2 level, is to allow 
WCAG double-A level content to be rendered.
