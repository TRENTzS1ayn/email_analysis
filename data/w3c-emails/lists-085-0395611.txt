Hello,

In the 23 October draft [1], checkpoints 4.3 and 4.4
ensure control of foreground and background colors of
all text:

4.3 Allow the user to configure the foreground color of all
    text, with an option to override author-specified, 
    and user agent default, foreground colors. 
    Allow the user to select from among the
    range of system colors. [Priority 1] 

4.4 Allow the user to configure the background color of all 
    text, with an option to override author-specified,
    and user agent default background colors. 
    Allow the user to select from among the
    range of system colors. [Priority 1] 

The checkpoints have the same priority and almost
always appear together in the guidelines and techniques
documents. 

Reasons to merge them:

 1) One less P1 checkpoint, same requirements.
 2) Since they should be set as a pair (by authors, users), 
    it is convenient that they be listed as a pair.

I propose the following formulation of the merged 
checkpoints (a little easier to read, I think):

<NEW>
Allow the user to configure the foreground and background 
color of all text, with an option to override foreground 
and background colors specified by the author or user agent 
defaults. Allow the user to select from among the range of
system colors.
</NEW>

NOTE: As part of an action item for issue 348 [2], I am
reviewing this checkpoint and others related to styling
selection and focus. I may propose additional changes
to this and other checkpoints as part of this action, but
I expect that in any case, foreground and background color
requirements will be in a single checkpoint.

 - Ian

P.S. The first group of checkpoint in Guideline 4
is entitled 
 "Checkpoints for fonts and colors (content accessibility)"

Since these checkpoints (now 3) are only about visually
rendered text (and not colors for all content), I propose
reducing the scope of the title to:

 "Checkpoints for visually rendered text (content accessibility)"
