Hello Working Group,

The 29 December 2000 draft of the UAAG 1.0 Guidelines [1]
and Techniques [2] documents are available. They incorporate
some of the resolutions from the November face-to-face meeting.

NOTE: I will be out of town from today (29 December) until 
4 January 2001. I regret that I do not have time today to
update the list of changes; I will do so on my return. 
I thought it was important to get a new draft to the WG anyway.

Nonetheless, please review:
  - checkpoint 1.1
  - checkpoint 4.3
  - The new stuff on input modalities.
  - The revised conformance model presentation

(There are other changes than these.)

NOTE 2: I didn't have time to really scan the document to
see whether there are any horrible errors. Please let me
know if you find any!

Happy new year to all,

 _ Ian
