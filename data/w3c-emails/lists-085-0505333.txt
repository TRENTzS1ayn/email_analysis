The general approach we have followed here is that the basic responsibility of
the User Agent is to act responsibly with respect to what it can recognize in
the received data by applying the rules of the format.

So "marked up to indicate" here is synonymous with "where the UA has
recognized
that activation will [likely] incur a fee."  The requirement to recognize this
property where the definition of the format supports such recognition is
covered in Checkpoint 6.2 to do things and do them right.
