This request is from the User Agent Working Group.
In reviewing specifications that include event handlers, part of the review 
of the specification should include what expected user behaviors will 
trigger the event.

For example:
onFocus event handler in HTML: The onFocus event should be triggered when 
either keyboard focus is moved to an element, when a pointing device hovers 
on the element or a voice command is used to move voice focus to the element.
