Judy,
In the User Agent joint meeting with the DOM working group the issue of the 
implementation of the DOM Views module was discussed.  Right now there is 
no work going on in this area, since only one company is interested in 
working on it.  My question for the CG is there anything that we can do to 
encourage another developer to participate in developing this module.
