Hello,

I've published the 4 April 2001 UAAG 1.0 Guidelines [1] and Techniques
[2]. The changes in this version [3] are on the Web and quoted below
as text.

This version is mostly about changes to the Techniques Document.  I
classified the techniques for each checkpoint. I think the following
checkpoints need particular attention: 2.7, 2.9, 3.4, 3.8, 4.13-4.15,
5.2, 5.6, 6.1, 6.2, 9.4, 10.3, 11.1, and 11.3. Of course, all of the
techniques should be reviewed and augmented.

Thank you,

 - Ian

CHANGES
-------

* Added same navigation tools as in Guidelines (next, previous,
  guideline etc.)

* Divided techniques into five groups: notes and rationale, example
  techniques, doing more, cross references in this document, other
  references.

* General editing to the techniques to reduce redundancy and update
  with changes to the document.

* Removed table of Netscape's keyboard bindings and replaced with a
  link to the Mozilla site (which has lots of good information about
  keyboard bindings that developers should think about).

* Some images were too wide, so I cropped them as best I could.
