Discussion

1.Last call scheduling issues

IJ: 
a) 4 April draft is basically the one to go to last call
   with some editorial changes.

b) Last call: 9 or 10th to 4 May.

c) Objections? 
 
   IJ: I have two:

   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0553

   /* Participants here don't have other objections. */

d) Encourage widespread review. There will be a public version
   of the last call announcement on the UA list.

   JG: I'll send last call review to people we've sent it to
    in the past.

e) What do we want from this review?
   i) Clarifications ok. Notably editorial ones. 
  ii) IJ: I don't think we should re-open issues without
      significant new evidence.
 iii) We expect to put new issues or proposals in the future
      issues list:
      http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-new.html

f) Some (very general) scheduling:

   i) Suppose 3 weeks to process last call issues. 
      IJ: Propose two meetings/week to address issues.
      Same time on Tuesdays 2pm ET for: GR, MQ, HB, IJ, JG

  ii) Prepare implementation report during last call. Suppose
      we don't have implementation experience for every requirement.
      IJ: We go to CR until we do. If we remove requirements, we
      have to go back to last call. Suppose we have a 6-week last call.

 iii) Go to PR end of July.
  
  iv) Beginning of September for Recommendation (optimistically).

      JG: Very optimistically....I think we may require much longer.

2. Techniques document review

  GR: I like the state of the speech checkpoints 4.13-4.15
  DP: I'll work on navigation section.
  TL: I'll meet with Ian at Microsoft.

Closed actions

1.IJ: Talk to Judy about adding informative quote from
     section 508 about definition of AT.
 Source: 
 http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0555.html
 Status: IJ sent email to W3C Team.

4.TL: Report to WG on discussions at Microsoft about keyboard emulation.
Source: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0227

TL: We provide the APIs to do this. Developers weren't sure
    why they would want to do this. I'm not sure that this is
    a good answer, but this is the direction people are taking.

JG: My browser group has implemented some software to query
elements and trigger events in a device-independent manner. I will
send a pointer to this in a couple of weeks.

TL: There's a feature in Windows 2000 where you can have the pointer
follow the focus rectangle. But the expected functionality doesn't
work. I found it to be more confusing than valuable today.

TL: Windows 2000 Narrator has an option to have the mouse follow the
focus.

GR: JFW does the same thing.

8.HB: Talk to EO about publishing "How do people with disabilities use 
     the Web".
Source: 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0555.html

HB: We have another round of edits to be done. 

IJ: When expected to be published as a Note?

HB: Judy has to do the edits first.

       guidelines with a product.
Source: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0137

   TL/IJ: We will talk about this when Ian at Microsoft.

6.CMN: Find out from SYMM WG whether repositioning of objects will
