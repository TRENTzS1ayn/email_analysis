Charles,
The accessible browser project is a group of senior design students that 
are working on building a more accessible browser.  The accessible browser 
is built on Microsoft Internet Explorer technology and supports graphical 
and speech rendering of web pages.  It will also support structural 
navigation and the dynamic application of style sheets.  The feature of 
greatest interest to the User Agent working group is a new feature to 
navigate to elements with event handlers (even if they are not links or 
form controls), allow the user to query what events are associated with the 
element and then allow the user to trigger each of the events 
manually.  This is very important for showing implementation experience for 
Checkpoints 1.2, 9.2 and 9.4.  I hoping they will also be able to implement 
checkpoint 9.5 on disabling automatic triggering of user interface events.
