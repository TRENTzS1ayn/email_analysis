I am not sure if this is a stable enough URI, but this would be a useful
techniques reference for APIs

This table shows the roles and states Gnome will probably be using, and
compares them with those used in MSAA and Java accessibility.

http://www.accessmozilla.org/article.php?sid=11

This may not be the final roles and states they use, because there seem
to be some mistakes.
For example, Gnome accessibility contains both ATK_ROLE_ROW_HEADER and
ATK_ROLE_TABLE_ROW_HEADER - oops!
Same with ATK_ROLE_COLUMN_HEADER and ATK_ROLE_TABLE_COLUMN_HEADER.

Hope this is helpful,

Aaron
