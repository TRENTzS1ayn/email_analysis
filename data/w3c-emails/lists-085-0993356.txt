Hi folks,

I probably shouldn't do this, but I am curious to know whether
people think we should break UAAG 1.0 and the Techniques
documents into smaller chunks. UAAG 1.0 (not including
the appendixes) is 322k. The Techniques Document is 533k. 
These are both on the long side. 

It would be possible (though I haven't tried it yet to see
what kind of effort is required) to split the document(s)
into smaller pieces. We would also provide a link at
the top to a single source HTML version (essentially,
what people get today). 

The W3C Process Document [1] has been organized this way.
Essentially, you only get the table of contents on the first
page (in the Process Document case, that's only 18k).

In the UAAG 1.0 case, it makes sense to split the
document into the following pieces:

 a) Front page
 b) Introduction
 c) Guidelines
 d) Conformance
 e) Glossary
 f) References
 g) Acknowledgments

For instance, the Guidelines section (the longest) would only
be approximately 162k. The appendixes (checklists and summary)
would still have their own URIs (but are considered part of
the document package).

The navigation mechanisms of the Process Document are pretty
straightforward: you have next/previous/contents links
at the top of each section. 

Obviously, this doesn't change the substance of the document,
but it may be worth exploring. Your comments welcome,

 - Ian
