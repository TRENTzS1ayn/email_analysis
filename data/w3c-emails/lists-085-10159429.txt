searching to wrap or not to wrap.  Actually, this topic as it is drawn
is to deal with a couple of issues that have been raised.  we need to be
able to wrap the search and be told that it is wrapping if desired to
wrap.  this is for consistancy.  we discussed at great lengh whether or
ot to include here all the possible variations fo searching and came to
the colclusion that there only neded to be this specific requirement
concerned with wrapping.  my addition was to indicate when the end of
the search had been reached instead of just ending if there was no wrap
so that one would not have to wonder why the search had gone nowhere or
semed to go nowhere.  we have other checkpoints for navigation which
address some of the other issues.
