this does alleviate the too many bindings issue though and one other
thing is that it should be stated clearly that if you are in an imput

perhaps this could also be done with a single keystroke such as f2 to
suspend single keystroke actions?

I'm not sure I agree with this. I think that if single key means
anything other than "one time", we will confuse readers.
