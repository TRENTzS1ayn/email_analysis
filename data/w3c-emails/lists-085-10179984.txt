The Techniques document [1] already points this out. The first
bullet for checkpoint 11.4:

  "In some modes of interaction (e.g., when the user is entering 
   text), the number of available single keys will be 
   significantly reduced. The number of available single keys
   will also be determined by the keyboard device capabilities."
