Comments on 23 March Draft
1. Are Checkpoints 2.5 and 2.6, special cases of Checkpoint 2.1?  Do we 
need to put a reference in or possibly remove the checkpoints?

2. Checkpoint 3.4: Add technique to configure to selectively turn off 
script execution.  For example do not process user interface event 
handlers, or subsets of user interface event handlers.

3. Checkpoint 4.11: Can we using "talking rate" instead of "playback 
rate".  Playback doesn't seem to be the right term for synthesized speech.

4. Checkpoint 5.4: Add onChangeEvent to example in the note


5. Checkpoint 9.5 "Use make available" terminology, instead of query?
