I agree with this Ian,

In fact, when I went looking for ua info in 508, I did not corolate and
should have been able to the fact that their requirements were even
addressing ua issues.  There seems actually to be some gapping in their
requirements since ua work is mostly rendering and cooperating and much
other software seems to be involved from their point of view in getting
to the stuff of the software its self.  They also talk about documents
and I guess taken together, there might be some ground on which to form
a comparison.  I'll research this a bit.  It might be an informative
resource on the wai home page.
