I don't think we should remove the checkpoints. I am ok to add 
cross-refs.

Ok. Actually, very much in line with your desire for increased
granularity, I intend to add the following note to this checkpoint
(and a similar one about style sheets later on):

   <BLOCKQUOTE>
   Scripts and applets may provide very useful
   functionality, not all of which causes accessibility
   problems. Developers should not consider that the user's 
   ability to turn off scripts is an effective way to improve    
   content accessibility; turning off scripts means losing the 
   benefits they offer.  Instead, developers should provide users 
   with finer control over user agent or content behavior known 
   to raise accessibility barriers.  The user should only have 
   to turn off scripts as a last resort.
   </BLOCKQUOTE>

I agree with David's suggestion of "speech rate".

Ok.

Done.
 
Thanks Jon,
