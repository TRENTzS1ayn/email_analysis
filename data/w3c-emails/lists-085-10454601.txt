Hello,

I've published the 31 March 2001 UAAG 1.0 Guidelines [1] and
Techniques [2]. It is my strong hope and expectation that these
documents will be the ones that go to last call (possibly with minor
editorial changes and additional techniques). These documents
incorporate all the resolutions to all the second last call issues.

If you have substantial comments, please hold them until last call.
If you have editorial suggestions, you may send them and I'll try to
incorporate them before last call, but may wait until last call.

The changes in this version [3] are on the Web and quoted below as
text.  Noteworthy changes are:

 - New checkpoint 3.8 about toggling placeholders.
 - Checkpoints 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, and 6.7 now require
   a publicly documented API if a standard one doesn't exist.
 - Checkpoint 11.4: Minimal requirement for single-key bindings
   now the set of functionalities in 11.5. Also improved Note
   after checkpoint.
 - Executive summary now integrated as an appendix.

Thank you,

 - Ian

CHANGES
-------

General

 * Integrated executive summary per [54]29 March 2001 teleconference.
 * Further deleted instances of "must" to fall in line with RFC2119.
   "Must" only used in checkpoints, in references to checkpoints that
   use "must", and in section on conformance.

Guidelines

 * Added Note before Guideline one about checkpoint
   "interdependence".

Checkpoints

 * 1.2: This checkpoint moved from Guideline 9 per [55]29 March 2001
   teleconference since about device-independence.
 * 2.3: Clarified (with one word) in checkpoint what was already in
   the Note: that the config requirement is global.
 * 2.5, 2.6: Added that these are special cases of 2.1.
 * 2.7: Editorial changes to remove "author's intention" and instead
   focus on how the content is encoded. Same language as 2.6 in
   essence.
 * 3.2, 3.7: Per comments from Greg Lowney, changed to not talk about
   activation of placeholders (but same requirement).
 * 3.4, 4.16: Added some rationale to Notes about turning off
   scripts/style sheets as a last resort technique.
 * 3.8: New. Added per decision at [56]29 March 2001 teleconference.
   See [57]issue 467.
 * 4.6: Changed "same" to "at least" for clarity, per decision at
   [58]29 March 2001 teleconference.
 * 4.11 (and elsewhere): Changed "speech playback rate" to "speech
   rate".
 * 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.7: Important Per decision at [59]29 March 2001
   teleconference, added requirements that if standard APIs not
   available, use some publicly documented API to provide access.
 * 8.2: Tweaks in Note about conformance to W3C specs.
 * 9.2: Per decision at [60]29 March 2001 teleconference, did not add
   requirement for reverse navigation, but did add suggestion to
   note.
 * 9.4: Per decision at [61]29 March 2001 teleconference, changed
   language from "query" to allow for non-query techniques.
 * 10.2, 10.6: Fixed label: These checkpoints are for content only.
   Moved 10.6 to section on content requirements.
 * 11.4: Minimal requirement is to have single key bindings for at
   least all of what's in 11.5, per decision at [62]29 March 2001
   teleconference. Add a Note to encourage developers to supply a
   bunch of single key bindings AND that most functionalities should
   be available for single-key bindings. Other edits as well to
   clarify the meaning of single key, option for modifiers for
   default input config. See [63]issue 468.

Conformance

 * In applicability provision 3, cleaned up references to event
   handlers.
 * Added (new) checkpoint 3.8 to content type label groups Video,
   Audio, Animation, and Image.
 * Added note that checkpoint grouping/order has no bearing on
   conformance.
 * Added note that link to techniques after checkpoint is
   informative.

Glossary

 * Some general (minor) editorial cleanup.
 * "Placeholder": updates and cleanup of definition. Added some
   techniques as well to convey idea.
 * Updated definition of "Documentation" and deleted "document source
   view" per decision at [64]29 March 2001 teleconference to
   implement [65]proposal from Ian.
 * Event handlers: Cleaned up definition and added definition of
   "explicitly associated event handler".
 * Assistive technology: Added as another example of an AT
   definition, link to AT act of 1998.


References

 * Added [AT1998].

Techniques

 * 1.2: Added query and non-query techniques. Added config option to
   non-query technique.
 * 1.2, 9.4: Added information about what constitutes an input device
   event handler in HTML 4 and DOM 2.
 * 2.5, 4.6: Added techniques for SMIL 1.0 user agents on recognizing
   as captions what is guarded by the system-captions test attribute.
 * 2.7: Added very little in the way of examples of conditional
   content.
 * 3.4: Added technique to increase granularity of on/off control.
 * 8.2: Added link to W3C tech reports page.
 * 9.4: per [66]29 March teleconf : added technique to restore state
   variables after refresh of content. Removed first technique since
   part of checkpoint now.
 * 11.4: mention that entering a special mode (e.g, via one key) and
   having single key bindings after that is also useful.
