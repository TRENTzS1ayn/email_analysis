Note that this includes a public list in teh distribution.

Jon,

this is noted as a good idea in general, and is one of the requirements for
an event model anyway.

  This request is from the User Agent Working Group.
  In reviewing specifications that include event handlers, part of the review
  of the specification should include what expected user behaviors will
  trigger the event.

  For example:
  onFocus event handler in HTML: The onFocus event should be triggered when
  either keyboard focus is moved to an element, when a pointing device hovers
  on the element or a voice command is used to move voice focus to the element.
