Just to assuage concerns: I've already done this for the
W3C Process Document; I have all the scripts ready to go.
I suspect that it would take me one-two hours on a 
Saturday afternoon to apply this to UAAG 1.0, so it won't
slow down our process at all.

Jon is right, however, and the first priority is the
implementation report.
