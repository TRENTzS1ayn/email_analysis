This is going to be the case for most screen readers. I can only speak for 
Window-Eyes, but we do not parse HTML ourselves. Instead, we receive the 
parsed information from the browser through MSAA. So, if the TAGs in 
question are supported by MSAA, then they will be supported by Window-Eyes. 
If we have to step around MSAA and go right to the DOM to get some feature 
to work, then we will. But those cases are usually rare.
