IJ2: That, at least, should be clarified.

IJ2: I also like that suggestion.

IJ2: Yes, this is exactly our model - the user agent is, with few
exceptions,
not required to repair broken markup. We ask authors to use markup
according
to specification (not necessarily coding by hand, but using authoring
tools
that save and use markup according to specification).

IJ2: At one point, the UAAG 1.0 included a checkpoint about turning
off navigation bars. And HTML 4.01 was modified to allow authors to
use the MAP element for non-graphical navigation mechanisms, so that
user agents could recognize them and turn them off. 

Ultimately, instead of keeping this requirement, we included the
more generic structured navigation requirement. There were too many
special case requirements that are useful, but would have bloated
the document. These included: navigation bar control, navigation of
table cells, navigation from table to table, etc. 

The structured navigation required is expected to allow users to
skip navigation blocks as you have described in your example. However,
UAAG 1.0
proposes a generic mechanism for navigation of "important elements", not
just
links, or blocks of links, or tables, etc.

I have snipped the rest of the comments as we seem to be
in agreement!

Thanks again, Richard, and thank you for the support!
