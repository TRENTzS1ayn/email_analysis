I like the article. It put a "face" (Ms. Laitinen) on the guidelines. It
shows that the guidelines are not only  technical, they impact the lives of
people.

Subject: UAAG 1.0 in ERCIM newsletter #46


Hello,

Daniel Dardailler and I wrote a small piece [1] for the ERCIM Newsletter
about the UAAG 1.0. The text is based on the UAAG 1.0 summary.

The ERCIM News:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
 ...reports on joint actions of the ERCIM partners, and
 aims to reflect the contribution made by ERCIM to the European
 Community in Information Technology. Through short articles
 and news items, it provides a forum for the exchange of information
 between the institutes and also with the wider scientific community.
 ERCIM News is published quarterly. The printed edition has a
 circulation of over 7000 copies.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

The theme for this month's edition is Human Computer Interaction. There
are a number of articles on usability and accessibility.

Note: Since the text of this article is not quite the same as the text
of the summary, it would be interesting to compare the two and state
which
you prefer. The article version is shorter, for example.

 - Ian
