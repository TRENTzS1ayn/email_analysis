This article is an appropriate addition to the Education Outreach
resources. The effective use of a person (Ms. Laitinen) to motivate
the reader's thinking about accessibility is the technique now being
used in the EO draft "How People with Disabilities Use the Web:"

I prefer the article [1].

Editorial:
1. Fix typo in title "Iinitiative."
2. I'd condense one of the "third of a trilogy" references.
3. I'd add links to the references from where they are discussed, and
4. Move the URL for UA techniques to the references for consistency.
