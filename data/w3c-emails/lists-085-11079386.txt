I think a more imersive example would be better if you are going to use
it instead of our current summary.  It would be good for instance to
show speech input and blindness or speech input in addition to blindness
thus two examples.  perhaps a hearing impaired person seeing audio
indicators flash instead of or in addition to sounding on the screen and
I'd put it in a somewhat different light.  I cannot explain this well,
but it has become tiring for many of us to be showcase material if you
know what I mean so a different approach to this which again, I am not
sure of what that might be would be much welcomed.

This article is an appropriate addition to the Education Outreach
resources. The effective use of a person (Ms. Laitinen) to motivate
the reader's thinking about accessibility is the technique now being
used in the EO draft "How People with Disabilities Use the Web:"

I prefer the article [1].

Editorial:
1. Fix typo in title "Iinitiative."
2. I'd condense one of the "third of a trilogy" references.
3. I'd add links to the references from where they are discussed, and
4. Move the URL for UA techniques to the references for consistency.
