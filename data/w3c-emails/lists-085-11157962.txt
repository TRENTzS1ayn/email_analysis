To: wAI User Agent Working Group<w3c-wai-ua@w3.org>

There is no meeting today.

Use the meeting time today to review and comment Ian's response to the SVG 
last call comments[1].

Send a response to the working group by July 10th indicating either:
1. Agree with response
2. Agree with changes or other comments
3. Disagree and would like to discuss at 12 July meeting.  Here is the 
basis of my disagreement for a specific issue raised and here is my counter 
proposal.

Ian will be preparing some additional responses to the SVG working group, 
based on discussion with Dean Jackson some time this week.

Look forward to hearing your responses,
Jon
