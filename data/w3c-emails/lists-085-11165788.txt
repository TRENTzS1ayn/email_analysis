If I understand you correctly, it captures it well.  Look at modalities
rather than individuals.  I might not even care if this particular
person with this particular disability has this particular problem or
experience but I do care that I can reach a wider audience if I develop
in such a way that barriers are defeated.

[This is somewhat of an EO issue, but Harvey is tracking the situation
and it
should reflect back on the introduction in the UAAG itself, all the
same.

I would like to second what David is saying.

One of the appropriate defenses when people complain that WCAG 1.0 is
"all
about blind issues" is that "motor issues tend to be handled more in the
player, sensory issues in the content."  Along the lines of "hit the
high
spots
first" as Daniel was saying in the XML GL context, the number one bread
and
butter User Agent issue is keyboard access to all verbs.  Although
eyes-free
use does imply that one has to be able to run the interface without
visually
observing the position of the mouse cursor, the simplest and most direct
way to
get a naive reader into understanding why something has to be done is
starting
with motor disabilities.

If we don't get an other-than-blind example out first in our propaganda
raising
people's awareness of User Agent issues, we are just feeding the flames
of the
"WAI only understands blind issues" fires.  Because for the User Agent
guidelines, the blind consumer is not the _first_ consumer that _should_
come
to mind.  In the end, the breadth of the set of guidelines is about
making the
Web accessible for everyone, or as many of everyone as we bloody well
can.
But
for illustrative examples we have to sample.  Looking across the set of
documents, we want to be sure to distribute our examples.  For each
document,
we want an example that couples well with the subtexts "here, you see
how
there
is a problem" and "this is really something about which something should
be
done."  To carry the day for these arguments, playing numbers games
(targeting
sweet spots in the demographics) is exactly where we need to be.

This is how I read David's reaction, anyhow.  Is that something like
what you
meant, David?
