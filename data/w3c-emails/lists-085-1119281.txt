Actually, even saner would be to be able to query the image itself for its
description. See, for example, Describing and retrieving photos using RDF and
HTTP - a W3C note at http://www.w3.org/TR/photo-rdf/ which shows how this can
be done.

It should also be possible to do this for out of line images using a service
like Annotea http://www.w3.org/2001/02/Annotea but I haven't managed it yet.
I'll chase the Annotea team to find out if it is me or them...

cheers

  aloha, again!

  it just struck me as i tried to fall asleep that the sanest syntax (given
  the present state of affairs) with which to link a CSS-generated graphic to
  a textual equivalent/description might be the following (warning: the second
  URI is fictitious):

  background-image: url(http://www.w3.org/QA/images/qabg.png);
  background-image-longdesc:
  url(http://www.w3.org/QA/images/longdesc/qabg.html)
  or
  background-image: url(http://www.w3.org/QA/images/qabg.png);
  background-image-alt: url(http://www.w3.org/QA/images/longdesc/qabg.html)
  or
  background-image: url(http://www.w3.org/QA/images/qabg.png);
  background-image-desc: url(http://www.w3.org/QA/images/longdesc/qabg.html)

  the contents of the background-image-longdesc or background-image-alt or
  background-image-desc could then be pulled inline by the browser/UA to
  provide for an inline textual description if (a) image loading is turned
  off, and (b) the UA is configured to display descriptions of background
  images inline--and, if condition b were met, then the content of the BODY of
  the document referenced by the background-image-longdesc/alt/desc could then
  be rendered in place of the background image, or be made available via a
  context menu type functionality from a placeholder graphic, or be accessible
  in toto via a UA-generated hyperlink, etc.

  perhaps there are 3-levels for which functionality is needed:

  background-image: url(http://www.w3.org/QA/images/qabg.png);
  background-image-alt: "Quality Assurance and Conformance";
  background-image-longdesc:
  url(http://www.w3.org/QA/images/longdesc/qabg.html)

  with the background-image-alt being required if using background-image, or
  perhaps the pseudo-elemental "content" construct (actually, i think the
  correct term is "property") could simply be recycled for the purpose of
  providing a brief textual alternative?

  gregory, who probably should be asleep.
