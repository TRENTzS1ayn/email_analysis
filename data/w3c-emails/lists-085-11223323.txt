Hello,

I think that in order to ensure that user agents implement
a focus mechanism that meets the expectations of UAAG 1.0, 
checkpoints 9.1 and 9.2 in the 22 June draft [1] need to include
certain characteristics as normative. These characteristics are:

 - The focus must be persistent within the current session.
 - It must designate zero or more enabled elements, and may designate
   disabled elements.

The other required characteristics are already covered by checkpoints:

 - The user must be able to move it per checkpoints 9.3 and 9.7
 - The user must be able to trigger event handlers that the focus
   designates per 1.2 and 9.5
 - The user agent must restore it per 9.4 (when history is implemented).

This is a non-editorial change since it moves requirements into 9.1 and
9.2,
but I believe that this has been our intention with respect to focus,
at least since the February face-to-face meeting in Cambridge [2].

Note: I am not proposing that we move selection characteristics into a
checkpoint. We don't need to. A selection may refer to text only
or text and images, and this doesn't affect our current selection 
checkpoints.
