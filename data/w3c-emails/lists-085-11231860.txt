Possible New:

EH:
    The requirements of this document only apply to the operating 
    environment governing the relevant user agent behavior, user
    interface, APIs, etc.

I deleted the word "innermost" since it is not clear what it contributes.
Perhaps if it seems important to retain, could say:

    The requirements of this document only apply to the operating 
    environment that governs the relevant user agent behavior user
    interface, APIs, etc., i.e., the "innermost" operating environment.

My wording is a bit awkward, but the basic idea is to _not_ use the
undefined term "innermost" as a qualifier.
