I agree with Eric. "innermost" is undefined and should be removed. The
example statement provides clear illustration to the requirements statement.

old:
  The requirements of this document only apply to the  "innermost"
operating environment governing the relevant user agent behavior, user
interface, APIs, etc.
   For example, if a Java-based user agent relies on the underlying
operating system to satisfy checkpoint 4.2, then the conventions to follow
for that
checkpoint would be those of the operating system. Similarly, in the case
where
two operating environments are governing the execution of the user agent,
then UAAG
requirements apply to to both of them."

Possible New:

EH:
    The requirements of this document only apply to the operating
    environment governing the relevant user agent behavior, user
    interface, APIs, etc.

I deleted the word "innermost" since it is not clear what it contributes.
Perhaps if it seems important to retain, could say:

    The requirements of this document only apply to the operating
    environment that governs the relevant user agent behavior user
    interface, APIs, etc., i.e., the "innermost" operating environment.

My wording is a bit awkward, but the basic idea is to _not_ use the
undefined term "innermost" as a qualifier.
