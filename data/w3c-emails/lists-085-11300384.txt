WebSound - http://websound.unige.ch is a browser that is designed for blind
and visually impaired users. In addition to providing speech output and very
large print (synchronised to positioning in a standard graphic rendering) the
browser provides access to the position within the structure, and attempts to
make the layout of the page accessible to a blind user, for example to use as
a preview tool with an authoring system, or for collaborative work with
people who are "blindless".

It has a bunch of neat features, and so might be good to look at for
implementation examples. (And the developer is interested in feedback from
users, like many developers)

It's essentially a tiny project at the University of Geneva, based on
Explorer (so it supports scripting and so on).

cheers

Charles
