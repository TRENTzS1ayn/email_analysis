Hello,

Based on Working Group comments about the version of the 
UAAG 1.0 summary that appeared in the ERCIM Newsletter [2], 
I have published a revision of the summary [1] for your review.
This revision includes three accessibility scenarios, in order for
a physical disability, deafness, and blindness. It also includes
fewer examples of the (boring <grin>) checkpoints and guidelines.

Comments welcome,

 _ Ian
