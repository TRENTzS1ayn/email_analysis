Thank you for informing me of the resolutions.  I have very few remaining
comments, which you should consider under the same context as my original
informal review comments.

Glad to hear it, and glad to have been of some assistance.

I do not think it is my place to be satisfied or not with the UAWG's
resolutions.  My intent was only to provide feedback from one implementor's
perspective which the UAWG was free to treat however it saw fit.  Hopefully
my comments were helpful to the UAWG's efforts.

I am not registering any objections.

I have snipped out the issues and responses for which I had no further
informal comments.

> Issue 481: 9.2 and 9.6: Definition of "non-interactive element"

> ------------------------------------------------------------------

>    An interactive element is piece of content that, by specification,
>    may have associated behaviors to be executed or carried out as a

>  </BLOCKQUOTE>

Through the parenthetical comment alone '(e.g., through the various "on"
attributes)', it is possible to interpret pretty much every element as an
interactive element, in that it is possible in popular user agents to
dynamically attach the various "on" attributes to pretty much every element.

Due to the strongly worded final sentence, specifically "non-interactive
elements never become enabled elements", and since it is nearly impossible
to satisfy the "never" condition of that sentence given the above described
dynamic attribute attachment ability, the term "non-interactive element" is
nearly meaningless with the current definition.

I do not have a better suggestion to offer.  I am only pointing out the
limitation (presumably unintended) of the current text in the hopes that a
better alternative can be provided.

I briefly looked at the sample cases, and noted that most of them involve
the spawning of new windows ('window.open'), for which there is already a
requirement to allow disabling, and therefore, the argument could be made
that those sample cases are already "handled".

However, I did note that there are sample cases which do not involve
window.open, and allow me to add this additional related sample case which I
have seen:

  Similar to case 4E as documented in the above message, there are SELECT
elements with ONCHANGE handlers which immediately navigate to a new page,
which can make it difficult to "arrow key through" the various OPTIONs after
having focussed a SELECT element (since after even "arrow keying down" one
OPTION, the ONCHANGE event may fire which may result in an immediate page
navigation).

For configuration file formats defined by W3C standards (e.g. a user style
sheet), it should be sufficient for the documentation to refer to the
appropriate W3C standard (e.g. CSS1) rather than have to explain the entire
W3C standard (e.g. a CSS1 tutorial).

This is reasonable enough.  But, in this case, what about alternate (or
primary) style sheets which are specified through HTTP LINK headers?  The
above definition would seem to imply that they are not part of the "document
source".  This seems contrary to intent.

I would like to point out that the reason I raised this issue is that some
very small text sizes are illegible (e.g. anything less than 9px
unsmoothed), and therefore, it may be preferable for a UA to set a "lower
bound" for the purposes of avoiding "unusable" configurations.

Is it a P2 (or P3) requirement to permit users to configure the size of text
to such illegible sizes?

Thanks,

Tantek
