IJ: What is "enabled" ultimately depends on the user agent. The user
agent
developer implements a specification, but may choose to do more or less
than the specification. In the case of HTML, the "on" attributes are not
defined for every element (far from it). However, user agents may allow
authors to specify these attributes for almost every element. In this
case,
the developer is not implementing the specification correctly (a
separate
issue), and in doing so is increasing the amount of interactivity the
author can specify. There is no reason users with disabilities should
not
have access to these enabled elements, even if they are not
"interactive"
because they are not defined by specification to be potentially
interactive.

Thus, we separate the definitions of "interactive" (by spec) and
enabled.
Our requirements refer only to enabled elements - those that are live
in a given session. Our *expectation* is described in the last sentence,
but if user agent developers turn non-interactive elements into
enabled elements in some sessions, our requirements are that the user
agent provide access to them.

IJ: I would go further and say that the UA should either explain the
format or refer to some document that does (for any format).

IJ: I agree, as we would like to have access to these alternate style
sheets and expect to for LINK elements. The "good news" (and I learned
this by surprise some time ago) is that the Link header field is not
part of HTTP/1.1. Refer to section 19.6.3 [1]:

   "The Alternates, Content-Version, Derived-From, Link, URI, Public and
    Content-Base header fields were defined in previous versions of
    this specification, but not commonly implemented. See RFC 2068
[33]."

There's no link header in section 14 ("Header Field Definitions").

IJ: It is still a P1 requirement if this illegible size is part of the
range of font sizes offered by the operating environment. We don't make
the small size requirement directly, only require access to the range
already
made available by the operating environment. As mentioned above, while
we
tried to find a lower bound because we agreed with your sentiment, we
could
not do so readily in an I18N context.
