With event bubbling model used for scripting, every element potentially can 
be interactive.  The user agent can make pretty good assumptions from the 
markup that elements with an "on" event hander, marked up as a link or 
input controls is an interactive element.  Other elements maybe interactive 
based on scripting, which is difficult or impossible for the user agent to 
determine from markup.  Maybe the term non-interactive needs to defined in 
terms of "recognized through markup".
