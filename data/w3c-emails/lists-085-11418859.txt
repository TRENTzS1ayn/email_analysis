It was difficult for the working group to come up with a required minimum 
size for many reasons, including internationalization issues.  It can be 
assumed for western characters that are visually rendered in a box less 
than 8x8 pixels it would be difficult or impossible for most people to 
read.  If an author specified a font size that resulted in a graphical 
rendering in a box less that 8x8 pixels box accessibility requirement would 
be to increase the text size (probably needed for everyone) to one that is 
readable.  But there is no need to allow the user in this case to decrease 
the font size.

Since there is no accessibility requirement for smaller sizes, no priority 
is associated with adding this capability to a browser.
