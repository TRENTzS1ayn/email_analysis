I believe we have already talked about this issue.  If the timing for the 
input is not recognizable as a part of markup, then the user agent does not 
have to provide the service.  It may indicate a potential accessibility 
problem in the SMIL 2.0 specification, if this type of user input 
interaction cannot be identified by the user agent through the author 
supplied markup.

QUESTION: Does anyone know if timed input behavior can be defined in SMIL 
2.0 through markup alone, or would there need to be some scripting 
involved?  The difference I see in the use of scripting, is that the author 
is essentially creating their own user interface.
