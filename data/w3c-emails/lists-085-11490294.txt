I agree with Ian's proposal for resolving issue 517 [1] the minimum 
requirement would be control for the master container.  Sub elements can be 
controlled individually if the user agent wanted to provide that 
functionality, but in most cases this will not be very useful since the 
author did not intend for the sub elements to play out of synch with the 
other sub elements.  This type of behavior would most likely add confusion, 
since the sub elements often will be fragments that are not useful out of 
context with the other elements.

I think there important authoring issues here and this issue need to be 
addressed by WCAG.

Jon
