Good to know.  HTTP LINK headers were but one example of HTTP headers which
affect the content, or the display thereof.

Another example is the HTTP Content-Language header, as this is often used
to denote the natural language of a document, using a language code (e.g.
"en-us"), which may then be utilized by :lang() selectors (<eg> :lang("en")
{ color:green } </eg>) in style sheets referenced by the document.  Access
to such style rules may require the presence of that portion of the HTTP
header.  Lack of that header may result in being denied access to such
styling.
