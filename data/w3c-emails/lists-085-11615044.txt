Tantek,

The main difference between what I think you want and what the group can 
provide is you would like something based upon usability of the rendered 
fonts, especially in the Macintosh environment.  We tried that approach and 
invited font experts to help in defining minimal usable sizes based on 
pixels or something else.  Our main obstacles in achieving a minimum limit 
based on a minimal size in pixels were internationalization and hardware 
issues.   The groups only other choice was to say whatever the operating 
environment supported.  This is approach is based on system capability and 
not on usability as we had wished.  It is assumed by using this requirement 
that the system would provide a set of usable font sizes.  The limitation 
of this approach, as you have pointed out, is that it may require user 
agents to render content that is in a font size that is not very usable to 
anyone.  But that is the best the working group can currently provide.  We 
are open to suggestions to improve this (or any part) of UAAG specifications.

So the group resolved not to specify a minimum size in pixels in either the 
guidelines or techniques document.
This problem is part of the statement that was included in the 22 June draft:

"This checkpoint does not include a "lower bound" (above which text sizes 
would be required) because of how users' needs may vary across writing 
systems and hardware."

Questions:
1. What capabilities does the Mac OS environment provide to developers for 
specifying the size of text rendered on the graphical display?

2. What system resources are available to allow the user to choose the font 
sizes available for a particular font family?

This dialog today has refreshed my memory of this important and difficult 
issue.

Jon
