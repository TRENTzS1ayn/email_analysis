As regards that last question, yes.

See, for example

<http://www.w3.org/TR/smil20/extended-linking.html#SMILLinking-Area>http://
www.w3.org/TR/smil20/extended-linking.html#SMILLinking-Area

Here the sensitive region is a volume swept out by a display region X a time
range.? The time range of a smil:area is its own time container in the
hierarchy of time containers.  And this is all defined in the SMIL, there
is no
scripting involved.
