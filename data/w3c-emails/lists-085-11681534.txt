I think that there may be some other things to consider, here.

It looks as though Issue 516 is subject to the same confusion about the scope
of stopping and pausing as is Issue 517.? In the SVG comments, it is suggested
that some scopes _could be paused_ to allow arbitrary time for input, and I am
not sure we ever meant more than what they say could be done.

Also, there was discussion that SVG "can't tell if the keypress is for a
simulated game console or for a form."? That's fine.? We don't care, either.?
If a keypress targeted to the game console is going to change the course of
the
play of the game, it is user input in the sense of 2.4.

It is possible that the current language is overly specific, however.

If we were to abbreviate the checkpoint to the first sentence of sub-point 1.
as follows:

The operational outcome of success is the same. 

And it allows for an asynchronous tree walk of the contents to visit the
enabled elements as with event handlers in HTML.

The "asynchronously walk the structure to visit the verbs" method is not
allowed under the present text, where it explicitly requires detecting and
autopausing on all events of the class "something enabled is going un-enabled
right now."? But it is hard to say that that method would not constitute
"equivalent facilitation" and it meets the letter of the shortened checkpoint.

We could try to check with someone who understands what's behind the SVG
comments to see if we can first clear up the possible misunderstanding about
stop/pause scoping, are we closer on 2.4?  Would a "list of input
opportunities" view be easy to generate, as opposed to the "pause on
desensitization" as currently described?
