Hmm. It would be nice to use this to update the SMIL accessibiltiy note for a
version 2 - use declarative animation (SMIL) rather than Javascript for this,
becuase it can be more easily controlled. But there are other things it would
be nice to update in that note too, and I don't think anyone has said they
have any time to work on it yet. Sigh. Volunteers anyone?

  As regards that last question, yes.

  See, for example

  <http://www.w3.org/TR/smil20/extended-linking.html#SMILLinking-Area>http://
  www.w3.org/TR/smil20/extended-linking.html#SMILLinking-Area

  Here the sensitive region is a volume swept out by a display region X a time
  range.? The time range of a smil:area is its own time container in the
  hierarchy of time containers.  And this is all defined in the SMIL, there
  is no
  scripting involved.
