Not at all - nothing I said is specific to the Macintosh environment.

I am not asking for a minimal size which would be guaranteed to work across
languages and hardware.

I am merely asking for the flexibility for user agents to disallow sizes
which are known to be completely unusable to anyone.  The current text does
not seem to have this flexibility, and thus encourages bad design
(permitting users to choose useless values).

The assumption is not only false, but ill conceived.

Operating systems provide the ability to render fonts as small as 1 pixel
tall (which is meaningless for legibility purposes, but provides a way to
draw seemingly random broken lines), simply because at the system
application program interface (API) level, it is easiest to provide maximum
flexibility, with the intent that _applications_ which are built on top of
the operating system will be written to provide usable text sizes in their
user interface, and may user other text sizes for other purposes (perhaps
for showing previews which are not meant to have legible text).

Strictly speaking, I agree with these statements.

In fact I would rather not see a minimum size specified in the guidelines or
techniques document as a _requirement_.

However, under the premise that the guidelines and techniques should
encourage (not discourage) more accessible and usable user interfaces, some
wording should be added which permits the user agent to set a lower bound on
its font size preferences.  What that lower bound is, probably should not be
specified in the techniques or guidelines document, for the reasons you
state.

1 pixel to 255 pixels.

There are no system resources which allow the user to specifically choose
the font sizes available for a particular font family for all font families.

What is available is the system "Appearance" control panel, which permits
the user to choose:
 - which font family is used for the "Large System Font"
   . note: only among a subset of the fonts on the system
   . no size preference is given.
 - which font family is used for the "Small System Font"
   . note: only among an even smaller subset of the fonts on the system,
           on my machine, "Geneva" was the only choice.
   . no size preference is given.
 - which font family is used for the "Views Font"
   . a size preference is given with both a menu (9,10,12,14,18,24),
     and a text entry box which shows the currently chosen size.
       If you try to enter a size smaller than 9, when you close the
     control panel, the size is rejected, and reset to its previous value.


The idea of disallowing sizes smaller than 9 pixels is not a new one.

Note that this is _very_ different than requiring that sizes 9 pixels and
larger be available, which I would agree, is a problematic statement.

Even requiring the disallowing of sizes smaller than 9 pixels may be
considered problematic.

To be very clear - I am not asking for either of these requirements.

I am asking for wording which provides the flexibility to the user agent to
disallow sizes that are smaller than what the user agent deems as legible
(this takes care of the international and hardware issues, because
presumably the user agent has enough information to make those decisions
correctly).

Thanks,

Tantek
