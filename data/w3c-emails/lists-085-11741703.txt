Tantek,
I will bring this issue back to the group for further discussion.

Here are two proposal that I though of to change checkpoint 4.1:

<OLD>
2. Allow the user to choose from among the full range of font sizes 
supported by the operating environment.
</OLD>

<NEW1>
2. Allow the user to choose from the range of fonts which includes the 
largest font size supported by the operating system environment and the 
minimum font size that is considered usable for people without visual 
impairments for each operating system supported font family.  The minimal 
usable font size will vary across character sets and the user agent can 
satisfy this checkpoint by supporting the full range of font sizes 
supported by the operating system.
</NEW1>

or

<NEW2>
2. Allow the user to choose from a range of font sizes that includes the 
largest font sizes supported by the operating system for a specific font 
family.  The user agent can satisfy this checkpoint by supporting the full 
range of font sizes supported by the operating system.
</NEW2>

Personally I like the second proposal, since it is clearly the original 
intent of the checkpoint.  The first proposal seems a bit much and 
ambiguous.  I think that we can trust that developers to include the 
smallest font sizes that they feel are usable by people without disabilities.

I will bring this up with the group.  I am not sure the group will want to 
make a change from the current wording.  Personally, like you, I am 
troubled by the current requirement of the full range of supported fonts, 
especially when the range includes unreadable font sizes.

If you have any other proposals, please send them to the group.

Thanks again for your interest in the guidelines,
Jon
