2001


The 12 April User Agent Working Group meeting is cancelled for
tomorrow.  We will be meeting on 19 April to discuss the implementation
report and techniques document issues.

Thanks again to all the working group members for your hard work in
returning the document to last call.  I think we all deserve a little
break
this week.
