C.1. Too many Priority 1 checkpoints
I think we could add to the C.1 response that individual developers are 
free to prioritize the P1 checkpoints themselves to determine which ones 
they want to satisfy first.  They can develop there own plan of 
implementing the P1 checkpoints over a period of time and product 
versions.  This plan can be tailored to their products and the disabilities 
they identified as the most important to address "first".  It might be 
useful to make these plans public to show people with disabilities what 
they can expect from a developer.
