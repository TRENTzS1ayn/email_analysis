C.9 Checkpoints 6.1 and 6.2: DOM shouldn't be required for UAs that don't 
support scripting.

I think we can add here that the SVG working group had concerns about 
platform independence and that this should also be mentioned that the DOM 
is platform independent for communicating content information with 
Asssitive Technologies.
