Who is the authority that determines what is usable? I don't agree
with this proposal (even though I understand the sentiment).

How many is sufficient? In this regard, colors are harder than fonts.
I would be more comfortable saying that 10 font sizes are sufficient
than I would saying that 16 colors are sufficient.

I am uncomfortable drawing an arbitrary distinction here (e.g., 
the larger half of available sizes for a particular font family). 
However, I think this is worth discussing (but not for very long!).

(This sentence is unnecessary at the checkpoint level.)

Right.
