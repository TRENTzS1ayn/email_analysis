Responses in JRG:

>How many is sufficient?

JRG: We don't have a requirement for how many increments now, so that would 
not change with this proposal.

JRG: I am not saying the larger half.  All it is saying that the range of 
fonts must include the largest font available for that family, which is 
part of the current requirement.  The number of increments to the largest 
font would be the same as the current requirement, basically what the OS 
environment supports in terms of increments.  The only difference from the 
current proposal is that the UA developer gets to choose the smallest font 
size they want to support.

It could be added as a note, if the group felt it was important.
