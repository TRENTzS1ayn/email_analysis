No, I said that.

So, a UA could conform by only supporting the largest font (which I
don't
think that they would do in practice). I think that supporting only one
large font would lead to poor usability. Some variation is required so
that
users can balance size requirements with the desire to optimize how much
data the user can view. I am uncomfortable saying that one big font
meets
the accessibility (and usability) requirements of users with low vision.
