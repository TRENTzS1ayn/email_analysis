JRG: I guess it comes down to whether the working group trusts developers 
to pick an usable lower limit or the user agent guidelines requiring a 
lower limit in many cases that is clearly not usable by anyone (e.g. 1 
point).  I really don't think any user agent developer who wants people to 
use their technology would hardwire the largest size font size for a 
particular font family.
