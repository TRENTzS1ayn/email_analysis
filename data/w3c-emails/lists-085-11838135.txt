I agree that that is unlikely. 

I am uncomfortable with a scenario where the user has available
9, 10, and 80 points only as I think that for many users, 80 points
will not result in a usable environment, and 36 points would be
a much better solution. In fact, 80 points would make browsing
nearly unusable for many people.

I think more granularity is required, and in the past we have
not been able to establish with certainty any granularity other
than "everything".

Is there a way to get 
 a) Biggest font.
 b) A few other big fonts.

That's why I mentioned in passing: the top half of the size range.
