Hello,

As predicted, it did not take long to split the UAAG into
pieces (I did this while I was sick, since it allowed me
to kill some time...)

I have published the 11 April 2001 Guidelines [1]
and Techniques [2] for you to examine this type of 
document division. There are otherwise no changes.

Links between the Guidelines and Techniques document 
still work. However, links from older documents to these
versions will break.

Let me know if you find any problems or would like any
improvements. Unless there are strong objections, I hope
we can continue forward with this organization.

 - Ian

P.S. Don't spend too much time on this. Gathering implementation
experience is the most important activity at this point.
