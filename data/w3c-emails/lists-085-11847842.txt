JRG: I guess it comes down to whether the working group trusts developers
to pick an usable lower limit or the user agent guidelines requiring a
lower limit in many cases that is clearly not usable by anyone (e.g. 1
point).  I really don't think any user agent developer who wants people to
use their technology would hardwire the largest size font size for a
particular font family.
 
IJ: I agree that that is unlikely. 

GJR: unlikely, but not unimaginable...  however, since stranger
implementation decisions have been made in the past and continue to be
made as we type, in the interest of moving UAAG forward, i vote to curtail
further discussion on the topic and to leave checkpoint 4.1 unaltered --
especially in light of the feedback obtained from people in the
internationalization working and interest groups...

ontologically, gregory.
