Just a minor point - when talking about font sizes on the screen, please use
the units relevant to the screen which are pixels, not points.

I agree with your concerns and think they are valid.

How about:

<NEW3>
2. Allow the user to choose from the range of font sizes from the smallest
font size presented by the font size selection mechanism provided by the
user interface of the operating system environment (lacking such a
mechanism, use the smallest font size supported by the operating system
environment) up through and including the largest font size supported by the
operating system environment.
</NEW3>

This gives you (a) Biggest font, and (b) _all_ the font sizes from the
minimum available in the user interface of the operating system (e.g. 9
pixels on the Mac as documented in my previous email - I expect similar
minimums on other operating systems) up through the largest font size (255
pixels on the Mac).

This way, no mention of a particular numeric minimum size is made by the
techniques or guidelines, and the user agent is only expected to provide as
small a size as the operating environment UI provides, which is presumably
the smallest usable size for that operating environment, taking hardware and
languages into account (OS's tend to take care of those kinds of things in
general).  And of course, a full range (rather than only 9, 10, 80) is also
required.
