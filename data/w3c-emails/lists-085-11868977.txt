Sorry about that.

This is interesting because it points at a difference that I think is
relevant but that I don't believe we've explored previously:

 - The operating system (or environment) API might allow one range of
   sizes.

 - Conventions for choosing font sizes might allow another. If I've
understood,
   the operating environment's font selection mechanism may be adopted
   by software (and in fact, we are presuming that it will be adopted
   by software running in that environment). 

One question to ask might be: what does the checkpoint mean by
"supported by the operating environment", and perhaps we need to
be more precise. 

I would not object to a clarification that we are not talking
about text drawing capabilities of the operating environment but font
size (and family) selection services that are conventional in the
operating enviornment.

So, tell me if this makes sense:
 
<NEW4>
Allow the user to choose from among the full range of font sizes offered
by
the conventional font selection mechanism of the operating environment. 
If the operating environment does not offer such a mechanism, allow
the user to choose from among the full range enabled by conventional
text drawing APIs of the operating environment.
</NEW4>

I like the idea of a cascade, but I am not familiar enough with the
operating enviornment mechanisms in play here to say whether this
specific one makes sense.
