Hello, 

In the 9 April draft [1], checkpoint 12.5 reads:

   "12.5 In each software release, document all changes that 
         affect accessibility."

I think this checkpoint is could be interpreted as making
a requirement that spans more than one release of a user 
agent. This would make conformance for a specific release 
of a user agent impossible.

Instead, I propose the following language, which I consider
an editorial clarification:

   "12.5 Document all changes from the previous version
         of the user agent that affect accessibility."

Comments:

 - The term "release" has been replaced by "version", which 
   is the term used in the section on conformance.
