I don't like complicating the checkpoint with cascading requirements and 
ambiguous terms.
I think we want two things:

1. The user to have a wide range of sizes to choose from
2. That the range of sizes available include the largest supported size
3. I don't think the minimum size needs to be specified or mentioned, since 
any practical user agent will implement smaller sizes useful to people with 
average vision.  I don't think many developers are going to start their 
design process using our document and say want we need to do to conform 
this document.  Most will be trying to add capabilities to current 
implementations to their technology.

My revised proposal:

<NEW5>
2. The user agent must allow the user to adjust font sizes based on the 
resolution of the font sizes available through the operating environment.
3. The range of font sizes offered by the user agent must include the 
largest font size available for a particular font family.
</NEW5>
