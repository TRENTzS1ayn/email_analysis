Of course I don't want to use ambiguous terms. My point is to resolve
the ambiguity by defining what "supported by the operating system"
means.
Does it mean API or font selection service?

 - Why doesn't "2" include "3"?
 - What does "based on" mean?

I don't think this proposal is going in the right direction. I prefer
Tantek's direction but need more technical understanding.
