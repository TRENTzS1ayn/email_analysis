How about this then:

<NEW6>
2. Allow the user to choose from among the range of font sizes supported by 
the operating system environment between the smallest and largest font 
sizes offered by the user agent.
3. The range of font sizes offered by the user agent must include the 
largest font size available for each supported font family.
4. The range of font sizes offered by the user agent must include the 
smallest font size available for operating system controls (i.e. menus and 
button text).  If the operating system does not offer resources to control 
of font sizes for operating system controls, the range must include the 
smallest size available from the operating environment.
