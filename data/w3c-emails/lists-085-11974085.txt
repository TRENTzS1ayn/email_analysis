The users who want the smallest screen font are not visual users but Braille
users, IIRC.  We can't necessarily judge the low end of what is needed from

I am trying to check my sources, but the value I recall as in use was '3.'  I
just succeeded in throwing WordPad into size '3' Arial.  But not for all fonts
such as Fixedsys, which seems to bottom out at '9.'
