This addresses all the concerns I had about Checkpoint 4.1, and encourages
better design that is more consistent with the operating environment.

So, yes, your proposal makes a whole lot of sense.

It makes _a_lot_ of sense, and this is far simpler than a cascade.

If the OS has a standard font size UI, developers are encouraged to use it,
or provide at least as much functionality as it.

If the OS has no font size UI, then developers are encouraged to simply
provide the full range of sizes available at the next lower level - the OS
API.

Either way, consistency with the operating environment is encouraged, at as
high a level as possible.

Thanks,
