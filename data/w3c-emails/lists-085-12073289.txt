Yes, I would rate this change as an improvement.

FWIW:  Possible wordsmith...

<NEW4.end>

If the operating environment does not offer such a mechanism, allow the
user to
choose from among the full range enabled by conventional text drawing APIs of
the operating environment.

</NEW4.end>

<NEW5.end>

If the operating environment does not offer such a mechanism, allow the
user to
choose any size offered by text-drawing services available from the operating
environment.

</NEW5.end>

If you want to stick with 'APIs' rather than 'services' that's fine, too. 
These APIs are the application developer's interface to utility services; it's
just two ways of looking at the same thing.
