JRG: The default behavior of a user agent should be to trigger 'onfocus', 
'onblur' and 'onchange' in a device independent manner which would include 
keyboard commands that move focus to links.  The guidelines ask for a 
configuration option to not have these event triggered automatically, but 
allow the user to manually trigger the events using additional commands.
