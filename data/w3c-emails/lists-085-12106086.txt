JRG: MSAA is fairly fexible from my understanding, we could ask Tim Lacy 
what IE for Windows does.

JRG: We don't use the term "standard" to refer to technologies like MSAA 
anymore.  We just talk about APIs that support accessibility, since 
technologies like MSAA have not gone through a formal standards 
process.  MSAA has a lot of flexibility and Tim Lacy could probably tell us 
more about what MSAA does in IE, but it currently does expose DOM like 
information.

JRG: I agree and 4.1 is at the P1 level.

JRG: Developers who work with Braille include Glen Gordon, Hans Resbios and 
Aaron Smith

JRG: The group can still decide on no change to the checkpoint.  In that 
case we will have a requirement that has dubious accessibility benefits for 
a number of operating systems, basically because we could not generate 
consensus on a better way to describe the required features.  I don't know 
of anyone with a disability who I have worked with who has ever wanted 
smaller fonts or comments in the working group that having smaller fonts 
sizes than what the user agent already provides was a P1 requirement 
.  That does mean somebody with a disability would not potentially benefit 
from smaller font sizes, we just have not documented the case as a P1 
requirement, so that weakens the validity of our document to developers.  I 
believe the working group wants the document to be valid as possible to 
developers.
