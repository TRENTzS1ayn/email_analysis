I don't think so. I would apply the concept of "recognize" to
humans here: if you know that if affects accessibility, you document
it. If you don't, then you don't. 

Of course, people can lie, but I don't think any document we write
can protect us against that.

I agree that this checkpoint is hard to verify (as many others
are in our document) and impossible to automate.
