Hello All,
I like Ian NEW4 wording for Checkpoint 4.1. (echoing Gregory - Nice Job!) It
is clean and addresses the issue. Further, it meets with the reviewer's
(Tantek) approval.

aloha, y'all!

for what it is worth, i would support changing the current 4.1 to
ian's NEW4 wording, as i think it rather elegantly addresses everyone's
concerns without either diluting or obfuscating the checkpoint's
requirement...  nice job, as usual ian -- synthesis is sweet when it
is actually achieved!

gregory.
