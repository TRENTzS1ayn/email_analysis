Hello,

Does anyone know if current user agents have implemented !important as 
defined in CSS1 or as in CSS2 - i.e. in CSS1 the author has preference, in 
CSS2 it's the user.

I'm assuming it's per the CSS1 spec since that is more widely implemented 
than CSS2.

Sorry for the cross-post.  Please provide a reference with your response.

WebReview only shows !important in the CSS1 chart and not the CSS2 list 
(which  they warn is not complete).

Thanks,
--wendy
