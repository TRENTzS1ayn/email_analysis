Opera 5.12 for Windows seems to handle the !important declaration. Opera,
though, can be trickier to test than Netscape or IE because of its
flexibility with style sheets.

I tossed an example up here:
http://www.geocities.com/joelsanda/important.htm.

The example's a bit extreme - the p class is defined as arial, 20em, red,
and declared important. The final paragraph (p.you) (way past the huge red
letters <grin>) is defined as arial, 20em; black.

Opera 5.12 (Windows) will not override the normal p class, but will allow me
to modify the p class with user preferences or by loading an external user
style sheet.

This should conform to CSS Level 1.

Subject: !important


Hello,

Does anyone know if current user agents have implemented !important as 
defined in CSS1 or as in CSS2 - i.e. in CSS1 the author has preference, in 
CSS2 it's the user.

I'm assuming it's per the CSS1 spec since that is more widely implemented 
than CSS2.

Sorry for the cross-post.  Please provide a reference with your response.

WebReview only shows !important in the CSS1 chart and not the CSS2 list 
(which  they warn is not complete).

Thanks,
--wendy
