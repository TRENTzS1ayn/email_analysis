Hello,

Results for IE 5.5:

IE 5.5 for Windows gives the user's !important precedence over the author's 
!important.  However, it only takes effect after opening a new page; a 
refresh doesn't make all of the changes.

I used the attached user style sheet to look at Joel's example page.  Since 
he only declared font-size as important, that's the only thing I can't 
change w/my style sheet with a page refresh. Once I  open it in a new page 
i get the smaller font and the serif font-family (rather than arial as he 
defined).  Changes in text color take effect with a page refresh.
