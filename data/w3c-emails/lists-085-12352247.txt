I propose we add to the definition of "operating environment" [1] the 
additional capabilities that a user agent may add to the conventional 
capabilities of the operating system.   I think this is important in the 
area of highlight mechanisms to include border styling.  Border styling is 
typically not a part of most operating systems, but is available on 
browsers that supprt CSS.
