I don't think that the checkpoints of Guideline 12 can be
reduced to one checkpoint. The requirements are:

 a) What must be documented:
    - feature that benefit accessibility (12.2)
    - the default input configuration (12.3)
    - software releases that affect accessibility (12.5)

    Our definition of "documentation" is not normative.
    Only the above checkpoints make requirements about
    what's in the documentation.

 b) How the documentation must be organized:
    - it must have a section just about features
      that benefit accessibility (12.4).

 c) Finally, the documentation must conform to WCAG (12.1).
