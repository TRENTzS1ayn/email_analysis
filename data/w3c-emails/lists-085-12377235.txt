Ian,
The UA may support technologies like CSS which would allow for greater 
styling of elements that receive focus and selection.  The current drafts 
seem to limit the styling of these elements to what you can do with the 
operating environment.  I believe it was the intention of the working group 
that CSS styling effects should be available for 10.2 and 10.4 if the user 
agent supported CSS styling.

I also think that in some operating systems like UNIX there are few, if any 
conventions.   The user agent then becomes the convention for which other 
capabilities can be based.

Jon
