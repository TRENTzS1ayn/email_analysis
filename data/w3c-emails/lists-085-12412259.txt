What Charles sent you to, in terms of CC/PP, is where to look for something
usable to possibly emerge.  But this does not give you something, nor is there
anything else, that you can use today.  The fact that the user is using AT,
never mind precisely what AT, is something that they have good reason not to
advertise in random web hits.

Further, some intelligence would be fine, but an automatic redirect without
recourse is not.

Build the choices into the site in static HTML forms.? Look at the "universal
usability checklist" from University of Maryland for things to cover in detail
pages accessible from a [required] "how to use this site" guide section of the
site and an [optional] "access features" section.? If you do the latter, look
at the self-representation template from the GSA for equipment vendors to
publish how they address Section 508 requirements.? Adopt a similar story line
to say how your site approaches the access requirements of the WCAG.

Do not put any look and feel variations into your site that operates by
sleight
of hand that are beyond the reach of some 'manual' control or other you give
the user.? You will just make more enemies than you win friends.

The feasible success rate of automatic 'intelligence' stuff in estimating what
the user will find advantageous is currently at a performance level where
it is
essential to make whatever the automation comes up with enter into the process
as nominations for, not constraints on, the choice/profiling of the view
through which the user operates.
