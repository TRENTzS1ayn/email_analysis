<CURRENT>
Allow the user to choose from among the full range of font sizes offered by 
the conventional font selection mechanism of the operating environment. If 
the operating environment does not offer a font selection mechanism, allow 
the user to choose any size offered by the conventional text drawing 
services of the operating environment.

<NEW>
Allow the user to choose from among the full range of font sizes offered by 
the conventional font dialog box resource supported by the operating 
environment. If the operating environment does not offer a conventional 
font dialog box resource, allow the user to choose any size font offered by 
the conventional text drawing APIs of the operating environment.
