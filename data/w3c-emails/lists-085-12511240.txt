aloha, jon!

isn't a quote conventional font dialog box unquote a technique?  i don't
think that the proposal is any clearer; nor, upon reflection, do i think
that much tweaking is necessary, provided that the 2-step cascade worked
out and notated by ian in the minutes from the 19 july 2001 telecon is
addressed...  the current 4.2 says precisely what you restated, only in a
non-techniquey manner -- what i would, then counter-propose is the
following: 

<PROPOSED2>
Allow the user to choose from among the full range of font families
offered by the conventional font selection mechanism of the operating
environment.  If the operating environment does not include a
conventional/direct font dialog selection mechanism, allow the user to
choose any font family supported by the conventional text drawing APIs of
the operating environment. 
</PROPOSED2>
