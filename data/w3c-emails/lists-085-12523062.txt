aloha, again, jon!

again, i lodge the same objection here as in the case of 4.2 and 4.1 --
dialog box is a technique; the key bit is the conventional color selection
mechanism, whatever that be...  so, again, i counter-propose:

<PROPOSED-GJR-4-3>
Allow the user to choose from among the full range of colors offered by
the conventional color selection mechanism of the operating environment. 
If the operating environment does not offer a conventional/direct color
selection mechanism, allow the user to choose any color supported by the
conventional text drawing APIs of the operating environment. 
</PROPOSED-GJR-4-3>
