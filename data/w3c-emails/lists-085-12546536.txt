Gregory,
On the call yesterday people seemed to want to use the phrase dialog box in 
the requirements, since that is terminology that is more familiar to 
developers.  I add the word "resource" to emphasize the part of the 
operating system environment user interface a user would expect from an 
application for font and or color selection.  The proposed wording doesn't 
require you to use the font dialog box resource, but only that you provide 
the same capabilities as found in the operating system resource.  Maybe 
that needs to be made clearer.

What do people think about "font/color dialog box resource" or 
"conventional font/color selection mechanism"?


Jon
