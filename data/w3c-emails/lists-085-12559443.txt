This is a proposed revision of checkpoint 10.2 and 10.4 based on 
discussions on the 19 July teleconference[1].

<CURRENT>
For graphical viewports, if the highlight mechanism involves colors or text 
decorations, allow the user to choose from among the full range of colors 
or text decorations offered by the conventional color and text decoration 
selection mechanisms of the operating environment.
</CURRENT>

<PROPOSED>
For graphical viewports:
1. If the highlight mechanism involves colors allow the user to choose from 
among the full range of colors provided by the conventional color selection 
resource of the operating environment.   If the operating environment does 
not offer a conventional color selection resource, allow the user to choose 
any color supported by the conventional text drawing APIs of the operating 
environment.

2. If the highlight involves text styling allow the user to choose from 
among the full range of text decoration provided by the conventional font 
selection resource of the operating environment.  If the operating 
environment does not offer a conventional font selection resource that 
includes text decoration, allow the user to choose any text decoration 
supported by the conventional text drawing APIs of the operating environment.

3. If the highlight involves borders and the user agent supports CSS, allow 
the user to choose from the border styling defined in CSS1. If the user 
agent doesn't support CSS, allow the user to choose the border styles 
supported by the operating environment.

NOTE: The conventional color and font selection resources for a graphical 
operating environment are typically dialog boxes available to all 
applications for the selection of colors and font information.  You do not 
need to use the conventional operating system resources to satisfy this 
checkpoint, only provide equivalent capabilities provided by the selection 
resources.  Although, supporting the conventional selection resources may 
help in satisfying other checkpoints in this document.
