Dear UAWG,

I've published the 31 July 2001 versions of the UAAG 1.0
Guidelines [1] and Techniques [2]. The list of changes is on the
Web [3] and excerpted below.

Unless we received additional comments that lead to changes in
the document (either from the UAWG or from the SVG WG), this will
be pretty much the document that we request be advanced as a
Candidate Recommendation. I hope that any changes from now on
will be mere clarifications and editorial improvements.

To get to Candidate Recommendation we need to:

 - Hear back from the SVG Working Group about our responses
   to their last call comments [4]. Otherwise, we have no
   more open issues [5].

 - Prepare an implementation report for the Director, that
   shows which requirements of UAAG 1.0 have already been
   implemented.

I encourage you to review this document. Thank you,

 - Ian

Changes between 14 July and 31 July drafts:

General

* Editorial changes based on comments from Harvey Bingham.

Checkpoints

* 2.4: Edited entire checkpoint based on discussion at the 26
  July teleconf and discussions with the SVG WG. Pause technique no
  longer mandatory, but there are requirements when it is used to
  satisfy the checkpoint.
* 4.1, 4.9, 4.12, and 9.10: These checkpoints required both
  configuration and control. Removed "control" requirement as this
  is a subclass of configuration.
* 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 10.2, and 10.4: Per 26 July teleconf, edits to
  the cascade of which services to use: range first based on what
  conventional choice utility offers, otherwise lower level API.
* 6.5: Per 19 July teleconf, clarified note that only about
  content [the checkpoint already says "content", so this is just
  clarification.] Also, move the sentence about what an available
  API means from Note to checkpoint (already done for 6.3 and 6.4).
* 9.3: Per 19 July teleconf, Added that user agent must (on
  configuration) not move focus to another enabled element except on
  explicit user request. Fixed note after the checkpoint.
* 10.4: Per 19 July teleconf, changed fourth provision to not
  require rendering of more specific than smallest encompassing
  element.

Conformance

* Important: For content/For UA feature labels now only used when
  it's necessary to disambiguate a checkpoint. This is much easier
  as it requires less reading and can be deleted in the obvious
  cases or where the labels were confusing. I have also edited some
  of the checkpoint text to make sure that it's clear when it's
  about content or rendered content.

Techniques

* 2.4: Some changes based on discussion at the 26 July teleconf
  and discussions with the SVG WG.
* 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 10.2, and 10.4: Added information about function
  calls for these services in Windows based on discussions with Tim
  Lacy: ChooseFont, ChooseColor, DrawText.
