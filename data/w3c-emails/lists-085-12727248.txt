Dear SVG WG,

On 14 July, I sent the formal response [1] of the UAWG 
to your last call comments about the User Agent Accessibility 
Guidelines 1.0. I mentioned that the UAWG had not yet resolved
on issue. We have since resolved issue 516 [2]:

     "Checkpoint 2.4 doesn't make sense for SMIL 2.0."

Based on discussions with Dean Jackson, Jon Ferraiolo, and Chris Lilley,
the UAWG modified the checkpoint so that a conforming user agent is not
required to pause a presentation in order to satisfy the checkpoint.
The revised checkpoint makes it clearer that the goal is
time-independent
access to the various outcomes available to users. Pausing the
presentation
automatically is one technique for achieving this goal. 

Dean Jackson and I have also discussed ways to implement this checkpoint
and have asked developers of SVG players for their assistance in 
demonstrating useful ways to satisfy 2.4 for SVG. 

The 31 July 2001 draft of UAAG 1.0 [3] incorporates some changes 
that relate to issues raised by the SVG WG, and you are welcome to
review it as you prepare your replies to our comments.

Thank you for your continued assistance. We look forward to 
hearing from you soon.

 _ Ian
