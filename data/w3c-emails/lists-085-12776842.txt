No, potentially "enabled".

I think the document is already sufficient on this front.

1) The definition states:
    "A non-interactive element is an element that, by specification,
     does not have associated behaviors."

   It is thus only by virtue of specification (whether markup language
or
   style sheets) that something would be considered interactive or
non-interactive.

2) The applicability provision is always in force anyway. So if not
recognized, it
   doesn't apply.
