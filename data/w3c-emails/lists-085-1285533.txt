UA desire is to be able to reference this work and check it for coverage
of UA issues. I asked and got no time commitment to finish it.

As I reported at our last UA meeting, this remains a work in progress:
the most recent working draft is dated 2001-01-04.

     http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/PWD-Use-Web/Overview.html

We have a change log and it awaits another round of edits by Judy Brewer.
     http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/PWD-Use-Web/changelog.html

Topics currently included, illustrating issues for representative users:

         Online shopper with color blindness (user control of style sheets)

         Reporter with repetitive stress injury (keyboard equivalents for
         mouse-driven commands; access-key)

         Online student who is deaf (captioned audio portions of multimedia
        files)

         Accountant with blindness (appropriate markup of tables, 
abbreviations,
        and acronyms; synchronization of visual, speech, and braille display)

[Note, braille display UA has soft-pedaled.]

         Classroom student with dyslexia (use of supplemental graphics;
        freezing animated graphics; multiple search options)
         Retiree with aging-related conditions, managing personal finances
        (magnification; stopping scrolling text; avoiding pop-up windows)

         Clerk with cognitive disability at an online grocery service
        (clear and simple language; consistent design; consistent navigation
        options; supplemental audio)

         Teenager with deaf-blindness, seeking entertainment (user control
        of style sheets; accessible multimedia; device-independent access;
        labeled frames; appropriate table markup)

EO is currently at work on business cases for different kinds of
organizations.

Regards/Harvey Bingham
