This time is fine with me, but I'm just one member from the SVG working group.

I would prefer scheduling something after the next SVG face-to-face 
meeting, which is Aug. 15-17. The SVG group is in the midst of dealing with 
SVG mobile requirements, SVG 1.1/2.0 requirements and SVG 1.0 Proposed 
Recommendation, so our plate is pretty full at the moment.

Chris Lilley returns next week. He is the one to lead the scheduling effort 
on this coordination effort.
