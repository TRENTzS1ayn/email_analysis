I believe the ideas in the "static view" option bear a slightly more
pedestrian, step by step, development, more parallel to how the "pause on
event" technique is discussed.  Not that the current draft is wrong, just
that it could be clearer.  A static view which preserves the structure and
flow of an animated experience may sound like an oxymoron to many
experience designers.

The key idea is that the static presentation should contain the action
opportunities embedded in a structure evoked by orientation cues that
reflect the virtual world presented in the animation and the activities
that take place in that world in the episode depicted.  Time is not the
only organizing principle in the presentation realized by the temporal
experience.

    1. For [87]rendered content where user input is only possible within
       a finite time interval controlled by the user agent, allow
       [88]configuration to provide a view where user interaction is
       time-independent. For example, if a presentation includes
       time-dependent user input opportunities, pause automatically to
       allow for user input, and resume on explicit user request. Or,
       offer a time-independent ("static") view of the presentation in a
       different viewport that preserves the order and flow of the
       presentation.

       offer a time-independent ("static") view containing elments that

       expose the same action opportunities.

    3. For a static view, present the action opportunities in the context of 
       orientation cues reflecting the structure and flow of the temporal
experience.

This last is an insert in the numbering sequence.  The current 3. pushes
down to become a 4. etc.

      2.4 Allow time-independent interaction. (P1)

    1. For [87]rendered content where user input is only possible within
       a finite time interval controlled by the user agent, allow
       [88]configuration to provide a view where user interaction is
       time-independent. For example, if a presentation includes
       time-dependent user input opportunities, pause automatically to
       allow for user input, and resume on explicit user request. Or,
       offer a time-independent ("static") view of the presentation in a
       different viewport that preserves the order and flow of the
       presentation.
    2. If the user agent satisfies this checkpoint by pausing content
       automatically, pause at the end of each time interval where user
       input is possible. In the paused state:
          + Alert the user that the [89]rendered content has been paused
            (e.g., highlight the "pause" button in a multimedia player's
            control panel).
          + Highlight which [90]enabled elements are time-sensitive.
          + Allow the user to interact with the [91]enabled elements.
          + Allow the user to resume on explicit user request (e.g., by
            pressing the "play" button in a multimedia player's control
            panel; see also [92]checkpoint 4.5).
    3. When satisfying this checkpoint for a real-time presentation, the
       user agent may discard packets that continue to arrive after the
       construction of the time-independent view (e.g., when paused or
       after the construction of a static view).

   [93]Techniques for checkpoint 2.4

   Note: If the user agent satisfies this checkpoint by pausing
   automatically, it may be necessary to pause more than once when there
   are multiple opportunities for time-sensitive user interaction When
   pausing, pause synchronized content as well (whether rendered in the
   same or different viewports) per [94]checkpoint 2.6. In SMIL 1.0
   [95][SMIL], for example, the "begin", "end", and "dur" [96]attributes
   synchronize presentation components. This checkpoint does not
   [97]apply when the user agent cannot [98]recognize the time interval
   in the presentation format, or when the user agent cannot control the
   timing (e.g., because it is controlled by the server). See also
   [99]checkpoint 3.5, which involves client-driven content refresh.
