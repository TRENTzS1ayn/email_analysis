PrismaBrowser is a self-voicing browser which also features a "big
character" and "high contrast color" visual display (akin to that offered
by PWWebSpeak) 

to quote from the web site of EKTVision, the developer of PrismaBrowser: 

quote
The use of PrismaBrowser is obtained through the tree control modes.

The first one allows controlling the software only with function keys.

The second one allows to manage all software functions with a voice-based
menu which can be controlled via edit keys like cursor keys, PageUp,
PageDown, etc. This mode allows the total control of PrismaBrowser with
few keys only.

With the third and last mode the user can control the software through a
joypad connected to the game port (it's similar to the previous control
mode.
