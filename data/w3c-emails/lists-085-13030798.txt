====================================================================

------------------------
Candidate Recommendation
------------------------
 - Still working on scheduling going to CR. May be early September,
   but depends on state of implementation report being ready
   beforehand.

 - Recall proposed exit criterion: one implementation of each feature.

--------------------
Face-To-Face Meeting
--------------------

1. Meeting is in the Hyatt, and no special transportation is being 
   provided since assumption is that people will stay in Hyatt.

2. We are still looking for participants:

 GR: I think that it would be good to set aside particular slots of
 the agend for big implementation holes and invited people who can't
 be there in person to attend by phone.

 IE/Windows Media   Yes.
 Freedom box        Invited, probable
 Ion Systems        Invited, probable

SVG WG last call comments

- No reply from SVG WG on our responses to their last
  call comments.

- We have sent a reminder that we are expecting their
  comments around 10 August.

 - Jon will send reminder if we don't hear from them soon.

---------------------
Implementation Report
---------------------

 - JG has been working on a tool to compile xml representation of
 evaluations into a master document that may be styled/filtered
 differently. Tools should be available to people in the next day or
 two.

 IJ: What is relationship of this tool to EARL?

 Action JG: Talk about JG's tool and EARL integration at WAI CG.

 GR: Talk to Sean Palmer about EARL.
  
 HB: I will send EARL primer to the WG.

 IJ: Collate the following:
  - 26 April, 3 May teleconf minutes
  - Opera last call review.
  - RealNetworks last call review
  - 13 November 2000 implementation report:
    http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-IMP-20001113/

 JG: I will send the report format to the WG.

 DP: Do we need to purge PWWebSpeak from our data?
 
 JG: No, the point is to show implementability.

 JG: We should check out HPR and WebSpeakster for synthesized
     speech checkpoints.
  
 GR: Check out Italian speech output browser (GR to 
     send URI to list).

 DP: Also, WebTalk (out of England?)
