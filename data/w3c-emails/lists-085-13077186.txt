Two updates:

a) Charles is not so available as I had hoped.

b) I looked at Diggles's poster.

Here is a rough outline of the state of the art in this matter:

The poster as a whole:

Is not something you would want to move to the Web as a poster layout.  Or not
as the poster layout alone.  This is a pretty awkward arrangement of the
contents if you have an interactive workstation to work with you, even for the
sighted.  The accessible transcription of this poster would generally follow
the structure guidelines of a a digital talking book. 

 NISO Working Papers
 <http://www.loc.gov/nls/niso>http://www.loc.gov/nls/niso/
 
You could have a poster XSLT that formatted the whole thing on one wall
chart. 
But the content would be in a more "pool of resources with multiple possible
tours and layouts" format.  Device independent, if you will.  What to do with
the material is reasonably clear from the talking book specification, outside
of the four figures.

Figures #1 and #2 can go into accessible SVG by the techniques already
discussed in the existing "Accessibility features of SVG."  This conversion is
a SMOP, not a question of devising new strategies.  

Figures #3 and #4 contain sensor imagery and how to handle the image
content is
a research topic.  The highest and best access is that the online version is a
data browser that has the capabiblities to generate all these figures from the
multisensor data bank and the figures are just presets cached in the data
browser, but the user can generate any other view in terms both of information
selection and representation within the capabilities of the data browser which
include binding to haptics, SVG, what have you.  In a system like this, the
heavy lifting is done prior to reduction to SVG in systems such as the
scalable
visualization toolkit

 <http://vistools.npaci.edu/home.html>http://vistools.npaci.edu/home.html

But SVG could be a good choice as the Web intermediate language for client
communication even in an interactive data browse scenario such as this.  

There are a variety of accessibility applications for the resulting software
architecture.  Adding morphologically-registered highlights to real-time
speaker video so as to provide cued speech for speech readers, for example.

 The role of User Environments in The Grid
 <http://trace.wisc.edu/docs/ud4grid/#_Toc495220373>http://trace.wisc.edu/d
ocs/ud4grid/#_Toc495220373

For use of an SVG-breathing remote web device as the client workstation in
such
a system, we could use SVG as an intermediate language to share with the Web
device; but this involves a 2-1/2 dimensional model (multiple values of
z-index, multiple layers of 2D stuff) I believe to pull off.  For example the
visual and the haptic data would make sense to put in independent SVG
layers or
independent layers of which the visual was SVG but the registration was rock
solid by the fact that both are built on registered box frames.  It is
possible
this can be done with just one graphic layer and rich metadata encoded in RDF
and included via the svg:metadata element.

The strategies that one can use today are pretty device specific: what you
would filter the imagery into for a haptic device would be rather different
from what you would filter it into for creation of a tactile graphic by means
of the Tiger device.  Each of these could be implemented using SVG as a means
of expression, but as I say this is a research topic.  Reg Gollege and Bill
LaPlant have been talking about organizing [I believe an NSF] workshop to
spawn
a research program in this area.  This may not be moving fast enought for what
you are after with SVG agent round 2.  So this puts us back to being sure we
can do access to Figures #1 and #2 and taking our best guess at the
architecture that will let us absorb image understanding and haptics as growth
areas.

If there is follow-up interest I will try to make myself available.
