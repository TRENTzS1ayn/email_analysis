Disclaimer. In order verify the utility and applicability of the Guidelines,
the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (UAWG) is testing the
Guidelines by reviewing a variety of user agents (both graphical desktop and
dependent user agents) on a variety of platforms. This review will help us
determine which requirements of the guidelines have been implemented and
which requirements have not.

1. "In order verify" should be "In order to verify"

2. the terms "graphical desktop user agent" and "dependent user agents" are
no longer utilized by UAAG -- they certainly aren't defined in:
<http://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG/glossary.html>, nor in
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/Glossary>
nor are they used in:
<http://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG/intro.html#target>

if these terms no longer apply, they shouldn't be utilized in the
disclaimer; if they do apply, then they should be defined.  i think,
however, that the parenthetic phrase be updated to:

<proposed who="GJR">
(both target user agents alone and in conjunction with assistive technology)
</proposed>

with the term "target user agents" linked to:
<http://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG/intro.html#target>
