Hi Folks:

I would like to invite all members of this list to a Birds-of-a-Feather
discussion at LinuxWorld SFO next week, on Tuesday evening.  Certainly I hope
that all of you who will be at LinuxWorld will be able to attend.  It should
be an excellent opportunity to meet face-to-face and discuss progress to date
on Gnome Accessibility and the upcoming roadmap, as well as an opportunity to
make suggestions and raise any questions and concerns.

The following message from Anne Tirsell details on the BOF.

I hope to see many of you there!

-Bill

At the upcoming LinuxWorld Expo in San Francisco, Sun Microsystems
will be
hosting an important Birds of a Feather discussion on the new
Accessibility Framework for the GNOME desktop. Your participation will
help make accessibility an integral solution in the workplace for
users with
disabilities.

Join us to discuss and learn about:

        - why it's important to build accessibility support in your
applications
        - how to quickly add accessibility support to your
applications using
                the Accessibility Toolkit
        - how to use the Assistive Technology Service Provider
Interface to
                integrate assistive technology products such as screen
readers,
                screen magnifiers, and alternative pointing devices

Our resident experts will be on hand to lead the discussion and answer
your
questions
on how to design and build accessible software solutions that benefit
all users,
not just those with disabilities.
