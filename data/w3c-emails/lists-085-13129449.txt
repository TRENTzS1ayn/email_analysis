I've noticed recently that it is taken that an alt tag such as:
alt=""
is no alt tag.  It was my understanding that this was to represent a
null hence supressed conditional view.  If however this is so than user
agents complying with this should when asked for the information not
repair it to a condition of no alt tag.

If I quirie the element, I should be provided with the information that
is available for that element such as in the case of an image, the name,
type and what ever other information has been provided for that element
and not a notice that it has a lack of conditional content?


In summary, Is not an null alt tag still an alt tag?
Should it not in all instances of conditional content view be given that
status?  if I ask for a place holder, I should be presented with <image>
or the above value representation.  If I ask for conditional view, I
should be given none.  correct?  I have reviewed the checkpoints on this
and it seems that this is so.

I'd like to know or perhaps if not, we should be certain that we have
stated our intent clearly.
