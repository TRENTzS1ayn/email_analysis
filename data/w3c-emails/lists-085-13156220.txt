It is almost as you describe.? What the guidelines say about browser behavior
could be developed in terms of cases graded into good, better, best.

Good:? When there is a non-null ALT and when images are off, the browser
displays the ALT. When there is no ALT or the ALT is the null string, the
browser shows you nothing.

Better:? The above, except that when there is no ALT or the ALT is the null
string, the browser synthesizes a repair text string which is presented
much as
the ALT text would have been.

Best:? The above, except that when the ALT text is the null string it ignores
the object or generates a synthetic placeholder depending on the setting of a
mode you can pick.

The third case, which is just about what you describe, is the best behavior.?
But there are allowed to be double-A compliant browsers that don't quite get
there.? They don't distinguish the null ALT case and they generate repair
placeholders anyway.? This was based on the feeling that it is more urgent to
have access to some information for sure, even though it is more better to
have
the option of either mode.? If you only support one of the modes, it should be
the "show repair text anyway" flavor.? Not the "hide objects with properly
indicated null ALT" flavor.

Best authoring practice would make the 'hide' mode the appropriate behavior.?
But we can't count on a perfect world where everyone is using the absolutely
best authoring practice.

Hope this hasn't confused the situation too badly.
