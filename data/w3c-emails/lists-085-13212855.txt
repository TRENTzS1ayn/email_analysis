>     3.Implementation report
>       http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/implementation/report-cr2.html
>gr: review implementation report and sent comments. when going through
>detail view, found comments to be confusing.
>jg: yes comments need to make sense out of context.
>gr: all comments should be "positive" "negative" or "NA"
>jg: comments depend on checkpoint, not to detailed, list things that are
>missing. developed a list of conditional content. will be cleaning up IE
>review.
>jg: removing view by score. will be using review by "rating", max
>conformance column = C for conformance, average conformance column - to get
>an idea of what checkpoints are giving developers the most problem. New
>style sheet. will be a link to take to comments from general report.
>gr: also in summary view, since there is expectation that document is
>stabilized. if short one liner of checkpoint text should link to actual
>check point.
>jg: working on it.
>gr: concern about proliferation of short mnemonics with out link to actual
>content. public perception will be short mnemonic.
>dp: problem with template in IE, it looks like code.
>jg: it is supposed to look like code. HB wants to modify DTD to make it
>easier to edit. goal: windows or Java application to do editing. have GR or
>DP have experience using windows access bridge for java.
>dp: there are problems with edit interaction. can read but no editing
>gr: still difficult
>jg: if I were to develop simple tool (prefer Java to run anywhere) with
>simple interface to edit. add comments to previous review. how to comment on
>a comment.
>gr: discuss with HB, use of url assertions. Sean Palmer can show how to do
>this.
>jg: how does this work
>gr: works with rdf triplets. can pull out comparisons between different
>comments/reviewers. can filter
>jg: is assertion included in report or point to something else
>gr: yes. would be good to have separate document. and pass off to EARL.
>jg: will talk with Palmer about how to do this. would be good for people to
>review comments. good idea. need to understand more about assertions.
>jg: need to assign new reviews. need multimedia players.
>dp: do you still need Openbook review.
>jg: there is a new voice browser, WeMedia.  www.webspeakster.com need to
>test version 2.0
>gr: was going look at voice in/out browser from university of Geneva (two
>weeks)
>**action dp and gr - review windows media player, and may look at
>webspeakster
>gr: difficulty because only using 1 hand.
