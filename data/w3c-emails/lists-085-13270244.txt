Hi Jon,

Looks good! Please add the following information:

 - A link to the *dated* version of the guidelines that is the
   subject of the review

 - More specific version about which format (HTML 4.01, CSS 2) is
   being reviewed. A link to the relevant specification (dated version)
   would be helpful.

Thank you,

 - Ian
