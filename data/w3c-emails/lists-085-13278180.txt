The problem arrises with at in that often, we want to browse with
something that at is not wedded to or wedded to tightly.  For instance,
If I want to use netscape 4.75 with jaws right now, there is  alot that
is not available and not necessarily because the at doesn't make it
available.  Do we ask at to do much else in our document?  I want to be
able to use a future ua with an at such that the ua makes things
available to the at rather than the at coding for something for a
specific user agent.  "this page" links are good things for all to know
because they show that it need not be necessary to scroll a long way on
a page to get to a specific piece of content on a long page.  We often
see this in the form of a table of contents at the top of a page.


It seems difficult for at to code for more than one ua of a type without
having to do custom coding for each.  I would hope that our guidelines
would help to one day bring this to an end or at least nearly so.

Yes, but this is under the control of, and should be the responsibility
of the
browser proper.

For following hyperlinks that have a URI-reference containing a
#fragment in
them, this should be considered required by Checkpoint 2.1 where it says

     * [39]Checkpoint 2.1 Render content according to specification.
       (P1)
         1. Render content according to format specification (e.g., for
a
            markup language or style sheet).

However, is there anything that says the browser should establish and
expose
programatically a view variable with is a location in the document which
the AT
will understand to be where to start reading after following one of
these
links?

I believe that by only keying on focus, we have obscured or
under-represented
this valid requirement, which is a cross-media feature of The Web
(albeit the
details are format dependent).  The location indicated by the #fragment
in a
hyperlink, on following that hyperlink, is where the referring page said
to
go;
it is something that should absolutely be within the visual viewport, as
we
have said for the current selection or focus.  It should actually be
positioned
in the viewport near the beginning and consistently positioned from case
to
case.  Not dragged into the top of bottom of the viewport whichever is
closer.

Likewise, there should be as I said above a marker for this location
such at
reading can begin there, or just before there.

How is this addressed in the Techniques?

If we don't make clear the allocation of functions where there is a
logical
allocation, we get bad results when both try to do something or neither.

Yes, the clean way to describe this is what constitutes maintenance of
the DOM
and what constitutes optimization of the view.  And how multiple layers
of
software can share in optimizing the view.  But that is a research and
development topic.  It helps to have hints as to who is the most likely
suspect
to do what.

Whether you distinguish same page links from general links is part of
optimizing the view, where the most common preference in visual view
will be
not to distinguish and the most common preference in speech only will be
not to
distinguish.  The URI-reference itself in the hyperlink makes the
distinction
available.  The Assistive Technology should at least have the
capability, as
Jaws has, because their customers will want to turn this on and most of
the
host browser's customers won't.  Coordinating the situation where both
offer
the option means putting the rendered stuff in the DOM and this hangs on
a
'views' module we don't have available to count on at this time.  So
letting
the AT take the initiative, configurable by the user as opposed to
automagically coordinated under the sheets, is about the best plan we
can ask
for.

What do you think?

PS:  Tell Rick Roderick about that Jaws adjustment.
