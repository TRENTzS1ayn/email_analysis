iCab 2.53 on MacOS 9.04 Provides a complete implementation of checkpoint
10.5, given that HTML does not define what are labelling elements explicitly.
It provides the ability to navigate via a nested table construcuted of
headers, plus start and end of page and any defined link elements.

Amaya 5.1 on Windows 98 also meets this checkpoint, by providing a table of
contents view that can be navigated - navigation is synchronised across
ultiple views of a document.

RealPlayer 8 (Basic) on Windows 98 provides VG implementation of checkpoint
2.5 - it allows captions _OR_ audio descriptions to be available, but in
doing so it is following the specification.

All tested by Charles McCN
