Hello,

Please be prepared to discuss whether the UAAG 1.0 should advance
to Candidate Recommendation status at the 30 August teleconference.
If you cannot attend the teleconference, your comments are welcome
on the list. Information on Candidate Recommendation status 
is in section 5.2.3 [0] of the Process Document.

The Candidate Recommendation document is likely to be the 31 July
document [1] with a few minor changes, in particular one from Al [2].

Regarding last call comments: I hope to hear from 
the SVG WG shortly before our own meeting tomorrow. Once we 
have received their reply, we can close our last call issues
having done due diligence.

Regarding objections, there are a total of three (and I suspect
that will be all of them): one from IBM (about checkpoint 12.1
priority), one from Gregory (about checkpoint 12.1 priority
as well), and one from Opera (about the DOM requirements).

I look forward to tomorrow's call,

 - Ian
