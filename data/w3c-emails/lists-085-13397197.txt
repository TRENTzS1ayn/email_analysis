aloha, ian!

first off, thank you for accomodating my request for a brief review so that a concrete proposal could be considered by the WG...

second, i think your proposed clarifications are excellent, and that they adequately address the issues which were raised during today's telecon...  moreover, i agree that while the checkpoint should not impose a minimal granularity requirement for either serial or direct access, a user agent SHOULD provide a combination of both functionalities to provide rapid access...

thank you, yet again, for facilitating synthesis,
gregory.
