Dear UAWG,

Congratulations! I have published the 31 August version of 
UAAG 1.0 [1] and requested that the Director advance it to
Candidate Recommendation. Below is a copy of the email message
I sent to him and the chairs mailing list.

The expectation is that the Director will make a decision
in about a week whether to advance, and if the decision is
yes, the document will be published as a Candidate Recommendation
shortly thereafter. We also plan to have a press release should
the decision be yes.

Thank you for all your hard work and dedication in keeping
this document moving forward!

 _ Ian

> Section 5.2.4 of the 19 July version of the W3C Process Document
> [2] states that before advancing a technical report to Proposed
> Recommendation, the Director must be satisfied that (among other
> things):
> 
>   "...each feature of the technical report has been
>   implemented. Preferably, the Working Group should be able to
>   demonstrate two interoperable implementations of each feature."
> 
> The UAWG intends to demonstrate for every requirement that at
> least one piece of software satisfies the requirement. The UAWG
> does not expect that a single piece of software will implement
> all UAAG 1.0 requirements. In practice, users will require a
> number of different components to work together to provide
> adequate accessibility. For example, for access to rich
> multimedia content, a user may dispose of a browser, a multimedia
> player, documentation on the Web, operating system features,
> plug-ins, assistive technologies, and other components. The UAAG
> 1.0 conformance model has been designed to allow (and expect)
> conformance by sofware used in tandem.
> 
> Please note that UAAG 1.0 is not format-specified (e.g., it
> applies to HTML, SMIL, SVG, etc.). To satisfy CR requirements,
> the UAWG intends to show that each checkpoint has been
> implemented for at least one (relevant) W3C format.
> 
> The UAWG will be meeting with developers throughout the CR period
> to discuss implementation strategies, starting with the UAWG's
> next face-to-face meeting, in September 2001.

> 
> This document provides techniques for satisfying the checkpoints

> programming interfaces (APIs), and languages such as the
> Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)

> ---------------------------------
> Abstract
> ---------------------------------
> 
>  This document provides guidelines for designing user agents that
>  lower barriers to Web accessibility for people with disabilities
>  (visual, hearing, physical, and cognitive). User agents include
>  HTML browsers and other types of software that retrieve and
>  render Web content. A user agent that conforms to these
>  guidelines will promote accessibility through its own user
>  interface and through other internal facilities, including its
>  ability to communicate with other technologies (especially
>  assistive technologies).  Furthermore, all users, not just users
>  with disabilities, are expected to find conforming user agents
>  to be more usable.
> 
>  In addition to helping developers of HTML browsers, media
>  players, etc., this document will also benefit developers of
>  assistive technologies because it explains what types of
>  information and control an assistive technology may expect from
>  a conforming user agent. Technologies not addressed directly by
>  this document (e.g., technologies for braille rendering) will be
>  essential to ensuring Web access for some users with
>  disabilities.
> 
> ---------------------------------
> Status excerpt
> ---------------------------------
> 
>  With the publication of this document, the User Agent
>  Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (UAWG) requests that the
>  W3C Director advance "User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0" to
>  Candidate Recommendation status (described in section 5.2.3 of
>  the Process Document). The UAWG resolved to request to advance to
>  Candidate Recommendation at its 30 August 2001 teleconference.

>  This document incorporates resolutions of the User Agent
>  Accessibility Guidelines Working Group to all issues raised
>  during the third last call review of the 9 April 2001 version. A
>  snapshot of the third last call issues list is available, as is
>  the disposition of comments.
> 
>  A list of changes to this document is available.
> 
>  Publication as a Working Draft does not imply endorsement by the

> 
>  This document is part of a series of accessibility documents
