See the following note from someone who is per force
compelled to use a tool by his ISP that creates broken pages
for access
--and of course broken with respect to W3C specs and error
free markup


attached mail follows:
Wow! FrontPage sure made a mess for me with the alt tags. Thanks for the
script, but I have to use the tools in FrontPage to make changes or it will
not publish to the ISP correctly. In addition to the missing equal sign,
there were many double alt tags and some orther error. They should be
correct in a few minutes.

Thanks again,
