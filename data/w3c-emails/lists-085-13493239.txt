I ran across an interesting conflict with jaws on the following page
which apparently does a fair job of using access keys.  Alt+d moves you
to a link on that page but it also happens to be the key combination
that places you on the address of a page for jaws.  Some will be happy
to know that if alt+d is used as an access key, actually, it is d the
alt is compulsery for ie users in windows, it super ceeds the jaws
function.
