As I mentioned a week ago at the Digital Talking Book technical meeting, 
here is the reference to the W3C/WAI/ User Agent Accessibility Guidelines.
They contain many checkpoints by which combined hardware and software 
may be judged for their accessibility.

     http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010831/

We've been working on these guidelines for about three years. We've 
returned to proposed recommendation three times. This is the first time
we've progressed to candidate recommendation. During this period we
particularly seek implementation experience. 

The Web Accessibility Initiative has three sets of interrelated guidelines,
    
    Web Content, 
    Authoring Tools,
    User Agents. 

DAISY Players will benefit from considering the issues raised by the
User Agent guidelines.

There are associated techniques for each checkpoint, indicating ways
that they have been addressed in some user agents.

    http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/UAAG10-TECHS/

In particular, I request that the designers of the DAISY players in
particular, and any others who are so motivated, particularly as users
of assistive technology, do a self-assessment, consider any deficiencies, and submit techniques for addressing the various checkpoints.

Submit comments to the user agent working group:
