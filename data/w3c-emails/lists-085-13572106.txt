Discussion
----------

1.User agent FTF meeting 

 - Update on participation 
   JG: Aaron Leventhal intends to attend by phone.
   IJ: Jonny Axelson may also attend by phone.

We review agenda:
  http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2001/09/ftf-agenda

MQ: We need to take caution about demos - we need to make sure
that these are not merely sales pitches.

JG: Right. The demos are in light of our requirements.

/* Some discussion of Webize (www.ionsystems.com) */

JG: Testing is 1pm PST. If we want Karl Dubost to attend
(QA guy at W3C), we might want to switch to the morning.

2. Discussion of Advancing to CR.

/* Some discussion unminuted */

RS: We need developers participating in the WG. And people who
can make decisions as well.

/* Tim leaves */

IJ: We might want to re-evaluate our teleconference schedule or
format during CR.

JG: Yes, I agree: We probably won't spend as much time talking to
each other during CR. We should use that time to work more
directly with developers.

RS: A point of leverage with Netscape - Tom Wlodkowski

JG: When we go to CR, we expect initial period to last until
mid-December.

3.Implementation report
  http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/implementation/report-cr2

/* JG reviews current implementations */

JA: I could try to review Windows Media Player 7.1 (but it
doesn't run on NT perhaps).

IJ: I recommend getting developers involved in each review (since
then they become aware of our document). It's also good to walk
through, in advance, the UAAG 1.0 with developers who will be
attending our ftf meeting.

JG: What about walking through WindowEyes with Aaron Smith?

Action JG: Contact Aaron Smith about a review.

DP: WinAmp is another product we should evaluate.

MQ: Check out the accessible mp3 player by biolink.
    http://www.biolink.bc.ca/

Action MQ: Do a review of this product.

JA: We should evaluate Quicktime (e.g., standalone player).
