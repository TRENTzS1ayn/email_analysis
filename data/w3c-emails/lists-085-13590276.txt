aloha - due to my continuing health problems, including the failure of my
right hand to heal sufficiently, i have reluctantly been forced to cancel my
travel plans, and, hence, will not be able to attend the face2face meetings
for which i had registered.  i am unsure at this time as to whether i will
be able to participate remotely, either by phone or by IRC, but i will
attempt to participate to the fullest extent possible - are the remote
participation mechanisms (read: phone numbers) readily available via WG web
space?  if not, could the staff contacts for each WG please email the
appropriate number, and/or indicate whether or not remote participation will
be possible? thanks.

wishing i were there, gregory.
