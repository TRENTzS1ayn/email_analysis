Hello,

I have updated the meeting page [1] (for the upcoming
meeting of the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines Working
Group, in Redmond, Washington) with information about joining by 
telephone. Please note that we will not have a 
bridge available to us for the entirety of the meeting.
The bridge will be available to us during the following times:

   Thursday: 9am-5:30pm PT (12pm-8:30pm ET) 
   Friday: 10:30am-5:30pm PT (1:30pm-8:30pm ET) 

The number to call is +1 617-252-1859.

Please refer to the agenda [2] if you are interested
in phoning in for a particular discussion.

Thank you,

 - Ian
