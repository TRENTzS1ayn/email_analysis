Ian and Jon,

Due to the recent World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks I have cancelled
my trip to the FTF meeting. The last I heard the FAA has grounded all
planes for the next 48 hours. Phill Jenkins made it to Dallas and had to
drive back to Austin.

If meetings are still to be held let me know if I need to call in remotely.

Regards,

Rich
