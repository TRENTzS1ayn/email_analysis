I have updated the implementation report [1] with reviews of Microsoft 
Media Player and Internet Explorer with Window-Eyes.  I have modified one 
of the views to sort the checkpoints by the number of complete 
implementations[2].   Please review the implementation report and send 
comments to the list.

Jon
