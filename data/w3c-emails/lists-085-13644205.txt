We are providing free e-mail access by phone (text-to-speech) to anyone
who
needs it to stay in touch with loved ones, etc. as a result of this
emergency.  If anyone has this need please call 1-888-576-8932.  Press
03
if you get a recording.

Regards,

p.s. We are also considering offering an unofficial off-list forum:
demo@inter-next.net that is accessible by phone for folks that want to
leave off-topic messages related to the tragedy if there is sufficient
interest.
