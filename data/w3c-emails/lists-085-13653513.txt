Should authors use scripts to capture events and create device independent
code, or will this interfere and duplicate UA guidelines? Is there a problem
here?

replies will be used in the following document:
Script Techniques for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0
http://www.learningdifficulty.org/develop/w3c-scripts.html#onfocus
this is currently a non-wcag draft

....I'm concerned with the confusion and incompatibility this could bring,
in
the WAI User Agent guidelines, the onmouseover etc. events must be made
available to keyboard users, therefore, if you duplicate focus and
mouseover - you have the situation where users will see two actions,
which could confuse, or equally cause scripting problems.

Please excuse cross posting I've not had a response yet from GL.
and thanks.
