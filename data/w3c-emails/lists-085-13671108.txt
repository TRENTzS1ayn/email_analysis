I don't believe there's a conflict here, but I will have to think
about it more.

In the "default" mode, focus and mouse events are conventionally
independent, so the author's redundancy shouldn't pose a problem.

In the enhanced mode required by the UAAG 1.0 -- keyboard
access even to mouse handlers -- nothing suggests that an
implementation would necessarily trigger a handler twice
unless on explicit user request.
