There is a problem, if it is done in the obvious way.

Having the author set an onClick and an onFocus that lead to the same script,
if it shows up as two entries in the context-adapted "what can I do?" menu, is
a real performance degrader.

Compare with the sequence of an icon and a text link that do exactly the same
thing.  The narrowband display [including speech] user really needs these
examples to be one item, not multiple.

All this means is that we need a coordinated suite of techniques, end to end. 
Not that either approach is wrong or absent.  We do need redundancy in the
content and we do need it recognizable per the format so that the UA can
handle
it appropriately, as for example folding two screen regions into one active
entity in the model before rendering it in speech.
