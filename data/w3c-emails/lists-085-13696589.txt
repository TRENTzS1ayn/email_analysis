As I originally thought, but obviously didn't explain well.

onMouseOver and an onFocus are more likely, click isn't defined only for a
pointing device is it?

If they are identical scripts handlers for the two events point to the
same function, then a UA could collapse them to one, the same as
collapsing icon and text links could be done, so the approach is possible,
it needs to be mentioned in the specifications.
