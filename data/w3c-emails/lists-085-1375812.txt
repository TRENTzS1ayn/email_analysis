In Windows, the attributes of the ALT text is controlled by the operating
system display parameters for "tool tips" (Control Panel | Display |
Appearance | Item | Tooltip). The user has controls of font size, background
color, and font weight (plus others in combination with other system
settings). I have change my tool tips to make them easier to read since
reaching the delicate age where I require bifocals

true enough, and the information you provided can't be re-disseminated often
enough, but i was referring to the inline rendering of ALT text when image
rendering is turned off--to my knowledge tooltip generation is suppressed
when image loading is turned off...  that being said, i agree that tooltips
are a positive boon to a large segment of users, and control over tooltip
size is an important issue (and, i would argue, a requirement for UAAG
compliance), but exposition of ALT via a tooltip is an implementation
decision, and not something defined by the HTML/XHTML specs...
