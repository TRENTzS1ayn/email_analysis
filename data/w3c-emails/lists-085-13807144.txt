One name is enough, it's all about how you script, I see no accessibility
issues, and certainly don't see anything bad with your demonstration, In
fact, I'm somewhat confused what you're asking, you don't mouseover the A
element, you mouseover the IMG element, if you place the onfocus event in
the IMG rather than the A (you'll need to add a tabindex in IE for this.)
then you'll get tab and onmouseover to be the same element.  This is not
surprising.

Not at all, you just use a more efficient script solution.

It already is, This is a scripting problem and not a
standards/accessibility problem, IMG and A are different elements, events
firing on those elements must be able to differentiate between the two.
