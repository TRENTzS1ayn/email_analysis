Could 'event syntax' be standardised?
Not only what is, but what might be.

A tabindex requirement, effectively involves naming again, and is
non-standard.
event.srcElement.firstChild is much nicer(txJL), but still retains a touch
of the lamp.

If no 'a' name is given, then could the 'img' name apply automatically.
More properly does it seem rational that each event should be treated in a
similar way?
ie document.onfocus?

thanks again Jim,
sorry if I seem to be thrashing around.
