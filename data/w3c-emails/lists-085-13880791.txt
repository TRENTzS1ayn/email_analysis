This is a very important planning meeting for the group.  We have just 
entered CR and we need to coordinate our activities during this period.  CR 
will be much different since we will be working on UAAG implementation 
rather than UAAG requirement issues.

I expect all members of the working group to attend!

Please let me know if you will be attending.
