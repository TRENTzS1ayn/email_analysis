The user agent working group is looking for dates to reschedule to the 
postponed 13-14 September face to face meeting at Microsoft.  Microsoft is 
still willing to host the meeting.

At the User Agent teleconference we discussed a target date of 29-30 
October as the primary date.  We also discussed using video conferencing 
technology to reduce travel burdens on participation.  Currently we are 
exploring video conferencing facilities in Boston, MA and Austin, 
TX.  Other sites could be arranged based on availability and resources.

Please indicate your ability to participate on the following dates either 
by traveling to Microsoft or using a local video conferencing system:

Primary date: 28-29 October (Monday, Tuesday)

Alternative date 1: 1-2 November (Thursday, Friday)

Alternative date 2: 22-23 October (Monday, Tuesday)

Please respond to me or Ian Jacobs (ij@w3.org) as soon as possible.
