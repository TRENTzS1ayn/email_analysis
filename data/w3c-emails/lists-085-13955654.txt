We are currently trying to reschedule the FTF meeting to 22-23 October at 
Microsoft.  We are hoping to have video conferencing sites available in 
Austin, TX and an east coast location.  We will also have a telephone 
bridge available.  If you have a problem with these dates let me know as 
soon as possible.
