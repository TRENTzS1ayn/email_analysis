Hi,
i am working in a project regarding e-learning services, in which i would
like to develop some agents to manage Chats Servers and Discussion List
status. So, it would help e-learning manager to know how many people are
using e-learning services, who is and which kind of subject are being talked
about. Where ( URL ) can i find more contents about it?
Regards, Euclides
