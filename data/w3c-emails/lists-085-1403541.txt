Does IE put the 'browse' button in the DOM or only to the screen through MSAA?

The INPUT type="file" element is a bit different, in that legal user inputs
here are not identified by type, strictly speaking, but by class.  Any object
with a 'copy' method (provided by a file system in the typical legacy-friendly
OS) is a legal selection, without regard to what is in it.

Windows has the sub-session window labeled well.  The operation that the user
should be offered is to _select a local file_.  Naming the file and browsing
the file catalog are two ways to do it.  The trick is that somehow the
implementation of a combo box for the one HTML element screws up communication
between the IE module and the front end as to what actions are available.

Has anybody tried this with Window-Eyes?

PS (notes):

terminology: Please don't call the action of invoking the file catalog
browsing
a 'submission.'  In a forms context, this term is best be reserved for
providing the answers to the questions to the recipient indicated in the
ACTION
of the form.

process (keyword = xtech):  My textbook answer would be to reply on the list
where the discussion is active already with copies to the chairs of any other
groups you think are implicated.  But there is no solid basis in experience or
CG consensus for any specific guideline on this point.

theory:  Wow, input (type=file) is a barn-door escape from "accessible by
construction" as big as scripting!  There is no schema knowledge or control at
all over what can be included here.
Do internet appliances let server thunks create files on your device?  So
is it
possible that this is usable on an internet appliance?
