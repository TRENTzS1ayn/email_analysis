The User Agent face-to-face meeting originally scheduled for September 
13-14, will be in Seattle on October 22-23rd.  The meeting will have video 
conferencing capabilities, there will be at least one site in Austin, TX 
and possibly another site on the east coast.  People interested in meeting 
on east coast should contact Ian or myself as soon as possible to indicate 
their interest and location.  The most likely east coast site would be in 
Boston at MIT.
