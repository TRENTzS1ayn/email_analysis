Dear Working Group,
I would like to thank everyone for their hard work in getting the document 
to CR, but participation is still very important.  We have come along way 
in the past three years in the development of the guidelines and we need 
everyone's participation in the next few months to turn the requirements of 
UAAG into reality for people with disabilities.  It is important that 
people attend telephone conferences, face-to-face meetings, and take and 
complete action items for evaluations, test suites and techniques.  I look 
forward to everyone's continued participation.

Let me know if you plan on attending the 4 October teleconference.
