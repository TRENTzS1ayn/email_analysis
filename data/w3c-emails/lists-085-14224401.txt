Why is there no archiving of the teleconferences, or live streamed audio
from them?  The telephone is invasive, you have to give it its full
attention, and have to really be available for the entire discussion,
whilst having the discussion streamed live, gives little opportunity for
immediate response, it does mean people who aren't able to attend through
other commitments to at least to be able to monitor and either add their
views to the list afterwards, or just pick up the phone and join
directly.

The Minutes are also very "dry", and you don't really get a full
appreciation of the discussion, being able to listen to how the
discussion actually went can I imagine save a lot of confusion for people
who didn't attend.

Jim.
