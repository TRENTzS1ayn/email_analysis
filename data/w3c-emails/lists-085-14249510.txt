I have posted an initial draft of a document titled "How To Perform a User 
Agent Evaluation for the Implementation Report"[1].  I have done the first 
couple priority one checkpoints.  Please review and tell me if you thing 
this type of information is useful or that something more or different is 
needed.

Thanks,
Jon
