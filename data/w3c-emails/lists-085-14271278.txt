Hi,

I thought I would let you know that I had a very interesting
discussion today (on IRC) with Dirk Mueller, one of the 
developers of the Konqueror browser [1], which runs in the 
KDE environment. We are evaluating Konqueror (slowly) and
exchanging ideas. When we are done, I expect to write up
an implementation report.

Konqueror has very good support for W3C specs, including the DOM,
CSS1, and HTML 4. There's also good keyboard support and
configurability.

I look forward to continuing my discussions with the Konqueror
team.

 _ Ian
