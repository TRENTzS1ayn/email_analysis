------------------------
2. FTF agenda
------------------------

Refer to agenda:
  http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2001/10/ftf-agenda

JG: Try to get Opera, Netscape to attend the "securing
developer commitment" slot.

Action IJ: contact Opera, Netscape.
Action JG: contact AT developers

JG: The implementation report will be a basis for discussion:
  http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/implementation/report-cr2-checkpoint-summary

Refer to summary of checkpoints that need attention:
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JulSep/0279

JG: Topics:

  - How do we test accessibility features?
  - How do we facilitate implementation?

-------------------------
3. How to evaluate a UA
-------------------------
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001OctDec/0006

IJ: I imagine a "high-level" document to set expectations about
pitfalls and a framework for evaluating software. The document will
include links to other resources (e.g., test suites).

JG: The how-to document might include:

 a) Framework for doing an evaluation. What systematic approach
    can be taken.
 b) Hints on where to look for information (e.g., documentation,
    developer claims, etc.)
 c) How you can identify which checkpoints you're trying to
    satisfy.
 d) Examples based on real checkpoints.
 e) How to report the results (using AERT?)

IJ: When this document is ripe, UAAG 1.0 should reference it. I don't
think the how-to document should be part of UAAG 1.0 (mostly so that
it can evolve on its own).

--------------------
4. Test suite update
--------------------

Action IJ: Invite Lofton Henderson to UAWG ftf re: test suites.

/* IJ summarizes  test suite framework */

MQ: Can this be automated 100%?

IJ: No, comparisons with expected results probably not
automatable.

MQ: I'd like a mechanism that keeps track (persistence) of what I've
already evaluated.

JG: How much of this mechanism exists already?

IJ: I hope to reuse the xslt framework (not yet available, but close).

LB: A requirement may contain several requirements. For example, a car
should be red with a black interior and white roof. These need to be
identified as distinct requirements. 

IJ: Yes, e.g., when a checkpoint mentions both audio and video, need
to have two tests.

LB: Need to be careful in reporting mechanism that the granularity is
sufficient: a UA may satisfy 4 of 5 bullets. Need people to be able to
see that a piece of a checkpoint has not been satisfied.

EH: This framework sounds like a good approach.

JG: Tim, will this help developers implement the guidelines?

/* LB leaves */

HB: Tim, do you have guidelines for preparing MS test suites?

TL: Nate would be able to discuss this.

IJ: Good to talk about tools, processes, frameworks at meeting.

IJ: I haven't even talked about processes for contributing test
cases. The XSLT framework includes this bit, but I've been more
interested in the encoding first, contributions second.

JG: It's time consuming to convert text email to a specific XML
format (such as the implementation report format).
