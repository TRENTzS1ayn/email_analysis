Minor change (as to make that statement make sense):

<q>For development: When we don't implement a checkpoint, we either think 
"Good idea" or "What do we need that for?". For the case of an HTML browser, 
we have mostly thought "Good idea". </q>

That should be <q>When there is a checkpoint we haven't implemented, we 
either think of it "Good idea" or "What do we need that for?". In our case 
making an HTML browser, we have mostly thought "Good idea". </q>  


We have not yet gotten to the state that we don't implement something 
*because* it is a good idea...
