As Jim Allen and Katie Haritos-Shea are doing a comparison of WCAG/508,
here is a worthwhile reference.

Jim Thatcher has done an effective summary, undated (last spring)

Section 508 Web Standards and WCAG Priority 1 Checkpoints
A Side-by-side Comparison

     http://www.jimthatcher.com/sidebyside.htm

Includes two tables, WCAG P1 vs 508, and 508 vs WCAG P1 + some P2
