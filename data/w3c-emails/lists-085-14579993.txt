I don't think so.  We (I'm a member of the TC) are about to make a public 
release of all of the materials (**including much better documentation**), 
for the purpose of starting to build the XSLT test suite from available 
contributions.

It has also been a goal, since fairly early in the designs, to "genericize" 
the XSLT procedures enough so that they would be widely useful (beyond 
XSLT).  Finally, I think there is the intention to submit it work to W3C 
(QA) when it is in proper shape.  Already, Kirill Gavrylyuk
(TC member from Microsoft) is presenting the "Infoset-ize" parts at the 
first QAWG/IG f2f in Brussels.

Regards,
-Lofton.

p.s.  As a courtesy, I intend to email the TC and inform them of my ad-hoc 
speaking on the TC work.  I'll invite any comments about others borrowing 
the work. -LH.
