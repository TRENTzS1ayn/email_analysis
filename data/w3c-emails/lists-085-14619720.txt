Hello,

I've published a document entitled:
  
  "Notes on discretionary behavior in 
   User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0" [1]

This is a prose description of just about every
optional requirement I could find in UAAG 1.0,
as well as some other characteristics of UAAG 1.0
requirements (e.g., permitted exceptions).

This prose description should be turned into a machine-readable
description that will be used to allow testers to create a
specific version of a test suite based on which requirements
they do or don't satisfy.

Your comments welcome,

   -Ian
