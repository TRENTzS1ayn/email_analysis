Hi All --
Here's the announcement NISO sent out to its voting members yesterday.
The site (www.niso.org) offers the draft standard in our HTML version as
well as PDF.  They've also added a neat feature that collects comments
and creates a database of them.  NISO just completed this new website,
so don't be surprised to see something quirky occasionally.

Attached is the cover memo that provides background to potential
voters.  Although I tried, I'm afraid I failed to adequately describe
the high volume and quality of work you all put in to create the draft
standard.  Well done!

Kind Regards,
Michael

BALLOT ANNOUNCEMENT
The proposed national standard for the Digital Talking Book
(Z39.86-200x) is out for ballot and review November 1-December 17,
2001.

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO
All NISO members are invited to review and VOTE on this proposed new
NISO standard. The deadline for ballot is December 17, 2002.

WHY THIS STANDARD IS IMPORTANT
This new standard enables a powerful and flexible reading system that
will make electronic resources accessible to millions of
print-disabled readers worldwide. Enabling the efficient presentation
of information through a variety of alternative media, this new
standard will make it easier for all readers to navigate the digital
world.  The attached memo from the committee chair, Michael Moodie,
provides additional important information on the history and
high-points of the Standard.
