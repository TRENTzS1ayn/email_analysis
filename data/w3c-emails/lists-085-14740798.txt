Charles,
We are looking to integrate Earl into User Agent at some point, but right 
now if you submit something in EARL format it would need to be manually 
translated to the UA Implementation Reporting Format.  This takes a lot of 
time, so we prefer that you use the current XML format.

There is a XML template for HTML:
