OK, I used the XML dialect of Jon's to evaluate some bits of iCab - there are
a couple of features it adds to the list of implemented things, and a bunch I
didn't really check because they weren't important for the Candidate
Recommendation check. I am planning to do the same for Amaya, which should
provide a couple more, when I get time. I have attached my report and the
style sheet I added to it so I could read it.

  Charles,
  We are looking to integrate Earl into User Agent at some point, but right
  now if you submit something in EARL format it would need to be manually
  translated to the UA Implementation Reporting Format.  This takes a lot of
  time, so we prefer that you use the current XML format.

  There is a XML template for HTML:
