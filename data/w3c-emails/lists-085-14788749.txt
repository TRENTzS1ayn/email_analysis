Al, The answer is yes.  Some times, the image details are just too
difficult to see or the image contrast is not good enough or the person
has vision severe enough that images are not good ways for them to
attain info but they can still read the text.

Question:

Are there some low vision users who should be able to have both the ALT
and
image shown at the same time? So the ALT is there to explain what is in
the
image of which you see a fragment?

There was the suggestion earlier [failing to find reference at the
moment]
that
LD users should have access to both the text equivalent and the image
equivalent, displayed together.
