Thank you, David.  

May I ask a follow-up clarifying question?

What you said here could describe a case where the image is completely useless
and simply giving the user the text is as good as it gets.

But that may not be what you meant.  I meant to ask, are there in between
people for whom the image is perceptually degraded to the point that the
assist
from the text is highly valuable; but still there is residual utility in the
image perception so that the text alone is inferior to having access to the
text with image, together.
