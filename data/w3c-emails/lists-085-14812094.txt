----- and the answer is still yes which I guess I didn't make clear
enough in my haste to describe lacks.  A person with failing vision who
is used to images may need the text to support their continued visual
reduction till they are at a point where they are using something other
than vision.  Or perhaps that vision remains stable but images alone are
not enough because of what they once had and now have lost.

Thank you, David.

May I ask a follow-up clarifying question?

What you said here could describe a case where the image is completely
useless
and simply giving the user the text is as good as it gets.

But that may not be what you meant.  I meant to ask, are there in
between
people for whom the image is perceptually degraded to the point that the
assist
from the text is highly valuable; but still there is residual utility in
the
image perception so that the text alone is inferior to having access to
the
text with image, together.
