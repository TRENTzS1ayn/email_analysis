Further question, just seeing if it has been raised.
On both netscape 6 and ie5, the message which pops up
when I enter or leave a secure area also appears to 
have a fixed size font.
We have had testers complaining that they couldn't read
the text on the buttons. 
Again this appears to be independent of the font size selected
for body text.

Is this also known of?

Regards DaveP
