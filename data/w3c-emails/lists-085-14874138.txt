Jon, I have nothing new to report on charter progress. Although I spent
some time with Judy at the AC meeting last week, we did not make any
progress on the question of rechartering.

I attended the QA meeting in Brussels (minutes not yet available). We
talked
about QA as a whole at W3C, but did not get into details about a
specific
test suite mechanism. However, it was good to share with the WG our
initial
experience in this area, and to meet Lofton Henderson and others on the
WG.

While I still think that test suites are an important complement to
UAAG 1.0, my current expectation is that for the next couple of weeks,
the details of rechartering will take priority over active development
of
test suites.
