These should help the non-Microsoft development efforts someday.
Wonder how soon?

>   GNOME Accessibility Framework, Early Access release
>   ---------------------------------------------------
>     The GNOME project comprises a desktop user environment: a graphical
>     desktop user interface and a set of user-interface libraries; as
>     well as a suite of office productivity tools and applications.  GNOME
>     is commonly part of Linux distributions (such as those from RedHat,
>     TurboLinux, VA Linux, etc.) and it is the future graphical desktop
>     for Sun Solaris workstations and servers.  GNOME 2.0 is the upcoming
>     major release of the GNOME user environment, and it will support
>     accessibility for people with disabilities through built-in keyboard
>     access, and accessible applications which implement the GNOME
>     Accessibility Framework.
>
>     The GNOME Accessibility Framework is made up of several key pieces:
>
>       1. The Accessibility Toolkit (ATK), which is a definition of
>          the accessibility contract for GNOME user-interface elements;
>
>       2. The GNOME Accessibility Implementation Library (GAIL), which
>          implements the ATK on behalf of the GTK+ user-interface library
>          (a library of user-interface elements comprising things like
>          buttons, menus, scrolling text fields, etc.);
>
>       3. The desktop Assistive Technology Service Provider Interface
>          (AT SPI), which unifies all of the accessibility information
>          of applications running on the GNOME desktop (be they standard
>          GNOME applications, Java applications, or something different)
>          into one central interface for use by assistive technologies
>          like screen readers, screen magnifiers, and on-screen keyboards.
>
>     Like the rest of the GNOME project, the GNOME Accessibility Framework
>     is completely open-source.  The GNOME Accessibility Framework is
>     licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL).
>
>     This Early Access release includes the final definition of the ATK,
>     an edition of GAIL that is roughly 70% completed, and an early
>     edition of the AT SPI.  Also included in this release are a set of
>     test tools which both test the accessibility information in GNOME
>     applications, and illustrate how to develop assistive technologies
>     on top of the framework.  The GNOME Accessibility Framework is now
>     ready for GNOME application developers to begin the process of making
>     their applications accessible, and for assistive technology vendors
>     to being developing assistive technologies for the GNOME user
>     environment.

>   Java 2 Software Development Kit version 1.4 Beta 2
>   --------------------------------------------------
>     The SDK is the reference release of the Java platform, containing
>     core support for Accessibility, the Java Runtime environment, and
>     the Java Plugin for use with web browsers such as Netscape and
>     Internet Explorer.
>
>     Version 1.4 Beta 2 contains the Java Accessibility API, the Swing
>     user-interface libraries (which support the Java Accessibility API),
>     and support for loading Assistive Technologies into the Java Virtual
>     Machine.  New for accessibility in version 1.4 is improved keyboard
>     navigation in a number of Swing components - including the ability
>     to navigate links in the Swing HTML components, first-letter navigation
>     in list components, and tabbed pane keyboard mnemonic support.  Also
>     new for accessibility are several new AccessibleRole definitions,
>     several new system properties, and AccessibleExtendedComponent, an
>     addition to the Java Accessibility API.
>
>     A detailed list of the new accessibility features in Java 2 SDK 1.4
>     can be found at:
>       http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/guide/access/new-features.html

>   Java Accessibility Helper version 0.4
>   -------------------------------------
>     The Java Accessibility Helper is a test tool for Java
>application            developers and testers to help them find and fix
>accessibility problems
>     with Java applications.  The Helper runs in a separate Java VM, and
>     works by exercising the application to be tested via standard
>     Java APIs, and via the Java Accessibility API.  The Helper generates
>     a report that includes a prioritized list of problems and potential
>     problems with the application being tested (e.g. verifying that
>     all input fields in an application can be reached using only the
>     keyboard).
>
>     Version 0.4 includes support for testing Java applications and
>applets,      and fixes a number of bugs in the previous releases.  The Java
>     Accessibility Helper development team maintains a special e-mail
>     alias for questions and issue regarding it.  Please direct your
>     Java Accessibility Helper e-mails to: jaccesshelper@sun.com
>
>     To download the Java Accessibility Helper version 0.4, go to the Java
>     Developer Connection Early access page (log in, or establish yourself
>     as a new user if you haven't logged in before):
