Per my task,

Technique for Changing font size of tool tips (alt tags), dialog boxes,
text
selection in Windows environment

In many browsers, "alt" attributes pop-up on the screen in the form of
"tool
tips"

In the Windows environment the foreground/background color and font
type/size/color/weight for "tool tips",  dialog boxes that appear as a
result of ALT attributes, or javascript commands, and text selection,
are
configured in the Control Panel.

Start | Settings | Control Panels | Display

in the Display Control panel select the "appearance" tab
In the Item (Alt-I)  pull down you will find the "tool tips" and
"message
box" and other controls.
select "tool tips"
the Tool tip "Color" (Alt-L) and "Font" type (Alt-F), Font "Size"
(Alt-E),
Font "Color" (Alt-R), and Bold - Italic controls (no short cut keys for
Bold
or Italic, however you can tab to these controls) become active. With
these
controls a user can change the background color and font type/size/color
and
weight for Tool Tips. Note: foreground color is the same as font color.

Dialog boxes are configured by selecting "Message Box"
the "Font" type, Font "Size", Font "Color", and Bold - Italic controls
become active. With these controls a user can change the font
type/size/color and weight for Dialog boxes.
the background color for Dialog boxes can be changed by selecting "3D
object" in the Item pulldown box and selecting the appropriate color
from
the "Color" palette (ALT-L) to the right.

the foreground and background color of text selection can be configured
by
selecting "Selected Items" in the Item pulldown. background color is
configured using the "Color" (Alt-L) palette to the right of the Item
control. Foreground (text) color is configured using the "Color" (Alt-R)
palette to the right of the Font control.

Jim
