AG:: yes, the extent of buffering is implementation dependent.  If information
loss is a consequence of pausing, pains should be taken to allow the user to
decide what information to miss -- the old or the new.

If information loss is always true on pausing a real-time stream, the user
should perhaps have to confirm the pause.  If loss begins after a finite
timeout, an advisory when the user pauses is probably appropriate, possibly
with a transient (no response required) alert when the buffer is full and bits
start dumping over the edge.

AG:: leave as is.  For an ADD user the tone of the presentation described by
the commenter could be totally defeating.  These users will use the form field
where you enter your stock symbol, or scroll the list, and not wait for a
symbol to stream by on a ticker.  On the other hand, other users are quite the
other way, as illustrated by the fact that scanning software is a standard
piece of assistive technology.  It just cycles the focus through the plausible
next actions until you say 'yes' to one of them.

AG:: in SMIL you always know the synchronization requirements across streams. 
So the SMIL player knows if you can pause one component independently or not. 
If the two media objects are referenced from the same SMIL file, the answer to
this question is given by the SMIL markup and the semantics of that markup.

 <http://www.w3.org/TR/smil20/smil-timing.html#adef-syncBehavior>http://www
.w3.org/TR/smil20/smil-timing.html#adef-syncBehavior

Beyond that, it should be the smallest super-presentation (where the
collection
of all open windows in a windowing system is a super-presentation) for which
there are sync constraints to require it.  So the whole screen doesn't have to
stop when you stop one thing, necessarily.

AG:: I would like to have an example of hardship imposed by the simpler rule
before considering this level of hair.  That is for 2.1 and 2.2, I don't see
the problem.  8.1 is another matter.

AG:: This is a genuine problem.  The browser configuration item does not
decide
whether it implements Flash or not.  It just checks locally for a compatible
handler for the medium.

AG::  Who is saying what, here?  I can't follow the boundaries of 'animation'
in any of the above.

Yes, there is interaction between 3.3 and 2.6 where timed text captions are
synchronized with a video, for example.  Stopping the text from changing will
(depending on the SMIL synchronization details as discussed above) sometimes
require that the video be stopped.

There may be a requirement buried in here for a pop-on presentation method to
be an option for any timed-text stream, but we haven't studied it in enought
detail to define a hard and fast requirement.

AG:: I do not concur with this proposal.  In the earlier discussion, we
pointed
out that this positioning capability was so a low vision user could control
what portion of the video is adjacent to the captions and hence visible within
the cropped effective viewport along with the captions when the user is
using a
high power of magnification.  Moving the captions into a separate window
prevents the user from having the juxtaposition capability they need.

Another viewport is sometimes desirable, but does not satisfy this
requirement.

What happens to the rest of the layout?  It is unaffected, as if grouped into
wallpaper, for the purposes of positioning the caption display.

AG:: Yes.  Should be relative where possible, absolute offset from some
articulable landmark when relative is not possible.  20% of first of 80 clips
is useless.  20% of 32 sec. for 1st of 80 clips is meaningful.
