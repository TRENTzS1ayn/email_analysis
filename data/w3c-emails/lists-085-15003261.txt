This is the latest on the.....
 
Draft: Mapping Comparison Between
Combined U.S. Section 508 Standards and
UAAG 1.0 Requirements & Priorities

...and linked documents.  The individual comparisons (the links across
the top of the page) are not populated with the comparisons yet.  I
wanted to wait until we have the combined document finished.  Allen has
a good model for that which I will incorporate.

.....We would appreciate comments as we are going
along........thanks.......Katie
