Sorry, these are notes that I took for myself (based on
the discussion). These are not formal review comments
from MS or RN.

Thanks for your comments, Al. My comments below preceded

IJ: I don't think it's a question of hardship, just of conformance
consistency. I have been talking to vendors and saying "the conformance
model allows you to conform for certain formats only, so if you
implement
3 video formats, but only meet the requirements for two of them, you
can still conform for those two." Therefore, statements such as
"for all formats that you implement" seem inconsistent with the
desired flexibility in the conformance model.

IJ: I'm not sure I understand. It's true that the browser doesn't
decide, but the claimant does (by including the Flash plug-in in the
claim).

IJ: I would distinguish animated text (by which I mean scrolling along
the bottom of the screen) from changing text (e.g., as subtitles in
a movie are replaced by new subtitles after a few seconds, and in
synchrony with the video track). 

There is an issue here: define "blinking". Do changing subtitles
count as blinking text? (I hope not.) At what rate does blinking
start?

IJ: I'm not sure I agree. I was aware of this case when I made
the proposal. It seems like an implementation detail to me whether
the captions track is moved to a global x,y that happens to
be in the same viewport, or whether it is put in a new viewport
that is then moved to the same global x,y. One difference might be
that the new viewport has chrome to it, and that chrome might get
in the way of the video content behind it. But suppose it doesn't
have a lot of chrome? Then it seems to me to provide the same
functionality, but the ability to move the viewport is provided
by the windowing system, not the user agent directly.

IJ: Yes.
