I begin to see what you are thinking.  But I am not sure you can, in the
visual
presentation technology that people are using today, get a transparent
background in that "new viewport" such that only the text obscures the video,
and the video content shows through as the background for the text.

If the "new viewport" can be made such that the text is all that shows in that
viewport, the background area not filled by the glyphs of the text is
transparent, and the positioning of the new viewport is free so the text can
overlay the video in any relative relationship as chosen by the user, then
"same or different viewport" is indeed a technicality not bearing on the
requirement.  I guess I was translating your "a new viewport" as "another
window" and presuming that windows start with an opaque layer at the back.
