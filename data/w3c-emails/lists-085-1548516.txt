AG2::  I agree that "all ... that the user agent implements" as used here is
intended to be scoped to the functions set out in the conformance claim.  I am
not so sure this requires, or is best clarified by, the changes here proposed
in the checkpoint language.

AG2::  It may leave room for confusion.  On the other hand, so far I would
tilt
toward making this unambiguous by a more explicit statement in the conformance
section and possibly a footnote the first time the term 'implements' is
used in
this way.  Perhaps dropping the 'all' would help, as it doesn't really add
anything.

<newNew 2.1>
?? "For format specifications that the user agent implements*,
?? make content available through the rendering processes
?? described by those specifications."
</newNew 2.1>

* The formats 'implemented,' for the purposes of assessing conformance, may be
limited by the particulars of a conformance claim, see [reference to
conformance section].
