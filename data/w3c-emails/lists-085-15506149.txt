Dear Working Group,

The current charter for the UAWG [1] expired at
the end of October 2001. We have a draft revised
charter [2] available for your review (and discussion 
at the 20 December teleconference). The primary changes
are:

 1) Extends the WG to 1 April 2003. The expectation is that
    UAAG 1.0 will advance to Recommendation in the fall of
    2002, and that after that the UAWG will work on 
    post-Recommendation support and will compile an initial
    set of requirements for future work.

 2) Team participation. Ian's time will drop to 15% starting
    1 January 2001. Ian will continue to edit UAAG 1.0 but
    there will be a new Team Contact.

 3) The focus of work is still on UAAG 1.0 advancing to
    Recommendation, but the charter is now oriented towards
    getting implementation experience. The charter does not
    require UAWG to produce a test suite, but this is still
    a good idea and would benefit UAAG 1.0.

After review from the UAWG, the charter will be taken
to W3C management, and if approved, announced to the
W3C Membership.

Your comments welcome,

 _ Ian
