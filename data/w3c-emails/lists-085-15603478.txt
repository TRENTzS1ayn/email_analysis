I suspect people are looking for a magic bullet which will work with
existing, unmodified, badly coded web pages.

Given that the WAI folks have issued other guidelines on how websites
should be (re)written for accessiblity, that goal seems unreasonable even
if it was achievable... and I doubt it's achievable.

There's a reason HTML was originally so bare-bones; it was _intended_ to be
semantic markup, which different browsers could style differently. Then
everyone started adding features which defeated that goal. The proper
solution is not to try to kluge around those features, but to abstract them
back to the semantic layer and work with that. Which is part of what the
XML and stylesheet efforts were all about.
