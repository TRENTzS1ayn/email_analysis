a color deficiency is also one which does not allow color to be
deffinitive in discerning where focus is.  It was implicit in our
discussion even though it was not necessarily discussed or implied.  I
however do not take issue with the approach and there are certainly
other cues that are available.  I only raise it as a point for practical
consideration when determining whether or not to remove this aspect from
our document.  I recall also that it it is a part of the wcag.  I am
still uncertain that we are covered adaquately if we remove this.

I don't think we should promote that technique since we are
requiring that information about selection, focus, etc. be
available through APIs. The definition of priority does not include
"ATs may need information this way", it's only about user needs.

I don't believe this checkpoint was every meant to help people
who might have trouble with the meaning of color, only with
the perception of color. I have no recollection of discussions
about accessibility issues related to the interpretation of
specific graphical mechanisms. I don't doubt that there are
such issues, but I don't recall that entering into our discussion
about the use of colors.

In short, I only recall discussing the needs of users
with color deficiencies, and those needs are met by
the ability to change color combinations.
