hi Jim (see MN below):

>You have heard from Cathy Laws that the Browse Button is recognized with HPR

MN:  I'm not disagree'ing with anything Cathy said, but I still do not
understand "exactly" where the "browse" button is on this scenario.  Is there
a chance that HPR "understands" the INPUT TYPE="file" and creates the
button in its' DOM?  (not even sure I'm asking that correctly...)



>But HPR is missing something. As a sighted user, I can type

MN:  based on the quick test I did prior using the MSAA object inspector,
i'd agree that the button is not properly exposed in IE for MSAA to
query/find.



>As I understand it, JFW parses HTML and, like HPR, JFW has a flaw in their

MN:  until I understand this, i'm not ready to say that.
