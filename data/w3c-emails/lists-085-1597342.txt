MN:  thanks for confirming for me, that Amaya under Windows does not use MSAA.

MN:  agree on your "screen-scraping"comment, and would also agree that we'd
prefer the "browse..." button to be in the DOM tree.  i'm still stuggling
a bit to understand this INPUT TYPE = "file" thing and how the UA
responds or treats it...

MN:  thanks for walking me through the HTML side of the equation

MN:  I would agree (or should I say hope) that the "browse" button would
be available to a COM DOM aware "anything", and that was my point of
testing using the object inspector of MSAA (MSAA is based in part on
COM technology), and why this topic caught my attention, when the
object inspector failed to "see" the browse button.  Ouch!   I now also
would be curious to understand just exactly how IE handles this
and why it doesn't seem to expose the button, such that MSAA can
query/find it?

MN:  The object inspector is one of the many utility tools which ship as
part of the
software development kit (SDK) for Active Accessibility.  If you are running
Windows 98 or newer, I "believe" you already have the operating system
components installed which support MSAA.  If you goto

MN:  http://www.microsoft.com/enable/

MN:  there is a link on the far right column "Active Accessibility" which will
take you to the page which should answer all your question far better than
I can and also provide a download/install link.  I know "some" screen
readers and other AT applications make use of MSAA.

MN:  just trying to learn <smile>
