This provision is in the document as a result of issue 458 [1]:

 "Do link highlighting requirements apply to all zones of an image map? 
 What is required granularity?"

The UAWG resolved at its 1 Feb 2001 teleconference [2] not to require
highlighting of each zone, aware of your initial email [3] on this 
topic.

While it may be feasible for a user agent to highlight active 
regions (for client-side image maps), we reasoned that in many 
cases, the author would be doing this, and therefore, it was not 
always required. We did not want to add a repair functionality 
when the author did not provide an image with borders built-in. 

Do you have new rationale for why we should reverse our earlier
decision?
