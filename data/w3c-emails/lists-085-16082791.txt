Dear All,

You may want to check out the use of SMIL and the navigation features
developed by the Digital Accessible Information SYstem (DAISY)
Consortium.

find more at: http://www.daisy.org


The navigation model for linking into audio content is very powerful.
This work is being continued in concert with NISO and you can learn more
at: http://www.loc.gov/nls/z3986

This same navigation model has been introduced to the Open eBook Forum
and is expected to be  incorporated in the version 2 of their
specifications for eBooks.

Hope this helps.

Best
George

I received an interesting question from a colleague who has a large
number of audio files and text transcripts on his site (see below). I
am not aware of a convention for abbreviating links to transcripts,
but perhaps one of you is. (In my experience, a plain-text link
called "Transcript" is most common.)
