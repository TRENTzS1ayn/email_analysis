"The macula has the highest concentration of cones, the cells that provide 
color vision.Thus
with the degeneration of the macula, it results in damage to the cone color 
cells. Patient still
see color but color perception may become more and more impaired in 
advanced macular
degeneration."

That does not suggest that we cannot use color, just that discrimination among
small color changes may be lost. Nor do I read that to suggest that just 
black and white is
appropriate, but that gray-scale differentiation is still useful.

I wonder if perceived brightness for different colors is consistent across 
different manifestations
of macular degeneration?  Are there better choices (such as color opposites)?

If there are any universal recommendations here on perception of gray scale 
vs color, we should
include them, at least by reference.
