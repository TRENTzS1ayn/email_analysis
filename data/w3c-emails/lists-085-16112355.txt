Hi Cathy,

Thanks for sending this information. I have a couple of
comments and questions below.

Can you define containing structure? Does this mean:

  * The element whose semantics is to group a number of descendant
    elements?

  * The rendering of an element that, in two dimensions, encloses
    some other content?

In short: can this be determined from the markup language alone?

The binding between process and window is something that is likely
done at the OS level. In UAAG 1.0, we talk about "viewports".

UAAG 1.0 doesn't require any particular type of selection; it can
be text-only or text-and-images, etc. Our requirement is that, 
whatever the selection encompasses, that information be available
through the API.
