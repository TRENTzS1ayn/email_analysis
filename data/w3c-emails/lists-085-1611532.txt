I'll clean these up later, but I wanted to get them to the web now so I could
point to them.

While techniques are informative only, it is expected that developers seeking
to implement the document are at least familiar with that document before
they start bringing questions to the working group. --So beef up the value a
bit

from 1.1:
" No format allows authors to encode all of their knowledge in a way that a
user agent can recognize. "- this is too strong, and reasonably likely to be
untrue. Should be less based on an ideal model and more on practicalities.

s/physical disabilities/motor disabilities/

may not understand fluently the natural language of spoken content. These
users are likely to benefit from the same visual rendering of text
equivalents that make spoken language accessible to people with a hearing
disability. -- this isn't a great example, since people with hearing
disbilities are also among the people for whom text equivalents are not the
most appropriate form.

2.3 Aargh!! is it possible to rewrite it into smaller chunks?
   Provide access to all "contditional content" that is included in the tree
by one of the following...
   Provide access to related conditional content by one of the following...
(access according to spec is already covered by 2.1)

How are 2.5 and 2.6 different?

5.3 what if the user refuses to open a new viewport? Is the ability tyo force
content update to occur in the same viewport implied? (seems to be to me, but
should be clearer please)

6.5 why different wording style from 6.{3,4}?

11.1 and 11.2 content labels mean that it is possible to get to level A
without letting the user know how to use keyboard control of content :(

11.4 tighten up conformance requirement ('most' is a bit vague, but it is
even so only in informative note...)

12.1 "ensure the documentation is available in at least one form that..." to
distinguish between having WCAG-AA doc for myBrowser 4.0 but not version
5.0...

3.1 conformance requirements come from checkpoints, plus cliaming conformance
according to this section. (Explicitly?)
