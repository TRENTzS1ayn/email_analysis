Hello,

I've started to incorporate into a comparative table [1]
comments we've received from AT developers about API
requirements they would like UAAG 1.0 to make.

I will continue to incorporate suggestions that AT
developers send. To make my life easier, please
organize your comments according to the categories
of the table:

   - Content
   - Rendering structure
   - Style
   - User interface/session variables
   - Events/change notification
   - Programmatic control
   - API requirements

This categorization isn't perfect, but fits well
with UAAG 1.0.

Note: There is a link in the document that gives a
linearized version of the table [2].

Comments welcome.

  - Ian
