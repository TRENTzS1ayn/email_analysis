Hi folks,

it might be intersting to compare the requirements that AT developers have
from the DOM with the W3C Note about requirements for a component
extension (i.e. plugin) interface - http://www.w3.org/TR/CX

One of the assumptions is that a plugin can itself be asked to call a plugin
- and the paralell in my mind is that an assitive technology might call the
browser as if it were a plugin.

Feedback from assistive technology developers on that document would also be
useful.

Cheers

  A lot of our requests are related to screen coordinates / rendering
  information. I do understand that this is not part of DOM, but for a screen
  magnifier is an essential information. Maybe DOM could describe a way how to
  get rendering information. Maybe it would be possible to have another
  standard defining how the rendering engine is providing information to the
  outside world.

  Best regards
