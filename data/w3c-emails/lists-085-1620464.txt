Thanks for sending comments, Charles. My comments below

IJ: Do you mean "Make the Techniques document better"? I agree,
and we have some ideas for doing so (profiles, test suites [0]). Do
you have more specific suggestions than "beef it up"? It's
already 150 printed pages.

IJ: I can soften the statement, but that would seem to make it
more practical and less ideal.

IJ: Actually, we explicitly chose "physical disabilities" over 
"motor disabilities" (since the 6 December 1999 draft [1]). Do
you have a compelling argument to change back?

IJ: Checkpoint 2.6 is referenced by 2.5, 4.4, and 4.5, so the WG
decided to make it its own checkpoint at the November
face-to-face meeting at AOL [2]. The configuration requirement of
2.5 is stronger than 2.3 (since it requires the UA to render
everything at once, so, for example, the query technique doesn't
satisfy 2.5).

IJ: I think that if the user refuses, then the viewport doesn't open.
I don't think there's any need to have a requirement to force
content update since the user can always do an HTTP GET.

> 6.5 why different wording style from 6.{3,4}?

IJ: This was actually a conscious decision by me. The length of the
list in 6.5 ("content, user interface controls, selection,
content focus, and user interface focus") made the following
formulation awkward:

   "6.5 Provide programmatic alert of changes to content, user
   interface controls, selection, content focus, and user
   interface focus using standard APIs."

I tried 6.3 and 6.4 using the current 6.5 structure, but decided
against. The current 6.3 and 6.4 "front load" better.

IJ: I am not sure what you mean by "content labels" here. Do you mean
"priorities"? If so, I note that you already have an objection to
the priority of checkpoint 11.2 (which I forwarded in the last
call [3]).

> but it is even so only in informative note...)

IJ: The informative Note is there to encourage more than the minimal
requirement of the checkpoint, which seems pretty clear: 

  "For each functionality in the set required by checkpoint 11.5,
  allow the user to configure a single-key binding (i.e., one key
  press performs the task, with zero modifier keys). If the
  number of physical keys on the keyboard is less than the number
  of functionalities required by by checkpoint 11.5, allow
  single-key bindings for as many of those functionalities as
  possible."

IJ: I can change "product" to "user agent". Then, that would be more
consistent with this statement from the beginning of section 2:

   "The statement of the checkpoint is one or more requirements
   that must be satisfied by the user agent (i.e., the "subject
   of the claim) for the purposes of conformance. The "user
   agent" may consist of more than one software component, as
   explained in the section on well-formed conformance claims."

Since the conformance claim must be about a specific version of
the product, you wouldn't be able to "get away" with a version of
the documentation for a different user agent.

IJ: I don't find "according to this section" in 3.1. Can you explain
more of what you mean, or explain more specifically what seems
ambiguous to you in section 3.1?
