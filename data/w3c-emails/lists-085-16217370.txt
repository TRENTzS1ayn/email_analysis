Aaron, Rich,

Aaron raised an issue (519 [1]) during a UAAG 1.0 evaluation
of Mozilla:

   "Can DOM API requirements be satisfied if APIs are not available
    out of process?"

The question can be rephrased: "Where UAAG 1.0 says "export DOM
interfaces, how far do they have to be exported?"

We started to discuss this at the 4 April teleconference, but didn't
have the expertise to pursue it.

Jon has observed that exporting interfaces, but limiting that to
process boundaries is one way to improve performance. This suggests
to me that it is sufficient (only) to export up to the boundaries
of the UA's process (presuming there is only one process here).

Rich, can you comment on whether you think that in-process
exporting of interfaces is sufficient (or even recommended over
out-of-process exporting)?

Thank you,

  - Ian
