Sorry I've not been on the list much. Too busy getting ready for my 
first kid!

Here's the issue:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/issues/issues-linear-cr2#519

The issue originally surfaced because Mozilla does not export it's DOM 
interfaces out of process, and is not entirely thread safe.
Mozilla uses XPCOM, rather than COM or CORBA for it's object model.

I was concerned that our DOM access would not be useful to 3rd party AT 
vendors. Too bad, because Mozilla's UI also supports DOM.

It turns out an AT can make use out of Mozilla's DOM by installing a 
component that acts as a stub on the main thread. The component would 
attach itself to the DOM (or via other non-DOM interfaces we have such 
as the web progress listener), and handle communication back and forth 
with the out of process AT. I have no reason to believe this is not a 
workable solution.
