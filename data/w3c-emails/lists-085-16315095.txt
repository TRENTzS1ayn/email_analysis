Yes, this is a reasonable expression of it. (I too am interested in comments
- I don't have any improvements I can suggest, but think we would need to
tighten this up toclarify how much gets stored)

  Perhaps this is a reasonable expression of what Charles
  would like:

      "These state variables must be restored whenever
       the content has not changed since the most recent
       setting of the state variables."

  So, in light of Tantek's request for clarification, do
  we set the stronger expectation for restoring state
  variables?

  Comments from developers?

  By the way, I'd like to change the title of this checkpoint
  from "Restore history" to "Restore viewport state history"
