There is, of course, the question of who should come up with the test suites.

One possibility would be to take an image that contains title and desc, where
the test is that the user can identify the titles and descriptions of
objects. This would be different from most SVG tests becuase it must be done
manually instead of being able to be compared with a bitmap image.

I am sure there are others that wouldn't take too much development work. I
note that SVG doesn't require conformance to UAAG, since it is not yet a
Recommendation, but presume that it would in future versions.

This question is also relevant to the Authoring Tool Accessbility Guidelines.

  Lofton and Chris: I hope you can identify portions of your SVG test suite

  The User Agent Accessibility Guidelines seeks implementation experience
  supporting the
  Web Content Accessibility Guidelines [WCAG1.0] that deal with image forms
  in SVG.
  We would like to include examples from SVG. We also wish to include tests
  in the SVG
  test suite that includes explicit tests for those WCAG1.0 requirements.

  In my cursory examination of the SVG test suite I find no occurrence of
  "accessibility" in
  any of the SVG html harness html files.

  Do I assume that this was not a highlighted part of that test suite? Or do
  I assume that
  the tests only indirectly address accessibility issues as part of different
  objectives?.

  The Accessibility issues with SVG objects should be explicitly included,
  such as those identified in:

  Accessibility Features of SVG
  W3C Note 7 August 2000

       Charles McCathieNevile and Marja-Riitta koivunen

  http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG-access/

  "Accessibility requires that the features offered by SVG are correctly used
  and supported. This Note describes the SVG features that support accessibility
  and illustrates their use with examples." ...
