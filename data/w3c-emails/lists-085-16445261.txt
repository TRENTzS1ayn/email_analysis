There are a number of links like this on the W3C Home Page. iCab, which
handles abbreviation elements by umarking them stylistically, and providing
an expansion of them on mouseover, still does this for a link.

in the case of something like

  <a href="DOM/" class="navlink"><acronym title="Document Object
  Model">DOM</acronym></a>

The status bar, on hovering, shows

  Link to "Document Object Model" (http://www.w3.org/DOM/)

Do you have the following example online somewhere so I can test what
happens?

cheers

  I expect someone else can think up a better example, and it is hardly a
  very serious issue, just thought I'd mention it.
