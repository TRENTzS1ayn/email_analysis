Charles,
1. The Opera Browser displays the contents of the title attribute in the 
status bar when you hover the pointer over an acronym 
element.  Unfortunately moving the keyboard focus to the element does not 
cause the title information to be rendered in the status bar.

2. Netscape 6.2 displays the contents of the title attribute as a tool tip 
when you hover the pointer over an acronym element.  No keyboard support.

Jon
