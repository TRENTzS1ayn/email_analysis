charles has advised me via gl that this should have come to UA

comments please

thanks


attached mail follows:
I think this is the key, if the web is as universal as supposed, does web
accessibility include the possibility that the user can expect to change OS
and still be able to open a browser window?

How does one go about learning these keyboard shortcuts?
via the grapevine, or do we need a guide?

I'm of the firm opinion that html guides are not enough, and that as a
public service wai could at least link to excellent resources on configuring
computers for special needs.
