JRG: This seems reasonable to me, we will discuss it with the group

JRG: This is an interesting question.  Should this be a requirement or a 
good technique.

JRG: I would like to talk to you more about this issue and why standard 
accessibility APIs or standard APIs fall short of the accessibility 
requirements.  My main concern is that we want to reduce the reliance on 
proprietary or special solutions for individual assistive technologies, 
since this will make it harder for developers to make their software 
accessible and a smaller number of assistive technologies maybe supported.

Could you come to our teleconference on Thursday, April 26th or May 3rd to 
discuss this issue more?
Telecon time is 2:00 EST.

Thanks again for your comments.  They have been added to our last call
