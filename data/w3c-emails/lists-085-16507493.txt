I think this is the key, if the web is as universal as supposed, does
web
accessibility include the possibility that the user can expect to change
OS
and still be able to open a browser window?

How does one go about learning these keyboard shortcuts?
via the grapevine, or do we need a guide?

I'm of the firm opinion that html guides are not enough, and that as a
public service wai could at least link to excellent resources on
configuring
computers for special needs.
