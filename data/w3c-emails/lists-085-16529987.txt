There are enough people to have a quorum at a meeting this week on 
Thursday.  The following people said they could attend:
Tim Lacy
Jon Gunderson
Jim Allan
David Poehlman
Harvey Bingham

More are welcome!

We will be discussing the following editorial and clarification issues:
Issue 544: Should we delete requirements re: fee links from UAAG 1.0 since 
not really part of Web today?
Issue 543: [Clarification] 11.5: Forward/back one viewport for 2d 
renderings only?
Issue 542: [Clarification] 11.5: What does "refresh" mean, notably in light 
of usage in 3.5
Issue 541: [Clarification] 11.5 (default binding requirements): Moving UI 
focus to address box sufficient
Issue 540: [Editorial] 10.3 (indicate rendering progress): Clarify that not 
about download progress, but position of viewport
Issue 539: 11.6 (user profiles): Must the user profile be portable? Does 
saving configurations suffice?
Issue 538: [Editorial] Make checkpoint requirements distinct from 
exceptions, sufficient conditions
Issue 536: [Editorial] 9.7: Title is too forceful and doesn't communicate 
key bit of checkpoint
Issue 535: 9.4 (restore history): Must consider UA cache availability
Issue 534: [Clarification] 9.3 (Move content focus): Clarify that "each 
element" refers to elements in set defined in provision 1
