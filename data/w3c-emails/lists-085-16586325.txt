==========
Discussion
==========

----------
Issue 544: Should we delete requirements re: fee links from
UAAG 1.0 since not really part of Web today?
http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/issues/issues-linear-cr2#544
----------

Resolved: Delete fee link requirements since not part of the
           Web today.

----------
Issue 543: [Clarification] 11.5: Forward/back one viewport for 2d
renderings only?
http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/issues/issues-linear-cr2#543
----------

Resolved: Yes, for graphical renderings only.

----------
Issue 542: [Clarification] 11.5: What does "refresh" mean,
notably in light of usage in 3.5
http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/issues/issues-linear-cr2#542
----------

Resolved:

  - Delete "refresh rendering" in 11.5.
  - In 3.5, change:
     * Title: "Toggle automatic content retrieval"
     * s/refresh/retrieve
     * Indicate in 3.5 Note more clearly that META refresh is one
       example.
  - In 11.5, change:
     * "Reload resource" is ok.
     * "Interrupt reload request" instead of "Stop loading
       resource".
      HB: Say that the effect is undefined if you interrupt.

----------
Issue 541: [Clarification] 11.5 (default binding requirements):
Moving UI focus to address box sufficient
http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/issues/issues-linear-cr2#541
----------

Resolved:

  - Clarify that there may be several ways to satisfy this, such
  as by prompting the user, or moving the cursor to the address
  box.

----------
Issue 540: [Editorial] 10.8 (indicate rendering progress):
Clarify that not about download progress, but position of
viewport.
http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/issues/issues-linear-cr2#540
----------

Resolved: This checkpoint is about the viewport's position in
rendered content, not download progress. To avoid confusion:

  - Change title to "Indicate viewport position".
  - State clearly in a Note the checkpoint that this is *not*
    a requirement to indicate download progress.
  - Include a cross-reference to 1.3 that info should be available
    as text.

----------
Issue 539: 11.6 (user profiles): Must the user profile be
portable? Does saving configurations suffice?
http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/issues/issues-linear-cr2#539
----------

Resolved:
  - Portability is not required by checkpoint 11.6 but is
    a useful feature.

----------
Issue 538: [Editorial] Make checkpoint requirements distinct
from exceptions, sufficient conditions
http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/issues/issues-linear-cr2#538
----------

Resolved: Yes.

----------
Issue 536: [Editorial] 9.7: Title is too forceful and doesn't
communicate key bit of checkpoint
http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/issues/issues-linear-cr2#536
----------

Resolved: Change the title to "Move content focus in reverse"
since the primary (but not only) difference from 9.3 is the
reverse requirement.

----------
Issue 535: 9.4 (restore history): Must consider UA cache
availability
http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/issues/issues-linear-cr2#535
----------

IJ: I don't want to require more than consideration of last
modified date. I don't want to require checksums or other
calculations.

Resolved:

  - UA is not required to restore these variables
    if content is "newer" than the content in the history.

  - Change title to "Restore viewport state history"

----------
Issue 534: [Clarification] 9.3 (Move content focus): Clarify
that "each element" refers to elements in set defined in
provision 1.
http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/issues/issues-linear-cr2#534
----------

Resolved: In checkpoints 9.3 and 9.7 (and others?), clarify that
"each element" refers to elements in set defined in earlier
provision.

----------
Issue 533: [Clarification] 8.1 (Input config indications):
"Identified as such [in the specification]"?
----------

Resolved: Clarify in 8.1, that the expression "identified as
such" means "identified as such in the specification".

----------
Issue 527: [Clarification] 3.6: Add brief explanation why 3.6 P2
and 3.5 P1 (already in techs)
----------

Resolved: Add brief explanation why 3.6 is P2 and 3.5 is P1
(already in techs).
