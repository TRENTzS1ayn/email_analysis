Dear UAWG,

Per my action from the 4 April 2002 teleconference [1], please
consider this revision to the original proposal [2] for changes
to Guideline 10 checkpoints. Rationale, etc. only appears in the
original proposal. This version takes into account suggestions
from the 4 April meeting. I believe the result is an improvement,
and it's shorter.

  - Ian

--------------
New 10.x (P1):
--------------

  1. Provide a global mechanism for highlighting the following
  four classes of information in each viewport: the selection and
  content focus, enabled elements, and recently visited links.

  2. For graphical user agents, ensure that the user can choose at
  least one global configuration where the highlight mechanisms
  for the four classes of information in provision one:
    a) differ from each other, and
    b) do not rely on text foreground and background colors alone.

  Note: For instance, highlight mechanisms such as underlines or
  borders generally do not rely on text foreground and background
  color alone.

  3. For graphical viewports, if a highlight mechanism involves
  text size, font family, colors, or text decorations, offer the
  following range of values:

    1) for text size, same range described in checkpoint 4.1;
    2) for font family, same range described in checkpoint 4.2;
    3) for colors and text decorations, offer a range
       that includes at least:

     * the range offered by the conventional utility available in
       the operating environment that allows users to choose
       colors or text decorations (e.g., the standard font and
       color dialog box resources supported by the operating
       system).

     * or, if no such utility is available, the range of colors
       or text decorations supported by the conventional APIs of
       the operating environment for specifying colors or
       drawing text.

  4. Highlight enabled elements according to the granularity
  specified in the format. For example, an HTML user agent
  rendering a PNG image as part of a client-side image map is only
  required to highlight the image as a whole, not each enabled
  region. An SVG user agent rendering an SVG image with embedded
  graphical links is required to highlight each graphical link
  that may be rendered independently according to the SVG
  specification.

  Note: Examples of highlight mechanisms for selection and
  content focus include foreground and background color
  variations, underlining, distinctive synthesized speech
  prosody, border styling, etc. Because the selection and focus
  change frequently, user agents should not highlight them using
  mechanisms (e.g., font size variations) that cause content to
  reflow as this may disorient the user. Examples of highlight
  mechanisms for links and other content include foreground and
  background color variations, font variations, underlining,
  distinctive synthesized speech prosody, border styling, etc.

  Note: Per checkpoint 7.1, follow operating environment
  conventions that benefit accessibility when implementing the
  selection and content focus. For instance, if specified at the
  level of the operating environment, inherit the users's
  preferences for selection styles.

--------------
New 10.y (P2):
--------------

  1. Allow the user to satisfy the configuration requirement of
  provision 2 of checkpoint 10.x via a single setting.

------------------
Revised 10.7 (P1):
------------------

  1. Provide a global mechanism for highlighting the viewport
  with the current focus (including any frame that takes current
  focus).

  2. Provide at least one highlight mechanism (e.g., a thick
  outline) that does not rely on text foreground and background
  colors alone.

  3. For graphical viewports, if the highlight mechanism required
  by the previous provision involves text size, font family,
  colors, or text decorations, offer the same ranges of values
  required by checkpoint 10.x.

  Note: Per checkpoint 7.3, follow operating environment
  conventions that benefit accessibility when implementing
  the viewport highlight mechanism.

  Note: Since checkpoint 6.5 requires notification of changes
  in user interface focus through an API, this checkpoint does not
  require that user agents indicate changes in focus through
  a text message in the user interface.

Additional comment on the current checkpoint 10.7: The Note says
that it's a special case of checkpoint 1.1; I think that's a bug.

---------------------
Notes on the proposal
---------------------

  - Per the resolution of the 9 May teleconference regarding
    issue 544, references to fee links have been removed.

  - Checkpoint 10.x combines and replaces checkpoints 10.2, 10.3,
    and 10.4. The most important change here is that the highlight
    configuration requirement for content goes from P2 to P1.
