Working group,

The W3C user agent working group is going to be discussing revisions to
our API requirements on Thursday.  Ian and I have summarized the results
[1] of the previous teleconference [2] and the survey responses [3].  The
summary also proposes a potential revision to the document to address the
issues raised during candidate recommendation.  I have invited AT
developers to also attend, so please try to read the proposal and be
prepared to discuss it at the meeting.  As always discussion or comments
on the list before the meeting is encouraged.

Jon
