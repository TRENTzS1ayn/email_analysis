By and large i like this. The only reservation I have on re-reading it (this
doesn't represent a changed part of the checkpoints is whether the note for
checkpoint 6.9 (was a note on checkpoint 6.8 in the old version) means that a
partial or partially invalid implementation of CSS can claim that the
checkpoint is not applicable.

relevant part of proposal:

    6.9 DOM CSS access.(P2)

    1. For user agents that implement Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), ff the
user agent operating
       environment is java or ecmascript, provide programmatic access to
those style sheets in content by
       conforming to the CSS module of the W3C Document Object Model (DOM)
Level 2 Style Specification
       [DOM2STYLE] and exporting the interfaces it defines.

   Normative definition:
    1. For the purposes of satisfying this checkpoint, Cascading Style Sheets
(CSS) are defined by either
       CSS Level 1 [CSS1] or CSS Level 2 [CSS2].

  Hello,

  Based on discussion at the 16 May teleconference [1], I have
  drafted a new set of Guideline 6 checkpoints [2] for your
  review [2]. The proposal summarizes changes from the previous
  version of the checkpoints.

  I hope that we can discuss this proposal at the 23 May
  UAWG teleconference.

  Thank you,

    - Ian
