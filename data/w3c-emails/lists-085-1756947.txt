Hi Jon and Scott,

My comments below preceded by IJ:.

IJ: Yes, I would support this, too.

IJ: Yes, I would agree with making this configurable as well. 
More specifically:

 - The UA satisfies the requirement if disabled elements
   are never in the navigation order, or
 
 - The UA satisfies the requirement if there's a configuration so
   that disabled elements do not appear in the navigation order.

IJ: I think this is an important topic, but I may have to miss the
teleconference where it is discussed (regrets for 26 April and 3 May).
As I mentioned in my recent email ([1], issue 13), I think that
we need to be able to present a consistent model in the document
and provide sufficient rationale when we deviate from it (e.g.,
our P1 requirement to support the DOM for XML content).
