It would be helpful for me to understand more precisely:

 a) What APIs you are using today to communicate with ATs?
 b) If you are not using MSAA, can you explain why (without

 c) What are AT developers asking of you?

Thanks for any details you can provide (about these or other relevant
questions)!
