Below is the info from ibm on noscript and hpr 3.0.
I now have it working and will perform some other implementation checks.

David,

We tried using the Custom Level under the Security tab in Internet
Options
to turn off scripting, but we could not get Javascripts turned off in IE
5.5. When we look at the DOM, the NOSCRIPT tag is there but not the
NOSCRIPT content. Since HPR only uses the DOM to get web page content,
it
is not rendering NOSCRIPT content.

On the WAI User agent working group teleconference today, we were
singing the praises of hpr as regards its implementation of the user
agent accessability guidelines which are currently in last call.  A
question came up as to whether there is a need for and if so, how hpr
3.0 might handle "noscript".  Since I cannot currently test this and
have been charged with finding the answer, can you provide us with
implementation info for this?  We won't kill you if noscript is not
supported.
Thanks!
