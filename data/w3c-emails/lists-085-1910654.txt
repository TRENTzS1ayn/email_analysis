Hi Gregory, 

My comments below are preceded by IJ:. I think that all of the issues
you refer to have been addressed by checkpoints 2.1, 2.3, and 2.9. We
need
to ensure that the HTML elements you mention are listed in the
techniques
document.

IJ: It should probably be mentioned in Frame techniques.

IJ: We don't need to say anything in the Guidelines, but we should
mention
IFRAME in the Techniques. The HTML 4.01 spec says:

   "The IFRAME element allows authors to insert a frame within a block 
    of text. Inserting an inline frame within a section of
    text is much like inserting an object via the OBJECT element:
    they both allow you to insert an HTML document in the
    middle of another, they may both be aligned with surrounding text,
etc."

Checkpoint 2.1 says "Render according to spec" so we are covered for the
"default
rendering". For the rendering of conditional content (the content of the
IFRAME
element), the HTML 4.01 spec says:

   "The contents of the IFRAME element, on the other hand, should only 
    be displayed by user agents that do not support frames or are
configured 
    not to display frames."

Checkpoints 2.3 and 2.9 cover this case, and the Techniques of 2.3
should list
IFRAME as an example of an element that provides conditional content.
Checkpoint
2.3 includes the option of rendering in a separate viewport.

IJ: This is probably a bug of HTML 4.01. UAAG 1.0 doesn't include any
resize
requirements for viewports, but I think that checkpoint 7.3 (use
system conventions) will cover us on this and other interface-specific
points. For instance, the Microsoft design guidelines for Windows [1]
state:

    "Because display resolution and orientation vary, your software
should
     not assume a fixed display size, but rather adapt to the shape and
size
     defined by the system.

IJ: That is one of the options provided by checkpoint 2.3.

IJ: I'm not sure that I understand this comment. How do you set the UA
so that it
doesn't issue a GET for the referenced document?

[snip]

IJ: The longdesc attribute is one that is likely to be addressed by the 
"provide a link to it" option of checkpoint 2.3.

IJ: This is covered by checkpoint 2.3. However, checkpoint 2.3 doesn't
specify
the behavior of the "link to it" option. Following the link might
display the
content in a new viewport or in the same viewport. Your options 1 and 3
look the
same to me, except that the scrollbar would be added in the case where
the inline
content dimensions were larger than its (sub-)viewport dimensions.
Checkpoint 2.3
includes a query option which is not one of your choices.
