Hi all,

RealNetworks is currently reviewing the UAAG 1.0 guidelines, and have 
several people handling different parts of the specification.  However, due 
to several factors (travel, coordination, other good reasons, some lame 
excuses) we doubt we'll be able to collate our responses in time to make 
the review deadline.

We think there's a lot of great work that warrants careful review, and so 
we hope to get a little extra time to put together a response.  We ask an 
extension until EOD Wednesday, May 9 (PDT) to submit our comments.  We 
could rush a response out sooner, but I have much more confidence in 
submitting a useful response on May 9.

Please let me know if this works for everyone.

Thanks
Rob
