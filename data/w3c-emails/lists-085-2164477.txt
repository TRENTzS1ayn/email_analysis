IE does not stop all sound in webpage. see
http://www.ffcvi.homestead.com/index.html it has a midi file embedded. that
does not respond to escape key, turning sounds off does not affect it. you
can tab around (I forgot to count how many) and eventually you end up on the
control...then you can hit space to silence the sound. You can hit space to
start it again, but it will crash the browser.

source for the sound is <EMBED src=files/sugar.mid width=272 height=36
Autostart=true LOOP=1>

I could not control the sound in Netscape 4.75, nor could I find any control
for turning sounds off.

My Opera is broken so could not test.
