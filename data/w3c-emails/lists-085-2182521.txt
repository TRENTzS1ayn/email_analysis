Jim,
EMBED does not seem to be a part of the HTML 4.x of 3.2 specification. It 
has the same functionality at OBJECT.  In the references that I have is 
that references in embeded objects use external programs for rendering.  In 
this case it seems that the user agent would know that it is rendering a 
midi file, even if it is using a helper application.
