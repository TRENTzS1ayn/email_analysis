I have requested the following days and times to process last call issues:

Wednesday, May 16: 2:00-4:30 EST
Thursday, May 17th: 2:00-4:00 EST (regular meeting time)
Friday, May 18th: 1:00-3:00 EST

Wednesday, May 24th, 2:00-4:30 EST
Thursday, May 25th: 2:00-4:00 EST (regular meeting time)
Friday, May 26th: 1:00-3:30 EST

I will let people know the phone number when I get more information.  It 
will probably be the same phone number as our current teleconference.
