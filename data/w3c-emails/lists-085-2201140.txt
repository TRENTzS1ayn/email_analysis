aloha, jon!

in ascertaining whether or not i can attend the extra UA telecons (i can), i
noted that you mis-calculated the dates of the second batch of meetings--the
correct dates are:

Wednesday, May 23rd, 2:00-4:30 EST
Thursday, May 24th: 2:00-4:00 EST (regular meeting time)
Friday, May 25th: 1:00-3:30 EST

gregory.
