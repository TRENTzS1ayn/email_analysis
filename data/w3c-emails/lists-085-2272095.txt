EH: I think that this would be an expansion of our intent. I am really not
sure of the consequences of such an expansion. This gets back to what is
"content" and what is its relationship to the DOM.

EH: Does content include algorithms for sequencing and branching? They can
create effects than can be sensed via visual, auditory, or tactile senses
(e.g., computer games).

EH: I wonder if the definition of focus needs to be clarified in the
document.

Old:

In this document,the unmodified term "focus" means both "content focus" and
"user agent focus".

When several viewports coexist, at most one viewport's content focus or user
interface focus receives input events; this is called the current focus.


I am not sure if BOTH means SIMULTANEOUS or not.

New:

In this document,the unmodified term "focus" means SIMULTANEOUS "content
focus" and "user agent focus".

When several viewports coexist, at most EITHER one viewport's content focus
or ONE user interface focus receives input events; this is called the
current focus.

=
Maybe I am misinterpreting, but I think this could be clarified.
