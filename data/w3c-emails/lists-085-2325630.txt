EH: This raises the issue: Must one read the Techniques document to know
whether a checkpoint applies? Ideally, UAAG 1.0 should be sufficient to
guide the user on that point. Or if they need guidance from the Techniques
document to make that determination, then perhaps that needs to be noted for
specific relevant checkpoints.

EH: The foregoing language may be OK, but in general, I think that we should
temper our emphasis on making improvements for "all users". One reason for
this tempering is something that relates to the notion of equal access. I
think that our primary focus is and should be on improving access for people
with disabilities. Period. Improvements for people without disabilities are
a possible secondary effect. Interestingly, such a secondary affect is not
always desirable. For example, in the area of educational testing, a change
or accommodation that improves the performance people WITH disabilities but
has _no benefit_ for people WITHOUT disabilities, is more likely to be a
"valid" accommodation (one that does not change what is being measured) than
does an accommodation that benefits BOTH test takers WITH disabilities and
those WITHOUT disabilities (if the latter were allowed to use the
accommodation). In essence, an accommmodation that benefits test takers both
with and without disabilities arguably does nothing to "level the playing
field."
