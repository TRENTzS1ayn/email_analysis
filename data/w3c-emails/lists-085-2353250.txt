EH: This seems like a good suggestion. It will probably lead to some
discussion.

> ================================
> 2) Checkpoints 11.5, 2.3

> Tantek suggested making the list in 11.5 a real list (to make it

EH: Ok.

> 3) Grouping of checkpoints in Guideline 12
> ================================
> 
> There are three types of requirements in Guideline 12:
> 
>  1) Accessibility of documentation (12.1)
>  2) Requirements for substance of documentation (12.2, 12.3, 12.5)
>  3) Requirements for structure of documentation (12.4).
> 
> I would like the prose of the Guideline to state this, and I'd
> like to switch 12.5 and 12.4 to make the checkpoint groupings
> consistent with the three types of requirements.
EH: Ok.
> 
> ================================
> 4) More navbars in glossary, references
> ================================
> 
> Provide navigation bars at the beginning of the glossary and
> references section (i.e., each key is listed at the beginning of
> the section, and links to the full entry).
> 
EH: Possibly OK..
> ================================
> 5) Print styles
> ================================
> 
> Tantek made some suggestions for a print style sheet to improve
> the black and white / color printed version. In particular, blue
