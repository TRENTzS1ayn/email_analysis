When using a COM DOM-aware version of JFW in conjunction with MSIE, the
Windows OS keybinding for "Select All"
(CONTROL+A) causes the aural rendering of the page to be selected; in order
to select the content rendered by IE
(that is, "written" to the screen"), one must invoke the "Edit" menu and
choose "Select All" from the menu item

thus, by using CONTROL+A whilst running JFW versions 3.5 and greater with
Virtual PC Cursor for MSIE turned on,
one actually selects JFW's aural rendering of the document, and not the
document as rendered by MSIE.  (Note that
JFW's Virtual PC Cursor is turned on by default.)

the advantages of selecting the aural rendering of the document using
CONTROL+A are many:

a) the presence (and, depending upon how one has configured JFW's HTML
Options, the status) of links are clearly
demarcated when one chooses to paste the aural rendering into an editor

b) the aural snapshot reflects JFW's ability to present a logical text flow,
rather than simply scraping the screen,
meaning that content selected, copied, and pasted into an editor is far
easier to comprehend than the simple
screen-scraped snapshot of rendered content that one obtains when selecting
text using IE's native selection
mechanism

c) IE's native "select" mechanism is still available to the user, provided
that it is invoked from the menu bar in a 2
step process:

 C1) first, by activating the "Edit" menu and then choosing "Select All"
 C2) second, by activating the "Edit" menu and then choosing "Copy"
