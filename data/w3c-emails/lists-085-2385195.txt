aloha!

while overall, i think ian did an excellent job modularizing UAAG, i do have
a few preliminary Quality Assurance (QA) type questions about the
modularized UAAG:

1. why isn't the Navigation bar that appears at the top of cover.html not
replicated on each constituent document?  why is there not a navigation bar
at the bottom of each page?

2. why are the filenames for UAAG and UAAG-TECHS identical?  if one attempts
to unarchive the hypertext version of the modularized document into a single
directory (such as C:\HTML\W3C\WAI\UA), one is forced to change the
filenames in any case, so as to avoid (a) overwriting files with identical
names and (b) wasting hard drive space through the
replication of the contents of the sub-directories contained in the
archives, which includes duplicate copies of all of the images used in the
guidelines...  of course, if one changes the names of the files contained in
the UAAG-TECHS archive, the links from UAAG to UAAG-TECHS all break...

would it not, therefore, be better to distinguish between UAAG and
UAAG-TECHS rather than provide users with 2 archives containing identically
named files with distinct content?

UAAG filename: cover.html
UAAG-TECHS filename: techs-cover.html (or cover-techs.html)

UAAG filename: guidelines.html
UAAG-TECHS filename: techs-guidelines.html (or guidelines-techs.html)

etc.

3. i couldn't find a listing of ACCESSKEYs for each component of the
modularized UAAG -- shouldn't the "Previous" "Next" and "Contents" have
ACCESSKEYs associated with them?

gregory.
