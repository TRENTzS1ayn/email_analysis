----------
Discussion
----------

1) Comments resulting from review with Tantek Celik.
   (Refer also to Eric Hansen followup on these proposals. HB, MQ,
    and JG have skimmed proposals).

-------
Part I:
-------
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001AprJun/0073

1) "Start" events are more important than "End" events.

GR: If down produces a submenu, then I need to continue to drag
into the submenu.

IJ: The argument is that the user using manual triggering should
not have *more* than what the user of the device can do.

GR: I still need to hold the mouse down.

Resolved:

 - The simulation required by 1.2 does not exceed that which
   is possible with the native device.

2) Render according to spec. Do other checkpoints override this?

Resolved:

 - Accept proposal that other UAAG 1.0 requirements may 
   override 2.1 if the format specs otherwise forbid them.

 - Mention that configuration is a possibility here (break
   conformance to other spec / don't).

3) Checkpoint 2.2: Define text format more formally.

Resolved: 

 - Adopt proposal to change checkpoint 2.2 to define exactly what
 we mean by text formats for this document (i.e., the minimal
 requirement).

4) Checkpoint 2.3: Scope of "alert" requirement.

IJ: Is this a global requirement or element-level? I would note
that if every page has conditional content, the alert message for
every resource is not very useful. It doesn't tell you anything
"new". 

GR: I think that a global-only alert is not very useful.

IJ: Think of a links view of a document. One could also provide
a similar interface for conditional content.

MQ: It sounds like the minimal requirement is to make available
the list (possibly empty) of sources of conditional content.

IJ: People have also asked that 2.3 be broken down into simpler
pieces.

IJ: My question is: is a menu sufficient (that some time can be
empty)? 

GR: What happens when I go through the conditional content menu,
then to the document, then back to the conditional content menu,
where do I start from? I probably want some persistence in that
menu.

Resolved:

 - No alert is necessary when conditional content is rendered as 
   part of sastisfying 2.3.

 - When required (for query approach), alert must be element
   level. 

 (IJ notes that this breakdown may allow simplification of 2.3).

 Techniques:

   - A global alert that then allows one to find out more would
     be useful.
   - The WG thinks that a "conditional content list" approach
     would satisfy the checkpoint.
   - Should be able to find one's place in context (in a "main"
     view).

GR: Check out JFW and Amaya for orientation between views,
possibly Opera too.

/* Tim leaves */

5) Configuration not required when the user agent always or
   never does something?

IJ: The question is: what are the accessibility issues
if some stuff is "always on".

MQ: E.g., I might want to be able to turn off captions otherwise
they will always be "in my way" (even when I don't want them).

/* Brief discussion of blink rate control */

IJ: We need to clarify whether configuration is also part of the
requirement (not just the functionality being configured).

GR: I think that applicability is relevant for 3.3.

IJ: I note then, that configuration is in most cases as important
as the functionality being configured. But I don't know whether
it's as important in all cases (where there is binary
configuration).

NO RESOLUTION.

6) Checkpoint 2.9: Automatic rendering of all conditional content
   at once required?

(First part)

Proposed:

 - Adopt proposal that "The user agent may satisfy checkpoint 2.9
 by allowing different configurations to render different types
 of conditional content automatically, possibly in different
 viewports."

NO RESOLUTION.
