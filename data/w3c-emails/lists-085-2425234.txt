I don't think that there should be access to the summary/checklist
from every constituent page. There is a link to the contents from
every constituent page.

Yes, that will be added.

My answer is: you shouldn't unarchive in the same place. Would
you choose to put the HTML 4 spec in the same place as UAAG 1.0?
Probably not as there may be name conflicts. 

These are two separate resources, and assuming that the names
of files are necessarily different and always will be is a 
dangerous assumption. I do not want to encourage that assumption
by using a naming mechanism that allows people to unload
all of them in the same directory.

In short: I think it's harmful to make the assumption that
the documents can co-exist in the same directory.

Yes, good idea.

Thanks Gregory!
