As name-changing breaks links, and we have many links from UAAG10 to
UAAG10-Tech, and at least one back. So changing either name just to avoid
a name collision seems unnecessary.

I agree they should have different names, so that links from one to the other
can work in the same directory, without having to change the URLs in either
document.

They can share the URL references to common images and style sheets.
