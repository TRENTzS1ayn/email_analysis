IJ: The links to the techniques from the guidelines document 
are absolute links to the *latest version of techniques on the Web*. 
They are not relative links to another file in the same directory.
This was designed so that people would always follow links
to the latest and greatest techniques. As a result, there is
no benefit (or need or requirement) to unzipping all the
files in the same directory. They are independent documents
(like CSS and HTML) and are not intended to be unzipped in
the same place.

I think that for me to change names or organization of this
kind at this point I would need to hear very convincing 
arguments about why one should be able to put all the files
in the same directory. Please note that they do *not* interlink
relatively, and so nothing is gained in that respect. 

(I also think that we should spend our time on more important
issues than this as I am pretty convinced that given how
the documents interlink, there's no benefit to unzipping
in the same place. I may be very wrong, but I'd rather worry
about substantial issues at this point.

There is only one common style sheet (no common images except
the icons at the top of the document, also referenced globally).
I don't mind copying the style sheet for each distribution.
