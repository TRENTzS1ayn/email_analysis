aloha, ian!

thanks for the quick reply...  you wrote, in response to my request that the
filenames for the guidelines and techniques documents be differentiated::

My answer is: you shouldn't unarchive in the same place. Would
you choose to put the HTML 4 spec in the same place as UAAG 1.0?
Probably not as there may be name conflicts.

These are two separate resources, and assuming that the names
of files are necessarily different and always will be is a
dangerous assumption. I do not want to encourage that assumption
by using a naming mechanism that allows people to unload
all of them in the same directory.

In short: I think it's harmful to make the assumption that
the documents can co-exist in the same directory.
unquote

and my response to your answer is that you are comparing apples to
oranges -- no, i wouldn't put the HTML4 spec in the same directory as UAAG
1.0, but why wouldn't i put the associated UAAG techniques document in the
same directory?  i already do, as they are intimately inter-related
documents -- hell, one could even argue that there is a symbotic
relationship between the two...

this is a usability question, and when addressing usability issues, the
proper question to ask is, "how are individuals actually using the archived
version of UAAG", and i respectfully submit that -- at least prior to
modularization -- both the UAAG and the UAAG-TECHS archives were most
commonly unarchived into a single directory...  after all, hardly anyone i
know has access to the same storage capacity as the W3C servers...

usability involves listening to users, not telling them "thou shalt not"...
like it or not, there IS a symbiotic relationship between UAAG and
UAAG-TECHS which has led more than one member of this WG to conclude that,
logically, one WOULD unarchive both documents into the same directory...
no, i wouldn't unarchive the CSS2 spec into the same directory as the HTML4
spec, or even the CSS2 spec into the same directory that holds a local copy
of the CSS1 spec; neither would i unarchive the WCAG-TECHS into the same
directory as UAAG, but i WOULD (and do) unarchive WCAG-TECHS into the same
directory as WCAG, just as i would/do with ATAG and ATAG-TECHS...

gregory.
