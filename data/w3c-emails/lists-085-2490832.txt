Hi Mark,

Thanks for sending comments! My replies below preceded
by IJ:. My hope is that we can handle editorial comments
on the mailing list rather than use teleconference time
to discuss them. If anyone feels that the issues marked
as '[Editorial]' below are not editorial, please indicate so.

 - Ian

Reference document: I'm not sure. (Mark, can you clarify?)

The checkpoint numbers seem to line up with the 9 March draft:
  http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010309/

> - does checkpoint 2.10, "Allow configuration not to render...."
> possibly fit better under Guideline 3, "Allow configuration not
> to render...." rather than under Guideline 2, "Ensure
> user....".?

[Editorial] 

IJ: Yes, it could go there. I have no strong feelings one way or
the other.

> - would a "note" under checkpoint 3.7 help to clarify why
> "images" are a P2, and not included in checkpoint 3.2 with audio,
> video, and animated images as P1 ?

[Editorial]

IJ: Sure. The rationale is that moving visual informaion is
expected to be more distracting than static visual
information. An excess of visual information may causes problems
to some users with cognitive disabilities.

If people have additional rationale they would like included,
please reply.

> Guideline, yet that concept doesn't have enough importance

[Emotional] <grin>

IJ: I personally have no problem with the concept. <smile> We
created Guideline 5 as the result of a decision at the March
face-to-face meeting [1]. We moved the UI behavior checkpoints
there and, as it turns out, none of them are P1.  But since
Guidelines are almost exclusively there for the purposes of
organization, it doesn't bother me that there are no P1
checkpoints there.

In fact, it is actually a fair representation of the document
that user interface accessibility takes a slight back seat to
content accessibility. In particular, we made an explicit
decision at a teleconference (I don't have the URL handy) to not
make the same requirements for the chrome as we do for
content. Instead, we rely on system software guidelines
(checkpoint 7.3, P2) to cover issues like blinking in the user
interface.

[Editorial]

IJ: I think the word "interoperable" can be deleted.
 
> - in checkpoint 6.2, which "user interface" is being referred to
> as allowing the user to modify content.  Is it the user agent user
> interface, or is it a user interface built within or from the
> content.  Is this distinction necessary and/or helpful?

[Editorial]

IJ: The distinction is necessary and useful, which is why we have
an entry in the glossary for "user agent user interface", which
is used in checkpoints 1.3, 6.4, and 11.7.

However, in the case of 6.2, the term "user interface" is
intended: it doesn't matter which part of the user interface is
used to modify the content. The term "user interface" links to
the glossary and explains that it includes both user agent user
interface controls AND controls in content.

IJ: Yes, it does.

[Issue]

IJ: "Accessibility APIs" are meant to include MSAA, the Java
Accessibility API, and any other API designed explicitly for the
purpose of improving accessibility. Does that make it clearer?

Added to the issues list as issue 472

[Editorial]

IJ: They were intentionally split (fairly recently). Guideline 7
is about operating environment conventions, Guideline 8 about
conformance to specifications. People found it clearer to have
the split.
 
> - in checkpoint 9.2, it talks about sequential navigation in

IJ: What does rendered order mean in the general case (especially
in the CSS2 world of arbitrary positioning)? Visual rendering
based navigation may be very useful, but as a minimal
requirement, we cannot rely on that being well-defined (or
useful) in the general case.

It is true that we don't define "document order" in UAAG 1.0.  It
is my understanding that "document order" means "based on the DOM
tree". I don't know that a particular traversal is implied or
that we need to restrict implementation or a particular traversal
(e.g., preorder).

About interntionalization: I believe I asked Martin D?rst that
question, and I believe he indicated that there were not,
although I don't have any record of that discussion. However, I
believe that relying on the structure (and not the layout)
relieves us of some rendering issues: however the DOM tree is
constructed, the tree order is what is covered by 9.2, not
whether the content is rendered right-to-left or top-to-bottom,
etc.

[In the 9 April 2001 draft, these are checkpoints 1.2 and 9.4,
but the point is still valid.]

[Issue]

IJ: Added to the issues list as issue 473
  http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc3.html#473

I will ask the WG to reconfirm the priority decision.

[Checkpoint 9.9 in the 9 April 2001 draft.]

IJ: I don't know why the cross-reference is there. I think it
should be deleted.

I'll respond on that thread.
