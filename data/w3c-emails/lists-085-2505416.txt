Hi Mark,

I argued earlier on this thread the Guideline 12 has three types
of requirements: what must be documented (12.2, 12.3, and 12.5),
organization of the documentation (12.4), and accessibility of
the documentation (12.1).

IJ: I still don't understand how 12.3 is a special case of
12.1. Checkpoint 12.1 says conform to WCAG 1.0, which says
nothing about what needs to be documented for a user agent
that conforms to UAAG 1.0.

The WG resolved at the 19 April 2001 teleconference to
adopt this proposal to address the issue about 12.5 referring
to more than one release:

[Editorial]

IJ: I think that if we change "product documentation" in 12.1 to
"user agent documentation" then we will be covered. The
conformance section binds the term "user agent" in the
checkpoints to the subject of the claim. And therefore, old
documentation (of previous versions) would not satisfy the
requirements.

IJ: I still don't agree (or still don't understand; sorry).

[Editorial]

IJ: The difference (which I will try to clarify in the document)
is that it's a P1 to describe accessibility features *somewhere*
in the user agent documentation. It's a P2 that those features be
documented in a (dedicated) single section (possibly in addition
to being distributed throughout the documentation).

Please refer to my proposal [1] to clarify in Guideline 12 which
features that benefit accessibility must be documented. This is
proposal 21b (not yet reviewed during a teleconference).
