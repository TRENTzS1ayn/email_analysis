i for one, am wholeheartedly in favor of this proposal precisely because
it is essential that accessibility requirements begin to become part and
parcel of every other requirement, where appropriate...  in fact, i'd
like to take the proposal to the PF group on monday, as the basis of a
group-to-group request: that the SYMM WG incorporate the appropriate
requirements into SMIL 2.x itself, with the advice and counsel of
PF/UA/whomever else wants to jump on-board....
