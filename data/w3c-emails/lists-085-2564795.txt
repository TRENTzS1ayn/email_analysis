Hi Eric,

We started to discuss this at the 10 May teleconference [1] but
didn't get very far. The way it was expressed at the teleconference,
it was not clear whether for each checkpoint, the configurability
was as important as the feature being configured. 

This will require more work and discussion.

IJ: Content = DOM in UAAG 1.0. I agree that style sheets and
scripts were not part of our original intention when discussing
conditional content. I think we meant "stuff that can be rendered
for consumption". This is not to be taken as a challenge but
as a sincere request: can you provide a better definition of
conditional content?

IJ: All P1 (as is the original 9.1).

IJ: I thought about this some more. Instead of an applicability
provision, perhaps a selection label would be better. There are
about 10 checkpoints related to the selection.

IJ: I agree that clarification is required. I think of them
as not being simultaneous, but rather any requirement that
applies to the "focus" applies to both the content focus and the 
UI focus.

IJ: I don't have a good example. I think it will be a rare
occurrence.

IJ: (b) should read "If there are focus handlers on a page..."

IJ: Tantek's point (I think) was that the functionality of
a page may be tightly bound to the behavior of focus handlers.
And so turning off might make the page unusable.

To this type of comment I generally say: It might also make the page 
more usable. This is where we let the user make the decision.

IJ: Yes. Although it might still be valuable to reiterate
all levels in the Note (for example).
