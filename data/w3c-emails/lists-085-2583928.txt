Hi Eric,

IJ: I don't think that developers are required to read the Techniques
document to understand whether a checkpoint applies. However, it
may be an indispensable resource: the more experience we have
with different formats, and can compare techniques from
format to format, the easier it will be for developers to
apply the checkpoints to their situation. As long as the 
checkpoints are technology independent, then a technology-specific
companion will be very important.

IJ: I think we emphasize universal design primarily to remind
people that a more general solution may both be easier to implement,
may benefit more users, and may still meet the requirement.

Do you see any instances where we emphasize "all users" other
than as a general side-effect or way to simplify implementation?
