I'd also like to know in detail which components of the interface we are
discussing.  Much of the a o l interface has little to do with web
connectivity as I understand it, but more to do with their generally
closed network.  Still, General software guidelines apply and there is
more than msaa at issue here.

Rich,
Apparently the special APIs were jointly developed in cooperation with
an
AT developer, but I think your arguments are still valid.  We don't want
to
promote the use of special APIs for different AT developers.  I have
asked
Scott to contact Tim Lacy at Microsoft to discuss the issues on why MSAA
could not have been used to solve the problem.
