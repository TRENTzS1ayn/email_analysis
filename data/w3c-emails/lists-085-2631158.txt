Sean,

Thanks for doing this! We are still working on the requirements
for well-formed claims, in particular to allow for increased
granularity. For example, I think it will be possible (required?)
to indicate the format that is used to satisfy a particular
content type label's requirements (e.g., to satisfy "Image" 
requirements, the user agent implements GIF, PNG, and SVG).

I like the use of rdfs:comment. That will also be important
for checkpoints that the claimant says do not apply (for
rationale).

WCAG 1.0? We require that one version of a claim 
conforms to WCAG 1.0 (this is not quite what the last
call draft says, but refer to proposal [1], section 15).
A machine-readable claim such as one in N3 probably does
not conform to WCAG 1.0, but is very useful (and probably
sufficient). Do you have any comment on the accessibility
of N3 claims?

In our conformance section, should we start pointing
to EARL as a format for making claims?

 - Ian
