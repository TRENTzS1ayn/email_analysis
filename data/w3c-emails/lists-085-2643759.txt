Ian,

Here is a sample page with a NOSCRIPT element. When we use HPR  to look at
this web page, it sees an IE DOM node that is associated with the NOSCRIPT
element, but there is no textual content in that DOM node. It is empty, and
we don't know why. Maybe there are settings that the user can change within
the Internet Options dialog to cause NOSCRIPT content to be rendered in the
DOM (and in the IE rendering of the web page), but we don't know what those
settings are.

Hi Cathy,

I'm not sure I understand the last comment about the tag
being in the DOM but not the element content. Why
is the NOSCRIPT content not in the IE DOM?

[Please forgive me if your comment was specific to
a given page and not a general comment about how IE
handles NOSCRIPT.]

Thank you,

 - Ian
