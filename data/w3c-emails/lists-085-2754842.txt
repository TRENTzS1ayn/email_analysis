Dear all,

I am going to discontinue tracking this working group actively, and will not
be on teleconferences generally. This is in order to concentrate on work
happening in the Authoring Tool area. So I wish you all the best with the
last call. (And I won't disappear entirely, but when I do appear I'll try to
be well-prepared)

cheers

Charles
