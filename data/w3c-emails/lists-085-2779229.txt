Hello,

I asked Martin Duerst to comment on our issue 477 [1], checkpoint
2.10 of the last call document [2]:
 
  "Allow configuration not to render content in 
   unsupported natural languages."

The issue: Does "natural languages" include writing systems
(scripts)? Should the checkpoint be clarified by pointing
this out?

His comment is:

  "I think script is subsumed in the checkpoint as you have 
   it now."

More comments below. I have one comment, preceded by IJ:.

IJ: I'm not sure your proposal is necessary: It seems to
say: "allow configuration not to render in modality X when 
you don't support modality X." We are saying: whatever
modality you do support, allow configuration not to render
garbage (related to unsupported natural languages) 
in that modality. We don't make requirements that a particular
modality be supported (though at least one must be
supported; refer to the section on content type labels).
