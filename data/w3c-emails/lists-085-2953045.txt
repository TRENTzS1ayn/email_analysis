Loretta,
 
I am writing to you on behalf of the User Agent Accessibility Group of
the W3C.  In our efforts to address issues raised in our last-call
process, we are looking for examples of applications program interfaces
for non-HTML or non-XML content on the web. (We are dealing with the
need to use public APIs in browsers to support interoperatibility.
 
Considering the work that Adobe has done to make PDF accessible, we are
hoping that you can direct us to examples of such non-HTML, but public
interfaces.
 
Please feel free to respond directly to the UAAG list at
w3c-wai-ua@w3.org.
 
Thank you for your time and consideration of this request.
