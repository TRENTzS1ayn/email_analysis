Martin,
I am not sure I would like a standard based on pixels, since this seems too 
connected to the hardware which is typically not under the control of the 
user agent developer.  Although a user agent developer could probably 
calculate this information.  I would like to see something more in the 
lines of point sizes, like 9 points as a minimum.

Does the concept of point size translate to other languages?

What terminology do non-Latin based languages use to indicate the size of 
their characters when rendered by a compuer?

Thanks for your help,
Jon
