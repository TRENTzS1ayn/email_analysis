Checkpoint 2.9: "Allow configuration to render all conditional content
automatically." If the <object> element of HTML is included under
'conditional content', then this checkpoint would change the semantics of
the <object> element, which is designed to select one of a number of
options.

Checkpoint 5.4: repetition of the word 'event'.

Checkpoints 6.1 to 6.4 DOM
As these sections stand it reads as if a UA is *required to* support DOM,
not "if the document has an API, that API should be/include DOM". We do not
understand the requirement that forces a UA to include a scripting interface
if it is to be even level A compliant, but maybe this is just a lack of
clarity of the text.

Guideline 9: Navigation. If you are looking at a frameset, and only one
frame has a scroll bar, you shouldn't need to have to select that frame in
order to do a [page down]. So it would be good to have a checkpoint that
says that if an action is obvious/unambiguous in the context, it should not
be necessary to have to select the only viewport to which it could apply.
