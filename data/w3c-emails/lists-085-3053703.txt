IJ2: I think that's covered by checkpoint 11.5, which is a list of
functionalities that must have bindings (in the default configuration). 
And then we have a requirement (11.3) that the user be able to override
the default bindings. So 11.5 is the WG's list of important
functionalities. After these basic ones, we stopped because we
are expecting diverse user agents to conform, and we can't
really predict every function that will be useful for a particular
type of user agent.

IJ2: How about instead:

 - The API requirements of this document are in Guideline 6.
 - Everything else (needs double checking) is not to be
   satisfied through an API alone.

IJ2: Sounds good to me!
