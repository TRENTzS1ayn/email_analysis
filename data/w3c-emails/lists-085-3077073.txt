EJ2: You probably only need to add the first point guideline 10 however
remember that not all platforms offer an Accessibility API so focusing
on API as opposed to saying programmatic or something more generic (but
having the same meaning) might be a better approach so UA developers
don't think no API means I don't have to worry about exposing stuff to
AT programmatically.
