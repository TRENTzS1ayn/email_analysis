Steven,
1. When you say you have a voice browser, is this for the desktop computing 
environment?

2. Is it being designed for general users or for people with disabilities?

3. You do not need to support scripting, you just need to export the DOM to 
make information available to assistive technologies. Right now the DOM can 
be primarily read only, with a few write requirements for information that 
can be modified through the user interface (i.e. form control values).

Thanks for your comments,
Jon
