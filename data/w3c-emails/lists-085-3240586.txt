This is perhaps 'English' rather than 'Latin'.  eg. Eastern European
languages regularly use accents above and below capital letters, and would
therefore require additional height.

In case it is of use, here are requirements we came up with a couple of
years ago with a customer re. minimum readable font sizes in pixels for a
number of Asian languages.  The minimum here is to allow reasonable
representation of the complicated glyphs involved.

Thai7-8 pixels in width, but 22 pixels minimum height (because vowel
signs below and above base characters, and tone marks above that.

Korean16 pixels square (includes a 1 pixel gutter vertically and
horizontally)

Japanese14 pixels square (includes a 1 pixel gutter vertically and
horizontally) (some strokes have to be sacrificed but context aids
recognition)

Traditional Chinese (Taiwan)24 pixels square (includes a 1 pixel gutter
vertically and horizontally) (this is obviously a lot, and is not needed for
all Chinese characters, but there are a large number of very complex ones
that do require 24 pixels for all strokes to fit. eg. ?[&#x8F5F;] ?[9F98]
?[9EA4] ?[9A6B] ?[7065] ?[91C1] ?[99A8] 


Note also that inter-line spacing may also be a factor - particularly in Far
Eastern scripts.  Two lines of 16x16 pixel ideographic characters separated
by a single pixel gutter can be very difficult to read - plus the inter-line
spacing generally helps indicate writing direction.  Note that additional
space may be required in the presence of underlined text.
