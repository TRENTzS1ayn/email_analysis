GJR: the third of the statements included in your reply to david is (a) 
the most sensible approach, (b) a very sucinct articulation of the points
that several of us made at the UA telecon, and (c) one which keeps UAAG
clear of the briar patch of setting a minimum, especially in light of the
wide variety of "acceptable" slash baseline minimums and guttering
requirements and considerations outlined by richard ishida in the post
archived at: 
<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001AprJun/0196.html>

so, if we are going to make any sort of statement concerning a lower
bound, i'd support your third suggestion...
