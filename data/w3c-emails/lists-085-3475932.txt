All,
here is the first set of feedback of Gregory's Implementation Tests for UAAG
1.0 [http://www.hicom.net/~oedipus/wai/ua/tests/index.html]

my system
NT 4.0 SP5
no AT
IE 5.50.4522.1800IC, SP1, Q279328, q290108

for http://www.hicom.net/~oedipus/wai/ua/tests/onfocus_form1.html
onfocus redirects. backspace - esc will allow returning to previous page,
with selection/focus in the list box. you can tab out of box to next link.

for http://www.hicom.net/~oedipus/wai/ua/tests/onfocus_form2.html which has
the "get guidelines" button. putting focus on the list box activates the
link. your warning about viewport change is true.

for http://www.hicom.net/~oedipus/wai/ua/tests/iframe1.html, no problem,
displayed and a scrollable inline window--to access-tab to Iframe, when it
had focus, arrow to scroll through content. can also tab through links
within Iframe. can open Iframe in new window--tab to Iframe, hit context
menu key, select open frame in a new window

for http://www.hicom.net/~oedipus/wai/ua/tests/blinking_text_test1.html no
blinking

for http://www.hicom.net/~oedipus/wai/ua/tests/blinking_text_test2.html no
blinking

for http://www.hicom.net/~oedipus/wai/ua/tests/scrolling_text_test1.html
marquee works, esc key does not stop movement, turned off play animations
and play video, refresh page, still no way to stop or slow down marquee

for http://www.hicom.net/~oedipus/wai/ua/tests/scrolling_text_test2.html
marquee works, esc key does not stop movement, turned off play animations
and play video, refresh page, still no way to stop or slow down marquee. but
can make them disappear (stop??), Tools | Options | Security Tab | Custom
Level | Scripting | Active Scripting | "disabled" radio button selected.

for http://www.hicom.net/~oedipus/wai/ua/tests/redirect_test.html, page
redirects after 60 seconds, cannot make it stop.

for http://www.hicom.net/~oedipus/wai/ua/tests/instant_redirect_test.html,
page redirects instantly (within 1 second), back function returns me to test
suite page (Yeah!)

for http://www.hicom.net/~oedipus/wai/ua/tests/onchange_form3.html, tab or
access key to form control. if down arrow - immediate opening of no
viewport. if alt-down arrow, list of items pops up, can arrow through list,
Enter to activate item, new viewport opens. within list can tab to move out
of control. if in list and hit esc activation of list item with
selection/focus, unless on default item with no event attached "Select a
Guidelines Document"

for http://www.hicom.net/~oedipus/wai/ua/tests/onfocus_form2.html, tab or
access key to form control, activation occurs immediately, new page opens in
same viewport. When form control gets focus, a message shows in status
bar--opening http://...., but ESC will stop redirect! BACK function returns
focus to form control on initiating page and activation occurs again.
