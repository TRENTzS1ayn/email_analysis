I think that Issue #503 does not refer to checkpoint 9.3, but checkpoint 9.5.

9.5 Allow configuration so that moving the content focus to an enabled 
element does not
              automatically activate any explicitly associated input device 
event handlers. [Priority 2]

I think the only HTML events that are affect by this checkpoint are:

onfocus = The onfocus event occurs when an element receives focus either by 
the pointing device or by tabbing navigation. This attribute may be used 
with the following elements: A, AREA, LABEL, INPUT, SELECT, TEXTAREA, and 
BUTTON.

onblur = The onblur event occurs when an element loses focus either by the 
pointing device or by tabbing navigation. It may be used with the same 
elements as onfocus.

onchange = The onchange event occurs when a control loses the input focus 
and its value has been modified since gaining focus. This attribute applies 
to the following elements: INPUT, SELECT, and TEXTAREA.

onchange event does not seem to be implemented in current browsers 
according to specification.  That's why include it in the list.  A 
particular user agent may need to do more based on how they interpret the 
specifications they support.
