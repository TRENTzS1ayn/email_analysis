Mike,

You bring up an interesting concept, especially where IE is concerned.

Window-Eyes supports what you're trying to do, but IE does not. Here's
why.

When you put controls inside of a LABEL tag, IE promptly concatenates
all
of the field names into one name for each control. You can see this
clearly
with INSPECT or AccExplorer (both from the MSAA SDK -
http://www.microsoft.com/enable/msaa/download.htm). So with Window-Eyes
(out of MSAA), you would tab to the first radio button and hear, "What
kind
of cheese do you want on your pizza Mozzarella Cheddar None."

If IE would properly assign names to the right controls, then
Window-Eyes
would speak (when you tabbed), "What kind of cheese do you want on your
pizza checkbox checked Mozzarella." Another tab would yield, "What kind
of
cheese do you want on your pizza checkbox checked Cheddar," and so on.

So what you're trying to do is correct and a good design method. But IE
either doesn't understand that, or accept that. Looks like it's time to
contact our favorite Microsoft representatives. <grin>
