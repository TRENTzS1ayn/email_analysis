The following questions are important to the W3C User Agent Accessibility 
Guidelines working group [1] in determining if its requirements for user 
agents to communicate rendering and user interface information to assistive 
technologies reflect the current and future needs of assistive technology 
developers.  Please send your responses to our public mailing list at: 
w3c-wai-ua@w3.org.  If you would like your comments to remain confidential 
you can send them to me at jongund@uiuc.edu.  Please indicate the responses 
that best match your companies current and future strategy, and feel free 
to add any comments you feel would clarify your intent.

Thank you for your help and support.  Please contact myself or Ian Jacobs 
(ij@w3.org) if you have any questions on the survey or the activities of 
the working group.

=================================
Question 1. Which of the following techniques do you currently use or plan 
to use to access and process Web content for alternative or enhanced 
rendering for people with disabilities?

a. Natively parse source HTML
b. Use the DOM implemented by the user agent (i.e. Internet Explorer)
c. Use accessibility APIs associated with the user agent (i.e active 
accessibility or Java Accessibility API)
d. Other (please describe)
e. Don't provide an alternative rendering

=================================
Question 2. Which of the following techniques do you currently use or plan 
to use to control ?

a. Use the DOM activate author supplied controls (i.e. Internet Explorer)
b. Use accessibility APIs associated with the user agent (i.e active 
accessibility or Java Accessibility API)
c. Other (please describe)
d. Don't provide an alternative input

=================================
Question 3. Are you familiar with the W3C Document Object Module (DOM)?

a. Yes
b. No

=================================
Question 4. If yes to question 3, are you familiar with APIs you can use to 
access the DOM implementations of current user agents (i.e. Microsoft 
implementation of the DOM in IE 4.x/5.x)?

a. Yes
b. No

=================================
Question 5. If yes to question 3 and 4, do you think the DOM will meet your

c. 75-90%
d. Will not meet needs
e. Not sure

=================================
Question 6. If yes to question 4 and 5, how complex and resource intensive 
is it to use the DOM to access Web content?

a. High
b. Medium
c. Low
d. Do not know

=================================
Question 7. Indicate which of the following resources would help you in 
using or deciding to use the DOM for accessing Web content. Respond to each 
question with a yes, no or don't know.

a. Demonstration code?
b. Web based tutorial materials on DOM capabilities and programming examples?
c. Face-to-face workshop on DOM capabilities and programming examples?
d. Access to people with expertise in DOM capabilities and programming?
e. Open ended question for you to indicate any other resources that would 
help you?
