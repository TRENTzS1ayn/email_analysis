We are having a special teleconference today with AT developers.  Please 
make a special effort to participate in today's teleconference.

As a special incentive today we will be serving coffee and doughnuts about 
5 minutes before 2:00 the teleconference.  So come early if you want the 
chocolate covered ones (smile) .
