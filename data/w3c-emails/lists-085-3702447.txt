I spent time talking with Ian after the meeting today.

Regarding the checkpoints in guideline 6.0 but more specifically checkpoint
6.4. If the checkpoint would emphasize the importance of
environment-specific APIs I would be satisfied with the checkpoint.

   Use of standard environment specific APIs promotes cross-software
   interoperability and reduces the number of APIs the developer has to
   implement.
   Use of standard environment specific APIs increases the likelihood that
   these APIs have been tested.
