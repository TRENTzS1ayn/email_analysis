Do we need to make it clear that a markup or style sheet language used to 
satisfy checkpoint 4.6 must allow both overlapping and non-overlapping of 
captions with respect to the video track?

This is the requirement in the otherwise clause, but it is not clear if 
this requirement applies also to the use of markup or stylesheet.
