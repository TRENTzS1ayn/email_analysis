PRESS RELEASE Reading Arabic Aloud for the Blind

Reading Machine Makes Using Computers and Reading Texts a Matter of
Talking & Listening

Washington, May 25, 2001- Digitek International, North American
distributor of Sakhr and Harf software products, has just released the new
Sakhr Reading Machine to local markets. 

The Reading Machine gives Arabic- and English-using blind and
partially-sighted users voice command of their PCs. For the first time,
visually challenged users of Arabic and English can take command of their
PCs, their use of the Internet, and access scan ned text when and as they
wish.

The Reading Machine program reads aloud Internet screens, scanned text,
and even keyboard input. Users first train the software to recognize their
voice commands: giving them control of their personal computers by voice
alone. Then, as they type, or acces s Web pages, or handle scanned text,
the Reading Machine speaks to them. Vocalizing keystrokes also serves as
an effective verification of their typed input. 

Already blind translators and Websurfers are adding the Reading Machine to
the repertory of tools that enable them to surmount challenges at work and
online

The Reading Machine uses Sakhr's proprietary bilingual text-to-speech
research and its voice recognition software engines to give users
state-of-the-art capabilities. 

One of the interesting side effects of the Reading Machine is the way that
it has sensitized the sighted to world of the visually challenged. Because
the program dispenses with the mouse as an input device, sighted technical
support specialists for the Re ading Machine have to learn to listen
rather than read as a way of understanding what is going on. When
Digitek's staff were learning the program, they had to close their eyes in
order to focus on the vocalized instructions rather than reading and using
a mouse to respond. Sakhr's Reading Machine became a tool for
understanding across disabilities. 

The Sakhr Reading Machine runs under Arabic Windows 98 and requires Arabic
MS Word.
