Access Keys
Access keys allow users to activate links from the keyboard. While targeted
at users with disabilities, these keys can also be used by anyone whose
browser supports them (e.g. Internet Explorer 5 and iCab for Mac). Mac users
can try holding down the Control key (MIE) or Shift key (iCab) while
choosing
the specified letter.

Note: those using iCab will see the relevant letter displayed next to the
link.

iCab's homepage is located at: http://www.icab.de/
some info, a features list, and system requirements can be found at:
   http://www.icab.de/info.html
while a FAQ can be obtained at:
   http://www.icab.de/faq.html

there's an interesting page located at:
   http://www.icab.de/test.html
that contains tests of quote the most important HTML4 features unquote

interesting that iCab, in addition to accesskey, also supports "fieldset"
and "legend" and makes LINK information contained in the HEAD of documents
available through a customizable toolbar interface...
