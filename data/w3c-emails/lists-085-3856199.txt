Hello:

     Here are a few brief comments.

Windows 95
MS IE Version: 5.00.3105.0106CO
Assistive Technology: JFW version 3.31

if you are using assistive technology, what effect did the blinking text have on your ability to review this page's content? 

A: Apparently none.  I could read the contents of the page without trouble
and the blinking text did not disappear.
I heard
This is some text which should appear and disappear.
