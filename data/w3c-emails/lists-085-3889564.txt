I suggest that we resolve issue 515 based on strengthening the note to 
indicate the importance of using accessibility APIs designed for the entire 
platform and only develop application specific APIs when platform specific 
APIs cannot be used to satisfy the requirements of our document (see Ian's 
note message[1]).  This would just be added to the note and not be 
normative.  Rich agreed to this proposal already on the list[2].  If there 
are no further comments this issue is closed and the note will be modified 
in the next draft of the document.
