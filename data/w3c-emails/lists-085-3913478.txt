aloha, ian!

one of the problems with the new "distributed" UAAG 1.0 is that it is
impossible to ascertain the date of the document one is reading from
within a sub-section, unless that sub-section happens to be cover.html

this is a really annoying aspect of the chopping up of technical
recommendations into bite-sized morsels...  why isn't there a W3C Process
guarding against this?  if date-stamps are important enough to embed in
URIs, surely they should be repeated somewhere in a document which "may be
updated, replaced or obsoleted by other documents at any time"
