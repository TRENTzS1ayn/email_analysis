Hello WG,

The (last call) version of UAAG 1.0 linked from the
W3C page of technical reports is the 9 April draft [1].
I'd like to replace it with what amounts to the
4 June Working Draft [2].

Why?

 - It includes resolutions for all the last call issues
   except for the SVG WG issues.
 - It is split into pieces and otherwise much improved.

If there are no objections to this by Friday of this week,
I'll request publication of the revision.

Thank you,

 - Ian
