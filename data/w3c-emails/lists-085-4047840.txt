Hello,

The UAAG 1.0 (e.g., the 4 June 2001 draft [1]) includes labels to 
indicate whether a checkpoint must be satisfied for content, for
user agent features, or for both.

I am pondering whether we need to be more specific for content
labels:

 - Some requirements are for rendered content only (where rendered
   content is a subset of all content). For instance, our search
   requirement is limited to what is rendered.

 - Other requirements refer to all content (e.g., conform to
   specifications).

I think we might want to "split" the content label into
"For rendered content" and "For all content" (or just "For content").

I examined the checkpoints labeled "For content" in the 4 June
draft and I would categorize them as follows:


For content: 1.1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.5, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 
3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 4.17, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.7. 6,8, 6.9, 8.1, 
8.2, 9.10, 11.2

For rendered content: 1.2 (assumes that the content focus is only on
rendered content), 2.4, 2.6, 2.10, 2.11, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5,
4.6, 4.7, 4.8, 4.9, 4.10, 4.11, 4.12, 4.13, 4.14, 4.15, 4.16, 5.5,
5.6, 9.1, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5, 9.6, 9.7, 9.8, 9.9, 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4,
10.5, 10.6, 10.8

This split may not be necessary because in most cases it's obvious
which class is intended. However, we have received questions about 
the search requirement and others that suggest that people are 
thinking about this. I think this clarification would be useful.

Your comments welcome. I do not intend to include this in the
next draft.
