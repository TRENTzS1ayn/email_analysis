Dear UAWG,

The W3C Webmaster has published the 22 June UAAG 1.0 [1] and
Techniques [2]. A list of changes [3] is available on the Web and
is quoted below.

Please note that this draft replaces the last call draft on
the W3C technical reports page. 

Please also note that the structure of the checkpoints has been
changed in this draft. This does not affect any of the normative
requirments but should be easier to read and to refer to. It also
uses markup more intelligently (e.g., headers are now used, lists
are marked up as lists, etc.). Your comments on the readability
and usability of this new structure are very welcome.

Your comments encouraged,

 - Ian

CHANGES
-------

General

 * Overhauled the structure of the checkpoints:
    + Now uses header elements properly.
    + Different provisions of a checkpoint are in a bulleted list.
      This should be easier to read and refer to.
    + Added document date to checklists and split-out chapters
    + Changed "next" link text to "next chapter". Same for previous.
    + Added xml namespaces as example of something that a user
      agent might not recognize (based on SVG WG comments).

Checkpoints

 * Updated description in section of the structure of a checkpoint.
 * 1.1: Changed note after 1.1 and notes/rationale/who benefits to
   make clearer direct v. spatial access
 * 3.2/3.7: Per discussion at 7 June teleconf, moved sufficient
   techniques (silent/invisible) from techs to checkpoint text for
   3.2 and 3.7. Make this a sufficient but not recommended technique.
 * 3.3: Per 7 June teleconf, the user agent must not drop packets
   in the case of streaming content. The user must have access to all
   the same content, but in non-animated and non-blinking form.
   Clarify that text may be rendered in another viewport.
 * 3.4: Per discussion at 21 June teleconf, clarified that a
   single alert for more than zero scripts or applets is required
 * 4.6: Per 7 June teleconf, made clear that transparent bg for
   captions not required.
 * 6.4: Per Chair's announcement for issue 515, added note to
   6.4 that UA developers should implement APIs that may work across
   software on a given OE.
 * 10.8: Fixed - for content only (not user agent).
 * 11.4, 11.5: Clarified that these are about user agent default
   input configurations. (same language used in 11.3).

References

 * Added [PWD-USE-WEB], even though not yet a stable document. Added
   link to it from impact matrix in techniques document.

Techniques

 * 3.2: Left rationale for why silent/invisible is not recommended
   technique.
 * 4.6: Added config for this option to doing more. Added note about
   which background is preferred, per comments from Cindy King
