I'd like to see that one my self.  I think part of it has to do with how
msaa and the browsers support the elements.  part for instance of the
way jfw handles the title tag has to do with the current implementation
of it by ie.

Subject: Information about screen reader support for HTML
elements/attributes?


Hi folks,

Does anyone know where I can find matrices of which
screen readers support which HTML attributes and elements
that are beneficial to accessibility (e.g., abbr)?

Thanks for any pointers.

 - Ian
