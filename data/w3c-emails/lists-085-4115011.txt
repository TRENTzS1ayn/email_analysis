Richard,

Thank you for your review of the 9 April 2001 UAAG 1.0 [1],
which is very useful even at this date. Please
see my responses below (preceded by IJ:). Some of my replies
indicate how the UAWG has changed the document up to and
including the 22 June 2001 draft [2] based on other last call
review comments.

I'm really pleased because your comments show that you've
read the document thoroughly. Thank you!

I've snipped out some of your comments to shorten this message.

 - Ian

-------
Summary of more-than-simply-editorial questions to take to the
Working Group:
-------

 - Should we remove speech output from the list of limitations
   to the document since there are a number of requirements?

Richard's comments and my responses start here:

Excellent! <relieved grin>

IJ: The word agent was intentional, but not a good
choice. "Agent" here meant "actors in the accessibility drama":
authors, developers, spec writers. I'll find better wording.

IJ: Ok, let's ask the UAWG.

IJ: Since the last call draft, we have eliminated the term
"standard API" as well as the need for the term. We have made the
requirements of Guideline 6 more precise. However, the term
"standard" was intentionally left in the Guideline title in the
hopes that it would convey a sense, if the not the details of the
requirements that follow. I don't have a proposal for a better term.

IJ: That is exactly the intention of checkpoint 9.9 (in the 22
June draft):

<BLOCKQUOTE>
9.9 Structured navigation. (P2)
  
  1.Allow the user to navigate efficiently to and among important
  structural elements.

  2.Allow forward and backward sequential navigation to important
  structural elements.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Does this satisfy your comment?

IJ: Yes, I agree.

IJ: Ok.

IJ: Fixed in the 22 June draft.

IJ: I agree that it's confusing to talk about graphical user
interface and audio cues as written. I'll tidy it up.

IJ: Yes, I agree.

IJ: In my opinion, that's just one example that is already
covered by the conformance model: it doesn't really matter to us
where the components that are in the subject of the claim
reside. For instance, the documentation to satisfy Guideline 12
may be on the Web or on a CD. I would note that for some of the
requirements of the document, server-based functionalities are
exempted explicitly when they cannot be controlled by the user
agent (another way of saying that they are not part of the
claim).

We could include your example (with fictional product names and
all) to illustrate the case of a distributed user agent. I note
that this is not really our target user agent, however.

IJ: Fixed/changed in the 22 June draft.

>In the note, exactly what is meant by digital rights management ? A

IJ: I can steal this text from the W3C announcement [3] of the
Digital Rights Management workshop earlier this year:

 "Digital Rights Management (DRM) refers to techniques for
 describing and perhaps enforcing copyrights associated with Web
 resources"

[3] http://www.w3.org/2000/11/w3c-drm-cfp

>[4. Glossary]
>
>Assistive technology
>
>First sentence in item #2 contains a superfluous word "a":

IJ: Yes.

IJ: Yes.

IJ: Ok.

>Visual track
>
>Second sentence contains inappropriate use of the word "an" before a

IJ: Yes. I even found a few other instances of "an visual" based
on your comment. Heh heh!

IJ: Yes, you are correct. There have been other edits to the text
since then, and I will incorporate your change into the new text.
