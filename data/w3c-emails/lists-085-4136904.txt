Hello,

I am pleased to confirm that the next face-to-face meeting
of the UAWG will be hosted by Microsoft on Thursday 
and Friday 13-14 September 2001. I have started a meeting 
page [1] but it is still largely empty. I will add information a
bout hotels, transportation, and details about registration
as quickly as possible.

There will be other WAI meetings that week at Microsoft as well:

  * WCAG WG meets Monday and Tuesday
  * ATAG WG meets Tuesday with WCAG, then Weds and Thurs.
  * UAAG WG meets Thursday and Friday

The UAAG 1.0 should be a Candidate Recommendation at that
time, so we will be talking about and documentation 
implementations. I encourage you to ask implementors you
know whether they would like to attend, and have them contact
Jon Gunderson or myself for an invitation.

I look forward to seeing you in Redmond,

 - Ian
