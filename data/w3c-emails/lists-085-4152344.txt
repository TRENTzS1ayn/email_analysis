Hello,

Please indicate whether you will or will not be able to attend
a 5 July teleconference. This will affect whether we skip
a week.

I am able to attend a 5 July teleconference, though I wouldn't
mind a break. I don't want too long a break since we have to
finish up the SVG WG teleconference.

 - Ian
