I can be there. I think a break is in order so Ian can catch up and the SVG
group can provide preliminary feedback on Ian's response questions to the
SVG report.

Hello,

Please indicate whether you will or will not be able to attend
a 5 July teleconference. This will affect whether we skip
a week.

I am able to attend a 5 July teleconference, though I wouldn't
mind a break. I don't want too long a break since we have to
finish up the SVG WG teleconference.

 - Ian
