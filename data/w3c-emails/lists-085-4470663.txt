Amaya provides a source view like other editors do.

But it also provides access to the document object. It processes some
information (what it can handle) to render it in a formatted way. For the
entire source it attempts to construct a tree of elements, which lists all
the attributes that each element has in the source. It is possible to use a
menu to get the value of any attribute on any element, in any view.

I will try to do this for ATAG anyway, so when I have the technique I will
share it. (I am trying to use http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/sources to describe
the ways there are available for sharing techniqes across documents, as well
as describing how ATAG is created...)

  I agree with Ian.  I think that we should have a specific requirement for
  access to the document source.  While a document source view is the most
  common practice of providing access to the source, I think the concept of a
  document source view is to provide access to the source information.  If
  there are other ways to do this than a text editor view we can put them in
  the techniques document.

  Charles would you be willing to submit a technique on how Amaya provides a
  document source view?
