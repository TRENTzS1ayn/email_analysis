More implementation information:

Amir Herzberg (who is part of the W3C Micropayments Markup Working
Group) informs me that for "NewGenPay Micropayments Wallet" [3]:

  "...[the] user can configure a pop-up confirmation 
   for payments over a user defined amount."
 
(I hope to get a URI to online documentation of this feature.)

That makes two implementations (see earlier on this
thread) of a payment system that illustrates configuration to 
confirm payments.
