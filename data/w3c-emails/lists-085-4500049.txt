Hello,

In response to the resolution of issue 404 [1] to include a
requirement to allow access to the full range of values if
text decorations are used to distinguish text, I propose the
following definition of "text decoration".

   In this document, a "text decoration" means any stylistic 
   effect that the user agent may apply to visually rendered 
   text that does not affect the layout of the document 
   (i.e., does not require reformatting when applied or 
   removed). Text decoration mechanisms include underline,
   overline, and strike-through.

 - Ian
