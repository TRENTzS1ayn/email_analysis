aloha, ian!

under the last grouping of techniques for UAAG checkpoint 6.2
could you please explicitly state that, in addition to HTML & 
XML, that the [VALIDATOR] also handles XHTML (a "self-evident" 
inference that should probably be made explicit) as well as
MathML2, at least according to the Math Activity's page [1], 
although the validator's intro page [2] doesn't mention anything 
about MathML2, so you might want to ping gerald on that one...
(nevermind, i just added gerald's eddress to the CC field)

a similar statement would, i believe, also be appropriate in 
the "References" section under the [VALIDATOR] entry...

thanks,
gregory
