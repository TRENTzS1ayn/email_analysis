JRG: I don't think the group has enough knowledge about this potential 
problem to make it part of the recommendation.  There are a number of 
implementation issues that relate to how a plug-in gets information from 
the OS and the browser.  At this time it seems that this is something that 
is implied by the current guidelines for conformance groupings that include 
plug-ins, but we do not have a specific requirement.  If this is something 
important we can add it to the next version of the guidelines.

JRG: I don't know enough about the problem either.

JRG: Currently this would seem to me more of a platform specific API request.

JRG: Correct and I don't think we currently have enough people in our 
working group with expertise in these areas.

JRG: I agree let's just drop this one for now.  We can put it on our issue 
list for the next version of the document.
