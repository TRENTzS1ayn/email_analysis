No, the "default choices" are those of the user agent
without any changes from the user. This checkpoint includes
requirements to override both the UA defaults and author-specified
colors.

That's why I don't think we can omit the "defaults" that follows.

Hmm, I was hoping that "all text" suggested "all text all the time"

I propose using the term "global", which is already used in
the checkpoint on global volume control.

I think that "full range" is a common English expression. From
Mirriam-Webster:

range: 
  8 a : the set of values a function may take on
    b : the class of admissible values of a variable

On the other hand, "full domain" shocks me, 
though I am aware of the mathematical usage.

I'm afraid that "gamut" may be too erudite.
MW says for gamut:

 2 : an entire range or series <ran the gamut 
     from praise to contempt>
