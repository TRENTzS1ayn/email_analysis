There is an example of a script at http://www.peepo.com that allows keyboard
navigation to work like mouse-based navigation, changing an effect that is
stylistic. (This is a cool example of how this should be done, but also shows
the hassles of dealing with current browsers...)

It occurs to me that the script could be generalised, so that instead of
triggering a specific action, it triggers a mouseover / click / etc event.

This could then be used in a browser as an implementation example for
ensuring device-independent access to event triggers in HTML, which is
important for accessibility, but as I understand it at risk for lack of
implementation proof.

Any takers for playing with this?
