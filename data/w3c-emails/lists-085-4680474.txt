Hello,

I've published the 13 January 2001 version of the
UAAG 1.0 [1] and Techniques [2] documents. I believe
that this document represents the WG's resolutions to
second last call issues through the 11 January 2001
teleconference. The list of changes [3] is online 
and quoted as text below.

My current impression about the changes to the
document are that they should not cause us to 
return to last call. I don't believe that that
is my impression based on a desire to advance
quickly! Rather, most of the changes are clarifiactions
(that narrow the scope of the document and tighten it),
and those that increase the requirements of the
document have developer support and implementation
experience to back them up.

The most significant changes in this draft are:

1) The conformance model has changed again (still attempting
   to make it as simple as possible, although it is actually
   complex). Please review section 3.

2) The introductory text (section 1), which gives context
   for the document. Please review sections 1.1-1.4

3) Combining/moving some checkpoints. In particular:
    - Highlight of fee links, active elements, and
      recently visited links in one checkpoint.
    - Configuration requirements for input (Guideline 9)
      are in one checkpoint.
    - Guideline 1 and Guideline 9 checkpoints about 
      OS conventions moved to Guideline 5.

4) Added checkpoint 4.19 (P3, to prevent auto-close
   of window).

5) Added checkpoint 8.2 (P2, default highlight requirements,
   but this information is extracted from other checkpoints).

6) Added checkpoint 8.9: (P2, about prompt before pay configuration.
   We have three implementations for this requirement suggested
   by a reviewer).

7) Raised priority of checkpoint 5.9 to P2 (we have implementation
   experience, support from developers, and support from WG).

8) Edits to definitions of "active element", "recognize", and
   addition of "text decoration" and "fee link".

9) Edits to applicability provisions so that they are format-based
   exceptions rather than "user agent ability" exceptions.

Your comments on this draft are highly encouraged!

CHANGES
=======

General

 * Some checkpoints moved around (sorry folks). Notably, checkpoints
   in G1 and G9 were moved to G5 since they are about following OS
   conventions.
 * Per [47]issue 374 changed "inflected speech" to "speech prosody"
   in two places.
 * Per [48]issue 397, Global change from "range of system fonts
   [and/or] colors" to "full range of fonts [and/or] colors supported
   by the system".
 * Changed "manual (request)" to "on demand" in several checkpoints.
 * To avoid confusion with "selection", use the verb "choose" rather
   than "select" when not about the selection.

Abstract

 * Per [49]issue 356, some edits in abstract and elsewhere to no
   longer talk about the "scope of the document."

Introduction

Important editorial changes. Based on [50]issue 356, section 1.2 was
split into a number of sections, one of which is "known limitations".
The sections are:
 * Minor: Added direct link to WAI resources page from after TOC.
 * New: Relationship of this document to other WAI guidelines. In
   particular, how the UAAG 1.0 uses WCAG 1.0 and does repair in the
   WAI accessibility model. This is a new section that sets the stage
   for additional information about importing WCAG terms, part of
   resolving issues 321 and 322 (still open action items).
 * Target user agents (mostly existing text)
 * Known limitations of this document: Added to this section: input
   modalities, time, security, and IPR (the last three per [51]issue
   377). Per [52]issue 396, added that resizing capabilities may be
   required for conformance to other specifications (e.g., SVG
   [[SVG]]).
 * Relationship to general software design guidelines (includes some
   info on installation). This is mostly existing text.

Guidelines

 * Guideline 3: Title shortened to "Allow configuration not to render
   some content that may reduce accessibility."
 * Guideline 6: Per [53]issue 428, s/promote accessibility/benefit
   accessibility.

Checkpoints

 * 1.1: Per [54]issue 416, added examples to Note, including
   selection.
 * 1.1, 1.2: Changed "user may" to "user can".
 * 1.2: Per [55]issue 392, language harmonized with that of 1.1 for
   three input modalities.
 * 2.2: Per [56]issue 360:
      + Note clearly states that this checkpoint applies only when
timing is recognized.
      + Added SMIL example to note
      + Added statement about what not required by 2.2
      + Does not talk about scripts explicitly to avoid suggesting
that no timing can be recognized in a script.
 * 2.2, 3.3: Edits to Notes to use "applicability" and "recognize" in
   a consistent manner.
 * 2.6: Per [57]issue 381, clarified language about missing
   equivalents. Now repair requirement easier to read.
 * 3.1, 3.5: Clarify that when background images or scripts are
   present but not processed, to alert the user.
 * 3.3, 3.4: Changed "motionless" to "motionless, unblinking"
 * 3.3: Per [58]issue 363, added note that this checkpoint does not
   address text blinking and animation effects caused by means (e.g.,
   scripts) that the user agent cannot recognize.
 * 3.5: Per [59]issue 364, added "any" to checkpoint text to clarify
   that this is a resource-level requirement.
 * 3.6: Per [60]issue 428, dropped requirement for control when
   instantaneous redirect.
 * 3.6, 3.7, 4.18: Per [61]issue 408, indicate in each checkpoint
   that one way to handle "on demand" is through a link or responding
   to a prompt.
 * 3.8: Added missing information about placeholder requirement per
   [62]observation from Ian.
 * 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.9: Now use the term "global configuration" (see
   glossary).
 * 4.4, 4.5 (were 4.5, 4.6): Rewritten to make "style exception"
   clearer. Per [63]issue 398, added more rationale to note after
   4.4, as well as reference to WCAG requirements and some examples
   of what is recognizable as style. Added x-ref from 4.5 to 4.4 for
   this explanation.
 * 4.9: Per [64]issue 434, added an configuration option to override
   author-specified and UA default settings for global volume.
 * 4.10 (was 4.11): Per [65]issue 400, added to Note (a) Rationale
   about why for sounds that are not synched. (b) UA may satisfy by
   allowing control of all sources.
 * 4.10, 4.12: Per [66]issue 434, added Note to clarify that this
   includes override of author-specified volumes.
 * 4.13 (was 4.14): Per [67]issue 361, added information about preset
   options to Note.
 * 4.17: Per [68]issue 410, deleted second sentence since redundant
   with 4.18. Per [69]issue 411, added to end of first sentence "with
   which it overlaps".
 * 4.18: Per [70]issue 409, added a sentence that "If a viewport
   (e.g., a frame set) contains other viewports, these requirements
   only apply to the outermost container viewport."
 * 4.19: Added per [71]issue 407.
 * 5.6 (was 1.2): Per [72]issue 367 and [73]issue 323, checkpoint
   modified to make OS and programming language APIs examples of
   standard accessibility APIs. [This seems more consistent with what
   the WG discussed at AOL and with the reviewer's comments.]
 * 5.9 (was 5.7): Raised priority from P3 to P2 per [74]issue 437.
 * 5.10 (was 8.6): Moved to Guideline 5 per [75]issue 421. Wording
   harmonized with checkpoint 5.12 (formerly 5.8).
 * 5.12 (was 5.8): Per [76]issue 412, added "that benefit
   accessibility" to second sentence.
 * 7.3, 7.4: Per [77]issue 350, added more clarification about their
   difference.
 * 7.5: Per [78]issue 354 and [79]issue 417:
      + Now includes requirements in the case of wrapping.
      + Offending text about inside/outside viewport removed.
 * 7.6: Per [80]issue 370, incorporated editorial changes
   [81]proposed by Ian.
 * 8.2: Added per [82]issue 422 based on [83]proposal from Ian.
 * 8.3: Per [84]issue 422, subsumes checkpoints from previous draft:
   8.2, 8.3, and 8.8. Min req added that one mechanism other than
   color required for graphical viewports. Per [85]issue 419, since
   fee links, recently visited links, and active elements are
   rendered "statically", it's ok to use fonts to highlight them. So
   added "font variations" to note after this checkpoint.
 * 8.4: Per [86]issue 352:
      + Moved cross-reference to 7.6 to Note.
      + Edited Note to make clearer (a) outline view concept (b) what
navigable outline means (c) positive relationship to 7.6
(rather than negative)
   Per [87]issue 387, rewrote based on [88]proposal from Ian.
 * 8.6: Per [89]issue 422, subsumes checkpoints from previous draft:
   4.15, 4.16 and first part of 8.6. Min req added that one mechanism
   other than color required for graphical viewports. Per [90]issue
   419, added recommendation that since selection/focus change
   frequently, UAs should not use mechanisms that cause reflow (e.g.,
   font size variations).
 * 8.7: About viewport highlight only. Added requirement that default
   cannot rely on color alone.
 * 8.9: Added per [91]issue 420 (as resolved at [92]11 Jan teleconf).
 * 9.1: Per [93]issue 423, added Note: "To satisfy this checkpoint,
   the user agent may make available binding information in a
   centralized fashion (e.g., a list of bindings) or a distributed
   fashion (e.g., by listing keyboard shortcuts in user interface
   menus)."
 * 9.2 (was 9.3): Per [94]issue 423, (1) Changed checkpoint text to
   state centralized view explicitly. (2) Moved HTML example to note
   (3) More clarifications in Note, including different views per
   modality.
 * 9.3 (was 9.4): Subsumes 9.4 and 9.5 from previous draft (combined
   for clarity). This cancels the need for the resolution to
   [95]issue 425 (and is inspired by the reviewer's comments). Some
   edits to 9.3 to make clearer modifier key requirements.
 * 9.4 (was 9.8): Moved to position after 9.3 per [96]issue 426.
   Also, added note that there is no requirement in this checkpoint
   for simple bindings by default.
 * 10.2, 10.4: Per [97]issue 428, s/promote accessibility/benefit
   accessibility.

Conformance

Important changes and clarifications here. I have attempted to
simplify the conformance model so that by default, you have to do
everything, and that to do less than that, you must say how you narrow
the scope of conformance in your claim (through three mechanisms).
 * To avoid "core" labels, made content type labels reduce the scope.
   So label names now *negative*. These changes eliminate the need
   for the "All" class and abbreviated labels.
 * Input modality labels are also "negative" (they decrease the
   scope).
 * Changed content type label "Text" to "NoColorText".
 * Per [98]issue 355: Edits to section on using OS features for
   conformance. Made this section a subsection of section on claim
   validity.
 * Text no the importance of accessible by default added to note in
   section on valid conformance claim. (refer to not-yet-discussed
   [99]issue 447, which complains about what "conformance by default"
   means.).
 * Per [100]issue 377, Added new section "Restricted functionality
   and conformance"
 * Per [101]issue 438, added statement Note: "Developers are
   encouraged to design user agents that are at least partially
   operable through all three input modalities."
 * Applicability provisions: Per [102]issue 357, edited provisions 2
   and 3 per [103]proposal from Ian. Added fee links as an example of
   what must be recognized in content.

Glossary

 * Active element: Edits for clarity per [104]issue 403:
   markup/content determines what is active (not scripts or style).
   Also, per [105]issue 369, added "For the requirements of this
   document, user agents are only expected to recognize potentially
   active elements through markup, not through scripts or style
   sheets (e.g., the ':hover' pseudo-class of CSS 2).
 * Fee link: Added per [106]issue 422. The definition makes clear
   that fee links must be identified client-side.
 * Global configuration: This term added and used in checkpoints 4.1,
   4.2, 4.3, and 4.9.
 * Input configuration: Per [107]issue 424, now mentions that
   bindings not recognized (e.g., set through scripts) are not
   applicable
 * Placeholder: Added per [108]issue 383. Placeholders not
   necessarily in DOM. Placeholders strictly in the UI (not in the
   DOM) are subject to 1.3
 * Recognize: Important clarifications (I hope!) to make this
   format-centric, not user agent centric. No longer about what the
   UA is programmed to do. Instead, about what the format enables.
   This change made to be consistent with language adopted in the
   applicability provisions per [109]issue 357.
 * Rendered content: definition now clearly states that some content
   may not be inside viewport at some times.
 * Repair content: no longer states that content generated as a
   result of user preferences is necessarily for repair; that is part
   of the defn of placeholder. Repair content not necessarily in DOM.
 * Text decoration: Added per [110]issue 422.
 * Voice browser: Added (based on info from [111]voice browser
   activity home page).

References

 * Added [ADOBE] (techniques only) per [112]issue 357
 * Per [113]issue 366, deleted [WAIRESOURCES] (since direct link
   now).
 * Added [ICAB] (techniques only).

Techniques

 * 2.2: Added SMIL ref and HTML/META technique to 2.2
 * 3.6: Per [114]issue 428, added technique to allow for
   configuration even when t=0
 * 4.4 (was 4.5): Added some techniques for "bgsound" and
   "background" in HTML.
 * 4.11 (was 4.12): Per [115]issue 403, added technique about
   override of author-specified chnages to playback rate.
 * 5.3: Per [116]issue 436, added some non-HTML/XML markup languages
   to techniques. Added MSAA and JAVAAPI as apis
 * 5.6 (was 1.2): Edited techniques per [117]issue 367 and [118]issue
   323.
 * 5.12 (was 5.8): Per [119]issue 395, Added technique that rationale
   of this document for making content accessible applies to UI as
   well.
 * 7.3: Per [120]issue 439, added technique about direct navigation
   and when it may be useful
 * 7.5: Added a technique about small viewports or big matchs and
   where to put viewport when there's a match.
 * 8.2: Added mini technique add to highlighting checkpoint on
   potential conflict for colors
 * 8.3: Moved techniques about selection/focus to 8.6 instead. Added
   some CSS techniques.
 * 9.2 (was 9.3): Added some techniques. Some based on
   [121]techniques from Charles.
 * 10.5: Per [122]issue 428, added technique to 10.5 suggesting
   linking from documentation required by 10.4. Removed "at a
   minimum" from techniques for 10.5.
 * Added JavaScript techniques (distributed among checkpoints)
   [123]proposed by Jon.
 * Fixed technique for repair content to say that repair content
   should conform to WCAG (instead of "must be accessible").
