Known Limitation of the UA Guidelines regarding Instruction and Assessment

In section 1.3, I suggest adding a known limitation regarding effectiveness
of instruction or assessments. This is important because provision of
alternative representations is central to our accessibility strategy, yet
depending on what is being taught or assessed, provision of such
alternatives may 'short circuit' or damage the validity of an assessment or
the teaching effectiveness of an instructional module. How this potential
for damage is addressed is highly specific to the purpose of the instruction
and assessment as well as to the intended audience.

New:

"Effectiveness of instruction or assessments. The document does not address
issues of effectiveness of instruction or assessments, such as how provision
of alternative content may affect inferences about what a person knows or
can do in an instructional or assessment setting. For example, the nature of
inferences that one could draw about a user's ability to understand an
auditory presentation may be influenced by an accessibility-motivated
provision of a text equivalent of the presentation."
