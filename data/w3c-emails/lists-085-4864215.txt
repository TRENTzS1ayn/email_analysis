Announcements

    1.Next User Agent face-to-face meeting in Boston on 1-2 March 2001

Discussion

    1.Update on joint meetings at all working group meeting

    2.Issue 389: Conformance: Hard to test conformance in an objective 
fashion.
      Source: http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#389
      Status: I wrote the reviewer with clarifications and asked for 
comment. No response yet.
      http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0038.html
      Proposed resolution by IJ: We have reduced some of the conformance 
requirements as a result of the reviewer's comments. We have worked very hard
      on this conformance scheme and rejected a number of others. If the 
reviewer has specific suggestions, we will consider them.

    3.Issue 443: Checkpoint 1.4: Device indepdent access to pointer (mouse) 
specific events.
      Source: http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#443
      Status: The document currently requires emulation of mouse-specific 
controls by virtue of our requirement that the user must be able to do 
everything
      through the mouse.
      Discussion:
      a) Do we want to require the UA to repair device-specific bindings 
specified by the author?
      b) Do we have evidence that the ability to simulate mouse events 
through the keyboard benefits the user?

    4.Issue 448: Checkpoint 5.7: Is CSS read-only or read/write? [This is 
checkpoint 5.9 in the 13 January 2001 draft.]
      Source: http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#448
      Comment: The reviewer's comment was "Is this section referring to 
viewing the page or editing the page? Why would a user need to access the 
CSS when viewing a document?"
      Proposed resolution by IJ: Make this requirement read-only access. - 
We already require that a conforming user agent allow the user to select 
and apply user style sheets (checkpoint 4.15 in 13 Jan 2001 draft). - We 
require that the user be able to operate the user agent through keyboard 
alone. - Therefore, the user should be able to apply user style sheets 
through the conforming UA's user interface. ATs do not need to write to 
user style sheets through an API. Can people suggest a scenario where the 
AT would need to write to the conforming user agent's user style sheet 
through an API?

    5.Issue 450: If UA is implemented in Java, what system conventions 
should it follow?
      Source: http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#450

    6.Issue 451: Checkpoint 2.6: Generalize to decorative content, not just 
null alt
      Source: http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#451

    7.Issue 452: Checkpoint 2.2: Review minimal requirement (three options?)
      Source: http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#452

    8.Issue 453: Checkpoint 3.5: Generalize to "programmatic objects"
      Source: http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#453

    9.Issue 454: Checkpoints 3.6/3.7: Should these be Priority 1?
      Source: http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#454

   10.Issue 455: Guideline 4: Change to "Ensure user control of presentation"?
      Source: http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#455

   11.Issue 456: Editorial: Need to clarify in section 3.2 that we do not 
mean system APIs
      Source: http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#456

   12.Issue 457: Checkpoint 5.4: Ambiguity about what exactly required: 
standard APIs only?
      Source: http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#457

   13.Issue 458: Do link highlighting requirements apply to all zones of an 
image map? What is required granularity?
      Source: http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#458
