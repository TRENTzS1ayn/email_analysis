I took an action item to send implementation examples of
re-configurable mouse bindings.  this is for action only not
input.  I have two of them.  one is in the folder options of later
windows.9x and millennium as well as 2,000.  I don't know about
nt.

you have two choices as to method of selection and opening.  one
is point to select and single click to open and the other is
single click to select and double click to open.  The latter is
acceptable practice for use with assistive technologies because it
is more keyboard obtainable.

The other example I have is with icq but I don't have it to hand.
In the events section of preferences, you can have events popped
up with either a double click of left mouse button or single click
of right mouse button.  You can also have events pop up
automatically but that is for another implementation example.
