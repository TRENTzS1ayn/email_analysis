I would like the working group to carefully consider raising checkpoint 3.6 
and 3.7 to P1 based on last call issue 454 [1].  It seems that if the user 
agent is automatically changing content and the user cannot control the 
changes the user would not have access to content in some cases.  These 
checkpoints were a P3 requirement in our previous last call and raised to 
P2 last spring.  We now have a request and it seems reasonable to make this 
a P1 requirement.  I would like working group input on this issue.  Please 
send previous rationalizations for the P2 and P3 of the past or your 
support for making this a P1 requirement.

Thanks,
Jon
