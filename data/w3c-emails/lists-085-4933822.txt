Jon, 

It would certainly appear that if a user agent is changing the content is
some unprompted fashion (presumably time dependent), then the information
would be inaccessible to a person who requires extra time to absorb the
information.  Since this makes that content impossible to access, that would
make these P1 issues.

Subject: Issue 454: Raising Priority of Checkpoints 3.6 and 3.7 related to
automatic updates or redirects of content
Importance: High

I would like the working group to carefully consider raising checkpoint 3.6
and 3.7 to P1 based on last call issue 454 [1].? It seems that if the user
agent is automatically changing content and the user cannot control the
changes the user would not have access to content in some cases.? These
checkpoints were a P3 requirement in our previous last call and raised to
P2 last spring.? We now have a request and it seems reasonable to make this
a P1 requirement.? I would like working group input on this issue.? Please
send previous rationalizations for the P2 and P3 of the past or your
support for making this a P1 requirement.

Thanks,
Jon
