Al, 

I thought about the back button as a way around this, but if the change is
time dependent, it will likely forward again before the user can access the
information.  The only time this wouldn't happen would be if you could
orient and begin reading from where you left off before the change, and I'm
not sure that the technology would necessarily allow that.

AG::

On the other hand, does the user have the ability to go back after a pushed
change in the content?? It is also possible to argue for P2 on the grounds
that
extracting the information becomes quite hard, but not flat out impossible.

Al

PS:? I am afraid this issue throws me back into a tailspin about the
interpretation of the priority levels.? This is a case where it is not clear
that the distinctions used in the WCAG are the right sort of policy
breakpoints
for a User Agent guide.

I really think that User Agents SHOULD _all_ provide the user with this
kind of
control.? The only problem I see here is in using language to explain why
that
User Agent developers will take as objective and reasonable.
