Hello,

In the 16 Jan 2001 version of the Guidelines [1],
checkpoint 2.2 reads:

    2.2 For a presentation that requires user input within 
        a specified time interval controlled by the user agent, 
        allow the user to configure the user agent to pause
        the presentation automatically and await user input 
        before proceeding.

I am working on an action item with Eric to improve 
the definition of "presentation". In reviewing checkpoint
2.2, I had the following ideas.

1) I feel like checkpoint 2.2 may be unnecessarily
   bound to the term "presentation":

 - We don't have a rock-solid definition of "presentation"
   Right now, the definition suggests synchronized multimedia.

 - I believe that this checkpoint covers more than just
   synchronized multimedia presentations.

2) Checkpoint 2.2 is clearly about content that depends
on time. This implies that that there may be different 
user interactions possible over the course of time, and
the checkpoint should be sure to allow that (notably
for consistency with checkpoint 2.5 to respect synchronization
cues). A user agent should not satisfy checkpoint 2.2 by
removing all time-dependencies; it should only satisfy
checkpoint 2.2 by pausing when user input is required and
resuming thereafter. Thus, content might evolve for one minute, 
then pause indefinitely for user interaction, then resume
another minute, then pause indefinitely, etc.

Please consider this rewrite (that includes a couple 
of other simplifications as well) to take into account
these two points:

<NEW>
2.2 For content that requires user input within a 
time interval controlled by the user agent, allow
configuration to make the time interval "infinite"
(i.e., pause automatically at the beginning of each 
time interval where user input is required,
and resume automatically at the completion of user
input).
</NEW>

 - Ian
