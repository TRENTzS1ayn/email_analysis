For using keyboartd equivalents for activation of events, mouseKeys allows
you to simulate clicks, double-clicks, right-clicks, and I think some other
stuff (on the mac - it's a standard extension avaialble for free).

But id doesn't solve the navigation problem for you, which is required to
deal with the focus/mouseover type behaviours.

I should go think about how to do it in Javascript - I am pretty sure it
isn't too hard.

Algorithm:
Serialise the active elements (form controls, links, thinks with behaviour
attributes)
Provide a means of going to the next or previous
Optionally, provide a means of saying what they are (a note to the status
line, for example)
Provide a standardised way of activating the different possible behaviours

  nt.

  you have two choices as to method of selection and opening.  one
  is point to select and single click to open and the other is
  single click to select and double click to open.  The latter is
  acceptable practice for use with assistive technologies because it
  is more keyboard obtainable.

  The other example I have is with icq but I don't have it to hand.
  In the events section of preferences, you can have events popped
  up with either a double click of left mouse button or single click
  of right mouse button.  You can also have events pop up
  automatically but that is for another implementation example.
