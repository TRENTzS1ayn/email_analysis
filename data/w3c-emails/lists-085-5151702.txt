my problem with tinkering with refreshes still holds.  there is
content that will be missed if we control the refresh and that which
will be missed if we do not.  I think this should be kicked around a
bit with the content people and perhaps pf or a group that sets rules
for causing the refreshes in the first places?  I think then if you
are going to require the user agent to interact in this way that you
must also require that it store the refreshed content and allow it to
be retrieved as needed.

I think the raltionale for them being P2 is that in the case of
redirects
the author had not intended the page with the redirect to be viewed
anyway, so that not having access was not considered to be a P1 issue.
So
I thin this one does not need to be changed.

For automatic client side refreshes this probably needs to be changed
to
a P1. One techniques is that the stop loading button stops the
refreshes
and the user can refresh manually.  We should see if this already
works
with current browsers.
