Either way there is a risk of losing something. The proposal is that the user
gets to decide whether they miss out on getting updates every n seconds, as
prpoposed by the author, or whether tey miss out on getting a chance to
actually find out what is in the content, a constraint imposed by their own
system. I use lynx specifically for this purpose - it converts the refresh
into a link that requires user activation rather than making it happen
automatically.

I think Jon's suggestions here are very sound.

  for causing the refreshes in the first places?  I think then if you
  are going to require the user agent to interact in this way that you
  must also require that it store the refreshed content and allow it to
  be retrieved as needed.

  I think the raltionale for them being P2 is that in the case of
  redirects
  the author had not intended the page with the redirect to be viewed
  anyway, so that not having access was not considered to be a P1 issue.
  So
  I thin this one does not need to be changed.

  For automatic client side refreshes this probably needs to be changed
  to
  a P1. One techniques is that the stop loading button stops the
  refreshes
  and the user can refresh manually.  We should see if this already
  works
  with current browsers.
