ok, but perhaps there needs to be a bit of clarification?
consider the following senario:
a user is typing into a form and when the last required character has
been typed the form goes away.  this is what the wording says to me.
An example of part of this is when filling in some registration
numbers for some installations, the key flows to the next numeric
group and inserts the dash at the appropriate point making it
difficult to check one's work.  true there is almost always a next
button but this might not be the case on the web.

"At the completion of user input" means whenever the user
has decided they they're done. What they do before confirmation
is up to them and the user agent's general capabilities
for editing one's input.

So, I don't think that the current checkpoint prevents
one from checking one's work before the presentation
continues.
