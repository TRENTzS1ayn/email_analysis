I took an action item:

   15.DP: Send information on programmable objects based on security
options in IE
      Source:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0105.html
Using ie 5.5 I opened up internet options, went to the security
properties sheet and selected custom level.  Some of these might not
apply but they should be self evident.  I've listed the choices of
behaviors where available.
  We might want some of this granularity instead of flat either or.
The list follows:
    under activex controls and plug-ins:
1> download signed activex controls:
can be configured to:
a. disable
b. enable
c. prompt
2> download unsigned activex controls:
can be configured to:
a. disable
b. enable
c. prompt
3> initialize and script activex controls marked as safe:
can be configured to:
a. disable
b. enable
c. prompt

h> submit nonencripted form data:

l> logon:

b. automatic logon only in intra net zone on/off
L> automatic logon with current user name and password:
can be configured as follows:
prompt for user name and password on/off

Note, the settings above can be achieved in large batches in the
instance of security here.  they can be set via the state of the
global security setting which ranges from none to full and will be
adjusted according to the setting of that parameter.  I did not
include the main groupings here as it was important to define the
scope of the list only.  This should be a fairly complete list of
items to be covered with some actually being outside the scope of the
issue we are attempting to address.
