One customization that I would like: Allow my audiogram (hearing loss
vs frequency) to shape the algorithm used for rate change without pitch 
shift. This is significant to me, as I have 60db loss between 2Khz and 
3Khz. I would like to have the plosives to be stretched, to reduce their 
high-frequency harmonics. Does anyone have any experience with this 
possibility?
An analogous technique might be important to shorten low-frequency phonemes
(such as changing to a female voice to avoid the too-low fundamental).
My customization desire would apply to listening to narrations in SMIL,
as we need for digital talking books.
