I can see what you are saying, but it sort of begs the question, "If it is
so 'important' and 'special', why isn't it _at least_ as important (in terms
of priority) as the checkpoint of which it is a special case?"

I tend to think of a special case as a 'subset' or a closer look at
something and that an 'important' special case would be at least as
important in terms of 'priority'.....

Maybe we should say that checkpoint 9.6 (P3) is an "_unimportant_ special
case" of checkpoint 9.3 (P2)....!?
