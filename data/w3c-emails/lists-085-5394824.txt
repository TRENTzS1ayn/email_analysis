Hi Eric,

Here's an argument against adding this: Section 1.2 of the 16 Jan
draft [1] includes this statement:

   This document was designed specifically to improve 
   the accessibility of mainstream user agents with multimedia 
   capabilities for users with one or more disabilities 
   (including visual, hearing, physical, and cognitive).
   In this context, a mainstream user agent is one designed 
   for the general public to handle general-purpose content 
   in ordinary operating conditions. 

Instructions and assessments would not be
general-purpose content; this is a particular environment
with particular restrictions.

So is your concern adequately addressed by the existing statement?

 - Ian
