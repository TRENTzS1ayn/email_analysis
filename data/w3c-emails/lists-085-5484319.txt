Nonetheless, I recommend the following for the techniques document
(after we tell authors to use server-side redirects):

   "The user agent may provide a configuration so that when the
    user navigates "back" through the user agent history to a page 
    with a client-side redirect, the user agent does not re-execute
    the client-side redirect."

This might even be a helpful technique in general: when I
move back, don't re-execute scripts except on demand, don't
refresh the cache except on demand, etc.
