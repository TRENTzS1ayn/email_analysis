General

* Global change of "operating system and programming language
  environment" to "operating environment". Left some OS-specific
  examples, however.
* Based on discussion at [49]25 Jan 2001 teleconf, deleted many
  instances of "author-specified" from checkpoints since the
  applicability provision is in effect globally. However, left
  "author-specified" when necessary to distinguish from what is from
  the author and what is from the user agent: keyboard bindings and
  styles, navigation order. Deleted some instances of
  "author-supplied" but left a few others where they added clarity.

Introduction

* At the beginning of section 2, added wording "Some checkpoints
  (e.g., those requiring developers to follow conventions or
  implement specifications defined outside this document) are
  inherently more subject to interpretation than others."

Checkpoints

* 2.1: Per resolution to [50]issue 394, (resolved at [51]18 Jan
  2001), added source-like view to minimal requirement. Added more
  rationale to Note.
* 2.2: Per [52]issue 452 (resolved at [53]25 Jan 2001 teleconf),
  modified checkpoint wording.
* 3.2: Content type label changed from Animation to Image.
* Old 3.4: Deleted checkpoint for no blinking images for a couple of
  reasons: We are not aware of these on the Web, and if there are,
  they are probably covered by the requirements to turn of animated
  images.
* 3.5: Per [54]issue 453, resolved at [55]22 January 2001 teleconf,
  revised checkpoint to use term "executable content".
* 3.6, 3.7: Switched order. Both clearly indicate that driven by
  client, not server. Deleted "author-specified" from both
  checkpoints.
* 3.6: Raised to P1 per [56]issue 454 ([57]25 Jan 2001 teleconf).
* 5.8: New This checkpoint added per resolution to [58]issue 327
  (resolved [59]18 Jan 2001).
* 6.2: Per [60]issue 324 (resolved [61]18 Jan 2001), modified
  checkpoint wording.
* 9.6: Since this checkpoint is P3 and checkpoint 9.3 is P2,
  checkpoint 9.6 is a "special case" of 9.3 but not an important
  special case.

Conformance

* Intro section to section 3 tweaked to be more readable.
* WCAG 1.0 conformance as part of well-formedness only in the case
  when the claim is on the Web.
* Editorial changes to well-formedness section per Eric Hansen
  suggestion. The result is that labels are part of well-formedness
  in the case of a claim of conditional conformance. So "validity"
  is reduced to well-formedness plus verified satisfaction of
  requirements.
* In definition of content type label for image, animated images are
  now included.

Glossary

* Some clarifications to definition of "active element" based on
  [62]proposal from Ian. This definition is likely to undergo more
  refinement based on [63]comments from Eric.
* Added definition of "character encoding"
* Deleted definitions of presentation, multimedia presentation,
  tactile object, tactile-only presentation, tactile track, audio
  object (part of audio track now), and visual object (part of
  visual track now).
* Per [64]issue 450 (resolved at [65]22 Jan 2001 teleconf), added
  "operating environment."

Techniques

* Added mention that W3C validator handles XHTML.
* Checkpoint 2.2: Added techniques proposed by WCAG reviewers.
* Checkpoint 3.5: Mention "ActiveX" in techniques. Added to
  techniques that plug-ins not part of content are not part of this
  checkpoint
* Checkpoint 3.7: Added technique: "The user agent may provide a
  configuration so that when the user navigates "back" through the
  user agent history to a page with a client-side redirect, the user
  agent does not re-execute the client-side redirect."
