Is it correct that the critical feature of an interactive element would be
that it is activatable? Is it possible that an interactive element might not
have the quality of deactivatableness (!?) by virtue of either  by having an
ephemeral existence or by being permanent. I don't mean the question to be
simply philosophical... I am just trying to identify the minimal set of
attributes that would define an interactive element.
