So....

But what happens when an interactive element is deactivated?
a. Is it simply no longer an interactive element? 
b. Is it still an interactive element that has had its behavior undone?
c. Is it still an interactive element, but has been put in a state of
readiness for triggering?

Maybe answers to such questions are not essential but do seem necessary
given that the present definition refers to deactivation:

I wonder if you can get away without using the words activate/deactivate and
simply refer to triggering:

Also the following statement might be clear enough, but I wonder how much
disagreement there might be about the line between an interactive element a
non-interactive element....

EH: I guess we would need to make clear what major specs say that we would
interpret as declaring some element as interactive and then make clear that
in this document we mean elements that have _both_ characteristics.
Otherwise, someone might interpret these characteristics as alternatives,
either of which could qualify the element as interactive. 

As I think about it, when you say that some is X by specification, don't you
simply mean that X is recognizable? If so, then it boils down to something
close to what you proposed.... (see suggestion above).
