I think language on restricting access to content for some "higher" purpose 
is very dangerous.  These are usually the reasons people site for not 
having to deal with accessibility.  This also seems to be an authoring 
issue and I suggest taking it to WCAG for discussion there.  If WCAG 
defines specific authoring practices for testing materials for 
accessibility that need UA support we can deal with those issues in the 
next version of the guidelines.  In testing situations there are techniques 
that would allow the "questions" and the "answers" not to be part of the 
same content.  Even if they are part of the same content it is not required 
that the all content be available at all times.
