Jon,

1. Perhaps some verbiage needs to be added to the Note for checkpoint 2.1 to
the effect that this does "not require that all content be available at all
times".
2. I suggest that the issue regarding the definition of "Text content" await
the forthcoming revision to the definition of "Text content"... The revision
may make the current discussion unecessary.

- Eric
