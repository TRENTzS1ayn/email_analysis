CMN I think the above is really clear and helpful.

CMN I found the second paragraph extremely confusing. As far as I can tell
the User Agent in fact is the ultimate determinnat of whether there is a
behaviour associated with an element. As it is pointed out, there may be one
sometimes, due to the user agent playing around with scripts. And I don't
understand what the applicability reference means. I suggest just removing
this paragraph.

CMN I thought this was useful clarification. But it is not clear whether the
User Agent is responsible for making sure that things which are sometimes
active can always be navgiated to or not.

CMN I don't think these two paragraphs add much more than bulk to the
definition.

CMN I thought this was a definition of what focus was. Is it meant to be
that?
