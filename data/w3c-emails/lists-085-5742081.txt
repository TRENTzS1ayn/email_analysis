                                     Call for Papers

                         INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
  UNIVERSAL ACCESS IN THE INFORMATION SOCIETY

                               Published by Springer

Universal Access in the Information Society (UAIS) is an international,
interdisciplinary refereed journal that solicits original research contributions
addressing the accessibility, usability, and, ultimately, acceptability of
Information Society Technologies by anyone, anywhere, at anytime, and through
any media and device. Universal access refers to the conscious and systematic
effort to proactively apply principles, methods and tools of universal design,
in order to develop Information Society Technologies which are accessible and
usable by all citizens, including the very young and the elderly and people with
different types of disabilities, thus avoiding the need for a posteriori
adaptations or specialized design. The journal's unique focus is on theoretical,
methodological, and empirical research, of both technological and
non-technological nature, that addresses equitable access and active
participation of potentially all citizens in the information society.

The journal's perspective is that the requirement for universal access stems
from the growing impact of the fusion of the emerging technologies, and from the
different dimensions of diversity, which are intrinsic to the information
society. These dimensions become evident when considering the broad range of
user characteristics, the changing nature of human activities, the variety of
contexts of use, the increasing availability and diversification of information
and knowledge sources and services, the proliferation of technological
platforms, etc.

The journal publishes research work on the design, development, evaluation, use,
and impact of Information Society Technologies, as well as on standardization,
policy, and other non-technological issues that facilitate and promote universal
access. Paper submissions, in English, should report on theories, methods,
tools, empirical results, reviews, case studies, and best practice examples, in
any application domain and should have a clear focus on universal access. The
journal will also host special issues, book reviews and letters to the editor,
news from Information Society Technologies industry, and standardization and
regulatory bodies, announcements (e.g., conferences, seminars, presentations,
exhibitions, education & curricula, awards, new research programs) and
commentaries (e.g., about new legislation).
