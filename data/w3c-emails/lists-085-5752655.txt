I did not elaborate upon a "second follow-up thought" but your comments seem
to lead right into it. See comments below...

EH: Very good point. When we say:

"2.1 Make all content available through the user interface"

don't we really just mean "conform to specifications"?

That is, aren't we really saying, "Show through the user interface that
which, according to specfications, should be shown through the user
interface"?

And if so, why do we really need to say it at all, since conformance to
specifications is an assumption underlying the whole document?

If this is the case, then the first sentence of checkpoint 2.1 could be
deleted. 

In that case, we would have the following:

New:

"2.1 Provide a view (e.g., a document source view) of the text portions of
content. This is only required for formats defined by specifications that
the user agent implements. [Priority 1]"  
Old (26 January 2001):

Old:

"2.1 Make all content available through the user interface. As part of
meeting this requirement, provide a view (e.g., a document source view) of
the text portions of content. This is only required for formats defined by
specifications that the user agent implements. [Priority 1]"

EH:

Here is a revision of the checkpoint that pertains to content produced by
the user agent.

New:

"1.3 Ensure that every message (e.g., prompt, alert, notification, etc.)
that is a non-text element and is part of the user agent user interface has
AN AVAILABLE text equivalent. [Priority 1]"

Old (26 January 2001):

"1.3 Ensure that every message (e.g., prompt, alert, notification, etc.)
that is a non-text element and is part of the user agent user interface has
a text equivalent. [Priority 1]"

Comment on revised checkpoint 1.3. This change makes explicit that the text
equivalent must be available to the user.
