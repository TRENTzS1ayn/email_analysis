I can see what you are saying about the difference in priority. Here is
another way to handle this that I think makes more overall sense...

Change checkpoint 6.1, which is P1 to encompass "all features of implemented
specifications", including accessibility features.

New:

"6.1 Implement the features of all implemented specifications (markup
languages, style sheet languages, metadata languages, graphics formats,
etc.). This includes accessibility features of a specification, which are
those identified as such and those that satisfy all of the requirements of
the "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0" [WCAG10]. [Priority 1]"

Old (26 January 2001):

"6.1 Implement the accessibility features of all implemented specifications
(markup languages, style sheet languages, metadata languages, graphics
formats, etc.). The accessibility features of a specification are those
identified as such and those that satisfy all of the requirements of the
"Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0" [WCAG10]. [Priority 1]"

The advantage of this is that it makes guideline 6 cover everything about
conformance to specifications and guideline 2 cover display of content
through the user interface.

To carry things a bit further, I would recommend considering a reordering of
the guidelines.

GL 1 (old GL 6) - Ensure conformance to specifications
GL 2 (old GL 2) - Display content through the user interface
GL 3 (old GL 1) - Support input and output device independence
GL 4 (old GL 3)
GL 5 (old GL 4)
GL 6 (old GL 5)
GL 7 (same)
GL 8 (same)
GL 9 (same)
GL 10 (same)

I think that the reordering is sensible because it puts guideline 6 up front
where it belongs. It seems to me that we are placing greater reliance on the
checkpoints in guideline 6 that ever before and it is time to give it the
prominence that it deserves.
