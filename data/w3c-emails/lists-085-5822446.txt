So much for that thought.

Thanks for reminding me of our distinction between "implementing" a
specification and "conforming" to it....

As I think about it now, it seems to me that we need to be clearer about our
distinction between conformance and implementation (where implementation
encompasses conformance as well as somewhat looser adherence to
specifications as well). This might be something for the introduction,
and/or conformance section, and/or glossary. There ought to be somewhere a
rationale for 6.2 only being P2, based on the existence of   checkpoint 2.1
having a P1 priority. If I can forget about this having gone over the
document as much as I have, then my hunch is that this distinction may be
lost on other readers as well.... Any thoughts on this?
