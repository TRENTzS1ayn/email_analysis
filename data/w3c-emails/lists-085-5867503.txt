Announcements

    1.Next User Agent face-to-face meeting in Boston on 1-2 March 2001

Discussion

    1.All working group meeting coordination

    2.Issue 455: Guideline 4: Change to "Ensure user control of presentation"?
      Source: http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#455

    3.Issue 456: Editorial: Need to clarify in section 3.2 that we do not 
mean system APIs
      Source: http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#456

    4.Issue 457: Checkpoint 5.4: Ambiguity about what exactly required: 
standard APIs only?
      Source: http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#457

    5.Issue 458: Do link highlighting requirements apply to all zones of an 
image map? What is required granularity?
      Source: http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#458

    6.Issue 443: Checkpoint 1.4: Device indepdent access to pointer (mouse) 
specific events.
      Source: http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#443
      Status: The document currently requires emulation of mouse-specific 
controls by virtue of our requirement that the user must be able to do 
everything
      through the mouse.
      Discussion:
      a) Do we want to require the UA to repair device-specific bindings 
specified by the author?
      b) Do we have evidence that the ability to simulate mouse events 
through the keyboard benefits the user?
