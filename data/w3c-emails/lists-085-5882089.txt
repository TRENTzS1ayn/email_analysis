Regrets for the meeting. My comments on the agenda issues are included
inline - search for CMN...

      5.Issue 458: Do link highlighting requirements apply to all zones of an
  image map? What is required granularity?

CMN
Highlighting should be possible for each region. Visually it can be very
difficult to make out what is active otherwise. I am not sure if this is as
important as a P1 issue (it depends on how easy it is for nominally visual
users to actually tab through the links or  otherwise find out what they all
are) but it definitely rates as a P2. (It is repair for poorly authored image
content, but unfortunately there is plenty of that around, and likely to be
for a long time, since creating good communicative images is difficult and
we can expect people to get it wrong as often as they have for the last
fifty years).

      6.Issue 443: Checkpoint 1.4: Device indepdent access to pointer (mouse)
  specific events.
        Source: http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#443
        Status: The document currently requires emulation of mouse-specific
  controls by virtue of our requirement that the user must be able to do
  everything
        through the mouse.
        Discussion:
        a) Do we want to require the UA to repair device-specific bindings
  specified by the author?

CMN
Well, we require the user agent to ensure that the device-specific things can
be done device-indepedently. I guess that means a repair. (Thisprobably
involves some careful thinking - it is possible that a very simplistic
search/replace repair will in fact break well-designed content).

        b) Do we have evidence that the ability to simulate mouse events
  through the keyboard benefits the user?

CMN
Well, it is popular enough for screenreaders to routinely provide it. Use
case: a link that only works as an onclick - form submission, stupid popup
windows, etc. Use case: Rollover or click functions that cause a menu to
appear, which is necessary for navigation. This is something I have seen on
many major sites, including those of participants in this working group.

Again, it is a repair function. Sigh. Maybe User Agent developers will be the
ones to convince authoring tool developers to get their act together and stop
generating so many things to be repaired.

  Open Action Items

        Deadline: one week.

CMN Deadlines that are a date are probably easier to figure out
