Why do you say that the user agent has attached the behavior? The
definition says that what is active is determined by content, not
the author. If the user agent implements the navigable outline view
in HTML, then HTML links define the behavior. What is the format
that the user agent is using to implement this outline view? Where
does the user agent store the fact that selecting a particular
entry links to an original location in the document? In this case,
the user agent is the author of the content, but the content still
is where the user agent (as user agent now, no longer as generator
of content) locates the linking semantics.
