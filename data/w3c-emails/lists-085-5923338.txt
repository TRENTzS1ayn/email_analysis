I know. It was a very low-level comment that recording these things as dates
in the future means we don't have to rely on the fact that our chair is
astute enough to make sense of these things. Slightly more relevant to the
list than "It's really warm and sunny here in Melbourne right now", but only
slightly. It just occurred to me in passing, and seemed like a small habit
shift that could be easily accomplished. (and something I should remember to
think about too)

  Fortunately, our astute Chair put the link to the source of the
  action item, the 25 January 2001 teleconf. I'll let you
  calculate from there.
