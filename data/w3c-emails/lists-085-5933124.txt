Charles,
The original request to add the source URI was that some people wanted 
context information for their action items.  I was not adding the source to 
indicate the deadline in particular, but to allow people to reference the 
discussion that generated the action item.  This sometime included a 
deadline.  Adding deadline information is also useful and I will try to add 
that information in the future if people request it to be included.

But the more information to keep track of manually the more time it takes 
and increases the chance of mistakes between agendas.  What is really 
needed is a action item tracking tool similar to the issue tracking tool 
used by UA, we may have one soon, cross your fingers.

Jon
