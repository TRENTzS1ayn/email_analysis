The outline behavior Charles describes is not defined by the author or 
specification, but by the user agent.  I therefore don't think this is 
content in the sense that we have been using the term.  It seems to me this 
is just a different view of the author supplied content and it may or may 
not be synchronized or linked to another view generated by the user 
agent.  In general we want to encourage the use of specifications, rather 
than convention for defining whether an element is active or not.  The more 
user agents make up there own behaviors the more people will use them, 
breaking interoperability that the W3C and WAI in particular would like to 
promote.
