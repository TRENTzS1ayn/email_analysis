Responses in JRG:

  An example would be an SVG graphic used in a web page.  The SVG

JRG: So this would require source views for unsupported or unrecognized 
formats.  Is XML based formats a special case?

JRG:
Are you saying that the UA must provide source views of linked resources?
Is an image SRC considered link information?
Do you know of anything that does this?
Amaya?

JRG: should "implemented" be "specified".  If the rendering is not 
specified anywhere, do we want to include the concept of using conventions?
