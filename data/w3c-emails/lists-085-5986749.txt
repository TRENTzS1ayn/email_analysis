XML is not alone, but it is an important example because it is where there are
going to be lots of resources where the UA hasn't implemented the dialect yet,
but a source view would be of help.

The definition I suggested had SGML and "Anything recognized as of Internet
Media Type text/*" as well as XML.

In pratcial terms, if the UA's text viewer will accept it, it should be up to
the user then to determine that it is useless garbage or contains intelligible
information.  Text formats are any format where the text viewer is a feasible
fallback.

This comes in two parts.  On the Web, you can't trust the format of a link. 
There may be a type indication on the link, but it's 'advisory.'

So, if there's a linked resource, and you suport hyperlinking, then you owe
the
user to recover the resource, if asked.

Once the resource has been recovered, you have an object in hand.  This value
of the recovered object is what has a type.  If the type is one you can play,
then you owe the user the chance to play it.  The ability to play it in some
context or by itself will depend on a) the rendering rules of the format where
the link was and b) the limitations of the media that the user has the User
Agent displaying into.  So where the rendered value of the recovered object
shows up depends on lots of things.  That's not the point of this discussion. 
What I am talking about is the steps to "play it again, Sam."

Experiment:  In a web page, set the SRC of an IMG to point at an SVG file. 
Then, in Lynx, turn the "image links" feature on to be sure you get recovery
capability.  You may have to adjust the mime.types database to cast image/svg
to text/plain.  But I believe you can configure Lynx as it ships today to walk
through the steps I discussed above.

In Windows, this is handled by the OS.  Any referenced object of an
unrecognized type is immediately turned over to an "OpenWith" dialog in which
the user is queried as to what tool to handle this file with.  So that's lots
more than two Aps that provide this facility.

Or maybe we need to look at the mime.types architecture that is supported by
Lynx and lots of Unix mailers as a second implementation of this case.

Actually, I should have referred to the 'External' capability in Lynx, where
the user can interactively select the player for an object where there is a
link to the object in the page.

I believe that Netscape also has menu extension capabilities like this.
