Discussion

    1.Coordination of joint meetings with DOM and CSS

    2.Issue 443: Checkpoint 1.4: Device indepdent access to pointer (mouse) 
specific events.
      Source: http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#443
      Status: The document currently requires emulation of mouse-specific
      controls by virtue of our requirement that the user must be able to do
      everything through the mouse.
      Discussion:
      a) Do we want to require the UA to repair device-specific bindings 
specified by the author?
      b) Do we have evidence that the ability to simulate mouse events 
through the keyboard benefits the user?

    3.Definition Issues:
         1.Issue 359: Definition: text content (incompatible with WCAG?)
         2.Issue 358: Definition: Equivalent
         3.Issue 322: The definition of the word element
         4.Issue 321: Equivalency relationships and the wording of 
checkpoint 2.3
