Issues
------

1. Issue 449: Executive summary.

 Action JG: Send an outline of what should be in a summary.
 Action EH: Send thoughts on what should be in a summary.
 Action IJ: Write an executive summary appendix.

2.Issues 358, 359, 322, 321, 394 postponed.
   These should be resolved after EH, AG, and IJ finish
   action item regarding checkpoint 2.3 and some definitions.

3.Issue 443: Checkpoint 1.4: Device indepdent access to pointer (mouse) 
     specific events.
  Source:
http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#443
  Status: The document currently requires emulation of mouse-specific
  controls by virtue of our requirement that the user must be able to do
  everything through the mouse.
  Discussion:
  a) Do we want to require the UA to repair device-specific bindings 
     specified by the author?
  b) Do we have evidence that the ability to simulate mouse events 
     through the keyboard benefits the user?

 TL: Scripting languages already provide for keyboard initiation
 of mouse-specific events. I think pretty strongly that this is
 an authoring issue.

 TL: Another way to fix this - bind some keyboard sequence to
 send a mouse event. It sounds easy on the surface, but it becomes
 complicated: where to you send the event? We don't think this repair
 should be done by the browser.

 MQ: My end-user reaction is that the problem won't get solved this
 way. 

 TL: But I don't think you should apply a complex solution to
 a problem that has a simple solution on the author side.

 MQ: Do Web page checkers identify these problems?

 JG: I don't think they do much.

 IJ: Note that this relates to including explicit event
 handlers in the list of active elements. If we're not requiring
 UAs to allow users to activate with the keyboard mouse-specific
 events, then should the mouse-specific events be in the list
 of active elements?

 JG: Good point.

 Summarizing:
  - Either the UA does transformations of device-dependent
    to device-independent and these are included in active
    element list.
  - Or exclude device-dependent handlers from list of 
    active elements.
  - The UA is not required to repair author supplied 
    interaction that is device dependent.

 JG: Transforming mouse-to-keyboard could be a lower priority
 requirement.

 Proposal:
  - Exclude device-dependent interaction that is specified by the
    author from the requirements of checkpoints 1.1, 1.2, 7.3, 7.4
  - Include a lower priority requirement for repairing author
    specified device-dependent interaction.

 JG: Since we don't have any implementation experience, we don't
 know whether this will actually help users. We don't know whether
 requiring repair will help accessibility; it may be more disorienting
 than helpful.

 /* IJ summarizes interdependences among WAI WGs and responsibilities
    of each party. The question here is whether we want to ask
    developers to repair device-specific handlers */

 DP: I wouldn't ask UAs to do spell-checking on the fly either.

 EH: I think I would support reducing the repair requirements here.

 /* EH leaves */

 JG: Frequent use of roll-overs is to dynamically changes images;
 basically a visual stylistic effect (so not critical for all users).

 DP: My understanding is that if you use mouse keys, you have similar
 issues - you don't slide over, you move to (it's more like tabbing
 more than rolling over).

 /* Rich arrives */
 
 RS: I think that you need to be able to navigate to elements with
 event handlers associated. 

 IJ: I have fears about removing this repair; we might have
     to go back to last call since this is eliminating a piece
     of an accessibility requirement (even through repair).

 JG: Has HPR tried repair techniques for this?

 RS: I don't know, but I don't think that you can activate
     mouse-specific events through the keyboard.

 /* The WG reviews the MS home page, which uses pull-down menus. MS
    home page provides pull-down menus, but if not supported, makes
    available the same links one page away. */

 MQ: I am willing to agree that this is an authoring problem. I'm not
 aware of implementations that simulate the mouse events.

 JA: Some of the MS links are available, but not all of them. So the
 author has done an inconsistent job at ensuring that all links
 are available.

 RS: The HPR people haven't implemented repair yet. I don't know
 whether IE provides a means to execute the javascript.

 DP: I may be wrong, but I think that JFW does with IE is that
 it takes every available link and makes it available - all links
 are made available (though not necessarily in the same order).

 TL: The way the home page works - all of the links are in the
 DOM; their display state changes. 

 /* Tim leaves */

 RS: Today, screen readers don't do the repair because they
 need a tie between the dom and what's rendered. Plus, IE
 doesn't let you execute scripts that are attached to an element.
 But today, you don't have the graphical rendering and the DOM
 tied together.

 JG: We already don't require control in the case of event
 bubbling. I'm not sure that a further limitation to
 device-independent handling is much more significant.

 Action JG: Ask WAI PF/WAI ER/WAI CG about their experience
            with repair of device-specific event handlers
            and indicate that we are leaning towards lowering
            the priority of repair here.
 Action RS: Find out what HPR's intentions are re: repair
            of device-specific event handlers.
