Chairs,
The User Agent working group has had a long standing requirement for the 
user to interact with active elements in a device independent way.  In 
recent teleconferences we have been considering removing the requirement to 
provide keyboard access to mouse based event handlers (onMouseOver, 
onMouseOut, onClick) that are explicitly associated with an element as part 
of the minimum requirement for conformance to UAAG.

The reasons for reducing the requirement for active elements:
1. We do not have any implementation experience for this feature.

2. Without implementation experience we do not know how the inclusion of 
the feature will affect accessibility

3. This is a repair requirement for poor authoring and including the 
requirement will continue to support poor authoring practices

4. In general other repair requirements are a lower priority in UAAG

5. Without implementation experience we may need to go to Candidate 
Recommendation until implementation shows a P1 benefit, delaying 
publication of current requirements.


The reasons to maintain requirement:
1. It is an important accessibility problem and that User Agent needs to 
require the repair

My question to the coordination group is do you agree with the reasons for 
reducing the requirement to eliminate support for pointer based events as 
part of the minimum requirement for conformance, or do you think that this 
is such an important problem that we should include, even though we do not 
have any implementation experience?

Thanks,
Jon
