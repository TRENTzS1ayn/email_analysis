I don't think mouseovers should be always considered a "poor authoring 
practice" that "need repair" (though of course any practice can be 
abused).  For example, a mouseover can produce help information in a 
temporary popup window--- one that doesn't timeout like "title".   Or 
cascading menus which have made Mac users happy for years (which also 
requires other mouse events to emulate) Users with disabilities that 
prevent use of the mouse should have access to the same information.

That does leave the lack of implemenation experience I realize.  But I 
don't think there's really much implementation experience for all other 
checkpoints, e.g. communicating with assistive technologies ( section 5), 
and if we're lenient there we should be lenient here.
