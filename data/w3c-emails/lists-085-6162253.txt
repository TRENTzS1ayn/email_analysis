This version of UAAG 1.0 intentionally does not include much in the
way of repair functionality. Is there a reason why this (if it's
considered repair) should have more weight than other repair
features that have not been included?

I don't think that "authors will always do the wrong thing" is a
good reason to push the requirement to user agent developers. We
have a hard enough time getting specs implemented properly.
