I was thinking of it more along the lines of actually tying a key
binding by repair to the element such that it would expose the
activity.

Certainly it is an acceptable part of a solution.

What is missing from mousekeys is the ability to navigate from element
to
element, or indeed to really know where the mouse is non-visually in
terms of
the document structure. What is missing from commmon keyboard
implementations
is the ability to fire mouse events.

The simplest technique for getting this to work that I can think of is
to
provide a function that brings the mouse cursor/pointer to the
location of
the currently focussed element. This provides for mouse hover, and the
rest
is already available using mousekeys - in other words operating system
standards. (I haven't tried to implement this - how easy it is depends
on the
window management system being used.)

As far as I can tell that would satisfy the user requirement and
the various checkpoint requirements. Albeit not the most elegant of
user
interfaces, is possibly good enough that people won't worry what is
the most
elegant for a while longer.

  JRG: Would you consider mouse keys to be an acceptable part of a
solution
  to this repair function?
