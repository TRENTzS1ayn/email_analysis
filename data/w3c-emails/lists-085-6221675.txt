Hello,

Here are a few discussion topics for our joint meeting with
the DOM WG tentatively scheduled for 2 March at 12pm followed
by lunch (in Cambridge, as part of the Plenary week):

1) API access to the rendering structure (this is apparently
   a dead-end, meaning the DOM WG is not going in this direction).

2) API access to the user's style sheet/run-time style

3) Device-independent events. What is the status of WAI PF's
   work in this area?

4) Exposing focus and selection through an API.

5) Identifying accessibility features in the DOM specs themselves.
   What are these features?

 - Ian
