Jon,

MouseKeys is an implementation example, but a poor one.  It is possible,
using MouseKeys to navigate via keyboard commands, but it isn't efficient,
and certainly isn't equivalent access.  However, it should be possible,
since the mouse position can be set in software, to move the mouse pointer
with a move of focus, so that it does allow fast navigation between active
elements, and you then have mouse-over, mouse-leave, and click-events on
demand.

JRG: Would you consider mouse keys to be an acceptable part of a solution
to this repair function?
