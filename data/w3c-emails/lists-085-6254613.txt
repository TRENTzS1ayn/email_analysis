Could this type of navigation (in terms of document structure) learn
from DAISY implementations.

DAISY is, as yet, inconsistant, but the principles are simple.
arrow keys navigate within the document structure, left to previous sibling,
right to following sibling, up to parent, down to first child.

Simple, and effective.
