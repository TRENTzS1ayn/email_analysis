Not directly. But this would be an implementation example of walkng the
document object structure, which is also useful information.

  Could this type of navigation (in terms of document structure) learn
  from DAISY implementations.

  DAISY is, as yet, inconsistant, but the principles are simple.
  arrow keys navigate within the document structure, left to previous sibling,
  right to following sibling, up to parent, down to first child.

  Simple, and effective.
