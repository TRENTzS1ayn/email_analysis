Some of the themes of the executive summary:

1. Implementation of specifications

2. Supporting separation of style and content (implement style sheet 
technology, user/author)

3. Supporting the keyboard (this I think needs to be clear and not masked 
in "device independence" language) although device independence also needs 
to be clearly mentioned and that the keyboard is the most important input 
device to support.

4. User control of styling of content (colors, fonts, magification)

5. User control over content (equivalents, new windows, dynamic content)

6. Compatibility with assistive technologies


Here are some starting points, comments welcome!
