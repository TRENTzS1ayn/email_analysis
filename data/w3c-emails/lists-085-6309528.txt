perhaps dependancies need to be mentioned here as well?  It should
also be as non technical as possible.

Subject: User Agent Executive Summary


Some of the themes of the executive summary:

1. Implementation of specifications

2. Supporting separation of style and content (implement style sheet
technology, user/author)

3. Supporting the keyboard (this I think needs to be clear and not
masked
in "device independence" language) although device independence also
needs
to be clearly mentioned and that the keyboard is the most important
input
device to support.

4. User control of styling of content (colors, fonts, magification)

5. User control over content (equivalents, new windows, dynamic
content)

6. Compatibility with assistive technologies


Here are some starting points, comments welcome!
