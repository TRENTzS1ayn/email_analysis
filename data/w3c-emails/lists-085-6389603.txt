Good and bad news, all of which I will deny if asked:

1)  We've already built this capability into Narrator.  If you are running
W2K, you can play around with it.  Theoretically, it should be doable to put
that functionality in a stand-alone utility (so you'd have your screen
reader and 'mouse-follows-focus' behavior).  I have no idea if we'd want to
do that, but will look into it.

2)  This does not fix the problem, in particular on microsoft.com.   You do
get the menu, but because that sub menu is appended to (not inserted in) the
tab order, your mouseover follows the focus and the submenu disappears.

It occurs to me, then, that the more better way would be to a) inform the
user that this link goes to a script-thingie, allowing them to b) send a
mouse-over via the keyboard to activate the script-widget if they so choose.

I'm quite certain also that the browser folks do not want to do any more
repair, and this one is really complex.
