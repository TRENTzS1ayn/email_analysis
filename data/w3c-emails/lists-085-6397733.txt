Too bad. By "appended to" you mean "at the very end of the page,
after all other links". 

Can the append be changed to insert? It would not change the
behavior the mouse-user perceives in any case (since the mouse
user is not making use of the tab order). 

Is the content (the N links) that appears on the mouseover inserted
into the DOM? If so, where?

That won't work for blind users, will it?
