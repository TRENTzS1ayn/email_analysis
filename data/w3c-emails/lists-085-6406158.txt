  5.Issue 458: Do link highlighting requirements apply to all zones of an

    What is required granularity?

    Resolved:
     a) Add a note to 8.3 that highlighting an image map as a whole
        satisfies the checkpoint for image maps. UA may highlight
        all of the hot spots of a client-side map.
     b) There is some assumption that the author will make the image
        communicate different zones. We choose not to add a repair
        requirement for the case of bad images.

CMN
I am concerned that this is the wrong move. It should at least be possible to
highlight in visual some way the hotspots of an image. After all, the
author's responsibility in highlighting the hotspots of any other link only
extends to identifying it as a link and letting the browser do the rest.

Implementation example is Amaya. Probably other examples from image-map
creation tools.
