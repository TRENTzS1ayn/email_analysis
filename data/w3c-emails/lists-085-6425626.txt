For someone using a visual method and a mouse the most likely way of hitting
the imagemap is to pass over it with the mouse and notice the cursor change.
This seems inadequate to me.

it can be done with css2:

*[usemap] { border-style: double }

  As the user moves the focus to elements of the image map there is a
  requirement for the indivdiual elements to be highlighted.  The 458 issue
  was a highlight of the image to indicate to the user that there are active
  elements within the image.

  The group felt that as long as the user knew the image map had active
  elements that that was sufficient and the invidual elements of the map
  could be explored as the user moves focus to elements within the image
  map.
