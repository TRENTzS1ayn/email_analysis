I think that for people with cognitive disabilities this is a low P1 or high
P2 requirement. For people without a disability this is a handy repair
feature - p3 or just scraping p2.

The problem is that people can get used to the idea of trying each linked
image easily, but the idea that an image is broken into several links is
harder to figure out.

  Charles,
  Is this a priority 1 requirement or just a nice feature?

  Does a person without a disability have the same problem?
