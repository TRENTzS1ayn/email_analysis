Yes, I wish to register an objection please. I will check this with people
who know more than me - if it was included as a P2 checkpoint or if I get
better-qualified information than I will withdraw my objection. But until
then it stands.

Cheers

Charles

  I suggest that we don't include this requirement at a P1 level
  in UAAG 1.0 and rely on the fact that the author will also be
  making some effort to convey hot spots on an image map.

  Charles, if you wish to register an objection, please do so.
