As part of the FTF meeting in Boston we are going to schedule some time 
during the implementation report discussions for demonstrations of 
graphical and voice browser technology features and assistive 
technologies.  If anyone interested in doing a demo of there favosite 
technology, please contact me or Ian.

Looking for people to demonstrate:

IBM Home Page Reader
Netscape 6.0 accessibility features
IE 5.5 accessibility features
Opera 5.x
Screen readers (JAWS, Window-Eyes, HAL)
Anything else people think would help with the implementation report

Demo's should be about 10 minutes and highlight advanced accessibility 
features, like access to tables, device independence, assistive technology 
compatibility and style sheet support.
