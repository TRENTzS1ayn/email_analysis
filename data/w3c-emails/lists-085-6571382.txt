No.

It is not about guaranteeing access, it is about providing a way to alleviate
a problem, which (at P1 level) is otherwise guaranteed to prevent access.

I like thje way the proposal is worded, since it makes it clearer just what
must be done in each situtation, but I disagree that it is a priority 3
requirement.

  Ian,
  I like the reasoning behind the proposal.  I agree that the repair we have
  talked about has dubious guarantees of making content accessible.  What do
  other people think of the proposal?
