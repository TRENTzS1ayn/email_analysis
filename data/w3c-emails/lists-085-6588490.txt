My comment about our priority definitions not referring to the 
responsibilities of authors is an important one. The user agent
cannot remove all access barriers alone; the author must contribute.
The definition of P1 is:

  "This checkpoint must be satisfied by user agents, otherwise one 
  or more groups of users with disabilities will find it impossible
  to access the Web. Satisfying this checkpoint is a basic 
  requirement for enabling some people to access the Web."

Substituting:

 "The user agent must emulate all mouse behavior through the
  keyboard, otherwise one or more groups of users with disabilities
  will find it impossible to access the Web."

I don't agree with the substitution since the "otherwise" doesn't
work for me; even if the UA emulates/repairs, one or more 
groups of users will still find it impossible to access the 
Web (as described below). The author's contribution is crucial 
here, and that's not captured in our priority statement.
