I spoke with the MPEG-4 working group chair today who works for IBM. MPEG-4
will support SMIL. Her team is implementing SMIL on MPEG 4 and will be
presenting at the XMIL meetings Thursday and Friday next week in Cambridge.
We should attend.

They will be demoing an MPEG-4 prototype that I believe will speak the text
from the MPEG-4 file that runs as a Java applet or application. I will be
getting the name of the presenter.

Their work sounds quite impressive.
