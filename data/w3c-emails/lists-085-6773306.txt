Gregory,

The suggestion is interesting. If the change were made, would the definition
capture what we mean?

New, tentative definition of "Conditional content":

Conditional content is content that the author does not intend the
user agent to render by default, but that the author does intend
to make available to the user through the user interface under
certain conditions. Some mechanisms for providing conditional
content include the "alt" attribute and the OBJECT element in
HTML, and the test attributes of SMIL 1.0 and SMIL 2.0.

The rendering semantics (when and where) of conditional content may
be well-defined in some cases (e.g., "alt" and OBJECT in HTML)
and less well-defined in others (e.g., "title" in HTML).

Note: The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 requires that
authors provide text equivalents for non-text content. This is
generally done by using the conditional content mechanisms of a
markup language.

Thanks!

Old defintion of "Optional content" per

Part III: Definition of optional content
-------------------------------------------------

Optional content is content that the author does not intend the
user agent to render by default, but that the author does intend
to make available to the user through the user interface under
certain conditions. Some mechanisms for providing optional
content include the "alt" attribute and the OBJECT element in
HTML, and the test attributes of SMIL 1.0 and SMIL 2.0.

The rendering semantics (when and where) of optional content may
be well-defined in some cases (e.g., "alt" and OBJECT in HTML)
and less well-defined in others (e.g., "title" in HTML).

Note: The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 requires that
authors provide text equivalents for non text content. This is
generally done by using the optional content mechanisms of a
markup language.
