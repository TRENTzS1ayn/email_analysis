Looks good to me.

> Hello,

> When we discussed issue 435 [1], a question arose about the normative
> status of the "checkpoint group labels". There are four such labels in
> our document:
> 
>  - Checkpoints for content accessibility
>  - Checkpoints for user interface accessibility
>  - Checkpoints for communication with other software
>  - Checkpoints for accessible documentation
> 
> These labels were initially included in the document for
> organizational purposes only, to address issue 121 [2]. However, they
> have since become "normative." The following statement in section 3.4
> of the 26 Jan 2001 Guidelines [3] ties the labels to conformance:
> 
>    "Each checkpoint requirement must be satisfied by making
>    information or functionalities available through the user interface
>    of the subject of the claim unless the checkpoint explicitly states
>    that the requirement must be met by making information available
>    through an application programming interface (API). These API
>    checkpoints are labeled "checkpoints for communication with other
>    software."
> 
> The problem is that it's no so clear cut. Some checkpoints include
> some requirements that aren't labeled "for communication with other
> software" but don't involve the user interface at all (e.g., the
> documentation requirements of Guideline 10).
> 
> One might think that ideally, each checkpoint should be sufficient to
> stand on its own, so this type of general statement would not be
> necessary. But some checkpoints depend on the requirements made by
> other checkpoints in order to be complete. For example, every time we
> say "allow configuration", we don't say "allow configuration through
> an accessible user interface that may be operated through the
> keyboard" because checkpoint 1.1 ensures that the UI must be operable
> through the keyboard.

>  a) Makes clear that the groupings aren't normative at all
>  b) Makes clear that requirements related to user interaction must

>     "self-evident", but I don't think it hurts to remind people,
>     notably for some cases where they may not have thought of it.

>   "The user agent must satisfy all requirements involving user
>   interaction (both user input and output to the user) through the
>   user interface.  This includes requirements that directly refer to
>   to user control, configuration, etc. but also requirements that
>   indirectly involve the user interface (e.g., system conventions
>   pertaining to the user interface). The following checkpoint grouping
