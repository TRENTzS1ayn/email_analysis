Hello,

In certain cases, the author may "take over" parts of the
user agent's user interface. I'm thinking specifically
of the status bar (are there others?). What should UAAG 1.0
say about this? This is content that is rendered through the
user interface, but should our "content" requirements apply
here (e.g., stop blinking, change foreground and background 
colors) or just our UI requirements (e.g., text equivalent
for messages, follow OS conventions)?

It is my opinion that since these checkpoints involve
the user agent's user interface (even though it's being
manipulated by the author), and the UA's UI is under
the full control of the UA developer, then only the 
UI requirements should apply, notably checkpoint 5.13
(follow OS conventions). 

I also think that WCAG should say something about
this, although I'm not sure what yet. I don't know
enough about whether it causes problems for users.
