Hello,

I've published the 24 February 2001 UAAG 1.0 Guidelines [1]
and Techniques [2]. The list of changes [3] is online and included
as text below.

This is the draft that people should be familiar with for
the face-to-face meeting in Cambridge. It includes changes to
Guideline 2 adopted at the 22 Feb meeting and a definition
of conditional content, as well as tweaks to definitions of
equivalent, text element, and text equivalent.

CHANGES
-------

General

 * The document talks a lot more about "conditional content" and a
   lot less about "equivalents", though equivalents are still
   mentioned (with respect to WCAG and also checkpoint 1.3).

Guidelines

 * Prose to Guideline 2 edited to reflect staged access model.
 * Prose all Guidelines edited to reflect current state of document
   (after evolution of checkpoints and migration of checkpoints to
   other guidelines).
 * Title of Guideline 4 changed per [50]issue 455.

Checkpoints

 * 1.1, 1.2: Editorial clarifications.
 * 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9 (new): All changed according to
   [51]proposal from Ian adopted at [52]22 Feb 2001 teleconference.
   This addresses issues [53]321, [54]322, [55]358, [56]359, and
   [57]392.
 *
 * 3.3: Added a note that blinking may be useful to some users (e.g.,
   users who are deaf).
 * 5.4: Per [58]issue 457, deleted "usign standard APIs". Added a
   cross-reference to 5.6, since it covers the standard API
   requirements. Checkpoint 5.4 requires read-write access in all
   cases, even when no std APIs available. Moved commented examples
   to Note after checkpoint, in conjunction with cross reference to
   5.6
 * 8.3: Per [59]issue 458, Added statement to that the requirement
   for image maps (all image maps, not just client-side) is highlight
   of map as a whole, with "should" for configuration to highlight
   each active region. The idea is that the author will help here.
   Note: [60]objection from Charles.

Conformance

Based on [61]proposal from Ian, added text to clarify that checkpoint
groupings are not normative. This pertains to [62]issue 435.

Glossary

 * Added "conditional content"
 * Modifications to the definitions of text element, text equivalent,
   and equivalent. Much of the information previously there is still
   there, but now the definitions point more towards WCAG 1.0
   definitions.

References

 * Added RFC2046 (for checkpoint 2.2).

Techniques

 * Checkpoints 2.1, etc.: Techniques updated since checkpoints moved
   around.
 * Checkpoint 2.10: Add info about HTTP headers and CSS ':lang'
   pseudo-class. Also, revised this sentence "For instance, a user
   agent that doesn't support Korean (e.g., doesn't have the
   appropriate fonts or voice set) should allow configuration to
   announce the language change with the message "Unsupported
   language -- unable to render" (e.g., when the language itself is
   not recognized) or "Korean not supported -- unable to render"
   (e.g., when the language is recognized by the user agent doesn't
   have resources to render it)."
 * Checkpoint 4.4: Added note that access through two passes is
   better than no access at all.
