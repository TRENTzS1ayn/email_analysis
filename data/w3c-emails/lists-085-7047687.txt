Charles,
While I see reordering the checkpoints as mostly an editorial issue, I 
think the group should discuss if the proposed reordering reflects the 
groups consensus of what the most important guidelines are.  I don't think 
it will take that much time and I would encourage people to post their 
opinions to the list.

Jon
