I think the main issue here is that the user gain as much control over the 
synthesizer that is possible.  Since synthesizer technology use many 
different standards and APIs to control and generate speech it is difficult 
to define an exact set of elements that translate well across many 
different operating systems and computing hardware.  I think in general we 
want to have as much control as the speech API allows, but flexibility to 
make sure that the technology is readily available to developers.  I have 
noticed that probably the most popular speech API, Microsoft SAPI, is now 
starting supporting W3C specs related to Voice technologies and Aural Style 
Sheets.

The minimum set that I think the group can be confident of are:
1. Average pitch
2. Gender
3. Punctuation and spelling
4. Voice labels related to age and accent (kid, adult, older, robotic 
).  These encompass preset values that guarantee stability for voice 
characteristics such as richness and pitch range.

I think we need to revisit the Voice browser specifications and Aural CSS.
