I would propose we change the wording to say:

<OLD>
2.4 For content that requires user input within a time interval controlled 
by the user agent, allow configuration to make the time interval "infinite" 
(i.e., pause automatically at the beginning of each time interval where 
user input is required, and resume automatically after the user has 
explicitly completed input). [Priority 1]
</OLD>

<NEW>
2.4 For content that is available for user input within a time interval 
controlled by the user agent, allow configuration to make the time interval 
"infinite" (i.e., pause automatically at the end of each time interval 
where user input is available, and resume automatically after the user has 
explicitly completed input or the user chooses not to select any of the 
timed input options). [Priority 1]
</NEW>

I think this was more my understanding of what we wanted.  I don't know of 
any markup that would indicate to a user agent that an input or user 
response was "required".
