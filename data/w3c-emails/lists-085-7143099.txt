Hello,

I ran into Aaron here at the Sonesta hotel, and pursued the
question of animation control for a few minutes. Aaron pointed
me to the following resources:

1) The 'speed' attribute is defined in section 11.1.3 of the 
   time manipulation module of SMIL 2.0 [1].

   The attribute defines the playback speed of element time.
   Values can be negative, for playback in reverse. This suggests
   that fast forward and reverse are also possible.

2) IE 5.5 may already implement this attribute (not absolutely sure, 
   but they do implement the accelerate and decelerate attributes).

3) One could specify "speed=.5" on the root time container element
   and slow down a whole document by half. Or one could do this on
   an element-by-element basis.

4) I'm not aware of players that let you do this today through the
   user interface.

So, this is starting to suggest to me our requirements for animation
control are covered by the SMIL 2.0 spec.
