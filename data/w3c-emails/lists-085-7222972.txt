HTML+TIME is what MSFT calls the support for XHTML+SMIL in IE.  It is a
marketing term, not a standard (kind of like the "Dynamic HTML" moniker
for DOM and script support).

Unfortunately, personal commitments will keep me from attending the FtF
in Boston. However, Debbie Newman from MS will be there if you want to
talk about IE and HTML+TIME/XHTML+SMIL, and others in the group can also
discuss and explain our (SYMM's) animation support.

Thanks - Patrick
