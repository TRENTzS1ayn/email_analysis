Another topic for the DOM WG.

Creating of a team to develop a cross-platform accessibility API standard, to eventually supercede MSAA & Java 
Accessibility. Judy Brewer, Daniel Dardailler, Rich Schwerdtfegger and I have spoken about this. We could probably get Sun 
involved on behalf of Gnome accessibility.

We see this as extending the DOM in some ways, and also defining a minimum subset of the DOM to support in legacy widget 
sets that want to support accessibility via this API.

Thoughts?
Aaron
