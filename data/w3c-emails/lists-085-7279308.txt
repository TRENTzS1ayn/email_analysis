10.1 Ensure that at least one version of the product documentation conforms 
to at least Level Double-A of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 
[WCAG10]. [Priority 1]

I'd prefer to require AAA for at least one form of product documentation, 
particularly that dealing with accessibility. By extension that should
apply to all documentation, since accessibility issues are not readily
separable.
