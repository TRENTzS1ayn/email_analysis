This question is for Tim Lacy:

For applications that embed the IE browser within them, is it possible to:

First get the associated box in pixel coordinates for a DOM elemnent
(bounding rectangle in screen coordinates)?

Second two simulate the mouse event to perform a mouse click within that
rectangle?
