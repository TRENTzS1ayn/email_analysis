WeMedia Develops "Talking Browser" to make Surfing the Internet Easier
for
People with Disabilities

People with low vision and some learning disabilities benefit from new
technology
New York - March 5, 2001 - Continuing its commitment to increasing
access to
information, products and services for the disability community, their
family and friends, WeMedia introduced the "WeMedia Browser" today.
The
Web
browser, which is available to download for free at www.wemedia.com,
makes
the Internet easier to use for people with low vision and some
learning
disabilities including dyslexia.

Unlike screen readers, the WeMedia Browser actually replaces
traditional
browser technology used for surfing the Internet. Oversized buttons
and
keystroke commands enable easy navigation, with the browser 'speaking'
the
text selected within the browser. Users can control the appearance of
the
Website converting pages to text-only for easier access, the speed and
volume at which the browser reads the Web page and the color contrast
of the
screen to make viewing easier. The WeMedia Browser also features a
user-friendly tutorial that explains the keystroke commands needed to
activate the browser.

"It is our firm belief that no one should be shut out from
communications in
any format, so everything WeMedia does is about increasing access.
With
this
technology, WeMedia opens up a few more ramps to the Information
Superhighway," said Cary Fields, president and CEO, WeMedia Inc. "We
are
thrilled to make this product available at no cost and hope that
parents,
siblings, friends, teachers, and others will help us to spread the
word. We
especially look forward to getting feedback on how future versions of
this
browser can be improved," he continued.

Version 1 of the browser is available to download for free at
www.wemedia.com and is compatible with personal computers (PCs) with
Windows
95, 98, 98 SE, ME, 2000 or NT platforms. It operates using a Windows
compatible sound card and speakers and requires Microsoft Internet
Explorer,
version 4 and above. AOL and Netscape users will only be able to
download
the current version of the browser if Internet Explorer is already
installed
on the user's computer system. Customized Computer Software designed
and
developed this application exclusively for WeMedia Inc.
