I took an action item to define animation for the UA wroking group. Here is
my first cut:

Animation:
(Need to check the SVG spec to make sure we are saying the same things, but
roughly:
An animation is anything that changes with time according to some rule
specified by the author. For example, an image which changes to give the
illusion of motion, or a video, or text that scrolls in place are all
examples of animations. Animations may be single framed objects, such as
videos or animated images, or may be effects that rely on several different
page elements - for exampleregions of a presentation moving around the page
dynamically.
