After discussing the fact that we need to allow making all interactive
elements
visible, I realized perhaps this should be done through CSS.

Do we need a new CSS pseudoelement, such as :interactive?
Also, would people want to be able to make items with mouseovers look
different
from, say, items with onkeystroke events?
If so, how would that be done in CSS?
