1. Processed most of the last call issue at last weeks FTF meeting.  Just a 
few small items to finalize and we should be done with the issues.
http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2001/03/ua-minutes

2. Checkpoints are becoming much clearer on what are minimal requirements 
and what is needed by people with disabilities.

3. Group is expecting to return UAAG to last call sometime late in March, 
probably for about 2 weeks.

4. A small number of checkpoint requirements do not have documented 
implementation experience and if implementation experience cannot be found 
the document will need to go to Candidate Recommendation or ask for an 
exception from the director.

5. We had participation from Netscape at the FTF meeting, no participation 
from Microsoft during the FTF (there was suppose to be telephone 
participation).

6. Coordination issues
a. Scripting: We spent a lot of time on scripting issues
b. Documentation: We need information on how people with disabilities are 
more dependent on documentation than people without disabilities.
c. Developer input to the document seems much more serious during last 
call, than during the preparation of the document for last call.  This 
results in extending the time in moving the document to recommendation.
