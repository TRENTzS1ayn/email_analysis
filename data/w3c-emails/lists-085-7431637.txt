If anyone has the actual AFB document (especially a URL) or any other 
supporting materials related to people with disabilities being more 
dependent documentation than people without disabilities this is very 
important.  Right now the group is split on the issue.  Developers feel the 
requirement of documentation to be WCAG double-A compliant is too high as a 
priority 1 requirement in UAAG and others say that the WCAG double-A 
priority requirement should be triple-A.  Two conflicting minority opinions 
have been documented on this issue representing these two 
positions.  Independent documentation may help remove at least one of the 
minority opinions when the document is advanced to CR or PR.

We don't need any more "its pretty simple from my point of view" 
statements, we have plenty in the working group minutes from both sides of 
the issue.  What we need is some independent documentation based on some 
type of survey or study of users.

Thanks,
Jon
