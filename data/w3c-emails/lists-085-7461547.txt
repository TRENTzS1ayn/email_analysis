JRG: No it does not, no Triple A checkpoints would need to be met for 
Double-A conformance.

JRG: That is already part of the requirements for 5.13 "Follow operating 
environment conventions that benefit accessibility. In
particular, follow conventions that benefit accessibility for user 
interface design, keyboard
configuration, product installation, and documentation. [Priority 2]"
