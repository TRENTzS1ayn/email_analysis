Hello,

I would like to propose the following editorial changes
to the document based on a review by Aaron Leventhal
(thanks Aaron!).

I intend to incorporate these into the next draft
unless there are objections.

Reference document 24 Feb 2001 draft [1].

1) Checkpoints 3.5/3.5

   3.5 Allow configuration so that client-side content refreshes 
   (i.e., those initiated by the user agent, not the server) 
   do not change content except on explicit user request. 

Aaron suggested that this might be interpreted as meaning
"compare and see if the refresh changed the content or not".

Proposed change:

   Allow configuration so that the user agent does not
   perform client-side content refreshes (i.e., those 
   initiated by the user agent, not the server) 
   except on explicit user request. 

I propose the same type of change to checkpoint 3.6:

   Allow configuration so that the user agent does not
   perform "client-side redirects" (i.e., those initiated by the 
   user agent, not the server) except on explicit user request.

2) Aaron suggested adding some techniques for checkpoint 8.4
   in the case of XML content: how do you determine "important
   structural elements" for (generic) XML content?

   I think the answer is "you probably can't, except if you
   have some kind of documentation," which may take 
   any number of forms:

   a) A specification.
   b) A schema (human or machine readable).
   c) Some other metadata
  
   Other techniques for this?

 - Ian
