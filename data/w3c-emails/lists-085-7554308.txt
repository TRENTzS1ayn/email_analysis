At the FTF meeting we proposed a revised set of checkpoints related to 
elements with event handlers. I feel that one of the new checkpoints should 
be a priority 2:

New Checkpoint 7.X The user must be able to configure the user agent so 
that moving the content focus to an enabled element does not automatically 
activate any of the associated actions.

I think this should be Priority 2 for the following reasons:
1. It is repair function.  We say we want device independent event handlers 
and now we say we no automatic event handling.
2. This is a new requirement and was not part of any previous proposals or 
discussions on this issue.
3. This does not necessarily guarantee access.  We already allow people to 
turn off scripts, so they can look at event handlers without firing them 
with this feature at a P1 level.  This seems like a new special/limited 
case of turning off scripts.
