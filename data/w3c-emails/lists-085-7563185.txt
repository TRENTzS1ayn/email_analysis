I don't think any of the reasons given are consistent with what we claim
about how priorities are assigned. Further, it seems that this requirement is
a special case of Checkpoint 3.4?- Allow the user to configure the user agent
not to execute any executable content (e.g., scripts and applets). In this
configuration, provide an option to alert the user when executable content is
available (but has not been executed).

So I propose that it be left as a priority one requirement, and that we
explain that it is in fact a special case of an existing requirement.

  At the FTF meeting we proposed a revised set of checkpoints related to
  elements with event handlers. I feel that one of the new checkpoints should
  be a priority 2:

  New Checkpoint 7.X The user must be able to configure the user agent so
  that moving the content focus to an enabled element does not automatically
  activate any of the associated actions.

  I think this should be Priority 2 for the following reasons:
  1. It is repair function.  We say we want device independent event handlers
  and now we say we no automatic event handling.
  2. This is a new requirement and was not part of any previous proposals or
  discussions on this issue.
  3. This does not necessarily guarantee access.  We already allow people to
  turn off scripts, so they can look at event handlers without firing them
  with this feature at a P1 level.  This seems like a new special/limited
  case of turning off scripts.
