  Hello,

  Per my action of the 1-2 March face-to-face meeting [1],
  please consider the following Guideline splits. These will
  appear in the next draft for review in context.
[snip]
  Split into:

    Guideline 4. Ensure user control of rendering.
    Guideline 5. Ensure user control of user interface behavior.
CMN: Fine by me

IJ  QUESTION:

    Should Guideline 4 read: "Ensure user control of rendering and
    styles" since there a style sheet checkpoint as well?

CMN Don't see why - style is  rendering.

IJ  2) In the 24 Feb 2001 draft:

     Guideline 5. Observe operating environment conventions and
                  standard interfaces.

  This guideline has started to grow large and there's a clear
  division of checkpoints into "things for APIs" and "things
  related to observing conventions". Therefore I propose splitting
  it into:

     Guideline 6. Implement standard application programming
                  interfaces.
     (10 checkpoints, all about APIs)

     Guideline 7. Observe operating environment conventions.
     (4 checkpoints)

Sure. Note that I consider this stuff editorial. If it isn't then the
checkpoints don't stand properly as a list of requirements which indicates
that there is a major flaw in the document.
