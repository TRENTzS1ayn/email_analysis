True enough. But does using setAttribute also get around the problem that
there wasn't an attribute to select on?

In which case it is perhaps a better way to do it that we should recommend.

In general I am not sure how to pick up the added listeners, except in the
User Agent... Add the things with listeners to the list of things that are
shown, via some kind of Javascript?

  Ian,

  Okay, I see that's a pretty good solution.

  The only problem I have with

     A[onmouseover] { background: yellow; color: black }
  is that I don't think it supports mouseovers that come from script, such as:

  function addMouseOvers()
  {
  var nodeList = document.getElementsByTagName('TD');
  var endList=nodeList.length;
  for (var count =0; count < endList; count++) {
    node=nodeList[count];
    // Using setAttribute instead of AddEventListener gets around bug where
    // the mouseover in the tablecell is ignored when you're over the text inside the cell
    node.addEventListener('mouseover',showTheSquare, false );
    }
  }

  I think this will be quite common.
