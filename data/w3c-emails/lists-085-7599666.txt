I don't see that there is a problem using the method Aaron suggested. It
would enable a user agent to seperately queue the changes to a document that
gets updated on the fly, which seems like a good thing since they could be
offered to the user who had asked for a page to stay still, as a seperate
item. It might be helpful to have this available, and I  can't see that it
breaks anything we need.

So I would propose to instead add this as a technique.

  Hello,

  I would like to propose the following editorial changes
  to the document based on a review by Aaron Leventhal
  (thanks Aaron!).

  I intend to incorporate these into the next draft
  unless there are objections.

  Reference document 24 Feb 2001 draft [1].

  1) Checkpoints 3.5/3.5

     3.5 Allow configuration so that client-side content refreshes
     (i.e., those initiated by the user agent, not the server)
     do not change content except on explicit user request.

  Aaron suggested that this might be interpreted as meaning
  "compare and see if the refresh changed the content or not".

  Proposed change:

     Allow configuration so that the user agent does not
     perform client-side content refreshes (i.e., those
     initiated by the user agent, not the server)
     except on explicit user request.

  I propose the same type of change to checkpoint 3.6:
