This seems like one  of the things we would like to have the semantic web
able to do for us. I propose that we send it as a request to PF that they

  2) Aaron suggested adding some techniques for checkpoint 8.4
     in the case of XML content: how do you determine "important
     structural elements" for (generic) XML content?

     I think the answer is "you probably can't, except if you
     have some kind of documentation," which may take
     any number of forms:

     a) A specification.
     b) A schema (human or machine readable).
     c) Some other metadata

     Other techniques for this?
