Charles,
The reason it can be a priority 2 is precisely that it is a special case of 
Checkpoint 3.4.  With 3.4 you can achieve the same affect as the new 
checkpoint since it turns off all scripting, the new checkpoint is only a 
convenience to turn off only the processing of event handlers.  Turning off 
the automatic event processing just makes it easier (that what P2 is for), 
it is still possible with out the new checkpoint to have the same 
functionality.

Jon
