I'm sorry, I simply don't understand your point I guess.
I thought the checkpoint has tried to say "Don't do automatic
refreshes". Aaron said that wasn't clear. The proposed rewrite is
supposed to be clearer.

I don't understand what the operational constraints you are talking
about are.

I also didn't understand your technique.

Could you expound further on the source of your objection?
My goal here, mind you, is only editorial clarification, not
alignment with existing implementations, etc.
