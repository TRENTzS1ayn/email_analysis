OK, this seems like a much better justification for the priority. My
lingering concern is that then they fall out of the standard navigation so I
am not sure if they can be identified. I am not sure if that is a problem or
not. I suspect it  is not a problem of more than P2 level, which means it
would be covered happily.

  Charles,
  The reason it can be a priority 2 is precisely that it is a special case of
  Checkpoint 3.4.  With 3.4 you can achieve the same affect as the new
  checkpoint since it turns off all scripting, the new checkpoint is only a
  convenience to turn off only the processing of event handlers.  Turning off
  the automatic event processing just makes it easier (that what P2 is for),
  it is still possible with out the new checkpoint to have the same
  functionality.
