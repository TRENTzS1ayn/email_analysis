If UAs don't keep track of the information, they will have a hard time making
use  of it. So it becomes an implementation issue. (That doesn't solve it
though). In particular, how to make sure that these tings fit in a reasonable
navigation context is a question for which it would be nice to provide
several techniques.

(I have no ideas yet)

  Per our discussion with the DOM WG, the DOM 2 event
  handler registration mechanism [1] doesn't allow programs
  to list the available handlers. So unless UA's keep track
  of this information themselves, I don't know how to help
  until the WG gives us this information (which we requested
  at the meeting).
