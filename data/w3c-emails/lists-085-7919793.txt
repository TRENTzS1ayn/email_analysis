The minimum requirement for refresh is that the user be able to configure 
the refreshing.  They should have at least the option of the automatic 
refresh or a manual refresh through prompting.  What content changed (if 
any or all) after the refresh was never part of the checkpoint.  The 
original intent was to give users the ability to read the content without 
the content automatically changing, if that helps them access the content.

A user agent that provides additional features to help the user find 
changes after refresh may be very useful to some people and should be 
included as a technique to do more than the minimum requirement.
