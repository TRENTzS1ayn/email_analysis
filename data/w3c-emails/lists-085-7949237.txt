I think for this version of the document we want to make sure we have good 
techniques to access event information.  In this case we may want to limit 
the minimal requirements for event related checkpoints to the information 
that is available in current DOM specs.  As DOM provides more information, 
we can then increase the requirement in a later document.  This stengthens 
UAAG requirement of using the DOM.
