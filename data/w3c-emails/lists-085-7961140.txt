It should be remembered that our current proposal does not solve all event 
problems, so we are really deciding how much Web content adds event 
handlers programmatically.  If it is not much, why require a lot of 
developer hacking that we will ask them to stop using in the future, if DOM 
provides what we need in the future.  We should do our best to get what can 
be achieved now through the DOM and try to work with the DOM group to get 
what we need in the future.
