Hello,

I've published the 9 March UAAG 1.0 Guidelines [1] 
and Techniques [2]. Changes are online [3] and quoted 
as text below.

Please review this draft!

I *strongly* encourage you to review this draft of the document.
We have resolved all of our last call issues and I don't 
anticipate any other major changes to the document 
(unless your review reveals significant problems).

The Working Group agree in the next couple of weeks that 
we are done and wish to advance to last call (after which
I get to prepare the document for our third last call).

--------------------------
Important things to review
--------------------------

1) Please review addition to checkpoint 4.5 about
   playing audio during fast advance/reverse.

2) Please review checkpoints 4.13, 4.14, 4.15. I rely
   on the expertise of the group to get the wording
   of these speech requirements right.

3) Please review the first 7 checkpoints of Guideline 9;
   I think they look great!

4) Please compare 9.2 and 9.7 and see whether the difference
   is sufficiently clear.

5) Please check out definitions of animation, enabled element,
   interactive element, and focus.

6) Pleae review checkpoint 2.4 (new wording and new alert
   requirement).

7) Check out the new section on how to refer to this document.

-------------
What's next?
-------------

 * Add executive summary

 * Address concern about "contradictory" statements of
   checkpoints 1.1/1.2

 * Al Gilman may have some suggestions for us about
   issue 464 [4] (How to account for captions in SMIL).

 * Now that we have resolved last call issues, I must
   respond to all last call reviewers to see whether
   they are satisfied or wish to register objections.

 * The Techniques document needs to be read!

 * The implementation report needs to be updated. I predict
   that we now have requirements for which we have no
   implementation experience, and we will need to 
   concentrate on these during Candidate Recommendation
   (if we need to go to CR).

------
Trivia
------
By the way, for those keeping score at home, this is the
fifty-fifth (55) draft of the Guidelines. Let's stop (at
Rec) when we hit 60.

Cheers,

 - Ian

CHANGES

General

* Editorial: General substitution of "Allow the user to configure
  the user agent to" to "Allow configuration to"
* Editorial: Global substitution of "active element" with "enabled
  element". Introduction of term "Interactive element".
* Editorial: Some changes based on comments from Aaron Leventhal. In
  particular, changed "must" to "needs to" in a number of places
  (e.g., guidelines prose, techniques) to avoid impression that
  required for conformance.

Introduction

* 1.3 (Known limitations): Added a limitation that there is no
  requirement in this document for all user interface components to
  be under final user control; this is covered to a large extent in
  Guideline 5 and also in other software guidelines.

Guidelines

* Guideline 4 split into Guidelines 4 and 5. Moved checkpoints about
  control of UI behavior to new Guideline 5.
* Guideline 5 split into Guidelines 6 and 7.

Checkpoints

* 2.4: Checkpoint wording changed per 1-2 March face-to-face.
  Added alert requirement as well. Please review. ( issue 460).
* 2.5: Changed from "allow the user to specify" to "allow the user
  to configure or control".
* 3.2: Content type "Animation", not "Image". But leave video as
  well.
* 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.7: Changed "video and animations" to "animations
  (including video and animated images)" per proposal from Ian
  adopted at 8 March teleconf.
* 4.5: Important Based on discussion at 1-2 March face-to-face,
  added the following statement: "The user agent is not required to
  play synchronized audio during fast advance or reverse of
  animations (though doing so may help orient the user)."
* 4.13, 4.14, 4.15: Important These are derived from one single
  checkpoint per 1-2 March face-to-face resolution. These
  checkpoints need review! (Didn't do much to move techniques around
  yet.)
* 5.1, 5.2, 5.3: Changed per proposal from Ian, adopted at 8
  March teleconf.
* 6.5: (Editorial) Selection and focus are no longer part of "UI
  controls".
* 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5, 9.6, 9.7: Now form a coherent
  content-focus navigation model (among viewports and among enabled
  elements and among history). Changed per proposal from Ian
  (adopted at 8 March teleconf) in conjunction with resolutions
  from 1-2 March face-to-face.
* 9.1: Removed this Note: "Navigation among all viewports implies at
  least allowing the user to cycle through all viewports."
* 9.2, 9.7: Based on comments from Aaron Leventhal, attempt at
  making the differences between these two checkpoints more apparent
  (note that the first sentence is the same in both, but the other
  two differ).
* 9.8: Clarification about where the default search starting point
  should be (when user has not indicated). Based on resolution from
  1-2 March face-to-face.
* 10.7: No longer talks about current viewport; instead viewport
  with current focus. Changed per proposal from Ian (adopted at
  8 March teleconf).
* 11.4: Browser history is not required, so history stage change
  bindings moved to "if supported" section.
* 12.2, 12.5: Edits to Notes based on comments from Harvey
  Bingham.

Conformance

* Applicability: Added some comments about event bubbling to third
  applicability provision.
* 3.5 Responsibility for Claims: Changed wording from "anyone may
  make a claim" to "this spec imposes no restrictions about who may
  make a claim".
* 3.1 (Content type labels): Made some adjustments based on
  definition of Animation that includes Video and Animated Images.
  In particular: Animated images are part of animation, not images.
  The goal was to have video/image/animation conformance overlap as
  little as possible. Also adjusted Speech label based on two new
  speech checkpoints.

Glossary

* New term: "Animation" (per 8 March discussion.
* New term: "Enabled element"
* New term: "Interactive element"
* Deleted term: "active element"
* Deleted term: "current viewport"
* Per 1-2 March face-to-face, changes to the terms "focus"
  (content focus and user interface focus), "selection", "point of
  regard".
* "Event handlers": Added "An event handler is 'explicitly
  associated with an element' when the event handler is associated
  with a particular element through markup or the DOM."

References

* New section "How to refer to this document". Distinguishes this
  version from latest version. Gives sample HTML markup.
* Added [SMIL20]
* Fixed some cross-linking bugs between Guidelines and Techniques
  pointed out by Harvey Bingham.

Techniques

* 3.5: Added technique to configure-content refresh based on CMN
  example.
* 4.4, 4.5: Added some techniques for doing this in SMIL 2.0. Added
  some info about applicability and streaming. Added techniques
  pointing to digital talking books information.
* 5.1, 5.2: Some techniques added.
* 5.5: Suggest warning user that some fee mechanisms may not be
  "caught" in this configuration. Added per 1-2 March
  face-to-face resolution.
* 6.1: Added rationale about advantage of access to source content
  to ATs (rather than offscreen access).
* 9.9: Added some comments about where important information is
  identified from (e.g., specs, metadata).
* 12.3: Added a technique to document where UA diverges from system
  conventions.
