Maybe there is a way to have a summary of the that key conformance bit early
(and perhaps even repeated) in order to address the issue that Aaron has
pointed out. Maybe even go through an example, something like pieces of the
conversation that Ian and Aaron have had. I am not excited about bring the
whole conformance section up to the beginning of the document but perhaps
some explanation could be put early.

Subject: Contradictory/confusing requirements wording


Hello all.

I have a problem with our wording on 1.1 and 1.2. 
Here's a conversation I had with Ian, that I think this list should be
involved in.

Aaron writes:

1.1 Ensure that the user can operate the user agent fully through 

keyboard input alone, pointing device input alone, and voice input 

alone. 

Maybe it's just me, but this seems to contradict the note 
below it, which says you don't need to satisfy the pointing device and 
voice portions of the checkpoint. Shouldn't a "Note" be informational, 
and shouldn't the checkpoint be a complete, clear statement of the 

requirement*?





Ian writes:
So this requires a bit of explanation. The conformance model works

as follows: You have to do everything by default (this is called

unconditional conformance). This means implementing all media types

and satisfying all checkpoints for all three input types. 



You can claim conformance for less, and not claim conformance for

voice. But you have to say so in your claim. Similarly, you can

not support speech output (there are three checkpoints for speech

output requirements) and still conform, but you have to say you

don't do them in your claim.



So the question is how do you say "You have to support voice

input unless you say you don't in your conformanc claim"? The

solution we've adopted is to not make this type of statement

in the checkpoint itself. Therefore, by default you do exactly

what the checkpoint says. In the section on conformance the

reader finds the information about certain exemptions they may

claim. 



The Note may seem contraditory, but it's just an attempt to

alleviate the terror of reading the requirements of the first

checkpoint. 



None of the other checkpoints say "you have to do this for

images/animations/video/audio/speech...unless of course you

don't do images/animations/video/audio/speech."

Agreed

Ian writes:

I agree that not scaring product managers is a good thing.

If we say something like this:

 1.1 Ensure that the user can operate the user agent fully 
     through keyboard input alone. Ensure that the user
     can also operate the user agent fully through pointing 
     device  input alone and voice input alone as well (unless
     a conformance claim states that the user agent doesn't
     conform for voice or pointing device input).

Then we should say this as well:

 4.11 Allow configuration and control of the synthesized 
      speech playback rate, according to the full range
      offered by the speech synthesizer (unless a conformance
      claim states that the UA doesn't conform for speech output).

So, your point is well-taken, and I thought it would be
sufficient to say "except if you don't conform to these things"
in the Note. The Note is informational: it doesn't cha!

nge what
the conformance requirements are.

Aaron wrote:

  "For each input technique/device that the user agent supports
   directly..."

Ian writes:
The reason we didn't say that is that the UA can support the mouse
for some functionalities, but the developer might not 
want to claim conformance for the the mouse 
(because the UA doesn't support it for all functionalities). Therefore,
you end up saying something like "For each supported input device
for which there is a conformance claim..." But that introduces
conformance language in the checkpoint, and none of the other
checkpoints
have such language.

I am not disputing that having a "gentler" first checkpoint would
be better, but I have been unable to come up with something
better than the current 1.1. And at least the form is consistent
with the other content type checkpoints.

I'll keep thinking about it, and I welcome other suggestions.

A!

Ian writes:
Agreed.

Ian writes:
Yes, that's a risk. Some checkpoints govern others. For instance,

1.1 covers everything, so we don't have to say in each checkpoint:



 "Allow configuration (through keyboard, voice, and pointing device)

..."



etc.

What do people on the list think? I think a new reader who visits the
document, even if they read it thoroughly, will be confused by 1.1, and
possibly come away thinking they have to support speech input.

I think consistency is important, but clarity is most important. If we're
slightly redundant in our wording, that's okay, as long as people "get it".
