Nitpicking on

     http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010309

1. Source lines 60 to 63 (a comment) is only use of capitalized HTML tag names:
     <!--
        <DT>Latest public version: </DT>
        <DD><A
        HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG10">http://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG10</A>
        </DD>
     -->
    Missing is enclosing <DL>...</DL>

Are you using such pseudo-tagging in comments as a general convention
across many W3 documents for some opaque reason?

Suggest omitting all those tags: they add nothing to the comment,
    or as a minimum make <dl><dt><a ...</a></dt><dd>...</dd></dl>
    to avoid problems with XHTML migration if decommented.

2. Quote placement about <code>...</code>

grep -n "<code>" yields inconsistent quote placement:

Form: "<code>begin</code>" in line 968
       "<code>title</code>" in line 2830
       <code>"..."</code>   in lines 879, 1042, 3472, 3006-7,3997
                                    4032, 4033
       <code>alt=""</code>  in line 1066

That latter case using "" suggests that a consistent form can be:
       '<code>...</code>'
as a means to avoid reliance on just typographic convention for
accessible reading of this document.

3. Typographic Conventions:

Suggest paragraph on typographic conventions to include:

     NOTE:      informative material about normative checkpoint
     _term_     links (some to glossary)
     [_XML_]    link to References, XML with underscore.
                Need to go there to find out if
                informative or normative.
     [XML]      Target in References
     _"..."_    Name of referenced document is link to it.
     '<code>alt</code>'   attribute names -- need consistency
          of quoting, as noted above:
     <code>OBJECT</code>    element name in smallcaps in HTML 4

Note these conventions need alternative representation for accessibility.

4. Terms in 3.1 Conformance Models

The terms defined therein for content type labels and input modality
labels seem to also be glossary terms. Are these candidates for inclusion
in the common WAI glossary? I noted similar in some non-WAI
W3 document. ?SMIL 2.0?

Input modality labels: two are included, pointer and voice.
the Note refers to "all three input modalities."

5. Example in 5.1 needs closing "</p>"

6. Element names have no surrounding <code>...</code> in lines

     3997  IMG
     4270  TABLE
     4271  OBJECT  NOFRAMES
     4272  NOSCRIPT

Element names other than HTML: Is the distinct lower-case convention
important to make, when the use indicates that other source.

     4011  switch  (a SMIL1 reference)
     4019  switch  (a SVG reference)

7. I'd like "return to Table of Contents" internal links within
the document, at the end of each section.
