Normative = you have to do it for conformance.

I'm not sure I agree that the information you were seeking isn't
there. From section 3.1: "A user agent conforms unconditionally
to this document if it satisfies all of the requirements 
of all of the checkpoints."

Then it goes on to explain conditional conformance. Therefore,
people can make statements of the form "I conform unconditionally
since I satisfy all the requirements of all of the checkpoints".

Furthermore, at the beginning of section 2 it states:

   "The statement of the checkpoint. The statement of 
    the checkpoint is one or more requirements that must be
    satisfied by the user agent (i.e., the "subject of the claim) 
    for the purposes of conformance. The "user agent" may
    consist of more than one software component, as explained
    in the section on well-formed conformance claims."

And then:

  "Informative notes about the checkpoint. These notes do not
state       
   requirements that must be satisfied as part of
   conformance; they are informative only. They are meant to 
   clarify the scope of the checkpoint through further
   description, examples, cross references, and commentary."

So I'm not sure what's missing, except that we don't say
"normative means you do it for conformance". Are you looking 
for that sort of statement?

I'm happy to make a statement that:
  normative = you do for conformance.
  informative/non-normative = not required for conformance.

The text I quoted above (that says that checkpoints = requirements)
is from section 2.

How would we know if we were sure? We require WCAG (for
documentation), DOM, and RFC2046 (for the definition of
text formats). I don't know how deep (recursively) we need
to look to feel reassured.
