We used to have those, then got rid of them. I was told
(perhaps by Gregory and/or Charles and/or Daniel?) that 
they weren't that useful in practice. They were used in WCAG 1.0
and I've never heard any positive feedback about them.

We also used to have links at the beginning of each Guideline
to each checkpoint in the Guideline. I was also told those
weren't useful in practice. So there's no easy navigation 
directly to a specific checkpoint.

I'm not against adding such mechanisms, but it doesn't come for
free, so I'd like to hear what users of the document have to
say.
