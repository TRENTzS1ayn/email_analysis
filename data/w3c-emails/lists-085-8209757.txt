I liked having the conformance section at the beginning of the document. IT
gives a simple way of explaining what needs to be read when you are going
through it, and makes it clear that conformance is something with meaning,
not just an afterthought. (All the ordering stuff should just be editiroial,
but in practice it isn't necessarily. So there's my preferences).

As for 1.1 how about something like
   1.1 Ensure that the user can operate the user agent fully
       through keyboard input alone. If the user agent supports input through
       pointer devices or voice, ensure that the user can operate
       the user agent fully through each of these methods alone.

  Maybe there is a way to have a summary of the that key conformance bit early
  (and perhaps even repeated) in order to address the issue that Aaron has
  pointed out. Maybe even go through an example, something like pieces of the
  conversation that Ian and Aaron have had. I am not excited about bring the
  whole conformance section up to the beginning of the document but perhaps
  some explanation could be put early.
