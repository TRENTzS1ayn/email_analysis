We got complaints that people had to wade through the conformance
section before they got to the requirements. So it was moved
to the back.

I like Eric's proposal to have a brief statement about conformance
up front, and the full section in the back.

I don't think this works.

That's what the document used to say. Then we got issue 390 [1],
where the reviewer said "This punishes me because it says that if
I implement the mouse at all, the user must be able to do everything
through the mouse alone." At the AOL face-to-face meeting [2], we
decided that the UA didn't have to do everything through pointing
device or voice input unless conformance was sought for those 
input devices.

So instead of saying "if the UA supports input through voice and
pointing device", you would have to say "if the UA seeks to 
conform for voice and pointing device", but no other requirement
in the document talks about conformance to itself.
