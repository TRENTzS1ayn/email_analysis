No, you can't conform if you don't have keyboard support.
That's why it says in 3.1:

  "In order to conform conditionally
   (or unconditionally) a user agent must be fully 
   operable through the keyboard, and must satisfy the input device
   requirements of this document for the keyboard."

necessary if we put a little intro about conformance
at the beginning of Section 2.
