I think that we have decided that all user agents should provide a
keyboard interface, because so many assistive technologies allow
generation of character codes, even if they don't do anything else.  The
primary output of single switch scanning or Morse code, for example,
will be characters.  These methods may provide a means of mouse
emulation, but the keyboard will be faster and easier in all cases with
these input methods.  So, if you don't provide  a keyboard interface,
you not only lock out the keyboard, (which you may not support), but
many types of alternative access as well.

So, in this case, I think you must provide a complete control via ASCII
characters, even if your device doesn't have a keyboard on it.

Maybe we could make the conformance stuff cleaner and tighter.

If the user agent doesn't have to conform to all devices, does it still
have
to provide keyboard support. (In other words, is it OK to build a user
agent
that conforms for pointing devices but not keyboard?)

If so, then the answer is "Yes, you have to do all this". If not then I
think
we have a problem.

But in any case, I don't have a problem with talking about conformance
in one
checkpoint only, especially this one...

  We got complaints that people had to wade through the conformance
  section before they got to the requirements. So it was moved
  to the back.

  I like Eric's proposal to have a brief statement about conformance
  up front, and the full section in the back.

  I don't think this works.

  That's what the document used to say. Then we got issue 390 [1],
  where the reviewer said "This punishes me because it says that if
  I implement the mouse at all, the user must be able to do everything
  through the mouse alone." At the AOL face-to-face meeting [2], we
  decided that the UA didn't have to do everything through pointing
  device or voice input unless conformance was sought for those
  input devices.

  So instead of saying "if the UA supports input through voice and
  pointing device", you would have to say "if the UA seeks to
  conform for voice and pointing device", but no other requirement
  in the document talks about conformance to itself.
