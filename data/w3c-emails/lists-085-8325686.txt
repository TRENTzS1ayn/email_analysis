This creates an interesting situation though, where a user agent would
have to have two categories of access: we have control via keyboard,
mouse, and voice.  We have accessible access via keyboard only.  I think
that this might be just as confusing.

Nope, that doesn't solve the problem because 
the input modality requirements apply to all checkpoints: you
don't need to put input type labels on any checkpoints because
they apply to all of them.

This is different from the content labels, which only apply
to some checkpoints (and therefore, they appear only on
certain checkpoints).
