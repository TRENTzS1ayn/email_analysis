  So, in this case, I think you must provide a complete control via ASCII
  characters, even if your device doesn't have a keyboard on it.

CMN Note that this gives rise to an i18n issue. Particularly for people who
are using a morse-code device or something similar to produce characters in
their normal script be that for arabic or urdu. (The point is sound, it is
just this little detail that needs to be considered).
