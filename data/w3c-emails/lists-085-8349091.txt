Hello,

Just to be sure, let me clarify what the document states:

  * To conform, a user agent must *always* be operable entirely
    with the keyboard.

  * People may also claim conformance *in addition* for the
    pointing device or voice input (or both). This means that
    the UA is operable entirely through those devices.

  * If the UA is not completely operable through voice and
    pointing device input, then the conformance claim must
    say so.

  * A user agent may be somewhat operable through pointing
    device and/or voice and that's a good thing. But you can't
    claim conformance in that case.

Aaron's question was about the "shock" of reading "you have to
do everything through all three devices." This is strictly an
editorial issue, not one about the requirements listed above.

Please indicate whether there are other issues I have not
understood.

Thank you,

 - Ian
