Hello,

In the 9 March 2001 UAAG 1.0 [1], we refer to "single key" bindings
in checkpoint 11.3 (we also refer to "modifier keys"). I think we
need to clarify that this refers to actual physical keys on a keyboard,
not signals sent by the hardware. The accessibility requirement involves
limited physical movement. 

I would also note that I do not believe that there are any
internationalization issues here. On systems where a user must
use several keystrokes to compose a single (abstract) character, we
still want single-physical-key access for users.

Therefore I propose clarifying in checkpoint 11.3 that when
we talk about "keys" we are referring to physical keys.

 - Ian
