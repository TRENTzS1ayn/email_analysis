Ian, 

I think I'll have to disagree here.  This would (could) lead a person to
directly address the physical keyboard, which is a design that would
bypass the AT that might be installed.  If the UA is receiving input
from the OS in the recommended way, it can't tell if the keystroke came
from the physical keyboard, or from a Morse Code input system that is
connected via a PCM/CIA or Serial port.  Single key means single
discrete action, as opposed to a long series of actions to activate the
binding.

Subject: [Clarification] "Single key means single physical key"


Hello,

In the 9 March 2001 UAAG 1.0 [1], we refer to "single key" bindings in
checkpoint 11.3 (we also refer to "modifier keys"). I think we need to
clarify that this refers to actual physical keys on a keyboard, not
signals sent by the hardware. The accessibility requirement involves
limited physical movement. 

I would also note that I do not believe that there are any
internationalization issues here. On systems where a user must use
several keystrokes to compose a single (abstract) character, we still
want single-physical-key access for users.

Therefore I propose clarifying in checkpoint 11.3 that when
we talk about "keys" we are referring to physical keys.

 - Ian
