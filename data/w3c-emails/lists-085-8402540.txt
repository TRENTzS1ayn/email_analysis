<NEW NOTE AFTER 11.3>
NOTE: In this checkpoint, the term "key" refers to a physical key of
the input device.
</NEW>

For reference, here is the checkpoint:

11.3 Allow the user to override any binding that is part
     of the user agent default input configuration. 
     Allow the user to override any binding in the default 
     keyboard configuration with a binding of a single key 
     and (possibly zero) modifier keys. Allow the user to assign a
     single key binding (with zero modifier keys) to at least 
     a majority of the functionalities available in the default 
     keyboard configuration. The user agent is not required to 
     allow the user to override standard bindings for the 
     operating environment (e.g., for access to help).

The goal was to have a lot of single key activations. We were seeking
something better than "a lot of".

Suggestions welcome,
