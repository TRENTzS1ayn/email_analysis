In my view, onfocus and onblur events are not used in ways destructive 
to accessibility. Perhaps someone can prove me wrong.
I also think it's putting a big burden on developers, and the complexity 
of the UI, to support navigating to elements without focusing there.
Personally, if we can't find a real world example, I'd like to see 
onfocus and onblur events excluded from the bit about needing to 
navigate without setting off event handlers. Unless someone can argue a 
good case where it's really useful.
