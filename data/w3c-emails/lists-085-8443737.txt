AG:: Is this your impression of what is being asked? 

What if the kind of 'navigating' we are talking about is precisely "focusing
there."  The condition for creation of the onFocus event happens.  The
event is
created.  This would leave the implementation the job to intercept the onFocus
event so that it does not reach its handler without further approval.

Is that onerous?

Capturing the event is functionally similar to the example David Poelman
mentioned 

 <http://bama.ua.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0004C&L=adv-html&P=R636>http://bama.u
a.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0004CL=adv-html&P=R636 

in his post at

 blocking enter key form submission:

//lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/2001JanMar/0747.html

If capturing the onFocus event is onerous, do you have a non-onerous solution
to satisfying Checkpoint 5.4 on form submission?

AG:: 

You don't need to find an actual old paint can of kerosene soaked rags in your
neighbor's house to have a rule against them.

There have been a lot of casualties from use of onChange to submit forms. 
While it is true that there is a way to use the screen reader interface to
work
around this, it is risky to rely for public safety on "there is a safe way to
use this."  

Maybe we should make the technology safe without requiring casualties first.
