Aaron,
You are basically asking that checkpoint 9.3 [1] be either removed from the 
document or reduced in Priority.  We discussed reducing the Priority of 
checkpoint 9.3 at last weeks telecon.  I think the questions you raised are 
important for the group to discuss further, since this is a new requirement 
on the document.

1. Do we have examples of access to content that this feature would be of 
benefit?
The current thought of the working group seems to be that any script may 
cause accessibility problems if it is automatically executed, so we want 
some way to control the execution of scripts without having to turn them 
all off.  We don't have any examples of how this particular techniques 
would solve an existing accessibility problem.  This is probably a good 
idea if we are going to require developers to add a feature.  The problem 
could be the start of a test suite for conforming to the user agent guidelines.

2. Last week people felt that main reason for reducing the Priority of this 
checkpoint, the ability to turning off all scripts (checkpoint 3.4) and 
query the event handlers associated with an element (Checkpoint 9.6), would 
make the elements inactive and therefore people could may not be able to 
navigate to them.

3. Your question of not moving focus as an undue burden for developers.
How hard is it to just disable event handlers that related to focus moves?
We actually want the focus to be on the event handler, so that the user can 
interact with it manually.

Thanks for you comments Aaron,
Can you come to the telecon on Thursday?

Jon
