Al,
At this stage in the process the problem and potential solutions need to be 
very carefully documented.  This is a new requirement (was not discussed to 
my knowledge by the working group as a feature before the March FTF) that 
is potentially very difficult for developers to implement, we need both 
good justification for the feature, how the feature should work and 
examples of the problem in the real world (like onChange) as a part of the 
techniques document.

I do not want the document to go to last call without everyone in the 
working group understanding the issue and that understanding reflected 
clearly in the document.  I do not want a repeat of our previous last call 
when the whole area of access to event handlers was barely mentioned in the 
document.

Jon
