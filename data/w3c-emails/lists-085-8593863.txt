Hello,

Checkpoint 1.2 of the 9 March draft [1] reads:

   1.2 Ensure that the user can interact with all enabled 
       elements through keyboard input alone, and
       pointing device input alone, and voice input alone. 

This requirement is covered by checkpoint 1.1:

   1.1 Ensure that the user can operate the user agent fully 
       through keyboard input alone, and pointing
       device input alone, and voice input alone.

Furtheremore, the Note after 1.1 starts: 

   "For example, ensure that through all three input modalities, 
    the user can interact with enabled elements..."

As I read this document on the plane, I felt that 1.2
was unnecessary and could be deleted without loss.

 - Ian
