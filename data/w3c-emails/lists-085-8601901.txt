Hello,

In the 9 March draft [1], checkpoint 2.2 includes some
information about what constitutes a text format:

 "Text formats include all of the following: 

  1) all media objects given an Internet media type of "text" 
     (e.g., text/plain, text/HTML, or text/*). 
     Refer to [RFC2046], section 4.1 for information 
    about the "text" Internet media type. 

  2) all SGML and XML applications regardless of Internet 
     Media Type (e.g., HTML 4.01, XHTML 1.1, SMIL, SVG, etc.)."

I think this belongs in the checkpoint as part of the 
(minimal) requirement.

 - Ian
