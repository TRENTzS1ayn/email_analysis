Hello,

In the 9 March UAAG 1.0 [1], checkpoint 9.1 reads:


  9.1 Allow the user to make the selection and focus of 
      each viewport (including frames) the current selection
      and current focus, respectively. For interfaces that 
      support a pointing device, allow the user to interact 
      with each viewport using the pointing device.

The second sentence seems out of place to me.
For one, it's not clear what "interact with each viewport"
means. Perhaps this means "you have to be able to send
pointing device events to each viewport". But unlike
the case for focus, we don't have any other requirements
tied to the pointing device once a viewport gets
pointing device input. Checkpoints 9.1 to 9.7 (and others)
all involve focus requirements.

In addition, checkpoint 1.1 covers the requirement that 
the UA be operable fully through the pointing device
(when conformance is sought for the pointing device).

Therefore, I think we can delete the second sentence of
checkpoint 9.1 and leave it solely about focus.
