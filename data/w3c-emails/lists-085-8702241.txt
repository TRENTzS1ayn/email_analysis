Querying RDF space for metadata is a separate technique from recovering and
inspecting the resource for suitable placeholder text.

Since PICS is operational and we are not committed to two competing
implementations of techniques promote this from an apologetic asside "it would
even be possible..." to just a technique among other techniques.? Link to the
Semantic Web activity home page.

Agreed.? If you imply they must use multiple this exceeds minimum requirements
in a way you didn''t need to.? So leave the example at "any of the
following."?
PS:? The 'also' is confusing in your comment, as this is what is said in the
proposal, not over and above what is said in the proposal.

This comment is confusing.? Maybe the checkpoint is too easy to
misunderstand.?
The contemplated User Action algorithm uses type indications within the
currently held document data, in the element referencing the external media
object.? This is the type information that is meant to be used in this case.?
Various HTML/XML elements give information about the type of content involved
where content is imported by URI reference.

Adding any Net traffic to satisfy this checkpoint is supposed to be above and
beyond the minimum requirement, yes.? But just saying "type" was not meant to
commit the user agent to discovering the actual type of the recovered value of
the resource just to generate a placeholder.? If you want to say "locally
indicated type" or "type indicated with the content reference" that could be
clearer.

This is correct.? The standard for User Agent generated text here is lower
than
the threshold for questions to the author in the AERT.? If the User Agent
can't
say anything smarter than "[application]" that's OK.
