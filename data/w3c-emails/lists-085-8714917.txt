1.Issue 466: What are the priority of the accessibility issues and
user agent minimum requirements for checkpoint 9.3
  http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#466

Question: Is there a real-world example of why it's necessary to turn
off automatic onFocus and onBlur triggering?

AL: I talked to one of the guys at work yesterday. He said the most
common uses: onFocus for selecting, onBlur for validation.

TL: I wrote some DHTML that implements a toolbar. It relies on onBlur
and onFocus to do rollovers (i.e., replace one GIF with another).

AL: Web designers usually do this for the pointing device.

IJ: I've heard rationale for doing things manually, but less for not
doing things automatically.

GR: Recall that navigation sequence changes when you turn off all
script supports.

IJ: If onFocus causes a change to the document such that you can't
activate the other handlers, then this would be a destructive case.

/* GR raises this email message from Al:
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0407.html
*/

CMN: The form case (don't trigger on enter key) is a separate case, I
     think.

IJ: If you do a destructive onFocus manually, you still have to
undo the action. Is there a difference between undo after automatic
behavior and undo after manual behavior?

CMN: There is a difference: Auto behavior can make it hard to 
undo (e.g., chaining, refreshing pages).

CMN: There aren't enough people writing accessible pages to give
real-world examples of using focus/blur. If we are successful, then
perhaps we will need this requirement more than today. Perhaps it's
easier to have a general event trap and not exclude specify types of
events.

AL: But I think that today the big issues are mouse overs and form
submissions.

IJ: In the past, we've said that automatic behavior may be
disorienting, thus we've required configuration to suppress automatic
behavior.

Rationale:
 * Automatic behavior can be disorienting.

AL: But we can't think of an example where this would happen.

CMN: When people include focus handlers, they have usually done a job
to make those handlers useful. One problem is that part of a page
changes, but the user is not aware of it.

AL: Screen reader gives you a review cursor.

CMN: I use a variety of browsers because a single one does not meet
all of my needs.

IJ: I don't think that there is a guarantee that if you can't prevent
auto-triggering, that access will be impossible. This is unlike form
submission, where you can't finish filling out the form.

CMN: But there are examples where onFocus causes, e.g., a list of
choices to be updated automatically. Every one of the different
players (author, user agent, authoring tool) can help solve the
problem.

GR: Another example: when I was trying to configure a computer online,
a lot of forms used magic links that appear when you do an
onFocus. There is assumption in authoring that you are using a
pointing device: if you navigate to a link that has appeared
dynamically, the rest of the page fails. In other words, the focus
and the pointing device establish context; not the focus alone.

CMN: Part of this is an authoring requirement. 

IJ: It seems like:
 1. This is not a widespread problem in practice.
 2. Not clear to me that automatic triggering is an accesibility
    problem that is a P1 problem.

CMN: Think of the structured navigation requirement in conjunction
with 9.3: You navigate around a "static" tree and fire at well.  The
P1 problem is that self-customizing content becomes inaccessible.

/* Denis joins the call */

AL: I'd like to satisfy this requirement so that a screen reader could
do this, by letting the user zap mouse to focus (technique).

CMN: Blind users don't know what they've missed as they're navigating.

Rationale for P1:

 * Handlers may cause inaccessible changes to content.

Rationale for P2:

 * Not widespread in practice
 * People who write onFocus handlers may be aware of accessibility
problems.
 * This is a repair functionality if changes cause inaccessible content

IJ: It's hard for me to include a P1 requirement for extreme cases.

DP: How does this affect access to all content? Would you not fail 2.1?

IJ: Who can't live with it as a P2?

Resolved:
 * Make checkpoint 9.3 a P2 checkpoint.
 
IJ: Note that an objection will be strengthened by evidence that this
is widespread in practice.

2. Comments from Denis Anson:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0425

IJ: Any statements the WG needs to review here?

DA: 

* In section 1.1: change "support authoring practices" to 
  "addresses authoring practices."

* Checkpoints 1.1 and 1.3: The way I read these, it's not
  clear you always have to do the keyboard.

  CMN: I want to see 1.1 say: you have to do the keyboard.
       I want to see a new 1.2/1.3 with input modality labels.

  IJ: I don't think you need a label if it only appears once.
      This is why it's different than content type labels.

  EH: Even a set of one, for the sake of consistency, to use a label.
  
  DA: I agree that it sounds contradictory to say "you have do to
      this but you don't have to."

 CMN: I have two parts to what I'd like to see:
  * Split 1.1 into two different checkpoints (you get
    a sense of two classes of requirements.)

 IJ: The input labels are conformance labels. The content type
     labels are next to the checkpoint labels for convenience
     only.

 IJ: All the checkpoints are accessibility requirements, not
     conformance requirements.

Resolved: (this is issue 465)
 * Split 1.1 into two checkpoints.
 * Add to introduction of Section 2 that content type
   labels after checkpoints are for convenience only.
 * Include an example of evaluting a browser for
   conformance.

CMN: If I'm not satisfied with the wording, I'll send
a new proposal.

Revolved:

 * For checkpoint 2.2, move text format requirement from 
   the note to the checkpoint.
 * Make clearer the "additional bonus should" of the Note.

DA: In checkpoint 2.3, why not have notification to AT that something
is there and unrendered?

IJ: The checkpoint says "alerts the user" as well.

/* No change */

DA: 2.4: Does this include the condition where there are embedded
links inside a QuickTime movie, for example, that allow a user to
further explore building shown in the movie? 

/* The WG thinks that Denis' example is covered by 2.4 */

DA: I'm not sure what this checkpoint means. 

Action IJ: 
 * Work on editorial changes to 2.9
 * Include an example (e.g., "alt" for IMG in HTML).

DA: Checkpoint 3.1: What about condition where you have a table with a
background image?

IJ: That's a chosen limitation of this document.

Action IJ:
 * Add to the beginning of the document (limitations)
   that 3.1 doesn't cover layers.

DA: What if text is bigger than the space alloted for the
    scrolling area?

CMN: You have to come up with some solution. It might be that you
re-render the content. It's the same as when you fire up a page
without images that chop off alt content.

IJ: The unblinking text doesn't have to be in context.

Action IJ:

 * Add to the techniques document that it's ok to render
   the unblinking text not in context.

DA: Checkpoint 3.5: How do I get content after I said no?

DP: Manual refresh is ok.

IJ: By saying no, you may miss some content. But I don't
think we are asking the UA to save 600 versions of a page.

CMN: There is an essential limitation that we can't stop the external
world.

DA: This is like frame-dropping.

/* No change */

DA: Checkpoint 3.7: [SUBSTANTIVE]. When you do this, there should be
an option that when I render "this image" it dismissive the previous
image. Too many images are two many images, whether they all appear at
once or serially one after the other.

IJ: One way to achieve this is to reload the page with images turned
off. We already discussed this and decided that toggling back off was
not considered a requirement.

/* EH leaves */

DA: I think it is, though. I worked with a guy who could hold 5 cards
in his hand, but couldn't hold 6 (he started playing as though he had
9 cards). You need a way to resimplify the page.

IJ: Why so burdensome to turn all images off?

DA: This is burdensome for someone with a cognitive disability.

IJ: This would apply to 3.2 as well (same reasoning: turning on video
and animated images).

AL: Implementation note: Netscape 6 or any Mozilla lets users turn
toggle images on/off on a per-image basis.

DP: I often browse without images turned on. When I'm working with a
sighted user, they often want to view images individually without
having to turn them on globally.

CMN: I do this in Lynx - run Lynx and view images one at a time.

DA: It would also satisfy the user requirement to show an image
temporarily and when you're done, make it disappear.

Action IJ:

 * Add to techniques to show images "temporarily" and when you
   leave the image, it goes away.

DA Proposal: Add toggle-off requirement to 3.2/3.7.

Action IJ: Write a proposal for what the new wording might be
for these checkpoints.

No resolution for now.
