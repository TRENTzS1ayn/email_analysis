   1.1 Ensure that the user can operate the user agent fully through
          keyboard input alone, and pointing device input alone, and
          voice input alone. [Priority 1]
          Note: For example, ensure that through all three input
          modalities, the user can interact with [130]enabled elements,
          select content, navigate viewports, configure the user agent,
          access documentation, install the user agent, etc. A user agent
          may claim [131]conformance to this document without satisfying
          the pointing device and voice portions of this checkpoint. See
          the section on [132]input modality labels.
          [133]Techniques for checkpoint 1.1

[end quote]

I suggest that in the sentence containing link 131 that you insert the word
'restricted' so as to say "may claim restricted [131]conformance to
this..." to give a clearer hint as to what it says in the conformance
section.  This is in a Note so it is not binding, but as this is checkpoint
1.1 it is good to set the right tone and expectations.  Otherwise if one
does not follow the link it just sounds as though pointer and voice access
just don't matter, despite what we just said.  Not a good impression to make.
