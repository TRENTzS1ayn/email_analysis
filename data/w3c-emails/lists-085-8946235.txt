Bryan,

Please find below a summary of how the UAWG addressed the
non-editorial last call issue (338) you raised;
please refer to the email source of the issue [0].

The complete second last call issues list [1] is available
online. The results of the UAWG's resolutions have been
incorporated into the 9 March 2001 draft of the document [2].

  NOTE: The issue titles relate to the 23 October 2000 last call
  draft [4]. In my comments below, checkpoint numbers, etc. have
  been updated to correspond to the 9 March 2001 draft.

Please indicate before 27 March whether you are satisfied with
the UAWG's resolutions, whether you wish the WG to carry forward
any objections to the Director as the document advances, or
whether you require further clarification or comment. If you do
not think you respond before 27 March, please let me know.  The
Director will appreciate a response whether you agree with the
disposition of comments or not. More information about the
process we are following is available in section 5.5.2 of the W3C
Process Document [3].

On behalf of the UAWG, thank you for your review and comments,

 - Ian

The UAWG agreed with you:
===============================================

#338: Editorial: Edits to Guideline 1 prose re: easy access 

  Comment: The edited sentences in Guideline 1 about the importance
  of keyboard access are:

  "Keyboard operation (using as few keystrokes as possible) of all
  functionalities offered through the user interface is one of the
  most important aspects of user agent accessibility on almost every
  platform. The keyboard is available to most users, it is widely
  supported, and specialized input devices may reuse the keyboard
  API."

  Please also note the evolution of our keyboard configuration
  requirements in Guideline 11.
