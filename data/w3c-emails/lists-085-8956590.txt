Karl,

Please find below a summary of how the UAWG addressed the
non-editorial last call issue (326) you raised;
please refer to the email source of the issues [0].

The complete second last call issues list [1] is available
online. The results of the UAWG's resolutions have been
incorporated into the 9 March 2001 draft of the document [2].

  NOTE: The issue titles relate to the 23 October 2000 last call
  draft [4]. In my comments below, checkpoint numbers, etc. have
  been updated to correspond to the 9 March 2001 draft.

Please indicate before 27 March whether you are satisfied with
the UAWG's resolutions, whether you wish the WG to carry forward
any objections to the Director as the document advances, or
whether you require further clarification or comment. If you do
not think you respond before 27 March, please let me know.  The
Director will appreciate a response whether you agree with the
disposition of comments or not. More information about the
process we are following is available in section 5.5.2 of the W3C
Process Document [3].

On behalf of the UAWG, thank you for your review and comments,

 - Ian

===============================================
The UAWG agreed with you:
===============================================

#326: Checkpoint 1.2: What if the standard APIs do the wrong thing? 

  Comment: This is now checkpoint 6.6. The checkpoint has been
  rewritten to favor accessibility APIs first, then standard input
  and output APIs when the accessibility APIs fail.

  The checkpoint now reads:

  
    "6.6 Implement standard accessibility APIs (e.g., of the operating
    environment). Where these APIs do not enable the user agent to
    satisfy the requirements of this document, use the standard input
    and output APIs of the operating environment. [Priority 1]"
