Raman,

Please find below a summary of how the UAWG addressed the
non-editorial last call issue (325) you raised;
please refer to the email source of the issues [0].

The complete second last call issues list [1] is available
online. The results of the UAWG's resolutions have been
incorporated into the 9 March 2001 draft of the document [2].

  NOTE: The issue titles relate to the 23 October 2000 last call
  draft [4]. In my comments below, checkpoint numbers, etc. have
  been updated to correspond to the 9 March 2001 draft.

Please indicate before 27 March whether you are satisfied with
the UAWG's resolutions, whether you wish the WG to carry forward
any objections to the Director as the document advances, or
whether you require further clarification or comment. If you do
not think you respond before 27 March, please let me know.  The
Director will appreciate a response whether you agree with the
disposition of comments or not. More information about the

On behalf of the UAWG, thank you for your review and comments,

The UAWG agreed with you:
===============================================

#325: Checkpoint 5.5: API notification of content change in one
viewport that causes change in another

  Comment: You requested the following functional requirement:

     "When user agents display content in multiple viewports --and the
     user's action in one view port causes the display in other view
     ports to be updated, the user agent should make such display
     update notifications available through standard APIs like the
     DOM/HTML event APIs."

   This is covered by our checkpoint 6.5:

     "6.5 Using standard APIs, provide programmatic alert of changes
     to content, user interface controls, selection, content focus,
     and user interface focus. [Priority 1]
        Note: For instance, when user interaction in one frame causes
        automatic changes to content in another, provide programmatic
        alert through standard APIs. Use the standard APIs required by
        the checkpoints of guideline 6."
