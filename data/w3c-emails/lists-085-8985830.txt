Hello,

Part of issue 413 [1] involved the question of whether what is
now checkpoint 8.2 (in the 9 March draft [2]) was meant to apply 
only to content. The Working Group resolved that it was only meant 
to apply to content. There was no change to the document as
a result of the resolution, mostly because the  WG felt that 
the label "Checkpoints for content accessibility" was a
sufficient indicator.

However, we decided on 9 January 2001 that the labels
were informative only, it is not so clear that they suffice
to convey the information that checkpoint 8.2 (and others) are
for content only.

Eric Hansen has also raised this issue (and others related to
conformance) with me privately, and suggested that we probably 
need to do a better job making clear which checkpoints
apply only to content provided by the author, which apply only
to the user agent's "native" features, and which (like 
checkpoint 1.1) apply to both.

This email does not contain a proposal, only a heads-up that the
editors will be discussing this topic and seeking ways to clarify
and simplify this conformance issue.
