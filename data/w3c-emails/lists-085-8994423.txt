Hello,

In the 9 March 2001 draft [1], checkpoints 4.13, 4.14, and 
4.15 were birthed from checkpoint 4.13 of the 24 Feb draft [2].
T.V. Raman pointed out to me that in doing so, we dropped the
reference to the CSS2 specification of aural cascading style
sheets [3]. He recommended that we return to using
the terminology of the CSS2 specification.

I propose to re-adopt the CSS2 terminology as follows:

For checkpoint 4.15:
  speech-rate and voice-family

For checkpoint 4.14:
  pitch, pitch-range, stress, and richness
 
For checkpoint 4.15
 speak (in particular the 'spell-out' value),
 speak-numeral, and speak-punctuaion

Please let me know whether this grouping of the CSS properties
corresponds to your expectations of the checkpoints as written:

4.13 Allow configuration of speech characteristics according 
     to the full range of values offered by the
     speech synthesizer.

4.14 Allow configuration of speech prosody (i.e., pitch, 
     pitch range, stress, and richness).

4.15 Provide support for user-defined extensions to the 
    speech dictionary, spell-versus-say functionality, 
    number read-out functionality, and punctuation read-out 
    functionality. 

Thank you,

 - Ian

P.S. I think this is editorial.
