Subject: A Significant Winamp Upgrade now Available


If you use Winamp to listen to ACB Radio's programming, it is strongly
recommended that you upgrade to Winamp 2.73, now available in the
download
section at acbradio.org.

There's one new feature in Winamp 2.73 that makes this upgrade a major
one.
Nullsoft has introduced seeking for HTTP streams. What this means is
that
when you are listening to a programme on demand from the ACB Radio
archives,
you can now press control+j to jump to a specific time point in the
file.
For example, if for some reason you had to stop listening about 20
minutes
through the file, you can now press control+j and type in 20:00 to
immediately be placed 20 minutes into the broadcast. Previously, this
feature was available for local files but not for HTTP streams. The seek
feature is very fast and seems to work well.
Enjoy Winamp 2.73!
