[snip good stuff]

First draft of glossary entry:

 Normative, Non-normative, Informative

   As used in this document, the term "normative" refers to
   "that on which the requirements of this document depend
   for their most precise statement." What is normative
   is required for conformance (though the conformance scheme
   of this document allows claimants to exempt certain normative
   provisions as long as the claim discloses the exemption).
   What is identified as "non-normative" of "informative" 
   is never required for conformance.
