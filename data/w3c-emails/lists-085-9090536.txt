AG::? Suggest rewording this one something like the following:

[proposal]
Allow configuration to adjust the pitch, pitch range, stress and richness of
the speaking voice.
[end proposal]

If the scope of the requirement (in this checkpoint) is these four voice
characteristics, just list them.? They don't need a "one name fits all"
category name.? And 'prosody' doesn't really fit.? The term 'prosody' usually
refers to the time-varying contour of voice properties such as pitch and
stress, not the general characteristics of the speaking voice.? In particular
one thinks of prosody as the different patterns of vocal inflection used for
asking questions vs. giving orders, etc.? This is not exactly what is
intended,
here.? We just want to change the voice.
