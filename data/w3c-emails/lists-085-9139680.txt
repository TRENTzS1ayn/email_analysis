Hi Denis,

Thank you for these comments (most of which we addressed at
the 15 March teleconf [1]). Some comments preceded by IJ: below.

IJ: I disagree with your interpretation (though I take note of it).
Our intention is to say: "Accessible design is good design, so
if you meet these requirements, you will also benefit a larger 
audience than just users with disabilities."

New text:

"Furthermore, this
document includes some requirements to address 
 certain widespread authoring practices that are discouraged because 
 they may cause accessibility or usability problems (e.g., some uses 
 of HTML frames)."

IJ: The introduction ("Known limitations of this document")
explains that this document "only includes requirements for 
keyboard, pointing device, and voice input modalities.

IJ: Yes, that's true. Refer to recent proposal on this topic:

[I have snipped a bunch of comments addressed at the 15 March teleconf.]

IJ: Ok.
