The "etc." is only part of the list of examples, so I don't
think it's the culprit. Perhaps it's the "all" in
"all SGML and XML applications regardless of Internet Media Type."

Is "proprietary" really the distinguishing factor? I don't mind
that PostScript is proprietary since the format is open. Is there
a technical characteristic (or more than one) to these formats
that we can/should point to?
