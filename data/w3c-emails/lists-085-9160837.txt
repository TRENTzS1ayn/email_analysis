  Is "proprietary" really the distinguishing factor? I don't mind
  that PostScript is proprietary since the format is open. Is there
  a technical characteristic (or more than one) to these formats
  that we can/should point to?

I rather like the technical characteristic "these are text-based formats - it
is possible to read the actual words inside them". RTF is a proprietary
format in the sense that it is specified by Microsoft, but then HTML is
specified by the W3C.
