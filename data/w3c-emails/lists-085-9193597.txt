Hi Denis,

Thank you for these comments (most of which we addressed at
the 15 March teleconf [1]). Some comments preceded by IJ: below.

IJ: I disagree with your interpretation (though I take note of it). Our
intention is to say: "Accessible design is good design, so if you meet
these requirements, you will also benefit a larger 
audience than just users with disabilities."

DA: That part is what I caught, but as worded it seems to say that it
doesn't make any difference what user agent you are using, all users
will benefit.  Actually, all users of the compliant user agent will
benefit, but not all users of the web.

IJ: The introduction ("Known limitations of this document") explains
that this document "only includes requirements for 
keyboard, pointing device, and voice input modalities.
 
DA: My point is that Morse Code and Single Switch scanning access the
browser via the keyboard interface.  That is why it's important to
distinguish between the physical keyboard and a keyboard API: these
alternative access techniques generate characters, and you need to have
a keyboard interface to access the browser using such technologies.
