Eric,

Thank you for comments. I've snipped out points of agreement.

IJ: I think we will need a little bit more work on these 
checkpoints. Refer to related proposals/comments:

Suggestion from Al for more precise wording for 4.14:

I think we should try to do for all three what Al suggested for
4.14.

IJ: I have adopted your proposal.

IJ: I have adopted your proposal.

IJ: I will let a reviewer with more experience using a braille
viewport comment.

IJ: Thank you for getting the ball rolling. I expect to 
be able to spend some time on the summary this week.

IJ: Sorry, this was kind of cryptic. Because the definition of
"animation" includes "video", I was wondering whether
animation/video/image
content type labels should all refer to mutually exclusive sets of
checkpoints. In the end, for 3.2, I thought it best to leave
two content type labels: Animtion (for animated images), Video.

In general, I have been wondering whether animated images should
fall under the "Animation" label or the "Image" label or both.
I think that I prefer just under Animation given the nature
of the requirements (and the document reflects that). 
Comments are welcome.

IJ: Yes, it is supposed to (the user selects "yes", which is an
option known to the UA).

IJ: I think that we limited our requirement to "alert" because the
issue was simply not knowing that you had wrapped. I don't think it's
as important a requirement to not wrap.

We haven't discussed what happens when a search terminates. Do you
have any proposals? I'm not sure we need to say anything.
