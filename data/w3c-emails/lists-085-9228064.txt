EH: Not sure what "this" in last sentence means. I am still having trouble
wrapping my mind around it. Is "it" a 'content focus or user interface focus
that receives input focus is called the current focus.' Do you mean 'For any
given viewport, at most only one focus -- either content focus or user
interface focus -- can receive input events.' Maybe I am just fishing,
trying to understand.
