Hello,

I've published the 19 March 2001 UAAG 1.0 Guidelines [1]
and Techniques [2]. The changes [3] are on the Web and
quoted below as text.

If you have wanted to read the document and didn't read
the 9 March 2001 version, please read the 19 March version
instead (as there is helpful editorial cleanup).

Please review a couple of changes not yet approved:

 - Deleted sentence in 9.1 about pointing device interaction.
 - Checkpoint 4.14 edited as suggested by Al (and in alignment
   with CSS2 property names). 

If all goes well, I think that there will be one more draft
for the WG to review after this one, and then we will be
ready to go to last call. I would like to be in last call by
9 April, which means we should decided by 29 March whether
we are prepared to return to last call.

Thank you for your continued active participation in
getting us to last call! The next 2 teleconferences will
be very important to our efforts.

 - Ian

TODO
====

We're quite near last call now. The following may look
like a long list, but I don't think much WG time will be
required on these topics.

We have proposals for the following topics:

a) Proposal to address conformance through pointing device and
   voice input.
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0452.html

b) Proposal to clarify checkpoint 2.9 
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0453.html

c) Checkpoint 9.1: Delete sentence about pointing device interaction
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0421.html
   [NOTE: I've implemented this one in the 19 March draft since I
    don't expect that it will be controversial.]

d) Checkpoint 2.7: Solution for repair text should not be
   minimal requirement.
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0418.html

e) Checkpoints 3.2/3.7: Toggle placeholders off requirement:
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0455.html

f) Executive summary (proposed by Eric)
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0413.html

We don't have proposals for these topics yet, and I think they
should be dealt with before we go to last call:

g) Al Gilman has suggested that we may have a way to deal with
   SMIL captions for checkpoints 2.5 and 4.5. Al, can you
   say more about what we can expect UAs to recognize w.r.t.
   system-captions?

h) Conformance: Refer to my comments with respect to issue 4.13
   about which checkpoints are for content, user interface, or both.
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0448.html

i) Conformance: Eric has suggested (and I agree) that we include an
   example of how one would figure out whether a checkpoint or part of a
   checkpoint should be covered by a claim, and if not what to do.

j) We need to add to the Techniques document for
   the following checkpoints 2.9, 5.6, 9.3, 9.5,
   9.6, 9.7. Additional techniques are welcome as well.
