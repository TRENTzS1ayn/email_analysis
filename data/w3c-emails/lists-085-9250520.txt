I think Denis' point is that the requirement for keyboard support includes
the API requirement, and that this should be reflected a little more clearly
in the introductory material.

I agree with such a suggestion (maybe that's why I interpreted it like that
<grin/>

It would also be good to explain in the techniques for 1.1 and 6.7 that many
users will interact with the browser through devices that make use of
keyboard APIs.

  IJ: The introduction ("Known limitations of this document") explains
  that this document "only includes requirements for
  keyboard, pointing device, and voice input modalities.

  DA: My point is that Morse Code and Single Switch scanning access the
  browser via the keyboard interface.  That is why it's important to
  distinguish between the physical keyboard and a keyboard API: these
  alternative access techniques generate characters, and you need to have
  a keyboard interface to access the browser using such technologies.
