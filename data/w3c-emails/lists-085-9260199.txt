it is customary to provide the user with feedback on this otherly, you
need a failure to find more indicator or an explicit wrap modality.  As
I understand the document, the requirement sets an if condition such
that if you employ a wrap, notify the user but doesn't talk about what
should be done if a wrap is not employed.Something to think about then
is to cover that situation with a message to indicate search termination
if at end of string matches.  In other words, after the last string is
found, the next attempt if it is set up in this way provides a
termination without match condition informant.  Of course, one technique
for getting around this would be to find all matches and present them in
a contextual list such that they could stepped through and examined in
context.
Thoughts?
