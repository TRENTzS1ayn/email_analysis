Charles,

That is exactly my point.

I think Denis' point is that the requirement for keyboard support
includes the API requirement, and that this should be reflected a little
more clearly in the introductory material.

I agree with such a suggestion (maybe that's why I interpreted it like
that <grin/>

It would also be good to explain in the techniques for 1.1 and 6.7 that
many users will interact with the browser through devices that make use
of keyboard APIs.

cheers

  IJ: The introduction ("Known limitations of this document") explains
  that this document "only includes requirements for
  keyboard, pointing device, and voice input modalities.

  DA: My point is that Morse Code and Single Switch scanning access the
  browser via the keyboard interface.  That is why it's important to
  distinguish between the physical keyboard and a keyboard API: these
  alternative access techniques generate characters, and you need to
have
  a keyboard interface to access the browser using such technologies.
