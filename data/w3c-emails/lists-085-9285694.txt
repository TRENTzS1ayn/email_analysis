Hi, Everybody:

Ian asked me to read the latest version of the UA guidelines and send comments to this list.  Please
 note that due to some recent travel I haven't been able to read the draft as thoroughly as I would have
 liked, but will go back over them after CSUN and send more comments as necessary.

Anyhow, just a couple points for now:

1.  Guideline 2.7:
"Allow configuration to generate repair text when the user agent recognizes that the author has failed
 to provide conditional content that was required by the format specification. If the missing conditional
 content is included by URI reference, base the repair text on the URI reference and content type.
 Otherwise, base the repair text on element type information. [Priority?2]"

GF:
Even after reading the associated techniques document, I'm still not clear on how authors are going to
 handle this guideline.  The inclusion of more examples-- perhaps some sample code, as is done in
 WCAG 1.0 techniques-- would be helpful.  In general, are you talking about incorporating and/or
 implementing an SSB (www.ssbtechnologies.com) or next-generation Bobby type of thing?  If so, it
 sounds like a giant request to make of UA manufacturers.  

2.  (from the glossary)  Auditory description
"An auditory description is either a prerecorded human voice or a synthesized voice (recorded or
 generated dynamically) describing the key visual elements of a movie or other animation. The
 auditory description is synchronized with the audio track of the presentation, usually during natural
 pauses in the audio track. Auditory descriptions include information about actions, body language,
 graphics, and scene changes."

GF:
My only objection to this definition is the term itself.  "Audio description" has become the industry's
 generic term for extra tracks of descriptive narration.  It is used in Section 508; in SMIL 2.0, there's an
 element called systemAudioDesc, not systemAuditoryDesc, which is used to toggle descriptions on or
 off, if present.   Thus, in the interest of conformity and clarity, I think you're better off replacing
 "auditory description" with "audio description".
