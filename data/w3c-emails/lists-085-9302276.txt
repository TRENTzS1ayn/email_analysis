Geoff,

My comments below, preceded by "IJ:" presume the 
19 March 2001 draft of UAAG 1.0.

IJ: Which part of the checkpoint surprises you?

 a) How to recognize missing conditional content?
 b) How to do the repair?

In the 19 March 2001 version, we're very specific about (b). In fact,
too specific; we may revise the minimal requirement per this
proposal:
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0418.html

As for (a), this information is supposed to come from
specifications.

IJ: Could you please explain a little more why this seems like a big
requirement?

IJ: Since this is a "content term", we are using the term "auditory
description" as used in WCAG 1.0 [1]. I hesitate to stray too far
from WCAG 1.0. Perhaps it would be sufficient in UAAG 1.0 to say
something like "An auditory description (also called an "audio
description"...) .... 

What do you think?

Thanks again Geoff,

 - Ian
