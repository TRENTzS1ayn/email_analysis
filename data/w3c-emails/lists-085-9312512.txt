JRG: User agent just needs to provide some information on the element with 
the missing information.  It is only repair in the sense that the user 
agent, based on available information, provides some information on the 
element to the user.  For example an image that is missing alt text, the 
user agent may provide the type of image format and the URL to the image 
file.  The user agent is not trying to fix the authors problem.

Does this make it clearer.  Was it the word repair that was misleading?
