IMPORTANT
---------

Please prepare for the meeting by reading the proposals listed
below. A lot of time has been put into these proposals so that the
teleconference itself can be as efficient as possible. You are also
invited to comment on the proposals on the mailing list prior to the
meeting. The goal is to send the document to last call in about two
weeks, and we need to address these proposals as quickly as possible.

------
Agenda
------

  1) Review action items (listed at the bottom of this email)
  2) Review proposals to address open issues

-------------------
Review of proposals
-------------------

a) I'd like to get confirmation of changes to the speech
  characteristic checkpoints of the 19 March 2001 draft
  (as announced:
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0472)

b) Proposal to clarify checkpoint 2.9 
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0453

c) Checkpoint 9.1: Delete sentence about pointing device interaction
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0421
   [NOTE: I've implemented this one in the 19 March draft since I
    don't expect that it will be controversial.]

d) Checkpoint 2.7: Solution for repair text should not be
   minimal requirement.
   Note: There is support for this proposal from Al and Denis.
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0418

e) Checkpoints 3.2/3.7: Toggle placeholders off requirement:
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0455

f) Executive summary (proposed by Eric)
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0413

g) Refer to conformance proposals regarding content/ui labels, input
   device conformance, and conformance example.
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0483

   See also the proposal to address conformance through pointing
   device and voice input and the question at the end of the
   proposal about the shape of Guideline 1.
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0452

   I think this proposal subsumes Al's comments:
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0440

h) Search termation. Refer to ideas from David:
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0474.html

OTHER TOPICS:

g) Al Gilman has suggested that we may have a way to deal with
   SMIL captions for checkpoints 2.5 and 4.5. Al, can you
   say more about what we can expect UAs to recognize w.r.t.
   system-captions?

h) We need to add to the Techniques document for
   the following checkpoints 2.9, 5.6, 9.3, 9.5,
   9.6, 9.7. Additional techniques are welcome as well.
