Issue 468 [1]: The "at least a majority" minimal requirement needs
review. Refer to Al's email [2]:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
On the other hand, the requirement of "at least a majority" of the
default key
bindings would seem to be infeasible in many situations.  The group
should
reconsider this language.  If the default key binding defines a full set
of
single-key plus two full layers of modified-key bindings, then there is
_no
way_ to reduce a majority of the actions defined [in the default key
binding]
to single-key bindings.  Never mind if there is a one-hand, large-key,
or
twelve-key device in use.  You just can't get there from here.
