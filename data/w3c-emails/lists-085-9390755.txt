EH: Issue 1: Proposal to split. It seems good. So 11.3a would apply voice
and pointer input and 11.3b would not.

Issue 2: 11.3b has been changed sometime recently but it seems not to make
sense. Specifically, the requirement to "Allow the user to assign a single
key binding (with zero modifier keys) to at least a majority of the
functionalities available in the default keyboard configuration" may
sometimes be impossible to follow. Suppose there are 250 functionalities
available through the keyboard in the 'default keyboard configuration'. This
checkpoint would require that there be a 'single key binding (with zero
modifier keys) to at least a majority" i.e., 126, of the functionalities.
Yet there are less than 126 such single key binding(s) (with zero modifier
keys) available on the keyboard. It seems that this needs to be fixed.

EH: It is a bit jarring to see video as an animation format, perhaps a link
to glossary of other explanation is warranted.

IJ:

EH: On the topic of recognition, this "example" is one of several possible.
One can make the case that in the current environments, checkpoint 2.5 ("")
does not apply.

EH: This list seems to contradict the earlier implication that video formats
would be a "kind of" animation format....

EH: It seems necessary to do as you have done -- to indicate which formats
are _implemented but for which no support is claimed_ (Y and Z) as well as
for which ones support is claimed (X). Should this be made any more
explicit?
