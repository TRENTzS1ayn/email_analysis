How about "at least a majority of single keys available should have a
configurable binding"?

  On the other hand, the requirement of "at least a majority" of the
  default key
  bindings would seem to be infeasible in many situations.  The group
  should
  reconsider this language.  If the default key binding defines a full set
  of
  single-key plus two full layers of modified-key bindings, then there is
  _no
  way_ to reduce a majority of the actions defined [in the default key
  binding]
  to single-key bindings.  Never mind if there is a one-hand, large-key,
  or
  twelve-key device in use.  You just can't get there from here.
