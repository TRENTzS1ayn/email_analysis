I think we should make clear that we are using an api model rather than
a physical device model here.  This would make our intent for the
document more clear and free us from some of the ambiguity that results
from the physical modality structure.  I believe this is discussed in a
response to us from brian on his last call issues?  It becomes important
when cross input modality approaches are taken and when an input mode is
indirectly used such as in the case of single switch mapped to keyboard
api and mouse or morse code and voice input also fall into this class if
I understand things and have read the document correctly.
 Thoughts?
