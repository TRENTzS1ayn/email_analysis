thanks ian, that clarifies things a bit.  Single key bindings are
exactly that.  one key press to do what it can take several keys to
accomplish.  TThis mapping is clear.  What is not clear to me though and
I will study it further is that when we say keyboard is some places in
the document, we may mean keyboard api.

We are?

But checkpoint 11.3 is about physical keys: it's a "one gesture"
requirement, not an API requirement. The API requirement to
use the keyboard API is checkpoint 6.7.

We can discuss this further on the call today, but I believe
that the "single key" parts of 11.3 are not about APIs at all.

In fact, you might want to bind one physical key to something
that requires 15 individual commands to accomplish. I use
this in emacs all the time: keyboard macros.

I don't think it's important to accessibility to be able to
accomplish a task through one procedure call versus 15 procedure
calls. The API requirement is simply that you can operate the
user agent, not that you can do it with fewer procedure calls.
