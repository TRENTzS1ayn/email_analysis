That review would be very helpful. And some clarification would
probably be good in the document.

Checkpoints in which "keyboard" appears (statement of checkpoint
or Note or both):

1.1 (keyboard operation, not api meant)
6.7 "API for the keyboard"
7.2 "keyboard accessibility" (keyboard operation, not api meant)
7.3 "keyboard configuration" (keyboard operation, not api meant)
9.1 "with the keyboard" (not specified)
9.3 "through keyboard input alone" (not specified)
Guideline 11: keyboard bindings (thus physical keyboard meant)
12.3 "keyboard bindings"
