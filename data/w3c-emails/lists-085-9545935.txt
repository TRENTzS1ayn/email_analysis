Gregory,

Thanks for comments. Mine preceded by "IJ:" below.

IJ: The 'and' was added for emphasis. But you're right, it's
now superfluous.

IJ: Agreed.

IJ: That is "pure coincidence". In the reorganization that
led to the creation of Guideline 5, checkpoints whose priorities
had already been determined by the Working Group happened to fall
this way.

IJ: Gregory, at the 2 May 2000 teleconference [1], which you
attended, we resolved to leave this checkpoint 5.4 (then 9.2) a
Priority 2 checkpoint. I realize that you have for a long
time felt this should be a P1 checkpoint (refer to your earlier
comments on this topic [2]). This is a case where I don't think
the Working Group should reopen this issue and you should voice
an objection if you have one. Please make an effort to review
past rationale for this decision and present new evidence why
the priority should be raised.

As for checkpoint 5.3, issue #175 involved the priority of
this checkpoint (increasing it to P1). At the 12 January 2000
teleconference, which you attended, we clarified that notification
was crucial for users of assistive technologies. Our P1 checkpoint
6.5 (in the 19 March draft) requires notification for changes
to the user interface. Therefore, notification of new viewports
is covered at a P1 level. We resolved to leave what is now 5.3
a Priority 2 checkpoint. I request here as well that you present
new evidence as to why this checkpoint must be a P1.

I note for the record that two of your previous objections have
been rendered moot by the progress of the document (which I
consider a good thing. These are [4] (CSS2 DOM raised to P2)
and [5]  (minreqs related to speech playback rate).

IJ: Yes. For the record, we resolved to change it at the 15 March 2001
teleconference:

IJ: We have a P1 requirement that the UA alert through APIs
changes to content.

IJ: The argument made at the previous teleconference was that
we were not convinced that too many dangers were lurking out there
in practice. Charles has an action item to hunt down real-world
cases of destructive on-focus handlers.

IJ: Noted. This will be on the agenda for next week.
