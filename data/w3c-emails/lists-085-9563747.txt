Ok, I'll add them to the next draft to give people a chance to 
play with them. However:

a) If you are at the end of Guideline N and wish to read Guideline N+1,
   I don't see the need for a next guideline link; you simply go
   to the next line of text.

b) It would seem like what would be useful is "back to the beginning
   of this same guideline". Maybe "previous guideline" is useful. Back
   to the TOC is fine too.
