aloha, ian!

thank you for your response...  you noted,

I note for the record that two of your previous objections have
been rendered moot by the progress of the document (which I
consider a good thing. These are [4] (CSS2 DOM raised to P2)
and [5]  (minreqs related to speech playback rate).

to which i simply wanted to note, for the record, that:
a) i, too, consider it a very good thing that 2 of my objections have been
mooted by the progress of the document;

b) it is not my intention to delay UAAG in any way, shape, or form, but it
is my obligation to stand by the longstanding objections which have been
logged, minuted, and archived...  why?  because they aren't simply my
objections, based on conjecture or personal prejudice, but reflect the
experiences, frustrations, needs, and desires of the constituency i
titularly represent (which, for the record, is the Visually Impaired
Computer Users' Group of New York City, also known as VICUG NYC), as well as
anyone and everyone who has ever contacted me via the VICUG NYC site--or any
of my other web sites, or in response or reaction to a post on a mailing
list--asking for assistance or seeking an explanation of exactly what it is
that has been reducing them to roadkill on the information superhighway...

i will respond to your specific responses to my other comments individually,
gregory.
