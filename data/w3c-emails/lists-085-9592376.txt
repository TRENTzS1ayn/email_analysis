Gregory,

The W3C Process is designed so that anyone may request that
their objections be carried forward to the Director for review.
You are obviously welcome to register your objections as we
move the document to last call. It even seems very reasonable
that a thorough review of the document after so many changes
would lead anyone to raise some issues (this has happened to 
me a number of times). 

However, I personally do not want to spend any more
time debating the priorities of the checkpoints in question.
We did that a year ago. I personally do not wish to take any
more WG time to discuss these priority questions without
substantial new evidence.

We really must move on.

 - Ian
