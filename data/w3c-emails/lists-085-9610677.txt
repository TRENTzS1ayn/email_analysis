Hello,

I've published the 23 March 2001 UAAG 1.0 Guidelines [1]
and Techniques [2]. 

The changes [3] are on the Web and quoted below as text.
Important changes:

 - Edits to prose of Guideline 1 and checkpoint 1.1
 - Edits to checkpoints 2.3 and 2.9
 - Edits to checkpoints 2.7
 - Edits to checkpoints 4.13, 4.14, and 4.15. 
 - Lots of changes to the conformance section. I hope it
   is simpler to use now.

Please review these changes. Thank you,

 - Ian

TODO
====

Here's what I have left on my TODO list. It's not much!


a) Issue 468: Checkpoint 11.4, "majority" of single key bindings.
   http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#468 

b) Issue 467: Toggle placeholders off requirement for checkpoints 
              3.2 and 3.7?
   http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#467

c) Issue 449: Executive summary
   http://server.rehab.uiuc.edu/ua-issues/issues-linear-lc2.html#449

We don't have proposals for these topics yet, and I think they
should be dealt with before we go to last call:

d) Al Gilman has suggested that we may have a way to deal with
   SMIL captions for checkpoints 2.5 and 4.5. Al, can you
   say more about what we can expect UAs to recognize w.r.t.
   system-captions?

e) We need to add to the Techniques document for
   the following checkpoints 2.9, 5.6, 9.3, 9.5,
   9.6, 9.7. Additional techniques are welcome as well.

f) Geoff Freed has made comments, without follow-up yet. Refer
   to responses from Ian:
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0477

g) Open action items.

CHANGES
=======

General

 * Added guidelines navigations mechanisms per [53]request from
   Gregory.
 * Checklist no longer sorted by groups, just priorities. 
   Also, added column for content, ua, or both.

Guidelines

 * Important edits to prose of Guideline 1 to make clearer why 
   these 2 checkpoints are important to device-independence 
   principle.

Checkpoints

 * 2.3, 2.9: Per [54]22 March teleconf, harmonized the relationship
   between these two checkpoints. Based on [55]proposal from Ian.
 * 2.7: Per [56]22 March teleconf, repair techniques in checkpoint
   are sufficient but not necessary. Important edits to Note after
   checkpoint to give a better sense of the goal of repair.
 * 4.13, 4.14, 4.15: Changes based on [57]22 March teleconf decision,
   but deviated from decision by incorporating CSS2 terms directly
   into checkpoints. Left informative reference to CSS2.
 * 9.8: Per [58]22 March teleconf decision, added alert requirement
   when search reaches end of content.
 * Old 11.3: Split into 11.3 and 11.4 (as part of improving input
   modality label defintions).

Conformance

Important changes based on [59]proposal from Ian adopted at 
22 March teleconference.

 * Implemented labels for content only, user agent only, or both.
   Labels appear after priority statement. See also new 
   subsection of 3.7 (validity of a claim) on these labels.
 * Rewrote conformance model (3.1)
 * Added example of determining set of requirements.
 * Added requirement to use content type labels in addition to
   information about supported formats.
 * Updated input modality requirements and descriptions.
 * Updated definition of valid claim based on "default" set of
   requirements.

Glossary

 * Added statement to definition of DOM about most requirements (but
   for repair) applying after construction of DOM.
 * Added definitions of normative/informative. Link to them from the
   document.
 * To definition of "auditory description", added "sometimes audio
   description" based on [60]commetnts from Geoff Freed.
