Hello,

As part of an action item to address issue 449 [0], I've published
a draft summary [1] of the UAAG 1.0 for your review. If you haven't
read Eric's version [2], please do so as well.

I have already integrated a summary (whether it's this
one or an edited version) as an appendix to the document. 
Like the checklists, the summary will be available from a 
link at the beginning of the document.

Your comments encouraged,

 - Ian
