1. Placeholders discussed in checkpoints for Guideline 3 should be added to 
the list of enabled element defintion

2. It seems the current priority 3 checkpoint 2.8 can be satisfied by the 
Priority 2 checkpoint 2.7, since 2.8 points back to the features of 2.7 as 
a solution.  I don't think this was the indention of 2.8.

a. 2.8 was originally only about images and I am not sure the general 
conditional content substitution works for this checkpoint with any known 
results.

b. Proposed new checkpoint 2.8:

<NEW>
2.8 Allow configuration so that when the author has intentionally provided
empty conditional content (alt="") for an image element, the user agent 
does not render the image (i.e. CSS display property of the image is set to 
"none").
[Priority 3]
