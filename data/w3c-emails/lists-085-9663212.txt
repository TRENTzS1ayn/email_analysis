Technique 1: Sequential Method
In the sequential method, every user interface event handler becomes a tab 
stop in the sequential movement of focus to elements, for example with the 
TAB key.  As each event handler is given focus the user is alerted to which 
event handler has been given focus.  The user could then activate the event 
handler, for example with the ENTER key.  An element that is a link and 
also has a onMouseOver and onMouseOut event handlers defined, would have 3 
tab stops: one for the link and two for the event handlers.

Technique 2: Query Method
In the query method, the user moves the focus to an enabled element and 
then the user can query the event handlers associated with element.  This 
could be done using the TAB key to move focus and a context sensitive menu 
with an event handler option could be used to provide a list of available 
event handlers (Shift-F10 in Windows).  Each enabled event handler would be 
available from the list.  An event handler could be executed by selecting 
from the menu, for example with the ENTER key.
