JRG: The original purpose of this checkpoint was to support WCAG 1.0 
requirement that when the ALT attribute is set explicitly to null (i.e. 
ALT=""), that nothing be rendered.  This is to try to minimize the number 
of empty image placeholders on a page.  I am concerned about having an open 
ended requirement to a checkpoint that was originally pretty narrow in 
scope and would be moved further away from the original intent with your 
proposed change.
