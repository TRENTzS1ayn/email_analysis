Hello,

One reviewer of the document has noted that the document is
not designed so that the checkpoints can be read entirely
out of context.

I think this is a very good observation. And it's true:
the requirements of some checkpoints "apply" to others,
the result of an attempt to reduce redundancy in the
checkpoints.

For instance, we don't start off each checkpoint by
saying "In a device-independent manner, allow the
user to configure ....". We say this once (in checkpoint 1.1)
and thereafter 1.1 "applies" to the other checkpoints.

I propose that we add a sentence or two to the beginning
of section 2 to explain this. This text might be appropriate
after the description of the structure of a guideline. Or it
might be appropriate after the description of the structure
of a checkpoint. In any case, here's the text:

<PROPOSED>
  Note: Many checkpoints in this document are "interdependent":
  they include requirements that have been "factored out" 
  of other checkpoints in order to reduce the size of the 
  document. For instance, checkpoint 1.1 requires that the 
  user agent be fully operable through the keyboard. 
  Consequently, checkpoint 4.1 does not need to
  state explicitly that all input device requirements of
  the checkpoint must be satisfied through the keyboard;
  it does not start "Allow global configuration and
  control through the keyboard..."

  As a result of this factorization, first-time 
  readers are likely to find the checkpoints easier to 
  understand in context than "on their own." For instance,
  guideline prose, guideline organization, checkpoint order, 
  checkpoint notes, and associated techniques all provide
  context for understanding the purpose and scope of
  each checkpoint. The checklist is expected to be a useful
  tool for people with some familiarity with the document 
  to evaluate user agents for conformance.
</PROPOSED>
