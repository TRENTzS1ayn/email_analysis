As I think about this issue, I wonder if it is fair to expect readers to
infer interdependencies based on reading order. It seems to me that our
approach has been to try to make important contextual information (e.g.,
qualifiers, caveats, etc.) explicit. I wonder if we need to identify which
checkpoints have these large cross-cutting functions and call them out in
the notes or otherwise. (It might even be noted that such checkpoints might
have been implemented instead as labels on other checkpoints, but for
didactic or other reasons, they were included as checkpoints.) I am not
suggesting any major revolution in the document, but rather consider
identifying those checkpoints that have this characteristic of acting like
an overlay on many other checkpoints. Is such feasible?

Seems reasonable. See notes below.

New:
First-time readers are likely to benefit from paying attention to
contextual
information such as guideline prose, guideline organization, checkpoint
order, checkpoint notes, and associated techniques. The checklist [??]
consisting of checkpoints themselves is expected to be a useful tool for
people with some familiarity with the document to evaluate user agent
conformance.
