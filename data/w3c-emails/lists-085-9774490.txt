Please read the 23 March draft [1] of the user agent accessibility 
guidelines before tomorrows meeting.  I would like to vote on returning the 
document to last call tomorrow.   To do this properly, everybody needs to:

1. READ the document!

2. Bring comments to list or meeting, at this point in the process comments 
should be editorial and for clarification

3. New issues raised will be deferred to the next version of the 
guidelines, a list for new issues has been created [2]
(please save new issues for after we go to last call or send them to the 
list and clearly mark them as a new issue for the next version of the 
guidelines)

4. Be prepared to state whether you think the document is ready for last 
call.
(If you will not be able to attend the meeting, send your statement to the 
list by Thursday afternoon.)

Jon
