I believe this shows implementability as long as we can also do this for
onmouseover and onclick.

No reference to your question, just a way of addressing the 216 unread
emails I am wading through.

1) I know you can get the left/top/width/height from MSAA as the
Location.  I'd assume you can also get this data from the DOM, but you'd
have to hunt around in the docs - I haven't found it yet, and our
resident expert is in Ireland for the next couple of weeks.  There may
be other ways to do this - for example, if you walk the DOM, we now
provide a QI to get to the associated MSAA node from the DOM node, and
vice versa.

2)  You can call the IHTMLDocument4::fireEvent method on an object in
the DOM.  You can look up the details at http://www.msdn.microsoft.com

So if I read this correctly, you could walk the DOM, QI it's MSAA node,
and then fire a mouseclick event against it.  Is this what you're
looking for?  I wonder why you'd need the boundingrect?  Seems easier to
walk the DOM, choose a node, and fire a mouseclick directly to it...

This question is for Tim Lacy:

For applications that embed the IE browser within them, is it possible
to:

First get the associated box in pixel coordinates for a DOM elemnent
(bounding rectangle in screen coordinates)?

Second two simulate the mouse event to perform a mouse click within that
rectangle?
