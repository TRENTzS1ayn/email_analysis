Should the Executive Summary be a formal part of the UAAG 1.0 document?
Certainly it will get better review if it is part of the document.
Furthermore, I think that it says some things better than the current
document does. I suggest making it part of the UAAG 1.0 for Last Call. If it
needs to be broken out again, that would be OK. But I suggest making it part
of what people review for last call.
