Hello,

In the 23 March draft [1], checkpoints 9.3, 9.5, and 9.6 are
about "device-independent activation of event-handlers". The
checkpoints state, for example, that the user agent must 
"allow the user to activate any explicitly associated event 
handler though keyboard alone". 

I am concerned that since the conformance model says, in effect,
that "you don't have to do things related to the pointing
device unless you claim conformance for the pointing device",
that the verbiage "any event handler" may not be strong enough.
I think we need to clarify that for checkpoints 9.3, 9.5, and
9.6 that we really do mean "any" event handler, even if the
user agent only conforms for the keyboard. These checkpoints
are "only for the keyboard" (in the default conformance scenario)
in that we only require activation through the keyboard.

Proposal:

1) (Based on Jon Gunderson comment) Move checkpoints 9.3, 9.5,
   and 9.6 to Guideline 1 since they are about device-independence.
   I hesitate to move them out of context since 9.1-9.7 make sense
   as a group. But moving three of seven seems ok to me.

2) Add the following Note to one or more of the checkpoints:

   Note: "Any event handler" includes handlers for input
   devices for which the user agent does not conform. For
   example, the user agent must allow the user to use
   the keyboard to activate an event handler for the pointing 
   device, even if the user agent does not conform for the 
   pointing device.

Comment:

 - I don't think this reasoning applies checkpoints that are
   not explicitly about device independence. For instance, 
   checkpoint 7.4 (follow operating environment conventions 
   to indicate the input configuration) does not, in my opinion,
   require the same type of clarification. The user agent only
   has to satisfy it for the keyboard when conforming only for
   the keyboard.
