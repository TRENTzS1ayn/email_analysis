In UAAG 1.0 we use "conform to" and "implement" carefully. In
general, our "conform to" checkpoints are P2 and our "implement"
checkpoints are P1.

I think that UAAG 1.0 is not going to be able to solve the general
problem of determining whether entity E conforms to spec S.

But yes, conformance is required.
