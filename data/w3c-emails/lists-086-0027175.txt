Al,

I think that developers will not want to leave a hole open for programmatic 
access to secure information.  They can provide a secure API, but I don't 
think this will work unless we have a spec available to show them now.  I 
don't think it is part of the current DOM requirements, but if it is then I 
with draw my suggestion.  I don't think we should require more information 
be provided through the API than what the user would get through the 
standard user interface.   You can always do more.
