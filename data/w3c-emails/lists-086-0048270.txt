The value of the password element is already exposed in DOM 0 (and
later), the asterixing is purely visual, it's often also misleading to
user/developers that it is in some way more secure than other form
elements, when it is not.  I think it would be more useful to expose the
value rather than the asterix's or blobs that are used now - it doesn't
introduce any new security holes, and the information is not secure.

For genuine secure information, that may be different, but do we have
any?

Jim.
