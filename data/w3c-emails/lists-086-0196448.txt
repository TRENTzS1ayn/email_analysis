Many of you on this list and others have expressed concerns about AOL,
NetScape and the future.  These concerns are quite valid, and we
appreciate
them.  However, as usual GW Micro is very much on top of things.  The
new
NetScape product called Gecko is much more friendly than NetScape has
ever
been before.  In fact, it is already reading like any MSAA
application.  Several of our employees are beta testing the next version
of
AOL which will include NetScape.  It is looking very, very good and
looks
like a great alternative for those who wish to use AOL.  AOL and GW
Micro
are both comitted to assuring compatibility between our products and are
working together to make this happen.  We will have more to say on this
later but rest assured that GW Micro the MSAA experts are watching out
for
your interests.
