Hello all,

At the 11 April 2002 teleconference [1], I took an action
regarding issue 521 [2] to identify checkpoints whose
requirements apply independent of formats that are part of the
conformance claim.

I propose that for the following checkpoints (reference UAAG 1.0
12 Sep 2001 draft [3]), the format requirements apply as follows:

   3.1 Toggle background images: Applies for all image formats.
   3.2 Toggle audio, video, animated images: Applies for
       all audio, video, and animated image formats.
   3.3 Toggle animated/blinking text: Applies to all formats.
   3.7 Toggle images. Applies to all image formats.
   4.9 Global volume control. Applies to all audio formats.

I tried to come up with a model that would allow me to choose
some checkpoints and not others, but I couldn't come up with
anything satisfying. One feature of the above checkpoints is that
I think it's possible to recognize images, audio, etc. by content
type, independent of format details.

Proposed changes to the specification:

  1) Indicate at the beginning of the section on conformance that
  a user agent doesn't have to satisfy the checkpoints for EVERY
  implemented format, only those that are part of the conformance
  claim with the following exceptions:

     - If the conformance claim includes the VisualText
       content type label, the user agent must satisfy
       3.3 for all formats.
     - If the conformance claim includes the Image content
       type label, the user agent must satisfy 3.1 and 3.7 for
       all image formats.
     - If the conformance claim includes one of the Audio, Video,
       or Animation  content type labels, the user agent must
       satisfy 3.2 for all audio, video, or animation formats,
       respectively.
     - If the conformance claim includes the Audio
       content type label, the user agent must satisfy
       4.9 for all sources of audio.

  3) Update the relevant content type label defintions with the
     same information.

Note: I thought that it might be useful to modify the checkpoints
themselves to say "for all image formats" etc. Upon
experimentation, I find that it makes the checkpoints unduly
complicated.
