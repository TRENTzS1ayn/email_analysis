At this weeks telecon we will be discussing checkpoints with less than 2 
independent implementations.

We have four options:
1. Remove the requirement altogether
2. Remove the requirement and transform the requirement into a suggested 
implementation note attached to another requirement
3. Make the requirement more general to allow a wider range of ways to 
satisfy the requirement (including some current implementations)
4. Maintain the requirement and ask the director to leave the requirement 
in the document as it advances, even though there is low implementation 
experience
