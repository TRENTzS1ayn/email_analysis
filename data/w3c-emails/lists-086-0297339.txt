Subject: Checkpoints with low implementation experience


At this weeks telecon we will be discussing checkpoints with less than 2

independent implementations.

We have four options:
1. Remove the requirement altogether
2. Remove the requirement and transform the requirement into a suggested

implementation note attached to another requirement
3. Make the requirement more general to allow a wider range of ways to 
satisfy the requirement (including some current implementations) 4.
Maintain the requirement and ask the director to leave the requirement 
in the document as it advances, even though there is low implementation 
experience


This is our current list of 21 checkpoints with low implementation
experience:

Priority 1 Checkpoints (Total 5)

No complete implementation experience
4.6 Position captions.
>> 3

One complete implementation
1.2 Activate event handlers.
>> 1
3.5 Toggle content refresh.
>> 2
4.4 Slow multimedia.
>> 3
10.1 Table orientation.
>> 1

Priority 2 Checkpoints (12 checkpoints)

No complete implementation experience
3.6 Toggle redirects.
>> 1
4.8 Control other multimedia.
>> 2
5.5 Confirm form submission.
>> 1 (I think this falls into the 'help avoid maliscious pages'
category, in which case we will always be playing catch-up)
5.6 Confirm fee links.
>> 1
10.5 Outline view.
>> 2

One complete implementation
4.7 Slow other multimedia.
>> 3
4.11 Control other volume.

>> 1
9.6 Show event handlers.

>> 4

One complete implementation
