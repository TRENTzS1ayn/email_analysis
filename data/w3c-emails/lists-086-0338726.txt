Surely for a UA to render content, it must know the content-type, I agree
that where you have "plug-ins" handling certain mime-types that it would
cause a burden on the UA hosting the plug-in, but there it should be down
the plug-in to provide the mechanisms to disable the blinking.

I agree, but I don't think this need prevent the actual existence of the
requirement, for example you can still provide a control which stops
animated gifs and videos in the page which wouldn't stop animation
introduced via css or scripting - but there are other mechanisms which can
stop those aswell.  Surely whilst you need to provide the mechanism it
doesn't need to be within one single switch.

Jim.
