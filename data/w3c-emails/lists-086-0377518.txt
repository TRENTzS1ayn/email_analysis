There is mixed reaction to these requirements.  Three people say keep and 
two people say drop and add as a note to another checkpoint.

PROPOSAL: I suggest we drop Checkpoint 3.6 and keep Checkpoint 3.5.  It 
seems that this is easy to implement and was identified as a major problem 
for screen reader users.  The requirements of checkpoint 3.6 could be a 
note on 3.5.
