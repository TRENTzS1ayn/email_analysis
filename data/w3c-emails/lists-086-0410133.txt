There is some sediment to drop "Checkpoint 5.5 Confirm form submission" 
requirement.

Proposal: I suggest we add it to the requirements listed under the repair 
label.  This is useful when there are automatic form submissions and that 
is really an accessibility authoring problem that this checkpoint is trying 
to repair.
