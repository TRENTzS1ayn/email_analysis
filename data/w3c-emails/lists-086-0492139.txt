Judy Plugged our document in her talk this morning so hopefully, we will
see some work since she asked for implementation.

I agree with Jon.

Checkpoint 10.5 Outline view.

I think that we should keep looking for implementation experience or
include user agents that offer user style sheets as a way to show
implementation for this requirement.  I think we could show that Opera
could do this and maybe even IE, although IE would be a several step
process to go from outline to standard view.

I suggest we keep this one and work harder at implementation experience.
