Control over playback speed gets some attention from Daisybook 
players.  I'll ask around and try to get a list of exactly who is doing it now.
As of this fall, we hope to have it integrated with the AMIS project (new 
Daisy player from JSRPD).
Control over speed of streaming media could be an issue that we will run 
into, depending on how the media player components (ex, windows media 
player, Java media framework) behave.
