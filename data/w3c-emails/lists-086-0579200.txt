Jon,

I like the idea of a repair checkpoint. I'm not sure I would
include 2.2 in that list, however. I think that this is a "last
resort" checkpoint and should remain a P1 checkpoint.

I haven't reviewed the other checkpoints in the document to see
whether there are other repairs that we require.

I hesitate to use the word "repair" to label the set, but I don't
have a counter-proposal right now. In the case of HTML event 
handlers, for example, it's not an authoring error to specify a 
mouse binding only. It is an error with respect to WCAG 1.0:

  9.3 For scripts, specify logical event handlers rather than
      device-dependent event handlers.

I think we should be able to show why each checkpoint is
a repair checkpoint.
