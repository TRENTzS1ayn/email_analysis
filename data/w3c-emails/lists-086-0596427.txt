Windows Media Player as an application doesn't support slowing of
streaming media.  However DirectAnimation which can also playback windows
media content can play it back slower * so hopefully for WMP at least it's
not too much of a technical issue.  DA is no longer "supported" by MS
though - You could currently build an interface to a WMP player that could
control speed - I've done one with audio.

(Apologies for the meeting, I am always unavailable then.)

* There may be a live problem actually, I _think_ I've seen it done with
live rather than just archive but I'm not completely positive.
