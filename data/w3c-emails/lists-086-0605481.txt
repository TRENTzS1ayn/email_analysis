Beware the slippery slope. All of the checkpoints in Guideline 5
are about making manual some automatic behavior. Indeed, that
is a *very important theme* of UAAG 1.0. We have lots of checkpoints
that amount to making some automatic behavior manual.

I do not recommend making 5.5 (or other checkpoints that
make automatic behavior manual) optional under the "repair"
label.

NOTE: If we pursue the "repair label" idea, there will not be
a perfect solution for which checkpoints are repair checkpoints
and which are not; we will simply end up choosing a set. The choice
will not be completely arbitrary, but will be subjective.
