Here are Daisy players that support time-scale modification:

         Hardware players:
                 PlexTalk by Plextor (http://www.plextalk.org/)
                 Victor Reader by VisuAide 
(http://www.visuaide.com/dtbsol.html)

         Software players:
                 Victor Soft reader by VisuAide 
(http://www.visuaide.com/dtbsol.html)
                 LpPlayer by Labyrinten 
(http://www.labyrinten.se/english/index.html)

         There will soon be a third addition in the hardware player 
category (Telex).

These are all solid consumer products that have been implemented 
internationally.

It might be worth noting that speed control is a feature of SMIL playback 
capabilities, as the DAISY format uses SMIL to represent synchronzed 
multimedia types.  Also, the above examples all use local media, not streamed.
