I suggest that we just put the checkpoints 1.2, 9.5 and 9.6 in a special 
group and call it something like:

1. "Events": seems too general to me, but it is simple and doesn't use the 
word "repair"
2. "Pointer Events": more specific, but checkpoints 9.5 and 9.6 are more 
than just pointer events
3. "Mouse Events": sounds very device specific
4. "User interface events": a little more descriptive of the types of 
events we are interested in

We should leave the labels of other checkpoints alone and not try to make 
major changes with the labeling.
