This is a good opportunity to remind everyone that
the approach taken by UAAG 1.0 is that combinations
of software can conform. The conformance claim indicates
what pieces work together to satisfy the various requirements.

So the combinations you cite do help us in our effort to
show implementability.

We welcome additional reports of how products working
together satisfy the checkpoints.

Thank you,
