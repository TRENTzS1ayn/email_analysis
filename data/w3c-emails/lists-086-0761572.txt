==========
Discussion
==========

1. Proposal for checkpoints should be "all formats" versus
"formats that are part of the claim".

Resolved: Accept IJ's proposal:
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2002AprJun/0114

2. What to do with checkpoints with low implementation
experience?

See JG proposal:
  http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2002/06/checkpoint-overview

JG: Question of how to handle 19 checkpoints with low
implementation experience.

2a) Checkpoints 1.2, 9.5, 9.6 (related to events).

RS: Please clear this proposal with the Director before
     returning to last call.

Resolved:
    - Accept proposal to make these optional.
    - Use "Events" label
    - For any checkpoint where we have less than 2
      implementations when going to last call, indicate
      in the status section.

ACTION IJ: Ask the Director whether this type of approach is
reasonable.

2b) Checkpoint 4.4. Keep this and update the implementation
     report.

HB: Daisy speed-up/down only addresses audio portion; not
synchronized.

MD: Enounce slows down video in WMP and RealPlayer synchronized
audio/video (which formats?)  This fall we should have something
for Daisy and video.

Resolved: Keep 4.4 unchanged.

2c) Checkpoints 5.3, 5.7.

JA: I've seen some javascript code that closes pop-up windows.
E.g., when you click "submit" a window is closed automatically.
Are there examples that motivate this checkpoint?

IJ: Gregory has sent examples in the past.

/* Teleconference interrupted for 10 minutes due to
    bridge problems */

JG: Seems like low-hanging fruit.

Resolved:
  - Keep 5.3
  - Move 5.7 as a note to 5.3.

2d) Checkpoint 3.5

JG: Jim Ley reports that Snuffin implements this requirement.
This is a problem for screen readers, that reset to the beginning
of the page when page is refreshed.

IJ: Opera has an option to let you reload a page every X minutes.
I don't know what impact it has on pages that reload
automatically.

AL: This is in our planning document, but not a short-term plan.
Should not be a problem to implement.

JA: I tested this in Opera. If you unclick "enable", Opera
doesn't get the page. But even if Opera set for 1-minute,
on a 2-second refresh page, Opera still respected author's
specified rate.

Resolved:
  - Drop the alert requirement.
  - Keep the requirement for configuration to not update
    automatically.

Action IJ: Follow up with Opera to see if there can be an option
to never refresh (and overrides author's specified rate).

2e) Checkpoint 10.5.

JG: Amaya offers this functionality. This can also be done with
user style sheets. This is weak implementation experience, but
works in many user agents that support CSS style sheets. Opera,
IE, Konqueror, support user style sheets.

IJ: Mozilla has a predefined location (I think). Also, Acrobat
Reader 5 does this for PDF (that's marked up correctly).

IJ: Note that what's required to do an outline view in CSS
is supported widely across browsers.

Resolved: Keep 10.5, 9.10 (configuration through style sheets).
Action JG: Update implementation report.

2f) 11.2 Current author bindings

JG: We have only one implementation (Jaws) but there is
consensus to keep this one.

Resolved: Keep 11.2

2g) 2.11 Alert unsupported language

JG: We don't have implementation experience for this.
This could be done in style sheets.

IJ: Recall goal of this checkpoint - reduce the amount of
garbage a screen reader has to wade through before the
user hears something useful.

JA: In RealPlayer, if a stream is available in several
languages, you can choose from among available streams.

JG: What does HPR do when it encounters a language it doesn't
know?

JA: I think it tries do use the default rendering. If you have
'auto-detect' on, HPR will switch languages dynamically.w3

Action JA: Test HPR and report to the list.

Resolved: Keep 2.11 even though we don't have implementation
experience for this.

2h) Resolved to make the following checkpoints informative
notes in the related checkpoints 2.10 4.8, 4.7, 4.11.

==========
Open actions
==========

JG: Write up user scenarios for why non-text-based highlighting
important for users; notably which users.
