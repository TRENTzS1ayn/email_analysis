Hi,

After testing the enounce trial plugins for RealPlayer and WindowsMedia, 
here is what I have found:

1) MPG file.  Audio and Video.  Local file.

Windows Media Player v8, with enounce 2xav plugin:
         very good synchronization, from 1/3 speed to 2.5x speed

RealOne Player
         poor synchronization, although present.
         For slower playback (up to 1/3 speed), the audio speed is adjusted 
appropriately.  Video plays at normal speed and then pauses, to      wait 
for audio to catch up.
         For faster playback (up to 2.5 speed), the audio speed is adjusted 
appropriately and the video is played faster.  Synchronization is    better 
here than for slowed playback but it sometimes does not match exactly, 
especially if you adjust the playback rate several        times during 
playback.

2) MP3 file.  Audio only.  Local file.
         from 1/3 speed to 2.5x speed.  Good performance from WMP8 and RealOne.

3) WMV file.  Audio and Video.  Local file.
         WMP8
                 speed up is good.  slow down shows video frame at a time 
(and skips a lot of frames), but it is more like a slideshow with 
an           audio track.
         RealOne: no support in realplayer for this type of file

4) AVI file.  Audio and Video.  Local file.
         WMP8
                 speed up is pretty good.  slow down pauses periodically, 
but is better than WMV performance.

         RealOne: no support.

5) RAM.  Audio and Video.  Streaming.
         RealOne:
                 Very good synchronization (1/3x to 2.5x).


as for Windows Media streaming, I consistently had problems with ASX files, 
which seems to be the most common format for streaming
media clips for WMP.  I think this is my problem and is unrelated to the 
enounce plugin.  Anyway, I was unable to test streaming time scale 
modifications under WMP8.

Any other questions, let me know soon - the software trial period is only 7 
days (starting today).
