I just want to thank everyone who was on the call today, decisions are a 
lot easier when we have good attendance on the call and people are prepared 
to discuss the issues.  We only have a few more items to resolve, please 
look at remaining checkpoints with low implementation experience [1] that 
we have not discussed and send your comments to the list.
