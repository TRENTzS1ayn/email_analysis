With automatic language detection, HPR first respects lang attributes based
on its list of supported languages. HPR does not alert the user when an
unsupported lang attribute is encountered, it just reads the page in the
HPR installed  language.  If no lang attributes exist for an element on a
web page, HPR determines which language  is the closest match to one of its
supported languages.  Spanish and German are  supported along with Finnish,
English, Italian, French, and Brazilian Portuguese.

Jim, HPR assumes all ViaVoice language engines are installed for all
supported languages. It does not detect when a language engine is removed.
Since ViaVoice is not reading the page, this looks like an error condition
HPR should handle. We thought ViaVoice would just ignore the language
switch if an engine was not there and read in the last language in which it
spoke, but I guess we missed fully checking this out. We'll look into this.
A better test would be to go to pages that are in languages that are not
considered supported HPR languages, like Swedish or Norwegian.

Also, everytime a new page is loaded, HPR resets the current language back
to the default language. So you should always set the default language to
automatic language detection or the language you usually want to hear. Then
just change the current language if you want to hear something read on the
current page in a different language.

Subject:    Action JA: Test HPR and report to the list.




Task from UAWG teleconference, 6 Jun 2002

Test HPR behavior for alerting user about unsupported language.
Application: HPR 3.0 with Spanish Synthesizer removed

Test 1
set default language to 'auto-detect'
set current language to 'auto-detect'
went to an English page
HPR read the page in English
went to a Spanish language page
HPR spoke the title of the page in English, but would speak nothing else on
the page.
it provided no indication that the language was not supported.

Test 2
set default language to 'German'
set current language to 'auto-detect'
went to an English page
HPR read the page in German
hit CTRL-O to reset language to 'auto-detect'
HPR now reads page in English
Went to Spanish page
HPR reads page in German
hit CTRL-O to reset language to 'auto-detect'
HPR read the title in German, but does not read anything else on page.
it provided no indication that the language was not supported.
