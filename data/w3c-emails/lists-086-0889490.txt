4.3.3. For a prerecorded audio track including audio-only presentations, 
provide at least one setting between 75% and 80% of
the original speed.

Labrinten LpPlayer working with a DAISY 2.0 book includes SMIL and HTML 
synchronization of narration with text. It allows
speed 75% of original. Also up to 300% speedup in increments of +25%, i.e. 
75%, 100%, 125%, 150%, ...300%.

Note that speedup change is desirable, particularly for linear reading.
