Hello all,

At today's teleconference [1], we talked about support
for THEAD in HTML user agents. The context: Do user agents
support the rendering where THEAD rows are fixed on the screen
while other data cells are scrolled by.

To test this, I have published a test table [2] that uses
THEAD for the first row (the one starting "Rows").

My results in my Linux environment are that no user agent
I have supports this, including:

   Lynx 2.8.4rel.1 [Text browser]
   w3m 0.3         [Text browser that supports tables somewhat]
   Mozilla 0.9.9
   Netscape  7.0 Preview release 1
   Amaya 5.3 (18 Dec 2001)
   Opera 6.0 Preview 6
   Konqueror 2.2.2 (KDE 2.2.2)
   Dillo 0.6.4

Untested:

   Galeon (Not working on my machine since I installed Netscape 7)
   Skipstone (I just installed to test this one, but it crashes).

Perhaps I missed some UA configurations that would cause
these user agents to keep THEAD frozen in place, but I didn't
find any settings.

I also tried using 'position:fixed' on the THEAD element
for user agents that support CSS fixed positioning. However,
since fixed positioning pulls an element out of the flow,
the result (at least on Opera) is that the THEAD row is
not formatted the same as the other (TBODY) rows. So while
the THEAD row remains fixed on the screen, the cells in
the other rows don't line up with it, so this approach is
not helpful.
