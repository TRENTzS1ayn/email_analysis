I think your expectation is wrong.  "11.2.3 Row groups: the THEAD,
TFOOT, and TBODY elements" of HTML 4 says as follows [3]:

    Table rows may be grouped into a table head, table foot, and one
    or more table body sections, using the THEAD, TFOOT and TBODY
    elements, respectively. This division enables user agents to
    support scrolling of table bodies independently of the table head
    and foot.

Note that this division *enables* user agents to support scrolling.
It doesn't mean TBODY must always be scrollable when THEAD is present.
HTML markup specifies table head - body - foot structure, and that's
it.  If you want specific presentation, use style sheets.  Your test
file doesn't attach any style sheets, so it seems quite natural to
me that user agents don't make tables scrollable.

What you want is to make TBODY scrollable, isn't it?  Then don't
try to do something for THEAD.  Something like

  TBODY { height: 10em; overflow: auto; }

would enable user agents to make TBODY scrollable when the height
of the table body is more than 10em, for example.  It should at least
work with Gecko-based user agents.
