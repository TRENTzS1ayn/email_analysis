Massyasu,
We know that scrollable TBODY it is not required by the HTML 4.01 
specification, we are just testing to see if anyone has implemented this 
feature, since it is useful to people with disabilities.
We are doing this test to help in the clarification of the requirements for 
Checkpoint 10.1.  It will probably not be a requirement of UAAG 1.0 since 
there is no implementation experience, but be included in a note stating 
that it is a useful feature to implement.

Jon
