This is specified in the maximum literal length field in the SGML declaration,
LITLEN, which in HTML 2.0 was 72 characters. There was also a limit on the
maximum number of characters in a start tag (ATTSPLEN) of 2100 characters.
These limits have both been increased to 64K in HTML 3.2, basically putting
the responsibility for limits on the UA.
