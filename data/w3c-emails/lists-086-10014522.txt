Hello all,

I've been workin in the HTTP 1.1 accesibility issues, and I must admit that I'm
a little bit lost on the way to approach requirements.                 

My very first ideas come later, and I'd appreciate comments (maybe I got it al
wrong...).



From my point of view, our goal is to provide dalternate media types for people
who cannot deal with a determined type (e.g blind people and images)

As long as alternate media types are selected using the HTML file, we have
three different approaches in the way we select them. 
1.The alternate media type may be included in the HTML file (e. g. ALT tag to
describe image contents)
2.The alternate media type is in the file referenced an HTML HREF tag (e.g D
tag to describe graphic images).
3.The alternate media type may be embedded in the file referenced by the HTML
file using the IMG SRC tag, (e.g. text description in gif 89 files or video
captioning in QuickTime video),

If the alternate media is in thew HTML file, theres no way to tell HTTP what to
choose.

If it is in a different file, maybe HTTP could be used to select the file that
fullfills user's needs.

If the thrid case, where alternate media is included in the file, the whole
file must be transmitted through the net, so again theres's no use in using
HTTP to select media type.

Is this correct?

Thanks in advance,
