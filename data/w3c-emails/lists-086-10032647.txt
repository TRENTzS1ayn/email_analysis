That might be were we need HTTP extension: to request part of the
file, like "just the comment/title in an image file".

HTTP already has a HEAD request, different from regular GET, which is
used in HTML to return the <HEAD>..</HEAD> part, and HEAD could be
used with image/* as well to mean just the "header" part of the image,
not the bits.
