I wonder how this differs from the HEAD request, which returns the
<TITLE> as part of <HEAD>.

I'm with you, but on a purely OO basis, it's good to have the
description of the data (here an image) stored with the image, and
retrieved from the same source. Maybe this is all too theorical and
ALT and ALTSRC is all we need.

My personal opinion, and I'm sure you understand it very well: I think
this is even more dangerous than the other proposal: the whole idea of
SGML is to have one version of the markup and different presentation. 

If we start "advocating" different version of the sources, we're in
for trouble, but I got your argument about what is needed today to
facilitate browsing.

Some kind of new text/html-text-only mime-type is one way to approach
the problem.

Another way to implement text/only I've heard before is the use of
LINK with some REL=text-only keyword, so that once the regular HEAD is
fetched, the user-agent can automatically finds the text-only version.
