When we discussed this at the teleconference yesterday, I
pointed out that this behavior was not required by user agents.
It would be possible, even without style sheets, for a user agent
to offer a configuration to exhibit such behavior. I have not
found this option in any browser I've tested. Nor did I find
scrolling as the default behavior (which was my expectation).

Will do. Thank you for the input Masayasu!

The results for Masayasu's technique (now part of the test file):

  Mozilla (Gecko engine): Yes (both THEAD, TFOOT since set on TBODY).
                          This implies (though not tested) that
                          Galeon and Netscape 7 should work as well.
  Konqueror 2.2.2: No.
  Amaya: No.
  Opera 6.0: No.
