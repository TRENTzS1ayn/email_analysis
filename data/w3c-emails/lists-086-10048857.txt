So far, it is scheduled to be the 5th only, and focused on Guidelines
but I get more and more convinced that we need to spend time
face-to-face talking about the technical items on the task list.

I'm proposing to have a afternoon of discussion Monday the 4th in the
afternoon, at the same location or near (that is Boston/Cambridge
Mass). 

Any strong objection ?
