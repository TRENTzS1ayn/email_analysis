I am somewhat ignorant of image file formats. Do those formats which are
in use today allow for a header, containing a descriptive title, to
precede the graphical data? I remember having read that W3C was working on
the development of image formats, so this issue could be raised in that
context. Now as is pointed out in RFC1866, it is expected that the client
will retrieve an image file referenced by an img element automatically,
without user intervention. This could easily be extended to an HTTP
request for the header containing the description. Furthermore, the
header could include, among others, the following two components: (1) a
title for the image; (2) an optional long description of the image.

The same scheme could also be applied to audio resources.

A fully concur with Daniel's misgivings regarding "text only" pages: there
should only be a single HTML document, which contains all of the necessary
semantic content in a form that is independent of presentation. In the WAI
briefing package, it was said that there is a need for web page
simplification, namely, techniques for reducing the complexity of web
pages. Although this could be accomplished by the server in response to an
HTTP request (assuming the necessary extensions to HTTP), it would be
better, I think, to conduct any needed transformations on the client side
by means of style sheets.
