You're on the right track, Gregg.  It's not that complicated
if you step back and see the rule as a smoothness metric on
the web, and not a function of the image in isolation.

The criterion for effective ALT text selection is simple:

Ensure the continuity and maximize the smoothness of flow within
the web of story lines which results when all images are replaced
by their ALT strings.

It only seems complicated if you assume that there should be a
context-free, local rule.

A more local rule that comes close to being sufficient for the
satisfaction of the global rule is to say that the ALT text
should perform the same function in connecting the story-line
that the image performs.  "Decorations" are images that don't
play any role in connecting the story line.  The functional
equivalent there is ALT="".

You have to look at the image in context, and ask "what is
the contribution of this image to this story?" to know what
the ALT string should say.
