Recently I have found time to read some sections of the HTML 4.0 draft,
now that it is publicly available. I have noticed that the suggestion for
an ACRONYM element has been included, and that abbreviations are to be
handled by client-side dictionaries. It is suggested that link elements in
the document's head could provide references to dictionaries for
specialised vocabularies. However, in the discussion of link types, no
type value is given for abbreviation dictionaries. One solution might be:
<link rel="abbreviation" href="dictionary.html">
where "dictionary.html" is an HTML document in which each abbreviation and
its expansion is given in a definition list.
