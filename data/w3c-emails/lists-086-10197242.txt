PNG has the ability to capture image descriptions as part of the image file.

But this only works for this graphic format.  We need to create rules that will work for all the formats that are placed in HTML pages.

A browser COULD though, detect if there is a description in a graphic and automatically treat this as if a DESC=  link were in the <image>  - and if requested it would pull it out of the picture rather than asking the server for it.
