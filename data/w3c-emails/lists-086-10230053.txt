He is, HEAD is just for HTTP header less the body. I was told this
morning by one of our HTTP guru that these headers should in theory
include "metadata" information for things that are found under <META>
HTTP-EQUIV in the HTML doc, but that this is not implemented (and
things like TITLE or DESC and just not here).

Indeed, this part of HTTP could be clarified and extended and Javier
is on the hook to produce a requirement document for that, that we
will submit to the W3C HTTP working group.

This is assuming that the client knows more about the document format
that the server. For HTML, this is true, but for image format, this is
probably not true. In fact, the client might not even know which
format is going to be returned (it can give preferences: PNG first,
then GIF and the server decides).
