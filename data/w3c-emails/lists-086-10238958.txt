I think this is a reasonnable request and I'm forwarding it to the
HTML working group (who still has open issues from us on the media
type extension and the cascading style/alternate rule).

I'll take the opportunity of this message to say that this HTML 4.0
public release is not a W3C "recommendation" yet (not even "proposed
recommendation"), it is just the announce of the availibility of the
public draft, and more importantly, of the version number (so that
companies can start claiming conformance with 4.0...)

This means we're still on hook for giving input to the HTML WG.
