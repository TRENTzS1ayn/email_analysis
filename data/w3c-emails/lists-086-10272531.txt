ALT="" is really telling something about the image: that it is
pure decoration, but that the user-agent is still free to try to guess
what it is (using some HTTP metadata, the filename, etc).


Another convention I remember coming across regarding null ALT was an
optimization of the above where the convention could be stated at the
beginning of the HTML, in some kind of (I'm making that syntax up)
 <META name=ALT-CONVENTION content=NONE-MEANS-DECO>

and the rest of the file would not have an ALT attribute where ALT=""
would be used otherwise.
