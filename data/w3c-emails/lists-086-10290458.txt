One might think that you could do this using CSS1 fragments in
the document <HEAD>.  This violates the notion that CSS just
adjusts frills and doesn't change content.  The scenario you have
raised here is a good example in which to test the idea that some
pervasive generation-by-rule [or other abstraction] capability is
required throughout, independent of what one considers to be
"content" vs. "style."
