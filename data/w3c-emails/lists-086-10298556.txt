Yes, we need to keep track of who has to do it because it affects
who we have to deal with to get it to happen.

On the other hand, as we look at the meeting agenda, we do need
to realize that we can't decide browser guidelines in isolation
or author guidelines, either.  The author and browser guidelines
fall out of choices between solution strategies.

Each solution strategy is a scenario that takes a class of
end-to-end transactions (e.g. get text description of image) and
breaks it down into a connected thread of agent-action and
media-content capabilities.

When we make decisions, we decide between threads, each of which
bundles media and agent features.

As we follow up with the media and agent people, we have to keep
track of which requests went with which solution threads, because
if a feature in HTML changes the guidelines may have to
accomodate the change in some way, and vice versa.
