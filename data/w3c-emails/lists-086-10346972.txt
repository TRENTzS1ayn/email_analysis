Mike, George:

Have you heard enough to draft a response to your action item?
It seems to me, considering the low level of detail we are
discussing at this point, we may be ready to shift to "commenting
on draft" mode.

I hear by the grapevine that David Poelman might be willing to 
help, too.

Gregg:

How can we best keep Uaccess-l in the loop as we go forward from
here?
