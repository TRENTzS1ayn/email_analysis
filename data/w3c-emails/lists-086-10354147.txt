Just to clarify this proposal, I would emphasize the importance of not
only specifying what the link type should be, but also prescribing the
format of the dictionary file itself. Unnecessary compatibility problems
would arise if different software developers were allowed to decide upon
their own dictionary file formats. Hence, a single standard for the
dictionary file should be provided right from the outset.

As already indicated, my initial suggestion (and this is of course open to
debate if necessary) is that the dictionary file be an HTML document, in
the body of which there is a definition list with one entry for each
abbreviation.
