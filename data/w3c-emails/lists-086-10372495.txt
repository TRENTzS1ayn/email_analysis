Q1:  May we say we are done with the ACSS action item?

Q2:  Has Chris or anyone from the Styles area looked over
my comments on the ACSS draft itself, and do they feel we have
answered their request for an accessibility review of the
draft?

Discussion:

I think I want to claim success on the part about giving feedback
to the Styles team, and failure on the part about doing examples,
and say it's done.

I can see benefit to WAI if someone were to do a demonstration
project of bimodal documents using ACSS and print- or screen-
alternative styles.

Another valuable experiment would be a third-party restyling
demonstration that would take a page with print- or screen-
effects and, without author cooperation, analyze them and
allocate ACSS effects to the document using the visual styling as
a base of departure.  Note that the original document doesn't
need to use CSS to make the latter function doable.  One could
key the audio effects to _de facto_ classes based on contexts and
visual effects as much as to classes named CLASS=foo.  

I don't volunteer to do either of these.  I would be interested
to try to help with the second demo described above, but I don't
think I should lead it.  If someone can find volunteers from the
industries that originate Web content who are willing to work on
either of these demonstrations, the WAI would benefit from the
concrete experience.
