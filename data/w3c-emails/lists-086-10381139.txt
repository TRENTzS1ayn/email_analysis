I'll leave it for others to answer the two questions above, but comment on the
  rest of the points:

The examples exist --and more than as examples--
The ACSS implementation in Emacspeak is something I use everyday
on the Wild Wild Web.

Note: there is a tendency within the WAI group to think of ACSS
as a piece of "access technology" --this is not how I think of it--
ACSS is "Aural Cascading Style Sheets" and is an access enabler.
In this sense, print and Braille belong within the realm of general CSS and
  not ACSS

The above is exactly how I use emacspeak and the ACSS implementation --100% of
  the WWW is designed for 
visual interaction and there are *no* pages that use ACSS today-- however
emacspeak does produce well-formatted audio  documents today.

The above as I say is obvious and done.
The reason I wrote the ACSS specification to be independent of visual
styles was with an eye to the future -- ie aural renderings should not be
  bound to the visual rendering
however as evinced by emacspeak, this does not preclude one from
having a personal aural style sheet that maps today's tags to a set of
  well-defined aural properties.
