Hello all,

I'm going on holiday and I won't be at the meeting on august 5th (I expect to
be in the one after that). I send you an HTML file with all I've been able to
come up with. I hope it is worth it and leads to good conclusions after debate.
I'll be ready again after vacation (in mid august).

Have a nice meeting!

Regards
