Have any style properties been proposed for CSS that would permit the
construction of outlines and numbered paragraphs? This possibility was
alluded to in the HTML 4.0 draft, and I would like to know what is the
current status of such work. I think that the braille CSS specification
should provide for the inclusion of outlines and paragraph numbers in
documents. Hence, this issue is relevant in the preparation of the
BrailleCSS requirements document.
