Note that if we use a LINK as in

<LINK REL="AbrevDict" CONTENT="dictio.html">

There is always the possibility, as when used with Style sheet, to
indicate the type:

<LINK REL="AbrevDict" CONTENT="dictio.xml" TYPE="text/xml">

I think this is as far as we can go in this context, and trying to
define a file format for abbreviation dictionary should be a separate
effort.
