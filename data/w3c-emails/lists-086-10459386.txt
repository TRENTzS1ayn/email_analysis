In answer to Al and Gregg:

Yes. Although we have an unusual number of subscribers for the mailing
list (more than 50).

I agree it would be good to get their input. 

I don't really like cross-posting as you can never be certain of the
real follow-ups.

The real question is: what is the charter of each list and is there a
large overlap ?

I think our charter is to focus on the Web formats and protocols, and
the associated guidelines. 

If there are some key people on the other lists - that some of you
know - and they want to be part of our discussions, tell them to send
me email on how to subscribe, etc.

Later on, I expect the IPO to broaden our scope (to education and
tools in particular) but it will also broaden its audience and create
new forum.
