On the one hand, I have to agree with Daniel that the issue of
formats for a public dictionary interface should be worked out
for dictionaries in general, and not be done in a peculiar
fashion for the disability community.

On the other hand, the universal design approach suggests that we
recognize Braille users as a language minority, and because
language minorities have an interest in circulating dictionaries
separate from applications, that we recognize that our client
community has an interest in the success of a public dictionary
interface that is fully integrated with the application of HTML
and styles.
