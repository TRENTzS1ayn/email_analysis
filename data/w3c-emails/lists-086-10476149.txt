Recommendation: I think the most practical way for the many
different mailing lists with overlapping interests to interact is
through the WWW.  This was a possibility I raised with someone
who participates in uaccess-l.  If they discuss something, and
come to a conclusion that might affect our work, they should
decant the conclusion into a document posted to the web and let
us know about it.
