HPR as a visual browser embeds the IE web browser control, so however IE
handles THEAD visually will be how HPR does as well, I believe. I didn't
look to me like IE keeps THEAD frozen in place.

As an audio browser, however, HPR does the following related to THEAD,
TFOOT,  and scope and header attributes:

- For TFOOT, HPR reads the bottom row (TFOOT) first in item reading mode
before reading the THEAD and the rows following that. This is probably
because IE is putting TFOOT before the other table rows in the DOM. HPR
does nothing special with THEAD.
- HPR reads both header and scope attributes for tables with 3 or more rows
or columns when reading across rows or up and down columns in table
navigation mode when the read row and column header settings are checked in
Miscellaneous settings. Header and acope attributes are not read in item
reading mode or any other reading mode.
- HPR does not support the abbr attribute.
- HPR reads table summary attributes when the user requests "Where am I"
information using Alt + F1.
- HPR reads CAPTION tags when encountered in item and most other reading
modes.
