I have put a draft guideline dealing with ALT and description issues
in 

http://www.access.digex.net/%7Easgilman/web-access/ALT_and_Description_Guideline.html

This presumes only current technology; no changes in standards at all.

There are some new issues introduced, e.g. sensitive maps and site indices.
