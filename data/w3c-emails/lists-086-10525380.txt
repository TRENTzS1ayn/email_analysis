Well, even having it in the "related material" section is progress --I dont
think it was there until the latest version.

I have no preferences as to where it gets listed so long as the draft actually
tells people that an actual implementation exists.

And merely listing a URL in the "references" section clearly
isn't succeeding in doing that.
