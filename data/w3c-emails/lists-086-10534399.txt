I agree that the HTML specification is not a suitable location for
describing the preferred dictionary file format and that the issue should
be treated separately. Would it be best to develop an "abbreviation
dictionary" specification specifically for this purpose, as a separate
document, which could perhaps be included on one of the W3C pages that
deals with markup?

I would still maintain the importance of defining the dictionary file
format, and of doing so before the concept of an abbreviation dictionary
is widely implemented so that there is little opportunity for divergent
standards and incompatibilities to arise.

Abbreviation dictionaries are likely to be relatively small, and require
only two fields per entry: one for the abbreviation and the other for its
expansion. Thus, the file format would be relatively simple, and I would
suggest using an HTML document for several reasons. Firstly, it can easily
be created using any HTML authoring tool or text editor. Secondly, the
markup for language identification and the full ISO 10646 character set
would be available, as is necessary in a truly international context.
Thirdly, HTML provides a simple mechanism, namely the definition list,
whereby abbreviations and their expanded forms can be listed.
