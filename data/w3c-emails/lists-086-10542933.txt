I am also subscribed to the uaccess-l list, and have noticed that Daniel's
message in response to the ALT content issue did not appear in that forum
at all, even though uaccess-l was included on the "cc" line. Presumably
uaccess-l only accepts submissions from subscribers, and this is one
reason why cross-posting often fails.

If I raise questions on other mailing lists and mention that they arise
from my participation in the WAI process, then I am likely to receive
inquiries and requests for further information, perhaps even from
potential participants. What would be the best approach in such
circumstances? Would it be best to advise people to contact Daniel
Dardailler for further information, or give them the URL for the WG list
archives, or take some other action? Perhaps there should be a web page
for potential participants which would provide an indication of the scope
and nature of the WAI working group, and give appropriate advice as to how
to become involved.
