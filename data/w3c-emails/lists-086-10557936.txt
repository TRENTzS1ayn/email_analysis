By outlining in this context, I mean the ability to generate automatically
the numbers and letters which identify items in multiple-level outlines.
The user should be able to specify the type of numbering format that would
be associated with each hierarchical level in, for example, a nested
series of ordered lists. An example of this functionality is to be found
in Word-Perfect, which allows the user to specify the numbering style for
each outline level: (arabic numbers, Roman numerals, uppercase or
lowercase letters, decimals such as 1.1, 1.2, 1.1.1, 1.1.2, etc.). Given
the limited length of the braille line, it would be helpful if such
formatting techniques were available in CSS, since they could then be used
instead of relying only upon indentation to distinguish different levels
in the hierarchy.
