Colin Koteles and I have been doing some work related on test suites for 
UAAG 1.0.  I have posted a draft section of the test suite for Checkpoint 
1.1 requirements of UAAG for HTML 4.01[1].

Please send comments and questions to the list.  We will discuss the test 
suites on Thursday.

The availability of test suites will make it much easier for developers to 
understand accessibility issues and help hem verify

Jon
