I have the opposite reaction: I prefer #2 (ALTSRC attrib) over #1
(D-LINK markup) because is it less invasive for non-disabled persons.

The most important thing IMHO is get the LongDesc link into the HTML
source. Anything that might slow down acceptation of this feature by
Web authors should be avoided and having little D appearing all over
the pages is not going to help us.

How is it exploited by the client side is less important once the data
is there and the lack of UI consistency can be reduced using Browser
guidelines. In any case I think this is where competition might be
useful and healthy.
