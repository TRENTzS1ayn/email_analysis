It could. I don't know exactly how W3C expect to deal with the
proliferation of new XML DTD or DTD-like proposals in the future.

It is important, but it's hard to prioritize it against others, like,
say, micropayment information format, or chemical molecule
representation.

True, but one could argue that it is a perfect application for XML,
where you could define a more semantically richer set of tags, using a
small DTD with things like <ABBREV> and <EXPAN>.

Anyway, I'll bring it up in the HTML forum.
