I think the need for subjective or critical comments is real but it
goes beyond images and WAI: it is about what W3C calls "Collaboration"
(I'm not sure what is the status of this effort right now, you can
check http://www.w3.org/Collaboration if you're interested) whereas
one should be able to annotate sections, images, entire documents on
the web, so that people can access to the comments when they read the
original document (with all the grouping, authorization, etc
necessary).
