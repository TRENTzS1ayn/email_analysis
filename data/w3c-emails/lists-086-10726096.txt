Now you've confused me. Why would HTTP be extended here since the
model is as follow:

  - the server sends *one* HTML document with multiple pointer
    to various SS in it, categorized by media target (see example in 
    http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-html40-970708/present/styles.html#adef-media)
  - the user-agent decides which one it wants, and fetch it.

In which circumstances would the user-agent need to negociate further
with the server (e.g. send it a preference list).

Yep.
