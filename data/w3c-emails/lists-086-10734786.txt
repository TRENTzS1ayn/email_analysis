Probably just my confusion.  I was thinking there was a scenario
which would work like the server-side decision to send .gif or
.jpg.

I wonder if the single-HTML-document scenario isn't a little
over-confident.  There is a possible scenario where adaptations
are done in a page generator engine at the server based on
capabilities sent from the client.  This approach has more
ultimate capability, that is it can be taken further if you push
it, than what one can do with styles.  I might not want to rule
it out.  My preferred strategy is to work the flexible
presentation problem in a way that treats the WWW as a black box,
i.e. don't assume what is client vs. server functionality.  Then
make sure we have enough communication capability (and
cooperation rules) so that a range of solutions are supported.

On the other hand, I think that the characterization of media
targets is more important, and is _our_ problem, not _their_
problem.  Somehow, we need to come up with a way to wean server
operators off the use of the User Agent string to discriminate
service decisions.  And the right short list of media targets
could really help.
