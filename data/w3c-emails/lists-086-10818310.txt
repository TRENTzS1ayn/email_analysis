I don't think I am arguing against #2.  It seems to be a reasonable
approach to solving the general way to get alternative descriptions.   

I have 2 concerns:
1. #1 can be done now and can work with any browser

2. #2 could easily become an invisible accessibility feature if know one
knows the information is there, since standard browser rendering would not
include the ALTREF information.  Most people with disabilities will also
only know the ALTREF information is there if their non-disabled peers know
it's there, since most don't have access to people with specialized
disability access knowledge.  Non-disabled peers will probably only know it
is there if there is some visual presentation or highly visible information
in a help file.  But you can also say this of #1, since 99.999% of WWW
authors don't even know about it.

I think the key issue is how best to coax authors into adding the
description information (development tools) and how users will know it's
available (browser rendering).

Since there is no clear benefit to this information for non-disabled
persons (except people using low speed modems) I don't think browser
developers will devote alot of creative resources to this project.  I would
argue it would be better to have a consistancy between browsers (guidelines
and example) of how to do it.  So if a person with a disability upgrades
their browser or uses an unfamilar browser they could use their previous
experience to access the ALTREF information (if available).
