I agree that a long description of an image map may in some cases be
necessary if the required information can not be conveyed by associating
an ALT attribute with each of the defined areas on a client-side map. All
web clients that comply with the HTML 3.2 specification should fully
support client-side image maps. Any failure in this regard should
certainly be addressed in the education and awareness aspect of the WAI
project. Again, this is a "time frame" issue. Perhaps the guidelines
should, in the first place, strongly discourage the use of server-side
image maps, and then offer a solution for those who still insist upon
using them.
