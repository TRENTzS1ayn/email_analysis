Some comments.

First, in the next release of CSS, CSS2, codename Frosting, ACSS
becomes part of CSS, and is no longer a separate spec (printing and
positioning too). 

Second, generic access to HTML attribute values from CSS (whether it's
ALT or ALTSRC) is scheduled for CSS2, and our WAI role here is to make
sure it stays in when the dropping features season opens.

Third, I was told that ALTSRC was not a good name, it's (or something
too close like X-ALTSRC) already used by Netscape and/or AOL as a way
to indicate alternate graphic format. I propose to use instead
something like LONGDESC as the attribute name.
