I was able to meet up with Daniel Dardailler last week in Sophia
Antipolis. We discussed this idea. Its not clear to me what format
is appropriate. The simplest format would be to place each
definition on a separate line, e.g.

  DrDoctor
  MrMister
  okokay
  ....

A more sophistocated approach would allow one to specify the
pronunciation of the expanded form using a textual encoding
of phonemic/prosodic information. This would be contingent on
our choosing such an encoding, which is something we want to
do for HTML in any case. 

Maybe for now its best to just reserve a term for linking
abbreviation dictionaries.
