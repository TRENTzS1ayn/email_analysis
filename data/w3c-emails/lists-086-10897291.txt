The ALT attribute is exposed through Active Accessibility as the Name property of the object, and the TITLE attribute is exposed as the Description property of the object. These are not necessarily always how they are used, but they were the best corresponding properties available.  Screen readers are free to present these as they feel fit.

Oops - I missed this one in my summary a minute ago.

HTML 4.0 has the TITLE= attribute that can be used for the purpose that
ALT is used for now.  TITLE can be used for descriptive text, whereas
ALT can go back to being an textual representation of a image (it's
original purpose).

So a picture of a red ball that says "click me" could be as follows:

<IMG SRC="redball.gif" ALT="red ball with words click me printed"
TITLE="Click here to access site">
