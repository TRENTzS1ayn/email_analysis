I agree that defining a link type for the abbreviation dictionary is an
important first step. Also, I have wondered to what extent the
abbreviation dictionary and the phonetic markup work can be combined. For
example, an external dictionary file might be an appropriate means of
implementing phonetic markup. However, abbreviation dictionaries perhaps
should not be connected exclusively with the phonetic work, since they may
be useful to braille translators as well (for example, I understand that
the French braille system distinguishes between a full stop (point) and a
"point abbreviatif", which is used in abbreviations).

I would suggest using either an XML DTD or an HTML document, as discussed
earlier in this thread. The abbreviation dictionary certainly needs the
equivalent of the HTML 4.0 LANG attribute, and should allow a full
multinational character set to be used. I agree that it would be helpful
in some instances for phonetic markup to be included as well.
