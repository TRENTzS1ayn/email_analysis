Another reason why ALTSRC should be regarded as an inappropriate name for
the proposed attribute is that it might be regarded by some authors as a
substitute for the ALT attribute. What I am here suggesting is that, at
least in cases where the IMG element does not appear as the content of an
anchor and a long description is deemed appropriate, it would be necessary
to include both an ALT attribute and a link to the long description. Some
people might therefore be confused by the need to include both ALT and
ALTSRC.

LONGDESC would be a better name.
