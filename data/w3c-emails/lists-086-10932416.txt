I like the LONGDESC attribute name.   Easy to remember and easy to figure out when you see it .

 I was told that ALTSRC was not a good name, it's (or something
too close like X-ALTSRC) already used by Netscape and/or AOL as a way
to indicate alternate graphic format. I propose to use instead
something like LONGDESC as the attribute name.
