Indeed, this is the same issue. The proposed LONGDESC (formerly ALTSRC)
attribute for the IMG element would presumably enable long descriptions to
be associated with image maps. I have not looked at the coding in detail,
but the HTML 4.0 specification also provides an example of an image map
constructed using the OBJECT element. It should be possible to create a
link to the long description in this case as well. User agents, perhaps
with the aid of styles, would need to render the LONGDESC link differently
from other links that are associated with the image map.
