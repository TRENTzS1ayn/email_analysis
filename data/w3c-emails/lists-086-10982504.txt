The value of ALT is a text string; the value of LONGDESC is an URL which
refers to a detailed description of the image. It is anticipated that many
images will not require long descriptions. However, for those which do,
ALT and LONGDESC would be used together within the IMG start tag. It would
be the responsibility of the HTML user agent, guided by any applicable
styles, to render the LONGDESC attribute appropriately and to distinguish
it from other links so that the user is aware that it refers to a long
description.

<img src="http://www.somewhere.org/figure1.png" alt="figure 1"
longdesc="http://www.somewhere.org/figure1-description.html">
