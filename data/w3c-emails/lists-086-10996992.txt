Subject:RE: Need some help  (Alt text and descriptions)

Visually, if the image was displayed, all that would be displayed would
be a tooltip when the mouse pointer is over the image.  The tooltip
would display the contents of the TITLE attribute (in this case "Click
here to access site").  If there was no TITLE, then the contents of the
ALT attribute would be displayed.

If the image is not displayed, then the contents of the ALT attribute
would be presented in the space provided.  The contents of the tooltip
is the same regardless of whether the image is displayed or not.

However, both these attributes have separated places within the Dynamic
Object Model.  And Active Accessibility intelligently parses the
information out as well.  At least as far as Internet Explorer goes,
screen readers shouldn't worry about capturing the visual display, all
the information is available through the specific DOM or the generic
MSAA interface.
