This is correct. However, in most cases, a separate page would probably be
required, since presumably most users who do not wish to read the long
description would not appreciate its being included as part of the
document. Perhaps if it appeared at the end of the text, under its own
heading, those who chose not to read the description could readily ignore
it. One solution might be to create a separate document which contains
long descriptions of images that appear at a particular web site or in a
particular directory. Each such description could be named and referred to
in LONGDESC attributes by means of an URL fragment:
longdesc="http://www.somewhere.org/descriptions.html#description3"
