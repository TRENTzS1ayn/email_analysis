I would not recommend putting all the long descriptions together on a page unless they are very carefully labelled.  It is very confusing when you get there. Most people don't get that they should only read part of the page and then jump back.  

Putting each on its own page would be option 1
Putting them all at the bottom (as an appendix if you will) is another.  It allows access if you download the document but has the same problem cited above unless each paragraph is very carefully labeled.

This is correct. However, in most cases, a separate page would probably be
required, since presumably most users who do not wish to read the long
description would not appreciate its being included as part of the
document. Perhaps if it appeared at the end of the text, under its own
heading, those who chose not to read the description could readily ignore
it. One solution might be to create a separate document which contains
long descriptions of images that appear at a particular web site or in a
particular directory. Each such description could be named and referred to
in LONGDESC attributes by means of an URL fragment:
longdesc="http://www.somewhere.org/descriptions.html#description3"
