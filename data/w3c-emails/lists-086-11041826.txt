I have made a rough first draft of the Braille CSS requirements document
available at http://rvib2.rvib.org.au/%7ewhiteja/brlcss.html

This is really a discussion paper; it analyses issues and suggests
solutions, but does not give firm recommendations. I would greatly
appreciate it if members of the WAI WG would read the document and subject
it to a thorough and rigorous critique. I would also like to arrange for
it to be read by braille experts and others who are interested in this
area.

All comments should be sent to the WAI WG list in order to promote
further discussion.
