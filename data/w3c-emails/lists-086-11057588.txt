If the image is a <MAP> link would the recommendation be to put the text
links in the long descriptions or to have the text links be part of the
original document; or do both?

Also if the LONGDESC is used for audio and video links there may well be a
text description available in the source document, making the LONGDESC a
target tag (see white house pages).

It allows access if you download the document but has the same problem
cited above unless each paragraph is very carefully labeled.
