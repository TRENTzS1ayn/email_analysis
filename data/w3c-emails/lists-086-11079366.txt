My main intention in making this draft available is to have it circulating
prior to the WAI technical meeting, which regrettably I will not be in a
position to attend. The document was written and edited in rather a hurry,
and a few minor spelling and grammatical errors have crept in, but these
should not be of significant concern.

All comments and criticisms are welcome, and as Daniel suggested, please
forward the document to anyone who would be interested in reviewing it.
