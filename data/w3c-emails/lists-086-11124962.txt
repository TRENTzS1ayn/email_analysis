Hello all

For the meeting Monday 4th and Tuesday 5th, some details.

Registration dead-line is today.

I've updated the agenda page with more links, and I'd like everyone
attending to be technically prepared to discuss the issues.

In particular, for the Markup guidelines session, I'd like to start
with the Trace Unified guidelines (unless there are objections) and
spend our time commenting on what people find unappropriate or needing
changes (in particular wrt to our recent technical work).

It's important to understand that the meeting at MIT is not going the
place and time to do the review: we're not organizing a seminar or a
tutorial here but a W3C working group meeting (education actions will
come later with the IPO).

Monday evening, I'd like to have some kind of informal dinner (not
paid by W3C) somewhere in town. Please tell me if you're interested
before next Friday, so that we can reserve some tables.

See you soon.
