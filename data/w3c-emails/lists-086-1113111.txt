Dear UAWG,

The W3C Team has just started a four-week W3C Advisory
Committee review of a revised UAWG charter [1]. The review
(rather than simple extension) was necessary since the WG
is being rechartered explicitly as a "Royalty-Free Working
Group".

The new charter duration is until 1 May 2003.

We should be able to continue our work unaffected by
this.

Cheers,

  - Ian
