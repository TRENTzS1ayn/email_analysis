The problem of notes in general (whether they be side notes, footnotes or
end notes) is both a markup issue and a style problem. There should be a
mechanism by which one can indicate the presence of a note and leave such
formatting details as the note marker (whether it be a number, an asterisk
or another character) and the positioning of the text of the note to be
controlled by style properties. I have not been able to find any element
for indicating the presence of a note in the "element index" of the HTML
4.0 draft. Perhaps one could use an empty anchor element for this purpose,
although this is obviously not an elegant solution:
<a name=txt1 href="#fn1" class="footnote"> </a> (and the style properties
would have to insert the note number into the text at that point).
