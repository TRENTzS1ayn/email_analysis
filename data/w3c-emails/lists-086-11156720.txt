HTML 3.0 included a NOTE element for this, but this feature wasn't
considered sufficiently valuable by vendors. One possibility within
the scope for HTML 4.0 is to subclass a DIV or P element and then
to use style sheets to determine the placement of the element's
content. You can also mark the relationship between a source anchor
and the DIV or P element using the REL attribute, e.g.

  <A REL=footnote HREF="#fn2">...</A>

  ...

  <DIV class=footnote>
  ...

  </DIV>
