IMHO a note is simply that. Its 'appearance' as being
at the foot, head or side is immaterial.

It _is_ very useful, but its representation as boxed text,
collated notes at the end of the chapter, at the foot of each
page or screen etc. is (should be) down to the individual
reader. I would support the use of note as a couger 
element, then leave the rendering of such to the style
sheet. A visually impaired readers requirement is
very different to a reader on screen. Default it, but
permit it.
Is html4 fixed in concrete? 
<quote>his feature wasn't considered sufficiently valuable by
vendors </quote> seems a poor reason to ignore something
in regular use for the last couple of hundred years.
I would support such an addition.
