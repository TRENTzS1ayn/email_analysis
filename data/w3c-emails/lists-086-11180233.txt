This approach should be feasible, provided that several problems can be
resolved. Firstly, in the case of footnotes or end notes, there is a
reference mark, whether it be a number, a letter, an asterisk or another
character, which appears at a particular point in the text to refer to the
note. A means of automatically generating these markers (for example, by
automatically numbering footnotes) should be provided. This would probably
be more important when documents are printed, since in that case the
standard layout of pages (with footnotes or end notes) should be retained.
The problem is what to place inside the content of the anchor which refers
to the note, if automatic numbering is desired. This would presumably need
to be accomplished by a combination of markup and style sheet mechanisms.

Secondly, style sheet properties should be defined to control the
placement of notes.
