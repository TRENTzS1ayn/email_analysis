I concur completely with T.V. Raman's assertion that once a mechanism for
marking up notes has been defined, and the required style sheet properties
have been established to control their presentation in the print medium,
all that may be needed for purposes of accessibility is an additional set
of style properties to ensure that braille and audio formatting of notes
can be successfully effected. I also agree that any continued discussion
of general note markup would amount to straying too far from the topic of
accessibility. It should be recognised, however, that the availability of
a convenient method of representing notes in HTML is arguably a greater
priority for people with print disabilities, given the movement by the
International Committee for Accessible Document Design toward HTML as the
standard format in which text books and other academic and technical
materials are to be made accessible. Consequently, it is legitimate to
raise this issue in the context of the WAI, just as it has likewise been
deemed appropriate to address the need for print page indicators, which
also arises from ICADD involvement.
