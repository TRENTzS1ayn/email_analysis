HoTMetaL 4.0 is the newest version of Softquad's popular HTML authoring
package. Along with many other improvements, this product has been modified
to help users to write HTML documents that will be more accessible to people
with visual or auditory disabilities, as well as people with slow Internet
connections or computers that lack sound capability. The new HoTMetaL now
includes:

1.  Pop-up alerts that let the author know when they are about to use HTML
that can be very inaccessible to readers who are using screen
readers or other access devices.

2.  Extra emphasis on ALT text during the insertion of images and other
inaccessible elements.

3.  A Descriptive Text writing facility that greatly simplifies the task of
writing descriptive text and connecting D-tags.

4.  An Accessibility Checking tool that scans any HTML page and returns all
the accessibility errors in an easy to understand format.

5.  A Revised Help system that provides the most up-to-date authoring .
