A meeting of groups involved in digital talking books is being held 
immediately before the Boston W3C WAI meeting on Monday, August 4th, from 
10:00 am to 12:30 pm in room 518, W3C/MIT LCS.

The purpose of the meeting is to discuss the convergence of digital talking 
books with the internet. Several ongoing activities of the W3C, in 
particular, HTML 4.0 and Synchronized Multimedia, are of considerable 
importance to the talking book efforts globally.  We plan, during this 
meeting, to develop a strategy for providing input into W3C to ensure that 
the requirements of the talking book community are addressed. This strategy 
will then be presented to W3C and WAI.

We apologize for the short notice of this meeting. If you can attend, 
please join us. Let me know of your planned attendence via e-mail or 
telephone. If you cannot attend, but are interested in the meeting, we will 
be recording the session (if there are no objections) and can make it 
available to you. Also, information will be posted to the web and you will 
be notified when it becomes available.

At present we have representatives from RFB&D, NLS, DAISY, RNIB, and NCR 
attending, with others invited. We look forward to your participation.

If are unable to attend, but wish to submit comments or questions for 
discussion, please email me before Sunday night (Aug 3), and so that we may 
include them in the meeting.

Regards,
Mark
