Fine if you don't support the use of notes.
Processing the SGML based on characteristics
is one thing, but is forcing an issue.
A preferable solution is to introduce notes as
an element, which may then be processed to
canvass as any other element, in the way 
best suited to user needs.
Lets recognise a kludge when we see it.
How to feed back into html wg to support it?
