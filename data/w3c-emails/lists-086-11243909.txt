what mechanisms does the Braille stylesheet 
need to provide a presentation of the note in Braille.
--------

Taking the basic point. 
The style sheet shall be capable of :

1. The need to identify references to notes.
Alternatives include 
<A href ...> 
<note> as an element - not presently supported.
note as a characteristic of another element.
  [Concern. This would tie the note to too large an
   element. There may be two notes within the same 
   sentance.]

2. The need to access note content from note reference
   by the style sheet processor in source html.
   [Question? Is this a how and not a what?]

3. The need to present note content in variable places.

a. In line, in place of the note reference
b. At end of braille page
c. At end of some division


4.The need to present in variable formats.

a. A single note
b. A collection of notes each with a unique identifier.
c1. As a boxed item (for floating sidebox notes)
c2. With or without decoration

5. The need to associate a note content back to
   a note reference.

a. By number
b. By description
c. By location reference.

Comment. There is an implication that the stylesheet
processor shall be able to 'collect' note content for
later processing. Is this realisable in CSS?
