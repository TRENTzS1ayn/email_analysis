I am concerned that there has not been enough time set aside to
execute this approach.  Can we start off by collecting from the
attendees what they think is important, and see what level of
agreement we can get on those points?  

One feature of the Trace Unified Guidelines is a flat structure.
There is no concise summary we can use as the basis for a rapid
critique.  The only effective way to critique it is to slog
through the whole thing, and I expect that to be a long process.

I have now read through the 7.2 revision and I think that there
are important points where we have achieved mutual understanding
via the email discussion but which are not reflected in this
revision of the document.
