A straightforward implementable solution might be 
as below.

Assumptions:
1. That pagenumbers are available!
    Braille pages that is.
2. That an html file is treated as a single volume.
3. Sequential numbering of notes in a document 
   is possible.
4. All notes content can be collated at the end of 
   a document irrespective of where the text actually
   occurs.


At point of reference use a numeric access (e.g. *7 for
the seventh note of the document)
Identify the source page and line number (braille page 
number, braille line number)

At point of collation of notes - here assumed to be
end of document.

For each reference, in order to ready access to source
point of reference, identify the note by the following 
sequence
1. Note number as defined above.
2. Page number (braille) of source point of reference
3. Line number (braille line number) of source point of
reference.
4. Note body.
==============
Example:
The following line is assumed to translate into braille
page 2, line 13.
This process *1 is repeatable, can be automated without
the exception processing presently necessary in
braille rules.

Comments please.
