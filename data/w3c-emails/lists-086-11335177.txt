It is wasteful for you and me to be arguing whether the author
should put information about the link target in the IMG.ALT or
A.TITLE when the authors have not populated either, nor will
they.

I need you to join me in teaching the group to demand a more
radical solution such that the navigability is preserved even
when the authors don't do anything extra.

My note at

  http://www.access.digex.net/%7Easgilman/web-access/perc-rfc.html

tries to follow your model for what WAI should do to capture a
problem for the experts.  Can you give us a response to that
message that is articulated in the proper language of DOM, XML,
RDF, etc?

We need a long-range plan for communicating the necessary
information about the link target that does not generate busywork
for authors.  Once we have that, perhaps we can see our way clear
to saying something about ALT in the short term that is
compatible with the browsers in the field today.
