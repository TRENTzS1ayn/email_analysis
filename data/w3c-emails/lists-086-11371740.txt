The last issue of the Perl Journal (published quarterly)
has a very nice article by Lincoln Stein
entitled
Rating Web Page Tastefulness with a Perl Agent
accompanied by a PERL script that rates WWW sites based on actual content vs
general glitz.

Not surprisingly, many of the tests he uses are also very very relevant to
accessibility.

The rater is at
http://www.genome.wi.mit.edu/~lstein/rater.
