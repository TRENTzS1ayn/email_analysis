I'm compiling all the guideline notes and will forward a copy to this list as soon as I get it finished.       I'll also include a NOTES section for each item which reflects other input I get or find so it is separate but available for us to look at.  

Great meeting Daniel.   Oofda on the workscope though.  (That's Norwegian)
