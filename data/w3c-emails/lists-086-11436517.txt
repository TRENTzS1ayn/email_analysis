The first sub-topic that one opens always links in 85% of the
issues in the whole problem.  To manage your workscope, consider
Murray's advice: give us a catalog of items, where for each item
we have identified:

- What is a problem
- Why it's a problem
- An alternative approach that is not a problem [if known]
- 1/2/3 grade rating from straw poll on 5 Aug 97.
- other votes taken in the process such as "A non-null ALT
should be required on all IMG elements."

The last example is best implemented as an input to the HTML
standardization process, not part of guidelines-after-the-fact.

We are not really ready to freeze a set of HTML usage guidelines
because we still have some possibility to change the language
itself.  And we need to develop more mutual understanding
throughout the group of tradeoffs between solutions in markup
vs. solutions in client programs.  While some of us clearly have
a good understanding of these, we are not all equally up on that
training curve.  To achieve universal design in the demands we
make, we need to continue to invest in teaching and learning
within the group.  The disability experts teaching about the
problem and the Web experts teaching about possible solutions.
