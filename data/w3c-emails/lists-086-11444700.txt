I agree completely with Al's comments on this point. There would need to
be compelling reasons to justify the abandonment of the proposal to allow
client side image maps to be specified in OBJECT elements. The conditional
logic is simple: if the user agent can not process the image map, then it
displays the content of the OBJECT element, which would presumably be a
list of links, one of which would, if need be, refer to a long description
of the image. This is a very elegant solution which is completely
consistent with the design of the OBJECT element. I also agree with Al's
"process" suggestion.
