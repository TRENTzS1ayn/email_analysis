Suggest also add abbr to th cells to see if browsers use them in place of
full th cell content when referenced to identify the th associated with any
td cell.

Which associated header information is abbr value if provided, else the full
th content.

HB asked about explicit use (however rare) of html th and td axis list of 
idrefs to
ids of cells (generally th) that contain header identification.

[I note that html4.01 strict dtd adds a headers attribute that contains a 
list of idrefs to
ids on all appropriate th cells.]

Alternative is to presume that all th cells (including spanning ones) in 
the row
and column of a particular td cell contain identification for that td cell. 
This may
desirably be limited to within the th of  just the nested table, and ignore 
the
superior table cell in which it is nested. Note that axis idref reference 
to an id in the superior table should be honored.

I also note that the abbr attribute can be used on th cells to provide an 
abbreviated
content for reading in place of the full th cell content when identifying 
the th that provide
the qualifying context for a td cell.
