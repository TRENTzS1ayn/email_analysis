Actually, OBJECT has the potential to provide a much more sophisticated
approach to image maps than does IMG, even if the LONGDESC attribute is
added to the latter. The content of the OBJECT element can be more than
just a simple list of links. It might itself include a complete
description of the image, with links included in the description that
refer to the resources designated by the various areas within the
client-side map. Thus, the long description is an integrated part of the
document, not a separate page, and the links emanating from the image map
can be incorporated directly into the description, which would be
displayed by default if the user has chosen, or the software is unable to
present the image map graphically.
