Just a note of exegesis with regard to the logical flow in the NISO spec.

Remember that this document defines the book format.  

In each of the cases noted as 'hard to reconcile' the pattern of logic is the same.  In order for the player to have the opportunity to offer a given function, the book must be marked up in a manner which provides the information on which that function depends.  The markup is not optional.  The bit about "the player may" is context setting and motivation for the MUST that follows.  If the markup isn't there, the player no longer has the option to offer the user this function.

The book has to support the function whenever the user manages to get a player that supports the function.
