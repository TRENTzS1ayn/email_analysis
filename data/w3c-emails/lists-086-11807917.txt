This is really a good point.

e.g.
 
<OBJECT data="delta-air.gif" shapes>
  This is an image of a plane with a Delta Logo on and
 it allows you to access the
  <A href="guide.html" shape="rect" coords="0,0,118,28">
        Guide to the service</A>
  or directly go to the page giving the 
  <A href="sched.html" shape="rect" coords="118,0,30,30">
        Flight Schedule</A>.
</OBJECT>
 
It doesn't look like MAP and AREA (attached to IMG or OBJECT) support
this kind of functionality, so now we have to think of what we lose if
we don't have it:

<IMG src="delta-air.gif" usemap="#map"
    ALT="This is an image of a plane with a Delta Logo on and
         it allows you to access the Guide to the service 
          or directly go to the page giving the Flight Schedule">

<MAP>
  <AREA href="guide.html" shape="rect" coords="0,0,118,28">
        alt="Guide to the service"</AREA>
  <AREA href="sched.html" shape="rect" coords="118,0,30,30">
        alt="Flight Schedule"</AREA>
</MAP> 


Even with LONGDESC added to IMG, you don't get the integration level
of the OBJECT shapes example, in fact, you need to maintain duplicate
data in different location, which is known to be a nightmare.

To me, this is clearly a barrier to accessibility.


Comments ?
