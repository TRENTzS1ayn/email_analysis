I think the following access guideline needs to be added
to the list:

When using HTML Tables, insert the <BR> tag before each </TD> tag.
This does not visually affect the look of the HTML Table 
on graphical browsers, but will make the table substantially
more accessible to blind users using older
versions of Lynx. In particular, its purpose is to "unwrap"
a table automatically when viewed in a text-only browser.

Any dissentors?
