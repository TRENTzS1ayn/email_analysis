Good point, but the guidelines already have a number of such items
in them relating to "solutions for today" which are very
important to put someplace. I guess the place that such a comment would go would
be under "making tables accessible today." That having been said, 
I do agree with Raman that this class of issues doesn't 
belong in an HTML access guideline. For good or bad the 
current unified access guidelines mix and match browser 
issues with HTML accessibility issues. I think from a w3c
perspective it would make much more sense to ENTIRELY separate
these into 1) recommendations to browser manufacturers, 
and 2) HTML access guidelines. And it will then be 
necessary to have a third document, more like the current, 
where relatively idiosyncratic solutions to current web
accessibility problems are addressed.
