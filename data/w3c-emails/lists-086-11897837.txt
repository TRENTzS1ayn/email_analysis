I agree with T.V. Raman that it should not be the responsibility of
content providers to accommodate the idiosyncrasies of specific user
agents. HTML should be written in accordance with the standards set by
W3C, and the developers of user agents have a responsibility to conform to
those requirements. Those who are using older versions of lynx can and
should obtain a software upgrade, which is freely available over the
internet and can easily be compiled and installed.

I would therefore not support the suggested addition to the guidelines.
