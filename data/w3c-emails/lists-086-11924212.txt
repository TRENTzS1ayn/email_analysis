As Al recognises, this is not a viable substitute for the capacity to
include image maps by means of the OBJECT element, due to the degree to
which OBJECT allows the links to be embedded within the descriptive text.

It would be of interest to know how such an approach would operate
concretely to overcome accessibility problems. Taking Daniel's example of
a description which is to be displayed as an alternative to an image map,
with the link to each map area being incorporated directly into the
description, how would such functionality be reproduced using a metadata
approach?
From what Al has said, it is evident that metadata may have considerable
advantages in reducing the effort required of authors in preparing
accessible documents. Perhaps this is a convenient opportunity to consider
how such a solution would be implemented.
