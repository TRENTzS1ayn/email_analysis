The trouble is, just as you mention, the 3-tuple of document-encoding,
user-agent,access-agent makes these items relevant to put someplace
(rather than just throw them away). If they don't belong in the final
w3c access guidelines, which I do agree, they have to go someplace 
cause they are relevant for today.

I guess the w3c access guidelines really need to be written in a form
where they specify each access issue and then list as solutions
the good improvements to the 3-tuple of document-encoding, 
user-agent, and access-agent. This isn't the way they're
written now and at the WAI meeting we didn't bring up
rewritting them in this framework. For the most part this
is an entirely different type of document than Gregg's proposal
for a 4 or 5 layer set of documents.
