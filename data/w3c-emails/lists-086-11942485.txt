CAST has just finished work on version 2.0 of Bobby,
a program that will automatically check web pages 
for common accessibility and browser compatibility 
problems.

Version 2.0 features an improved accessibility report which
attempts to order accessibility problems
by their importance. Problems closest to the top of the 
list are those that Bobby deems most important to fix.
We've also added a 4-star accessibility scale. Those sites 
that get a 4-star rating can use the "Bobby Approved" 
icon available on the Bobby home page.

Please feel free to check it out at:

Any comments or bug reports would be appreciated.
