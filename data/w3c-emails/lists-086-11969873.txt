A good set of proposals.

Some comments:

1) Customized bullets for list items -- this is addressed by CSS1 and it would
be silly to add this now as an HTML attribute.

2) Ditto for button appearances

3) Field groupings-- this is something that is much needed. In the summer of
1995, Dave Ragget and I had worked on this and come up with an extension to
the forms spec-- that took a back seat while Dave worked on tables. Many of
those ideas have been folded into
an extended forms proposal for HTML (from Microsoft no less)
--and I am not sure where that is in the HTML4 work train.
I would  focus on making sure that that work meets all accessibility
requirements and more rather than introducing an accessibility specific field
grouping tag.
