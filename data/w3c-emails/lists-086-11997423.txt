Yes, and the CSS mechanism is more powerful as it supports inheritance
of list-style among other things.

Well, not quite.

The static border look functionality is present (CSS border-style) but
the simple pressed/depressed setting using two images that Greg is
proposing would have to be done thru scripting in the current spec,
which is harder.

I don't know if Greg has looked at the new BUTTON element in FORM.

FIELDSET and LEGEND are in HTML4 FORM.

Yes, the HTML4 spec is now available and waiting for more review.


The other extensions in Greg's document cover:
- issue with logical ordering of markup, which Al Gilman has
        already proposed to as a new work item (private mail, on my stack)
        - issue with TABLE orientation, which needs to be folded in
        our TABLE work item. I like Greg's "HTML Presentation of
Tables" document, it has examples :-)


PS: Greg, could you send me your documents in HTML, so that I can make
them readily available thru our WAI WG site ?
