Speaking for myself, all statements I have made about keeping UA and
 UA and access agent  specific stuff
out of the guidelines  are made from the point of a good design that can
 survive over time, not as "a visually impaired user".

DD>  Dixon, Steve Tyler) are advocating the "let's  focus on the
DD>  document-encoding" view (or forget the idiosyncrasies of  specific user
DD>  agents, as Jason put it).  
You cannot improve things by focusing on any one of the three components in
the (document_encoding, user_agent, access_agent) tupple.
The key is to clearly anchor each statement and guideline with respect to the
elements of the tupple to which they apply.


 So on one hand, I'm totally in favor of

If they are footnotes in the overall document, you'll make that document have
more footnotes than content.

You need to separate the access_agent today because user-agents like IE and
Netscape dont have directly builtin accessibility.
Often, accessibility is muddied by how effective a particular access_agent is,
and you dont want to author guidelines that are biased by the features and
more likely the bugs of any single access tool.

No-- caring only about HTML will not help anyone.  You'll end up in the same
situation as exists today for SGML-- in theory it's the most accessible
because it is fully structured and separates presentation from information
--hell, most SGML documents have no presentation:-) but the "accessible
agents" for previewing SGML documents are even scarcer than the tools for
previewing them in a WYSIWYG interface.
