I'd like some assistance determining what is considered navigation and,
therefore, users must be able to skip. Here is the scenario: A series of
links (maybe 20 links in various categories) appear on the left side of the
page within one section of a site. They do not allow users to navigate
within the site or even within this particular section. Rather, users click
these links to narrow the search results that also appear on the page. Each
time a link is clicked, some or all of the links change. Therefore, I do not
perceive this as navigation. I think that if a visually impaired user (using
a page reader, for example) opted to skip the links, s/he would completely
miss the purpose of the page, in fact, the user would not actually be able
to use the functionality as intended.

Can anyone provide insight and/or additional resources in this area?

Thanks,
Jennifer
