Greg has provided a very good model around which the WAI guidelines can be
constructed. I have only one suggestion to make, namely, that we should
distinguish between screen readers, which essentially provide an auditory
or braille representation of a visual display, and access agents (audio
formatters and braille formatters) which attempt to generate an optimal
rendering of the document in their respective media. If the term "screen
reader" is applied to the latter type of software, it is likely to be very
misleading, since the purpose of such a programme is not to give a
representation of the visual appearance of the document but to treat
braille or audio as what T.V. Raman refers to as a "first class medium" in
itself. This is the conceptual basis which underlies the development of
ACSS and the proposed work on braille style sheets. It ought to be
reflected in the WAI guidelines as well by the use of appropriate
terminology.
