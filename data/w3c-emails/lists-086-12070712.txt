Greg Lowney has rightly recognised the importance of providing a mechanism
by which specific structural components of a document can be presented in
a different order depending on the display medium. An important question
to consider is whether this purpose can best be achieved by an HTML
extension of the kind proposed, or whether the presentational order of a
document would be better controlled by style sheets. The CLASS and ID
attributes, together with the DIV container element can be used, as Greg
Lowney has noted, to identify various block-level components of the
document. The order in which they are to be displayed in different media,
however, could be specified by style sheets. I understand that there
already exists a draft style sheet specification dealing with the
positioning of elements, but which I have not had occasion to review in
detail. To what extent does this draft accommodate the need which Greg
Lowney has identified, and could it be readily extended, if necessary, to
support full control over the ordering of HTML block level elements, using
ID and CLASS as selectors in the manner already discussed?
