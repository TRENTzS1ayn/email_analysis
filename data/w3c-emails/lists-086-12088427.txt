The minutes of the August meeting are now online at
http://www.w3.org/WAI/group/970805/min.html

More importantly, I started re-structuring the original WAI forum into
sub-groups, and am in the process of selecting chairs for the new
working groups (see http://www.w3.org/WAI/group).

In the next few days, each working group should get a home page of
their own (only the format&protocol group has one for now) and start
issuing draft documents for people to review.

I'm undecided as to how to populate new subgroup mailing lists.
I think I'll leave it to each WG chair to decide. 

If people have requests for way that would help them cope with the
number of mailing lists, like digests, or merged archived, please send
them to me.
