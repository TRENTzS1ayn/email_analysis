I just got around to reading Greg's 4-type document note.
In particular, in document type D, he gives the following 
suggestion for reorganization:

I think this is right on, though I would argue that the current
guidelines are not really in this format. If we could formalize the
WAI guidelines into this format it's precisely what we need.
We should be very careful about stressing the access 
issues without getting lost in idiosyncracies of only one 
of the 3-tuple of access agent, browser, document encoding.
