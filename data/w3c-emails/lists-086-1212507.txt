User requirement to be able to skip is broader than navigation.

Navigation requirements are what motions through the content you 
need to be able to make.

WCAG only talks about "groups of related links.

The NISO talking book 'escape' model is a much better conceptual
reference.  Anything that is a time [or keystroke] sink and a notional 
unit is a candidate for skipping or escaping from.

Are there hyperlinks in the main frame?

There are different ways that the content "is intended to be used" 
and the author needs to back off and give the user latitude to elect
which of these they want to employ.

In a frames-based design one would want to click in the left bar and
go straight to the consequences in the main frame without tabbing through
the main choices.  But one might rapidly decide to escape from the main
frame and go back to the tree descent.  The visual user does this --
skimming the current state of the main frame between tree level
transactions in the left-bar as multilevel menu.

Being agile in moving on a block basis between this dynamic, hierarchical menu
and the in-extenso development of the content at each stop along the way
is the requirement.  Not a static "skip navigation" flag.
