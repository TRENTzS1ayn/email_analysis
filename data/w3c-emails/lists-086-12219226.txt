This note is for the information of the
HTML and WAI Working Groups. Members
of either group who wish to contribute
material or to discuss these items
should feel free to contact me directly,
or through the WAI mailing list. Please
do not reply to the HTML mailing list.

I have accepted an action item from the 
HTML Working Group to write a proposal
for content changes to the HTML 4.0 Draft.

The items which I presented to the HTML WG
and which I will expand upon in a proposal are:

-- Image maps in OBJECT element
-- Introduce LONGDESC element for 
   use within an object.
-- ALT text required on IMG
-- Requirement to display ALT text
-- Requirement to display TITLE attribute
   on IMG, A and LINK elements
-- Table AXIS and AXES attributes
-- User preferences to provide overrides
   on presentation characteristics, such
   as typeface, type size, colors, contrast
-- User setting to specify cues on links
-- User agent transformation of tables (axis/axes)

Some issues on the list may be more (or exclusively)
pertinent to CSS. These are:

-- Mechanism for numbering of headings,
   divisions, lists, paragraphs, etc.
-- Mechanism to generate prefix/suffix text
-- Mechanism to link alternate media versions
        of a document (such as Braille)
-- Mechanism to provide phonetic info
        for speech rendering
