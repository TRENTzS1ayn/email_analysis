[David Pawson]  Are we approaching a 'channelling' effect?
The impact of personal choice would leave a user instructing the
browser to selectively action visual and auditory output,
leaving
[for example] presented material to be channelled primarily to
an audio device ( for the visually impaired reader) which would
eliminate any audio [switched off] from the page. Similarly,
auto-generated sounds from the web page might be switched
off and replaced with visual [alts] output for the user who has
no use for auditory output.
Channels would need to be defined for 
Primary output visual
Primary output audio
   [One of these may be defined as my preferred prime channel]
Secondary output visual 
Secondary output audio  
if we wanted to get exotic, the presence of a secondary channel
output could lead to an event to which I may wish to respond, by
halting the 
main channel output to listen, look at the secondary channel?

Just a thought.
