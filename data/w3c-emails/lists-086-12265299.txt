[David Pawson]  I was thinking only on the browser / stylesheet
end.
My starting point is the information availability at the page of
html. I
have the source available (a graphic [ maybe an alt], a sound,
some text). What is needed is
some preparatory work to assign these to 'my' preferred channel,
with 
event association. Then go ahead and 'read'. If we can block the
browser from
its asynchronous actions (playing the audio, showing the video
clip) then I 
can have a single source sound / site / feel, fed serially to
me, the way I want it,
rather than the way the author intended it (blazing saddles clip
with the sound of farting
in the background!). I can't remember which of TVR's 3 modes we
are talking about,
but it seems a good candidate for audio/tactile/visual
stylesheet commonality IMHO.

[David Pawson]  
If we can 'generate' alts [ e.g. here's some sound the author
forgot to describe] then even better, the channel source is switching
from data sink to source to assist the user need.
