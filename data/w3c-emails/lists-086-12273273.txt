Cc: WAI Working Group<w3c-wai-wg@w3.org>

Having read Jason's mail, and the private notes
that I have received from Daniel D., I am incensed.

I, as a member of the WAI WG took an action
to represent the WAI at the HTML, XML and CSS
meetings. I represented the group to the best
of my ability -- check with TV Raman. Through
my efforts, the HTML WG has agreed to accept 
a proposal. The process of the HTML WG requires
that an INDIVIDUAL be responsible for actions,
so I am the designated individual.

I have immediately reported the results of my efforts.
I have immediately indicated that a discussion
should ensue under the WAI mailing list, but not
the HTML WG mailing list. I have indicated that
private mail will be acceptable -- because I have
been around the block a few times and I know that
sometimes people want to say things without telling
the whole group what they think.

I have nothing to apologize for and I don't intend to.
I will continue to work for accessibility in the
Web protocols, as I have since 1994 with some success.
A brief history lesson would illustrate that I have
been one of the foremost (and most vocal) proponent
of the YRIF and WAI in the world. So please, if you 
want to be paranoid, please don't dump it on me.
