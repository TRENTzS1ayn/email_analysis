It was not my intention that there would be,
but I am offended by this bold assertion,
and the fact that it has been made in a 
semi-public forum.

I'll have to check the W3C charter, but I don't
think that such a statement is appropriate. I have
Cc'd this letter to Tim Berners-Lee and Sally Khudairi.

The fact that you don't understand should have 
been enough to make you pause to gather info
before sending out statements like this. I have
Cc'd this response to Dan Connolly so that he
can comment as appropriate.
