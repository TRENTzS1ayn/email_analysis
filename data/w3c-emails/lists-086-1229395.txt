Dear UAWG,

While revising UAAG 1.0, I started to think about two
of the content type labels [1] in the document:

   VisualText: checkpoints 3.3 (blinking), 4.1 (text size), 4.2 (font
               family)
   ColorText: checkpoint 4.3 (text colors - note; the spec
              incorrectly refers to 10.4).

In the current document, a graphical user agent that renders
text can conform to UAAG 1.0 without stopping blinking or allowing
the user to change text size, font family, or text foreground and
background colors.

I think that all conforming user agents should provide these
functionalities. Remember, the applicability provision means that
some user agents are exempt (namely, those that don't have
graphical renderings, those rendering formats where this type
of control is impossible, etc.)

PROPOSAL:

  - Raise the bar for conformance by eliminating the VisualText
    and ColorText content type labels. The four checkpoints in
    question would no longer be optional for conformance.

These already widely deployed functionalities will
benefit some users with low vision, color deficiencies,
and some cognitive disabilities or reading disorders.

Jon has already expressed his support for this proposal
(and adds that it will simplify conformance).

Please indicate your support for this proposal as follows:

1) If you support it, respond to this email with a "+1".
2) If you don't, respond with a "-1".

In either case, you may include additional comments.

As soon as there is at least +3 support and no negative
responses, I will make the change to the next draft (which
the UAWG will get to review). If there are any negative
responses, I request that this proposal be on the agenda
of the next meeting.

Thank you,

  _ Ian

P.S. I am making progress revising the document!
