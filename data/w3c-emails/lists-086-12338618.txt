That is perfectly described: the only ones we will really reach are
those who have to like governements and organisation for the

blind. This is my big concern.

One additional thing that has not yet been covered enough is
that we are talking about HTML documents only.
The web more and more does not use documents, but interactive
and dynamic approaches using much more than straight forward
HTML. The access tools mentioned above must support:
- security facilities
- script language facilities
- Interpretation of graphical objects (maps etc.
- ALT-text and longdesc handling integrated as a standardized
  view to theinformation.

As I said earlier: we need access to the web and not only to
blind-friendly pages.
The reason for this is that internet or its next generation will
be the only means to access necessary information.
Best regards,
Jaap
