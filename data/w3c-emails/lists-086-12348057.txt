I big and interesting question though is:
who is expected to prepare the metadata. It is always the
information provider who is and will stay responsible for:
- the accesability of his information
- the contents of the information
- updates (including removing of old data).

Metadata can only be used as a "linking" mechanism to be able
to locate requested data.
