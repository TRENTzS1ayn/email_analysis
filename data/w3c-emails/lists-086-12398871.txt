I agree that the failure of continuity if we try to migrate the
author community from IMG to OBJECT is a serious concern.

I'm not comfortable that I understand how LONGDESC would work.
What should I read?

Has anyone analyzed the prospects for relaxing what can go in
a MAP?

This may generate some heat, but for a newcomer it is not clear
why HTML doesn't use attributes which accept either a literal
string or a reference to a DIV elsewhere if what needs to be
inserted is structured.  I would guess this has FAQ status, but I
don't know the conventional wisdom in the HTML community on this
issue.  I mean, couldn't we change ALT to take as its value
either string or ref-to-DIV where the referenced DIV would be
like a MAP in being an optional text block.
