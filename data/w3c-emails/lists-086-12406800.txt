I am inclined to support Dave's point; it's more or less a case of "what
harm will it do" -- none. It provides an immediate solution to current (and
older) browsers, it certainly provides a reasonable solution to the
eventual OBJECT transition. Couger will be out on the streets very soon and
my understanding is that several browers are still heavily involved in
development.

What I also recognize is that just because we add LONGDESC to IMG, does not
mean that content creators will use it anymore than the use ALT now. BUT,
if we do our part by informing them, we can encourage content creators to
use today's mechanism and prepare for the better OBJECT mechanism in the
future.

Since my first Web Techniques article came out a week ago, I've had dozens
of requests from publishers, webmasters, ISPs, and the like for updated
information, hints, guidelines, etc..etc...It certainly appears that people
are willing to "do the right thing" if we show them how.
