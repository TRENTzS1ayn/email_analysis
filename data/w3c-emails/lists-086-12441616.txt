On August 16th, I asked the CSS&FP  group:

>For the meeting in Austin in November, the following dates have been
>proposed by the local organisers
>
>Are these ok for people? If there are scheduling problems, let me
>know.
>
>All day Monday 17th & half day Tuesday 18th - WAI
>Half day Tuesday 18th & all day Wednesday 19th - HTML
>All day Thursday 20th and half day Friday 21st - CSS

There wasn't much of a response. There are assorted clashes with Comdex,
US Thanksgiving, etc in November. We need a week (3 meetings of 1.5 days
each) and that week could sensibly be the week of the 3rd, the 10th
or the 17th of November.

So please, NOW, reply to this mail and answer the questions
below (delete as appropriate):

1) I would attend week of 3rd
2) I would attend week of 10th
3) I would attend week of 17th
4) I can't come to any of them, sorry
