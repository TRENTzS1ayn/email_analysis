If we are going to decline the gracious offer of the LONGDESC
attribute I think we owe Dave and Mike _et al._ a carefully
researched rationale.  At minimum I hope we can get both some
relevant users and some relevant authors to assess some actual
examples that work within what can be done now.

Find pages the authors rate tops in appearance and see what we
have to do to them to make them meet users' standards of
usabilty.  Find pages the users rate tops in usability, and see
what we have to do to them to make them meet authors' appearance
standards.  Visible links don't have to be ugly; the do have to
be styled right.  Basic worker unit for page rewrites is a
two-person team: one sighted, one visually impaired or blind.

Gregg and Chuck L.: any hope of this?
