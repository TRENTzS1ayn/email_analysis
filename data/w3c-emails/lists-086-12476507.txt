Thanks Al...because someone is going to really have to convince me that
providing "backwards"-type compatibility is a bad thing to do. As a long
time software developer dealing with customers who took months to change to
"new" protocols (OBJECT), I have to believe that minimally implementing
both the protocol and helpful guideline is *not* a waste of time and *is* a
helpful measure.

These, btw, are not the words of someone who doesn't have vision or isn't
forward thinking...but rather they are based on past and current experience
of what users and web site designers are already expressing.

- Mike
