If you have good evidence that content providers are willing
to support the "D" tag then perhaps longdesc is unnecessary.
I have yet to see this on popular sites though.

As an editor of the HTML 4.0 spec, I would like to get the
input of accessibility experts and content providers as soon
as possible since the window on changes to 4.0 will close within
days not months.

There are 2 major issues I would like help with:

  a) whether the DTD should include/reserve longdesc for IMG
     as a precaution for dealing with transition issues

  b) whether the latest HTML 4.0 proposals provide a
     sufficiently rich basis for rendering tables to speech

A new public version of 4.0 is expected this coming week.
This will include significant changes to the section dealing
with tables.
