I'm concerned about indication on how this is done, current
implementations of disabling background/foregeound colours make it and
CSS-P incompatible, to the extent where there is no ability to use CSS-P
in that enviroment.   So whilst I support the idea (not being a member in
good standing makes that pretty redundant I imagine anyway.) but I
believe we need to highlight the issue that if you do it simplistically
you also disable CSS-P, or you do it in a manner whereby CSS-P elements
with a background also gain the users background colour.

If you use IE5.5 or IE6 with "use own colours" on a a page with "popup
menus"  such as http://www.rcslt.org/ you will see the problem when mouse
overing the left hand menu (other implementations have similar problems
but I'm not sure if the popup menu will degrade or not.)

+1  In principle though.

Jim.
