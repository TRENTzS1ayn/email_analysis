I am going to address concretes first.  This is out of order
from your message.

We can come to a consensus on the accessibility assessment of
this question faster with a little more perspective from the HTML
working group.  Does the HTML working group see IMG being
obsoleted in favor of OBJECT for everyone (not just the
politically correct) as part of planned future migration?  Does
the HTML draft about to come out contain a LONGDESC provision,
and does it say whether the content pointed to by the LONGDESC
value (URI) is to be applied inline or encapsulated behind a
link?

Clearly we need to see the new version to answer b).  The question
of "when" leads me to the more general point:

I am not sure that our constituents in the disability community
would regard this as a reasonable effort to accomodate by the
W3C.  I am not in a position to offer concrete schedule proposals
because I believe that this question of terms of reference for
accessibility review prior to 4.0 going final is an open issue
"above our pay grade" within the W3C as we speak.  Jim Miller
can correct me if I'm wrong.

I just work here.
