In looking at the matrix (OBJECT/IMG) X (MAP/no MAP) X (short/long
desc) I came up with some issues and ideas.


Using OBJECT

Simple image with descriptions (both short and pointer to long)

<OBJECT data=foo.gif>
  shortdesc and a pointer to
  <a href=foo.html class=longdesc> long desc </a>
</OBJECT>

Simple image with map and long description.

<OBJECT data=foo.gif shapes>
this is long desc with
 <a>map coords</a> integrated 
 <a>map coords</a>
but without long desc pointer
</OBJECT>

To allow long desc pointer in the above example, the spec for OBJECT
shapes needs to be changed to say it only looks for <A> that have a
"coords" attributes (preferred) or A that do not have a class of
longdesc.

Introducing class=longdesc (maybe just in guidelines, but probably
better in spec) for A seems like a useful addition in any case (since
it allows the browser to identify it and present it to the user in
some special way, in graphical environment or not).


Using IMG and LONGDESC

<IMG src=foo.gif alt=shortdesc longdesc=foo.html>

This is more or less equivalent to the first OBJECT example (no map),
more strict in fact since it doens't use class=longdesc but a real
attribute (but doesn't allow for integration short desc/long desc
pointer).

Now if we consider map:

<IMG src=foo.gif alt=shortdesc longdesc=foo.html usemap=map>

<MAP name=map>
 <area alt=shortdesc1>map coords</area>
 <area alt=shortdesc2>map coords</area>
</MAP>
 
We see that we run into a problem that was already mentioned:
potential duplication in longdesc (talking about shortdesc1, 2, etc)
and the MAP itself providing area and alt for the same shortdesc1. 2.

One way out would be to extend MAP with the same OBJECT shapes feature:

<MAP name=map shapes>
this is desc with
 <a>map coords</a> integrated 
 <a>map coords</a>
</MAP>


I think the changes to the OBJECT-shapes-parsing-A rules and the
class=longdesc convention are needed, that IMAGE longdesc is good to
have and that MAP shapes extension is deluxe.
