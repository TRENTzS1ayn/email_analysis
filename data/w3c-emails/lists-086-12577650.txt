We also had mentioned things like "tty", "hugefont", "lowres".
We need to decide what exactly we want in HTML4 vs being adopted by
market practices.

I'm waiting for more input from the CSS gurus to understand what's
missing here.

Agreed. We need to discuss it further.
I've added your comment onto this item's page.

I also think it's a useful addition. 'linear text only' might better
convey what I'm thinking of.

I raised the issue with Bert Bos (W3C staff here in Sophia) and he
posted a first message to the CSS WG mailing list, then I followed up.

Two messages follow: one from Bert and one from me.

Subject: html4-970620: About LINK REL="alternate stylesheet"
-------

Why is there an "alternate" keyword in "rel=alternate stylesheet"?

Can somebody remind me? The only line about it I could find in the
minutes was: "usability concerns, concerns about overloading TITLE
attribute" (see http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Group/9702/24-html-wg)

I guess that "usability concerns" refers to the fact that the
"alternate" keyword is hard to understand and to use correctly, with
which I agree.

What "overloading" means I don't understand. It must have been the
reason why "alternate" is there now, and it must have been a stronger
reason than "usability"...

Here is a correct example:

(1)
<link href="styleA" rel="stylesheet" >
<link href="styleB1" rel="stylesheet" title="B">
<link href="styleB2" rel="stylesheet" title="B">
<link href="styleC" rel="alternate stylesheet" title="C">
<link href="styleD" rel="alternate stylesheet" title="D">
<meta http-equiv="default-style" content="B">

A is a "persistent" style, A+B is the default style, A+C and
A+D are alternative styles.

What is the difference with this one, without "alternate":

(2)
<link href="styleA" rel="stylesheet" >
<link href="styleB1" rel="stylesheet" title="B">
<link href="styleB2" rel="stylesheet" title="B">
<link href="styleC" rel="stylesheet" title="C">
<link href="styleD" rel="stylesheet" title="D">
<meta http-equiv="default-style" content="B">

It is also quite easy to create incorrect examples:

(3*)
<link href="styleA" rel="stylesheet" >
<link href="styleB1" rel="stylesheet" title="B">
<link href="styleB2" rel="stylesheet" title="B">
<link href="styleC" rel="alternate stylesheet" title="C">
<link href="styleD" rel="alternate stylesheet" title="D">
<meta http-equiv="default-style" content="C">

Note the META. Is A+C now the default, or is this an error?

(4*)
<link href="styleA" rel="stylesheet" >
<link href="styleB1" rel="stylesheet" title="B">
<link href="styleB2" rel="alternate stylesheet" title="B">
<link href="styleC" rel="alternate stylesheet" title="C">
<link href="styleD" rel="alternate stylesheet" title="D">
<meta http-equiv="default-style" content="B">

Are styleB1 and styleB2 cascaded together? And if so, is B an
alternate or not?

It seems to me that dropping the "alternate" keyword will make things
easier to use, harder to get wrong, and easier to implement.

To summarize what I got:
no TITLE: persistent style, always applied (modulo media match)
TITLE: a UI is presented for the end-user for selection by name.

What's not clear is the role of REL="alternate stylesheet" vs
REL="stylesheet" vs the presence of TITLE or not.

- Can a persistent (no TITLE) stylesheet be declared alternate and
what does it mean ? (I guess not)

- If there is a persistent and a non-persistent (non alternate), are
they both applied by default or just the persistent ?

- If there are no alternate in the list of TITLEd stylesheet, which
one is used and what is presented to the user in the UI ? Same
question with and without a persistent SS present.

- If there are only alternate in the list of TITLEd stylesheet, which
one is used ? Same question with and without a persistent SS present.

The example given in the spec only covers the case where one TITLEd
stylesheet is alternate and the other is not, in which case it is
applied by default and the other is presented in the UI. Fine, but
couldn't that be achieved using some order of appearance in the HTML
or the HTTP stream ?
