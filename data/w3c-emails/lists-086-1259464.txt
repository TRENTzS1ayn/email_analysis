On the contrary, all shows of support welcome!

Yes. Checkpoints 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3 require "global configuration"
(among other things). This means that one setting affects all 
reference text size (but other text e.g., headers may still be 
relatively larger), impose a single font family, and the user's 
preferred fg and bg colors for text. This would apply to content
that is in the normal CSS flow and also positioned elements.
