I believe that both the ALT= and LONGDESC= (or it's equivalent) need
NOT be "sold" to content authors, but sold to the HTML group as
"required".  If these attributes are missing, the HTML should be
considered incorrect and not to spec.

The IPO should help "train" the content authors to do a good job of
filling in the ALT= and LONGDECSC= with meaningful and appropriate
information; elaborate descriptions for elaborate images, and null
strings for null images (e.g., empty images used for positioning)
