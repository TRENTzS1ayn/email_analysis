I think we are in flaming agreement.

Sure, ALT should be _required_ in the technical requirements of
the HTML language.  

I am talking about selling the author community because I don't
see our selling job as finished when the HTML spec says that.

Part of the training is communicating to the authors why they
should care.  There is a better story to tell than "the spec made
me do it."  Yes we want to explain how to do it, including the
kinds of variations you describe.  To get them to use their
discretion effectively, we pretty much have to gain their buy-in
on the rationale behind the attributes, too.
