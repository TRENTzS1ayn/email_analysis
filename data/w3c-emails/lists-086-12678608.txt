I think there is still another issue you raised which is
approximately:

Do images loaded in to FRAMEs have the
same mapping and alternate-text 
capabilities as images imported with
the IMG tag?  Should they?

The other major issue I worry about that you didn't mention is
dynamism.  This is a significant problem and I would like some
effort put into seeing if we can reduce these concerns to
specific HTML language issues or make it clear that the
langugage is not the culprit.  Yes, in a hurry.

Would Phill or T.V. care to comment on what is happening in this
area?
