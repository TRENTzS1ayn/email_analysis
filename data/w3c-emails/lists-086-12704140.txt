With regard to the braille media type definition, should we include
provision for specifying the dimensions of the braille device so that
styles can be selected on the basis of the page dimensions of the
hardware? Such an option was included in my original proposal but it would
obviously depend on the details of how style properties were defined as to
whether these parameters are needed. Perhaps those who are familiar with
DSSSL could comment on whether it is likely to be necessary to define
separate style sheets for devices of different dimensions. Incidentally,
although almost all braille displays available today can offer only a
single line of text at any given time, multiple-line refreshable displays
are under development by several research projects. Thus, if a "page
length" parameter were considered necessary, it could theoretically apply
both to embossers and displays.

It is also important to emphasise that the extra parameters which might be
added to the definition of the braille media type should all be optional.
Consequently, media="braille" would in itself be a valid media type,
specifying that the relevant style or style sheet was applicable to all
braille devices.
