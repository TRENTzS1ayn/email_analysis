Hi Folks,

In our paper on "Hypertext Link Relationships 
in HTML," Liam Quin and I recorded about twenty
or more link types, including DICTIONARY. As a 
link relationship, this reserved name can be 
used to specify that the resource at one end
of a link is some kind of dictionary. It could 
be the source document or a resource that is 
addressed with a URL or URN of some sort. The
type of dictionary can be represented with a
second keyword if desired -- but the names of
these kinds (or classes) of dictionary have 
not been defined yet. Presumably these dictionaries
could include glossary entries, phonetic languages,
aural renderings, etc.

The idea is that one could specify any number of

<LINK REL="DICTIONARY" CLASS="..." TITLE="..." HREF="...">

in a document to tell the user agent when to locate 
dictionary resources if called upon to use them.

All that is really necesary is for the WAI WG to
name a list of reserved keywords that can be
universally recognized as links to accessibility-
related resources. That could include the long 
description, a Braille version of a resource,
an audio version, etc.

Ideally for the benefit of language designers,
we will probably want to adopt a set of keywords
that use a unique prefix to designate them. 
If I recall correctly -- which I may not --
the prefix agreed upon with the XML WG was "XMLWAI".
That agreement was reached before the WAI WG existed.

I hope that this input has been helpful.

Regards,

Murray
