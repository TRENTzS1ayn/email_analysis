Interesting discussions lately. Sorry for being
away from the list for so long.

So, what you are imagining is a link to a resource 
that is already preformatted to a specific size.
Links to Braille resources that are pre-formatted
for a variety of different physical sizes, ranging
from presses to punches and Braille pin readers.

Is that how Braille works? I always thought that 
electronic file formats were dynamically layed
out at presentation time -- but that is not a 
conclusion that I arrived at through research
of any kind So could someone please tell what the 
truth is? 

Anyway, if a user agent needs to know the size
of the resource before it retrieves it, then
I suppose we will have to ask for a mechanism
to do that -- a la' <IMG>.

The other way is to use <OBJECT> to declare
or include any Braille resource at any time.
By using <OBJECT> the WAI WG could reserve a
set of CLASS names for accessibility resources
and object-types.

Murray
