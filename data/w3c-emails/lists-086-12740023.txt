Murray,

Thank you for your input. The issue is not whether a user agent will need
to determine the dimensions of a pre-formatted braille file. As you
rightly point out, braille documents are dynamically laid out by the
translation and formatting software. Rather, the link to which I am
referring is the link to a style sheet. My question is whether, given that
Braille CSS has not yet been developed, and that in any case the
provisions for style sheets in HTML are not meant to reflect the
requirements of any particular style language, style sheets will be
dependent on the dimensions of the braille output. If so, then it would be
necessary for the user agent to be able to select styles on the basis of
these dimensions, so that a style sheet which is designed for a line
length of 40 cells will not be applied when the output device can produce
only, for example, 32 cells per line. The question is whether style sheets
will or will not be independent of page dimensions. The more that absolute
horizontal and vertical locations need to be used in defining style
properties, the more dependent style sheets will be on the dimensions of
the output device. Thus, we need to make a decision, prior to having
worked out the details of Braille CSS, and taking into account other style
systems such as DSSSL, whether we need the line length and page depth
parameters as part of the media type.
