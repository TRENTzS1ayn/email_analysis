 Hmmmmmm.

What if we could somehow have an invisible D link.  One that only showed up 
if the Graphics were turned off or a screen reader were attached (ala 
microsofts screen reader system flag)?

Not sure of the mechanism but just fishing.

One way would be to put the D-Link as the alt text to an invisible graphic. 
  then it would only show up when graphics were turned off ---- but 
unfortunately you would have a second graphic marker......

Or you could have the long desc and have the D shown by the browser - but 
only if images were turned off.  But this requires a browser change and the 
long desc would be inaccessible to older browsers.

Or you could use a D which was in a very very very very small font.  It 
would not be very visible but would show up to screen readers just fine. 
 (or print it in the same color as the background?)

These are all very inelegant but as i said,  i am just fishing and seeing 
if i can inspire a thought or a real idea.  Also remember - we only need to 
find a transition solution that is aethetically pleasing to the production 
people and will hold us til the real solution can be implemented.

Maybe its just too late here.

good night
