That's a more generic solution and therefore I think we should adopt
it.

What is the status of this proposal ? I don't see any mention of it in
the latest HTML4 draft.

Since this is closely related to the handling of abbreviation, acronym
and phonetic markup (all very new, or even to-be-defined) I would
advise to make it action items under this task in the WAI FP group,
rather than putting it in the HTML4 fast track band-wagon.

I don't follow here. Isn't it the role of rel="alternate" ?

Are you referring to:

(attached text for convenience, this is a mail I got from Mike
 Paciello last July)

================
From: Mike Paciello 
Date: Jul 97
Subject: The ICADD/WAI XML Accessibility System Name Proposal
-------

XML System Name Proposal for Accessibility


Identify and reserve the XML system name prefix in the form of:

XML-SDAprefixname 

where:

SDA = Standard Document Accessibility

prefixname = FORM, RULE, PREF, SUFF, or TRANS and all the current rules as
stated in ISO 1208-3 for the ICADD SDA rules apply.

The significant difference (for now) is the renaming of the SDA prefix from
Standard Generalized Markup Language Document Attribute to Standard
Document Accessibility. (We will need to make a similar proposal to the
HTML and SGML
working groups in the future, should they decide to maintain the SDA
attributes)
================



BTW Mike, could you check with the XML folks and declare this one done?
