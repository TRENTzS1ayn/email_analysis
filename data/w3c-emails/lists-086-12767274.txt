should we include
provision for specifying the dimensions of the braille device so that
styles can be selected on the basis of the page dimensions of the

would
obviously depend on the details of how style properties were defined as
to
whether these parameters are needed. 

Suggest rather than go for a specific device the style sheet
address the output size of the 'media' in terms of cells (characters)
e.g. the single liner might be 80 x 1. A standard braille page might
be 28 x 38. This would accomodate most braille output formats.

A single selection would then be usable for a users output, that is
one line change to the style sheet would format output for a users
preferred media, easily changed when you upgrade to another.
