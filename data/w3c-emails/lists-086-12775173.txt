Thus, we need to make a decision, prior to having
worked out the details of Braille CSS, and taking into account other
style
systems such as DSSSL, whether we need the line length and page depth
parameters as part of the media type.

They _should_ not be part of the media definition.

If I want printed braille output today, on my work embosser
which is huge, and smaller tomorrow on my home embosser
all I should have to change is the style sheet in use.

Output appearance is a factor for the style sheet entry,
whether this be for DSSSL, CSS or any other output 
transform. Braille is no different from print in this respect,
it is a presentation option which should be 'settable' by the
reader not the carrier. Set styles in the style sheet - media
definition is one aspect.  Style sheets are not 
dependent on the dimensions of the braille output, a one liner
in the style sheet indicates user preference - for whatever media
he or she has / prefers. 

Similarly for large print I could set my output media 
dimensions to A3 paper, my font to 24 point and 
get what I, the end user, want - from a standard
deliverable focussed on content.
