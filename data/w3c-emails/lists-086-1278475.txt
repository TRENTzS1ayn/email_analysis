The requirement of 4.3 is that for *all text*, the user be
able to specify foreground and background colors. This includes
elements rendered at any z-index.

UAAG 1.0 does not require that the user agent enable the user
to change the z-index of rendered boxes. The Note in 3.1
is explicit about this for background images:

    1. This checkpoint only requires control of background images for
    "two-layered renderings", i.e., one rendered background image
     with all other content rendered "above it".

Section 1.3 "Limitations of this document" states:

   "Background image interference. The requirement of checkpoint 3.1 
to allow the user to turn off rendering of background images does 
not extend to multi-layered rendering."

The UAWG intentionally avoided the world of multi-layered renderings
and acknowledges that as a limitation of UAAG 1.0. I personally
would not want the UAWG to reopen that discussion.

What would be very helpful for me is if you were to draft
text for me to include in the techniques document under checkpoint
4.3 (or 3.1), instructing UA developers on how to do the right
thing in case of multi-layered renderings such as those possible
with CSS-P.

Thanks!
