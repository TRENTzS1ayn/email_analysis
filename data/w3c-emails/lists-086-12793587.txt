Greggs idea of a very small graphic of a "D", hyperlinked, with the alt 
text "Image Description" sounds reasonable. Having it visible, but small 
helps make the point that is being used, and should make it more appealing 
than the text "D". With images turned off or to browsers that auto read the 
alt text, the meaning is obvious. I can't say the same for the text D.

Perhaps in the same way WGBH did the web accessibility logo, we could have 
a common, well designed D image (I don't want to get into the 
cross-language intuitiveness of the D itself... someone else can).  This 
image could be added to the next update of HM4 and FP.

 Hmmmmmm.

What if we could somehow have an invisible D link.  One that only showed up 
if the Graphics were turned off or a screen reader were attached (ala
microsofts screen reader system flag)?

Not sure of the mechanism but just fishing.

One way would be to put the D-Link as the alt text to an invisible graphic. 
  then it would only show up when graphics were turned off ---- but
unfortunately you would have a second graphic marker......

Or you could have the long desc and have the D shown by the browser - but
only if images were turned off.  But this requires a browser change and the 
long desc would be inaccessible to older browsers.

Or you could use a D which was in a very very very very small font.  It
would not be very visible but would show up to screen readers just fine.
 (or print it in the same color as the background?)

These are all very inelegant but as i said,  i am just fishing and seeing
if i can inspire a thought or a real idea.  Also remember - we only need to 
find a transition solution that is aethetically pleasing to the production
people and will hold us til the real solution can be implemented.

Maybe its just too late here.

good night
