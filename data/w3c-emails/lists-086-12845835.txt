I'm mostly in agreement with Dave.

I think the plus that LONGDESC brings over the full OBJECT support is
that it is very simple to implement, and therefore I would expect
Lynx, Emacs-speak and pwWebSpeak and maybe others to have it supported
quickly (before they think of being HTML4 compliant that is)
