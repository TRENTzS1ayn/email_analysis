I'll commit to adding longdesc support for webspeak immediately.  I am just 
not sure how many sites will ever adopt it, no matter how compelling the 
educational effort is. To be successful, it really needs to be supported 
and made a no brainer by the authoring tools. Do MS or SQ have plans to do 
so?

I'm mostly in agreement with Dave.

I think the plus that LONGDESC brings over the full OBJECT support is
that it is very simple to implement, and therefore I would expect
Lynx, Emacs-speak and pwWebSpeak and maybe others to have it supported
quickly (before they think of being HTML4 compliant that is)
