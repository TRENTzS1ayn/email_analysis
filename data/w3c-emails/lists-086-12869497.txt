I agree completely. The published draft merely says that if the boolean
SHAPES attribute is specified, the user agent must parse the content of
OBJECT, searching for anchors. In addition to Daniel's excellent
suggestions, I think the specification should also include an explicit
statement that the textual content of such an OBJECT will be displayed
only in non-graphical environments, (or in graphical environments if
graphics mode has been deactivated). Although one can infer the purpose of
the text inside the OBJECT which defines the image map from the example
which is given in the specification, a clear statement of its function
would leave no room for possible misunderstanding.
