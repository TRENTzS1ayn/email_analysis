Daniel is right in suggesting that we are all in agreement, but have for
some reason been communicating at cross purposes. His explanation of the
role of the "media" attribute in style sheet selection is absolutely
correct. My question is whether, if braille style sheets are linked to a
document, there will be a need for different braille style sheets for
output devices with different page dimensions. Will it be necessary to
have one style sheet for an embosser with a short line length; another for
an embosser with a longer line length; yet another for a braille display,
etc.? If this is the case, then there is an advantage in including the
page dimensions in the MEDIA attribute so that the user agent can
automatically select, from a range of alternate braille style sheets, the
one that pertains to the particular output device in use.

I suppose this issue could be set aside until further braille style sheet
work has been undertaken. If we can reach consensus as to the desirability
of distinguishing style sheets intended to control formatting for braille
embossers and those which format documents for presentation via a
refreshable display, then we could propose:
media="braille embossed"
media="braille displayed"
and leave any further parameters to be decided upon once braille CSS has
been defined, and Dave Pawson has completed his work on braille DSSSL
style sheets.

What approach do you think would be best?
