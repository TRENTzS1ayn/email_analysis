In response to Daniel's question concerning the meaning of rel="alternate
stylesheet", my understanding of the spec is as follows:

1. If no TITLE attribute is present, then the style is persistent
(provided that the media types match, it is invoked irrespective of user's
preference).

2. If TITLE is present, then the stylesheet is loaded (subject to the
media types' matching), but the user can enter a configuration menu or
other comparable component of the user interface and deactivate the style
by name, if he or she so chooses.

3. If rel="alternate stylesheet" is specified, then the user is presented
with the title of the style sheet before the document is rendered, and is
given the choice of whether to apply it or not, or in the case of several
alternate style sheets, the user can select one of them. I don't know what
the result is supposed to be if rel="alternate stylesheet" and no title is
given in the LINK element.
