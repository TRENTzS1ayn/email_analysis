It's not clear to me that the 'media' rather than the 'class'
attribute is better suited for that. As defined, the media range is
not sufficient to convey all kind of dictionary types. Maybe these two
are orthogonal in fact.

Not at all, I think this is implied by the way the spec is organized
(media types being defined in the SS section only) but this is worth
the precision.

The default media in the other case should probably be defined as
"current".
