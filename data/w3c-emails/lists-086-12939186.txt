I think the HTML4 spec can describe possible behavior but should not
mandate any.

I'm not sure of that, Jason ?

It's to associate a generic long description (a URI) with an image in
the markup.

Whether it's rendered inline, on demand, using a popup, a voice
command, is secondary (a bit like ALT is being rendered in as a
tooltip on some platform or in place of the image).

The browser guidelines can be more precise about that, of course.
