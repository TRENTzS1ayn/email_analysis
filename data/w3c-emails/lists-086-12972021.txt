How would today's browsers react to the following?

<a href="description.html" class=longdesc> <img src="" alt="[D]"> </a>

It should be noted that SRC is rightly marked as REQUIRED in the published
HTML 4.0 DTD. Would a null value be detected as an error by validation
software, and how would user agents respond to it?

Although LONGDESC is more elegant and versatile than the above solution,
there is nonetheless merit in having all of the possibilities available
for comparative evaluation as the discussion proceeds.
