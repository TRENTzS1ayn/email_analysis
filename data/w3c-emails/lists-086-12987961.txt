I agree, and also think that clarification of this issue in the spec is
necessary. In the published draft, as part of the exposition of the LINK
element, there is already an example similar to the following:

<LINK href="document.ps" rel="alternate" media="print">

which shows that MEDIA is of general application and not confined merely
to style sheets.

The use of CLASS to indicate the type of dictionary would be more precise
than relying on the MEDIA attribute:
<link href="dictionary.html" rel="dictionary" class="abbreviation">
provided that separate classes are defined so that the user agent can
decide whether to load the dictionary or not in any given instance.
However, what is the advantage of this strategy as compared with defining
separate link types for each kind of dictionary?

An abbreviation dictionary can be used not only by a speech synthesizer,
but also as a means of establishing hypertext links between every
occurrence of an abbreviation and its expansion. Thus, we should define
different types of dictionaries rather than relying on the media
attribute.

The question which remains is thus whether CLASS or REL should carry the
designation of the dictionary type.
