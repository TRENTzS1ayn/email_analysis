In Netscape 3, it shows the missing image icon.

The specs for "Relative Uniform Resource Locators" (rfc1808, at
ftp://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc1808.txt) says that empty urls directly
map to the base url, so I think what happens is that "" is taken as
the current directory, and since it's not an image, it breaks.
