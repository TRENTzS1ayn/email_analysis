Yes, we should be giving thought to how the most useful semantic
classes can gain standard nomenclature.  Unfortunately, we don't
yet know what the most useful classes will be.  That is why, as
with the media types, I suspect we should be looking for some
language mechanism which sets up a path for future refinement and
consolidation.
