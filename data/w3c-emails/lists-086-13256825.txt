Hello, we're finally closing down this list (w3c-wai-wg@w3.org) since
all activities have been transfered to either the WAI Interest Group
mailing list (w3c-wai-ig) or a specific WAI group (like w3c-wai-gl for
Guidelines)

I'm transferring over to the IG list the few people on WG that did not
auto-subscribe to IG (feel free to access the IG archive of the last 2
or 3 months to check what is going on in the list and potentially
auto-unsubscribe: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig)

Thanks
