Yes, I think they have to.  DOMHash is defined on the "expanded name"
whenever a name is qualified (either by default or an explicit namespace
prefix).

I think we want to consider them as a part of canonicalization.
XML 1.0 Recommendation clearly states that if an XML processor encounters
an omitted attribute, it is to behave as though the attribute were
present with the declared default value.  DOMHash assumes that
the DOM structure is created by a conformant XML processor, so
it counts the recovered attributes in the hash calculation.
