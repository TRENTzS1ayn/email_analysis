I agree. And following up on Phillip's comments, I think what will make
sense is if in the signature one can express the semantic depth (surface
string, canonical XML, DOM, etc.) one wishes to achieve in the signature. If
you just want to sign the bits, then you can. Sometimes this might be
implied by the hash algorithm, but it should be explicit otherwise.

Registration closed with 40 folks registered which was the cap.

Fair enough. I personally am not terribly vested in this having to happen at
the W3C. What I do want is that it be a well integrated piece of the whole
XML frabric. We'll have to see what people say on that note. Regardless of
where it happens, I think it should have coordination requirements whereby
it is synchronized and reviewd by the W3C XML-link and Sytax Working Groups
at least.
