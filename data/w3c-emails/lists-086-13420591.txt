Do I need formal methods to assess the neutrality of a canonicalizer? This
is probably true if I want to define a "general purpose" canonicalizer for a
given syntax (i.e. DER for ASN1). However, in most circumstances, people
have considered canonicalization in the confines of well-defined business
frameworks. There, it is very simple to ensure neutrality of the
canonicalizer. This because, from a business standpoint, XML is secondary.
It is just a syntax (or to be more precise a ML that could be used to define
such a syntax) - Adopting some XML DTD instead of ASN1 is just a matter of
convenience. The framework defines the semantics and dictate to the rules.
In such circumstances, a canonicalizer has many benefits and among others
relieves the business logic from the requirement of maintaining a copy of
the bitstream to ensure verifiability of the signature.

The previous comment does not preclude the definition of "general purpose"
canonicalizers such as DOM-HASH and X-HASH (respectively proposed by IBM and
GlobeSet). It shall be a matter of the different business frameworks to
decide if these algorithms are sufficient and semantically neutral from
their respective standpoint. In fact, they have been proven satisfactory in
several circumstances.

But you are correct, canonicalization shall not be a REQUIREMENT - It shall
be possible to sign at the bitstream level. (Though one may argue that the
simple fact to define what should be signed is a matter of
canonicalization.)

Sincerely,

Richard D. Brown
