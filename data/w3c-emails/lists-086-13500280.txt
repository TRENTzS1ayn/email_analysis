To:"Signed-XML Workshop"<w3c-xml-sig-ws@w3.org>

If there is consensus from the partipants that they would like to propose a
W3C Activity/WG on the topic:

1. A Briefing Package and Charter will have to be created. I've created a
fairly exhaustive template [1] that I hope will permit us to focus the
issues and move as quickly as possible if that consensus is reached. 
2. I've already spoken to a few folks about their interest in Chairing or
(co) Editing the specification and I think they'd be a great team. But to be
fair to all, if you are interested let me know, since this is something I'd
like to have settled soon after the workshop.
