This email serves two purposes. First, to notify you that you may be in my
targets for giving a small talk. <smile> Second, to solicit your thoughts,
comments, or partipation on a topic that I don't have listed.

Based on the position papers and outstanding issues at hand, here's how I
might organize the content. I expect to get more feedback over the next two
days, so this is very subject to change, but the idea is to confirm
presentation commitments that I know I will want at a minimum.
