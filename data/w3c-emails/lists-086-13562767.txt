Joseph,

XML Signature is only one of many aspects that should be considered for
securing XML documents. So far, it has been customary to approach Integrity,
Confidentiality, and Authentication (data and entities) altogether. Existing
secure envelope standards such as PKCS#7 and CMS have considered all these
aspects. This, because they all rely upon similar data-elements and
cryptographic procedures.

So, I suggest that we extend the mission statement of this activity beyond
Signature and that we also provide for Authentication Codes (already
considered in Digital Signature for XML Proposal) and Confidentiality
envelopes (encryption).

Sincerely,

Richard D. Brown
