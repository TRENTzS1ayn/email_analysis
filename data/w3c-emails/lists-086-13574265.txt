I disagree, a signature is logically an attribute related to the document,
something which once created may be considered a part of the document+
attributes package.

Confidentiality is a service which may be achieved in many ways, 
including IPSEC and SSL. Non-repudiation is a service which can 
only be realistically provided at the message layer, that is the
piece which transport and network layer security really can't 
provide.


The only advantage to implementing message layer confidentiality 
services is if you need to relay messages through caches or other
relay devices (mail servers) and want to preserve the end to end 
properties. PKCS#7 more than adequately addresses that need.
