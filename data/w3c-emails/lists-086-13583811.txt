That's a fair enough proposal (to be considered by the workshop, AC reps,
and ultimately the Director), though I think I disagree with the encryption
aspect. At least on that issue, I don't believe content confidentiality is
integral and dependent on the signature part, which I think is an undisputed
requirement. Consequently, I like to break those things apart, I would
consider it (at this point) a non-critical "look-ahead" [2] issue, that can
be addressed by subseqent activity. (You'll note in the proposed charter
does permit the group to propose a new charter for subsequent activity once
it got the core down. [1])

   4.Look-ahead: When I try to set your scope and constrain my options, I
     consider two classes of topic. Immediate, those things the WG has been
     chartered to do, and must be delivered within the time-frame.
Look-ahead,
     those things that are relevant to the work of the immediate, but are not
     deliverables. I use the second class of topics to help tease out the
concepts,
     and provide a high assurance that the first set of solutions are
extensibly
     complete. However, you do not want to place them in your critical path.
If
     they are important, they will not necessarily get solved any faster by
placing
     them in the immediate deliverables, and it certainly won't advance those
     problems any faster.  

(This document contains my own thoughts/baises on the adminstration of a WG)
