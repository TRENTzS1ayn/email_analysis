Phill,

Sorry, but I do not get your point (document attribute vs. service). I have
simply suggested that we further define an XML-based syntax for packaging
encrypted content (among others). Sure, PKCS#7 can serve the purpose - this
was my point in the first place. But PKCS#7 is ASN1-based and I am looking
forward an XML solution. The fact that a Signature is in fact a logical
attribute of the document while Confidentiality and Non-repudiation are
(from your view point) services have nothing to do with this. I am certainly
aware that they can be provided by other means. My point is that there is no
XML-based standard for enveloping encrypted content (at whatever iso or
non-iso layer). So far, security services have been considered at large, and
standards such as PKCS#7 and CMS propose syntaxes for both authentication
and confidentiality.

Sincerely,

Richard D. Brown
