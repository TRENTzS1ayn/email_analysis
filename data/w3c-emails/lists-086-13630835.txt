Don't you think that is where Signed XML standard stops and XDFL one starts.
In other words, the signature standard provides the means for signing
packaged external entities (simple elements from a signature standard
standpoint) and XDFL defines and identifies what is to be packaged, encoded,
signed, and verified.
