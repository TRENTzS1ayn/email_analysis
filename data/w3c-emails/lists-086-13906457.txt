[Sorry, that message escaped my Pilot before I got to include the
references.]

There are two areas where Xpointer may be relevant to signed-XML (so keep
your eye on [1]):

1. application: the use of a hash on an XML document to have an assurance
that the content referenced by an Xpointer has not been changed since the
pointer was created.
2. dependency: the use of the more advanced locators could be used to
provide for the scoping/filtering operations of some signed-XML
applications. [2] (I'm not sure how much of that functionality should be
part of signed-XML anyway.)
