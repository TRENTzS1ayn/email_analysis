To everyone who attended the W3C Signed XML Workshop in Boston last week,
thank you for an extremely enlightening meeting.

During the meeting, I mentioned a legal debate that took place at a recent
drafting session of the Uniform Electronic Transaction Act (UETA) regarding
formatting requirements for certain legal (consumer) notices.  The following
summary is taken from an email written by John D. Gregory, General Counsel,
Policy Branch, Ministry of the Attorney General (Ontario).  I thought you
might find it interesting.

The purpose of the (UETA) is to clarify or amend traditional paper-based law
to facilitate electronic transactions (I'm not sure it accomplishes its
purpose well, but that debate is for another list).  As it is currently
written, the UETA will apply to all "business, commercial, and government
transactions" subject to certain exceptions.
