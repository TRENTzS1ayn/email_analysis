Martin,

I am personally convinced of the need for adding explicit semantics to
signatures.  I am less convinced of the wisdom of trying to define a
standardized vocabulary of these meanings.  I rather favor the more
generalized approach of including an "assertion" block in the signature
block, coded in RDF.  It would then be possible for various interest groups
to define their own sets of values with explanations in whatever legalese
they want.

Your list below is interesting and helful, but I can think of a dozen
others I could add.  And I'm not a big fan of "central registries" where we
get to argue what is on the list and what is not.
