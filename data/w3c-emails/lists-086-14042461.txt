Alan, Martin,

I do not think that the XML DSIG proposal shall mandate a RDF statement in
the signature block. Though RDF could provide a formal approach to this
problem, there are many frameworks that may suffice without being explicit.

An application usually comprises processes and rules, which are disclosed to
and agreed upon by the participants. As long as the meaning of signing a
given document is well-defined and properly documented, and all the parties
have made clear their intent to be bound to the rules and aware of potential
liability, there is no need to further specify the meaning of the signature
in the signature block. Sometimes, an application may want to distinguish
between several signatures (i.e. E-Check) but it can do so without making
use of an RDF statement.

I do not think that being implicit or explicit in the signature block will
make a difference from a signature validity standpoint. Adequate
documentation and fair reglementations are fare more important. Being
explicit or implicit will not changed signer's liability if the process is
ruled deceptive. Being explicit or implicit will not changed signature
validity if you cannot prove the intent of the signer because there is no
adequate documentation regarding the process. Being explicit and formal only
helps external agents (agents extern to a given process) "interpret" the
meaning of a signature. This does not change anything from a given process
standpoint.
