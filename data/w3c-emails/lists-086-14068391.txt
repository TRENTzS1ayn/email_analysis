Yes!

Initially I did not quite get it why this all is needed. I now can somehow
understand the principle need for canonicalization, but still fear the
rathole we could get in here if we go too far. I really would prefer if only
encoding, spaces etc. would be canonicalized and everything beyond that need
not to. That would make it bounded and clear.
