My own view point on this is coming from wanting an application
to sign automatically generated metadata. I want the data that
is being singed to be uncluttered by any information relating to
the signature. The signature is an additional piece of reassurance
to any applications that choose to support it, that the metadata 
has been generated by a trusted application and has not been
tampered with.

Yes, it could be possible to point to a separate block of data
defining my intentions in signing, but this could generate lots
of additional blocks if everyone who generates metadata does this.

Being explicit in my intentions is necessary to protect myself from
litigation if my metadata generated by my application is found to be
fooled into being wildly incorrect by certain documents or wordings.
I dont want to attach a carefully worded document explaining the 
meaning of the signature to every signed document, I just want
a one-line phrase ' I believe its like this, but I'm not certain, if it isnt 
as I say then I'm sorry, please dont sue me' to my signature.
I think most people automatically generating metadata would
require something like this.

Alan, Martin,

I do not think that the XML DSIG proposal shall mandate a RDF statement in
the signature block. Though RDF could provide a formal approach to this
problem, there are many frameworks that may suffice without being explicit.

An application usually comprises processes and rules, which are disclosed to
and agreed upon by the participants. As long as the meaning of signing a
given document is well-defined and properly documented, and all the parties
have made clear their intent to be bound to the rules and aware of potential
liability, there is no need to further specify the meaning of the signature
in the signature block. Sometimes, an application may want to distinguish
between several signatures (i.e. E-Check) but it can do so without making
use of an RDF statement.

I do not think that being implicit or explicit in the signature block will
make a difference from a signature validity standpoint. Adequate
documentation and fair reglementations are fare more important. Being
explicit or implicit will not changed signer's liability if the process is
ruled deceptive. Being explicit or implicit will not changed signature
validity if you cannot prove the intent of the signer because there is no
adequate documentation regarding the process. Being explicit and formal only
helps external agents (agents extern to a given process) "interpret" the
meaning of a signature. This does not change anything from a given process
standpoint.
