I see a number of separate issues:

1) There is a need to encode attributes within a signature to define
the semantics of the signature event

2) There is a need to define the semantics of the attributes

There is already a project underway to achieve (2), the ETerms working
group of the ICC which is establishing a repository of business terms.
At the moment the effort is centered on the issue of constructve
notice of a CPS but the interest is considerably broader.

The issue of (1) is where the interface between PKCS#7 and XML-Sig needs
to be thought out carefully. Attributes defined for one envelope syntax
must be reusable in the other. Hence my interest in employing a PKCS#7
detached signature blob in a signed XML message.
