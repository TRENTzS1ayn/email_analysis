Hi Alan, Richard and Bob,

I'm actually mostly in agreement with Bob's point.  I don't think that data
types 1 and 2 should be PKCS#7 blobs, but I do think we will have the most
generalized solution by making them just binary blobs generated by the
underlying signature equipment, which need not even be cryptographic in
nature.  A function interface that expresses the signature needs of signed
XML need not be much more than a dozen functions.  For each new signature
technology, UWI writes the same function interface, calling the
functionality of the given technology to achieve the essential purposes of
those functions.  As long as the blob coming out of the sign function
actually correctly measures change in the document when the blob and
document are passed to the verify function, we do not care what format that
data takes.

To wit, the better handwritten signature technologies achieve at least a
modicum of security by encrypting the blob.  It is contrary to the needs of
this signing technology to put its internal content in a human readable form
such as XML.
