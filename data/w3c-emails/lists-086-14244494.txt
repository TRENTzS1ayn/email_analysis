If you want to do anything interesting with signed data, you already have to
include ASN.1 and DER. RSA PKCS #1 signatures have imbedded ASN.1 data. You
also need modular exponenatiation code, which swamps DER in size and
complexity.

I presumed there would be something like this. We then need to define that the
DOM methodes look like for things like PKCS #7 objects.

So our RSA signatures should be encrypted blobs of XML, and not PKCS #1 blobs
to be real XML signatures, even though every security token in the world would
barf on that data?

We're working on Signed XML. An XML digital signature, as you are trying to
define it appears to me to be and interesting academic exersize, but does not
get us any closer to deploying and using signed XML documents -- and certainly
does not meet any goal of getting something useful in the next 18 months!

So I submit that if you are trying to build a new *signature* standard, that
work should be done under some other working group.

The best analogy I can think of to what you are suggesting is if someone
decided that we need an XML Image format, because JPEG is to hard. The new
format would build on JPEG, and use DCT's, have all sorts of low level binary
data. it will have some interesting things like image size and resolution that
the XML application can use.

Again an interesting exersize, but not someone would actually use in a
commercial application.
