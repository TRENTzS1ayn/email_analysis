John,

Though it is probably not the subject of this mailing to discuss about the
strength of a particular signature technology, I cannot resist asking what
makes the PenOP scheme secure. Unless, the encryption that you refer to in
step 3 makes use of a strong public-key algorithm, I do not get it.
Attaching a biometric token to a message is no more secure than attaching a
digital certificate to the message - in fact this does not prove anything...
