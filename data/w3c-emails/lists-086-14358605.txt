I believe I answered this before.  When we say secure, we usually mean the
security offered by cryptography.  Although noone has ever proved it, we
believe that factoring 2048 bit keys, for example, is intractable.

I personally do not believe that the handwritten signature schemes are
intractably secure.  So the question is how much security do you get from a
tractable but difficult problem like reverse engineering the computation of
a very complex data structure?  That is a position that I am glad I don't
have to defend.  To me, though, it's beside the point.  Numerous
organizations have decided that, for a particular type of deployment, PKI is
too costly or impractical.  All they really want is a way to sign XML such
that the assertion that they forged an e-signature is at least as absurd as
asserting that they forged a paper signature.

This is not the binary on/off idealistic proof idea that we know and love.
It is the fuzzy, threshold of pain and liability idea that can be found in
the real world.  For walk-in business, for example, if the walk-in doesn't
have a certificate, how are you going to do business with the person?  You
can't issue him a cert. because you are the receiving party.

The pen people claim that their technology binds the document to the signer
in a way that digital certs. don't.  Users don't lose, misplace or leave
behind their hands.  Further arguments to the contrary should go to those
who manufacture this technology.  I only integrate with it, and I'm only
trying to say that these people have the core requirement of non-readability
of the signature blob.
