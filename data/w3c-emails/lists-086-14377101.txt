I agree. Our digital ticket system is the application which do not
require PKIX and X509 ... I believe that there are many other
applications which do not require any PK certificates. Because, a PK 
certificate is a document which binds a PK and identity, but identity is 
not required for all application. 

Of course, if an application requires X509 or PKIX certificates, then the
verification system must interprets the ASN.1/DER blob. But it is an
option, I believe.

I also think that a PK certificate can be/should be a "normal" singed
XML document which describes an assertion on the PK for the application.
