I don't think we need to address signature schemes based on
autographs for the following reasons:

1) The packing format had better allow any signature scheme
which produces as authentication data a string o' bits
which is a function of the message and optionaly some
additional data.

There are good reasons for allowing an SHA-1 hash or an
HMAC authentication blob, biometrics should be simply
another such blob.

2) Do we think we have a need for significant input of crypto
expertise? I don't think so, at this level we are treating
PKCS#1 RSA, DSS etc as well behaved black boxes. 

If we feel we can proceed without detailed instructions along
the way from Rogaway, Rivest, Kaliski et al we whould expect 
autograph identification methods to be capable of being
treated in an equally black box fashion.

3) Biometric techniques are not commodified to the same extent that
RSA, DSS etc are. Patent issues aside, RSA is RSA whoever you
buy it from, same for DSS. Even the more 'exotic' reaches
of cryptography such as eliptic curve are well defined and
standards defined.

I don't think it would be possible to address biometric
techniques without addressing specific proprietary techniques
which would in turn lead to the issue of endorsement which
I don't think W3C should get involved in - not unless they
want to actually conduct trials of biometric techniques which
I don't think they do.

4) The applications of biometrics and the applications of digital 
signatures are disjoint. I do not see an overlap, I consider
biometrics important precisely because they can do things 
which digital signatures cannot. I don't 

No biometric technique is proof against a sampling attack. Each
person has one and only one biometric profile. Individual
mechanisms may sample that profile and base their analysis on
a subset but there is no means of preventing a complete sampling
of the original.

At most a biometric proves is that there was knowledge of a 
biometric profile required to create a signature. That is very
different to the assurance of a digital signature which establishes
that there was knowledge of a specific piece of information.
Empirically, it is easier to do a biometric scanning attack than
a brain scanning attack! It is also easier to learn new pieces of 
information than change your fingerprint or autograph.

I know there are folk in the biometric industry who dispute this, and that
is kind of the point. I don't think the argument is usefull or necessary
however. It is currently raqging with much FUD in the legal arena. I don't
think we need to have the arguments rehearsed here too...
