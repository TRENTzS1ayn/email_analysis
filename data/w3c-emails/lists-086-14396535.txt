I agree. I would like to discuss from the former point of view more.

Basically, a XML schema defines the structure of the XML documents by its
definition, and any properties needed by the application should be freely
defined in the XML schema. I think that even an AP-specific signature
element should be allowed. For example:

<root xmlns:myAP='http://mycorp.com/schema'>
  <myAP:SignedAssertion>
    <myAP:Assertion>
    ... 
    </myAP:Assertion>
    <myAP:Signature>
    ...
    </myAP:Signature>
  </myAP:SignedAssertion>
</root>

I would like to define the semantics of the signature in the XML
schema definition instead of the signed document itself, since it
reduces the size of the signed description. Assume that the number of
the signed descriptions is more than 1000, of which semantics are the same.

Someone pointed out that it is possible to alter the signature
algorithms or other signature semantics if it is not explicitly 
defined in the signature block. But, this issue can be resolved easily by
having the digest value of the schema definition in the signed block
as follows: 

<root xmlns:myAP='http://mycorp.com/schema'>
  <myAP:SignedAssertion  dsig:SchemaDigest="...">
                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    <myAP:Assertion>
    ... 
    </myAP:Assertion>
    <myAP:Signature>
    ...
    </myAP:Signature>
  </myAP:SignedAssertion>
</root>

Do we really have to define standard signature DTD? Instead, I would
like to have the vocabulary to describe the semantic of digital
signature, which can be used in the schema definition. Although, it
might be an issue of the XML schema / RDF schema integration work.
