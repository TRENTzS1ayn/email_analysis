There seems to be general agreement that whatever we develop should be able
to accomodate multiple signature technologies.  There also seems to be
agreement that it is not the work of this group to judge the strength or
merit of any particular technology.

But it does seem necessary to understand the requirements posed by known
signature technologies on the specifications we develop.  Therefore, I
would assume we need to understand how signing using biometrics relates to
the process we are more familiar with: that of encrypting the hash of a
signature block using the private key of a public keypair.

Maybe I'm a bit dense, but I can't figure out the explanation provided
above.  What "encryption" binds the identifying information unique to the
signer and the description of what is being signed?  Could you take us
through that operation in more detail?

Thanks.
