As I pointed out in a previous message, I think there is confusion in the
air over whether the discussion embodies:

1. How to sign XML

2. An XML-based syntax for representing arbitrary signed resources.

My observation is that various groups are addressing one or the other
problem, assuming the other is either out of scope or not worth addressing.
 So a lot of "talking past" each other is going on.  As I said previously,
I personally think both things are important to address.  I also think
correspondents need to be clear which problem they are addressing.
