Biometrics provide nothing more that a unique identifier.  It is an
identifier that is a little more difficult to duplicate that a name or
serial number.  Biometrics are forgeable  Biometrics are relatively easy to
duplicate since they are just a string of bits.  Any strength in the
authentication must be based on the hardware component that is used to read
the biometric data.  Either a public key technique or a keyed hash is
required then to authenticate the biometric input device.  Cryptographic
techniques are also required to prevent the modification of biometric data
in transit for remote authentication applications.

Biometrics may be an interesting attribute to associate with a key.  As an
attribute of a key they could be used as part of an authentication or
identification process.

No!  I do agree that we should support a few different public key
algorithms.  I do agree that we may want to support encryption, key
exchanges, or keyed hashes.  A keyed hash has it's own properties and
should not be described as a digital signature.

There seems to be general agreement that whatever we develop should be able
to accomodate multiple signature technologies.  There also seems to be
agreement that it is not the work of this group to judge the strength or
merit of any particular technology.

But it does seem necessary to understand the requirements posed by known
signature technologies on the specifications we develop.  Therefore, I
would assume we need to understand how signing using biometrics relates to
the process we are more familiar with: that of encrypting the hash of a
signature block using the private key of a public keypair.

Maybe I'm a bit dense, but I can't figure out the explanation provided
above.  What "encryption" binds the identifying information unique to the
signer and the description of what is being signed?  Could you take us
through that operation in more detail?

Thanks.

Alan
