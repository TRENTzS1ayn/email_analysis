Your comment about judge the merit of certain signing technologies is
particularly important in the case of pen-based signatures.

As for whether there is agreement that we should develop support for
multiple signature technologies, I'm not so sure this is the case.  As I
showed in the most recent email, if you parameterize the signature
technology in markup, then you are deciding to limit support for signature
technologies to only those technologies that can be envisioned now.  If we
want to support new security ideas in the future, we have to change our
spec, our DTD's, and our software.

Furthermore, by parameterizing the signatures in markup, you also have to
say what the tags mean, which means you can't create an implementation that
is demonstrably compliant with the spec unless you also include the
cryptographic layer.  Did it really encrypt the hash with RSA?

The relationship is that both have this form
    SignatureBlob = Sign(M, ...);
    Verified = Verify(M, SignatureBlob, ...);

In the case of the RSA, Sign is implemented as Encode(Encrypt(hash(M, ...),
PrivateKey)) and verify is implemented, at least in part, as a test of
whether hash(M, ...) is equal to Encrypt(Decode(SignatureBlob), PublicKey).

We should recognize any technology that conforms to Sign() and Verify(), not
just the certain ones such as the ones in the current spec.

The encryption offered by the pen-based people is not, in my opinion,
cryptographically secure.  The encryption means that it is impossible to
break the signatures without reverse engineering their products.  This is a
difficult but certainly tractable problem.

The point is that it is being used as an example.  You can argue about the
merits of this particular example all you like, but that would be missing
the point.  The point is that we cannot predict what technologies will come
in the future.  So we either write a spec that has to change every time
something new comes out that doesn't have the same parameterization we
originally envisioned, or we write something generic enough to facilitate
incorporation of new signature technologies without having to change the
core spec, DTD, software, etc.
