Of course, this problem wouldn't exist if we weren't trying to express the
signature in XML.  If the problem did exist, it would be in the underlying
signature technology, and the signed XML group would not have created a new
security hole by trying to bundle new cryptographic techniques with the
fundamental and different problem of signing XML.
