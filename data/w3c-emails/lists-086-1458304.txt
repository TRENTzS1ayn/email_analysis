Is this not necessary to make the representation of the events to the
user easier, for example, when reaching a body element (say) with an
onmousedown event attached, a voice user, may be informed by a prompt
that mousedown is possible, you wouldn't then want the UA to prompt on
every child node, which is all that a Boolean check would give is it not?

Jim.
