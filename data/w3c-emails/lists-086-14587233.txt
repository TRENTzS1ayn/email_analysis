Signing XML is not a fundamental and different problem.  We have many
worked examples to learn from like: X.410, X.509, PEM, MOSS, DNS Sec, SDSI,
SPKI, PGP, DMS, and DSig 1.0.

The originator information is an often overlooked problem in signature
standards.  For example, formal evaluation of a PGP signature is difficult
because PGP's web of trust does define a single evaluation path.  X.509
also has had similar problems with the attributes that reference the
issuer.  Mulitple evaluation paths were possible because the issuer name
did not guarentee unique identification of and issuer certificate.   Id
numbers consisting of a certificate hash were invented to solve this
problem.

So, hopefully we will be able learn from these past efforts.

Of course, this problem wouldn't exist if we weren't trying to express the
signature in XML.  If the problem did exist, it would be in the underlying
signature technology, and the signed XML group would not have created a new
security hole by trying to bundle new cryptographic techniques with the
fundamental and different problem of signing XML.
