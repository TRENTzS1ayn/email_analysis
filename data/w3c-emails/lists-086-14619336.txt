Signing XML is a fundamentally different problem.  We do not need to learn
from these past efforts if we do not try to duplicate them, as would be the
case if signed XML meant "sign XML then express signature in XML".  Signing
XML only requires us to define an interface to call upon these technologies.
As the cryptography experts learn from their past efforts and put out new
standards, our interface will be able to call on the technology that
implements the new standards.  All without changing our spec, DTDs, and
software.
