I'm fine with the "inner signature" being a binary blob.  I certainly think
Pen Op and the like should be accomodated.  But that is not at all the same
as saying that what is called the Manifest in Richard Brown's proposal, a
structured element which can include arbitrary XML/RDF attributes, etc., in
it should be encoded with ASN.1/DER.

I think PenOp is about as strong as copy protection is/was but those who
want to use it shouldn't be stopped.

Hi Bede,

Actually, you start out incorrect, but then begin deriving some of the very
ideas behind handwritten signature technologies.  First off, by handwritten
signature technology, I am not referring to a simple signature bitmap
(although one can be included for display purposes).

PenOp is an example of a technology that binds the handwritten signature to
the document.  Further, they would argue that they do a better job of
binding the document to the signer than cryptography does.  I'm not sure I
agree that they do a better job than cryptography in any area of signature
technology, but I'm not prepared to argue that the technology is useless,
in
part because several deployments of XFDL use PenOp signatures.

They bind the document to the signature as follows:

1) 90 or so measures of a person's handwriting style are recorded into a
"biometric token".
2) a secure hash of the document is computed (sha-1 or md5)
3) 1 and 2 are concatenated and the result is encrypted

Now, as I just said in a very pleasant phone conversation with Don
Eastlake,
I'm quite sure that the use of encryption is simply to obfuscate matters
and
does not represent a cryptographic strength security solution.  Though a
tractable problem, it is still quite difficult and expensive to reverse
engineer this technology.  Therefore, it makes sense for many types of
deployments where one expects high volume, relatively low value
transactions
where the organization wants to avoid the cost and difficulty of setting up
a PKI for walk-in business.  It is probably not "reasonable doubt" to
assert
that the organization broke the signature technology since, based on the
value of the transaction, it is probably too costly to do that or it is
less
expensive to forge the person's signature (the "old fashioned" way).

So you see, the opaqueness of the blob (offered by the encryption) is how
these handwritten signature technologies can claim to bind the signature
(biometric data) to the document (secure hash).  Hence, if we only support
signing technologies that allow a human readable format, then we are, by
definition, excluding handwritten signature technologies.

Maybe this is what the group wants to do, but I think it is at least
important that we know we're making this choice rather than having it sail
by unnoticed.  In UWI's case, I'm pretty sure our executive will not want
to
throw out a good revenue stream because of the standard, so XFDL will most
likely to continue to support this form of 'signed' XML.  It will just be
unfortunate that the signed XML standard cannot accommodate all kinds of
signed XML.
