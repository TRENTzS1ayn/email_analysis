You can call me an arrogant @#&% if you like but I don't think that
Bede, myself and others are arguing from ignorance of the technology
here. As for making arbitrary design decisions without knowing the
full consequences... that never stopped any of us in the past!

'Letting the technology provide the security'??? I have no idea
what the statement means.

As Don points out attaching Biometrics to the message envelope results
in a system 'about as secure as copy protection', while I agree that 
people want to do that and should be acomodated I don't think that it
is a good idea for the group to put itself in a position where its
statements will be used in marketing litterature to imply endorsement.


The best use for biometrics is to gate access to a private key which
is in turn used for creation of a digital signature.

All else IMHO is a rat-hole. Which is why I didn't really want to go
into the subject. I believe that the requirements of PKI are a strict
superset of the requirements of biometrics.
