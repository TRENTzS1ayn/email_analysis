JRG:  I think we only want current node. We have no real use for bubbling 
information at this point.

JRG: This seems to be more a markup issue.  The markup language should 
provide a means to associate the purpose/function of a script to a 
particular event handler.  One possible solution is some thing similar to 
the label element for form controls.  This would be considered conditional 
content, form a UAAG point of view, and could be made available to the user 
through the DOM or the User Interface.
