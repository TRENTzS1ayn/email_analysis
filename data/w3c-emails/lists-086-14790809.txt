Joseph,

Humm ... how do we develop a standard without any  restrictions?  How can
we generate conformance tests?

I agree that we can not prevent extensions and should even encourage
flexibility, but we need to have some minimum syntax and some restrictions
on the ways the syntax is used.    I believe this is just a matter of
specification approach and guidelines.

This restriction on syntax is one of the reasons I'm pushing on
differentiating the characteristics of a keyed hash versus public key
mechanisms.  Keyed hash mechanisms require a Recipient Info field.  Public
key techniques do not need to provide recipient unique information.

I had a similar concern when I wrote the example, but I primarily wanted to
show the usefulness of RDF semantics. Regardless, how would you
characterize
this type of restriction? We can't place restrictions on a syntax, so this
is an operational requirement on trust applications?
