I see no problems with this, consider a page which allows you to annotate
any element on it, you need a mechanism to specify which element you are
annotating - "Mousedown on the element you wish to annotate." the
element(/node) that fired the event is then obtained and used in the
annotation, from a script perspective you only capture after it's bubbled
to the body, it's inefficient to capture anywhere else.

So in this instance, a UA needs to fire a mousedown on any child element
of the element which actually has the handler, I see no problems of doing
the annotation in a voice or other non mouse browser.  I do see that so
as to make a user aware that they can fire onmousedown sensibly, whether
the event is defined on the element/node or one its ancestors is
desirable.

I feel this is an oversight...
