Joseph,

[...]

This restriction on syntax is one of the reasons I'm pushing on
differentiating the characteristics of a keyed hash versus public key
mechanisms.  Keyed hash mechanisms require a Recipient Info field.  Public
key techniques do not need to provide recipient unique information.

### Maybe I misunderstand but if the public key technique being used is
Diffie-Hellman and a recipient has many DH keys, is not "recipient unique
information", in particular an indication of which key to use, needed?
