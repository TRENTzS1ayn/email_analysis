Hi Barb,

Actually, I thought we were focusing on how we were going to design the
markup.
I mean, at the highest level of abstraction, should we have a model that
allows signing XML with diverse signing technologies that don't actually
express the signature in XML.  Is that really an implementation detail?

I'd like to ask the meaning of "Every vendor" and "has had to extend".  Does
"has had to extend" mean that "every vendor" now supports CMS in released
software?  Does that include Microsoft, and who else besides Microsoft does
"every vendor" include?  I know that Microsoft has enough resources to
implement every standard that comes out, but what's not clear is whether
"every vendor" has followed suit.

Well, obviously I would agree that we can sign XML with current technology
since that's what we do with XFDL.  But I think one of the points here is
that the crypto we already have now would have to get replaced with new
crypto modules that express signatures in XML.  The other point is that it
is at least conceivable that there might be signing needs beyond what is
offered by the crypto we currently have.  This seems to fall into two
categories.  The first is things that don't offer cryptographic strength
security but which offer security that (the vendors would argue) is as good
as paper signature.  Ironically, one such vendor, PenOp, lists Microsoft as
one of its technology 'partners'.  The second category is technologies that
don't use public key.  The IETF draft seems to include such a method because
folks like Donald don't find the public key crypto we already have to be
appropriate in some important applications.  This, in and of itself, is
evidence that the makers of past standards did not create sufficient signing
flexibility to account for these diverse needs that now seem to be
necessary.  What makes us think that we can now write a standard that covers
off every signing need with "the crypto we already have"?  I guess the
question is not where do we want to go to today, but rather where will we
want to go tomorrow?
