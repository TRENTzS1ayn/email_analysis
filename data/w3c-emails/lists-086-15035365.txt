   So far there seems to be general agreement that the
   XML-Sig work should broadly correspond with CMS functionality
   without requiring ASN.1 at the packaging level.

Speaking only for myself ... yes.  On the other hand, in keeping with
the spirit of accommodation for "binary" formats, I think we may want
to allow CMS blobs as part of the spec.
