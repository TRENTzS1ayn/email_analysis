Phill,


Before agreeing on anything we have to understand the ins and outs of such a
decision.

For example:

1 - What do people refer to by CMS? CMS as specified by PKIX or PKCS#7 from
RSA.

2 - CMS implementations usually require the certificate-chain to be either
refer to or pass as an argument. What is the impact on XML-DSIG
implementation? Other crypto-algorithms require only the private-key.

...

Also, we can make sure that the specification provides for CMS without
making CMS mandatory. Actually, I would certainly vote against such a
proposition.

Sincerely,

Richard D. Brown
