Do you mean the public key? I don't know of any protocols that transport the raw
private-key.
XML-DSIG should be able to work with certificate-chain's. That's what's actually
deployed. That's what actual production protocols use (SSL, S/MIME). I won't
argue against allowing public key only signatures.. it's just that, unless they
themselves are signed, not much a generic application can do with them.

It should at least be a "should". You need at least one deployable solution that
works with existing PKI's if you are interested in any near term deployments.
Most importantly though, the spec should give the CMS profile. (that is if you
use CMS, this is what the tags look like).
