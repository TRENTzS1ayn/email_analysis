CMS is the IETF interpretation of PKCS#7. At this point CMS is the
standard to reference.

I think as far as 'blobism' goes it is the detached signature blob which
is of interest - everything within the signature envelope.

PKI implementations require a certificate chain to authenticate a
signed object, at least according to PKI as we know it. Whether the
certificates are sent with the message, retrieved from a server
or directory there is a need to authenticate public keys in some
manner.

I don't know of any PKI, including PGP which does not have such
a constraint. Certainly certificate chain transport is something
the XML spec has to address. It is not something which I would
want to insist on CMS to achieve however. Signature blobs stripped
of the cert chain achieve the backwards compatibility we need.

Votes? What votes?
