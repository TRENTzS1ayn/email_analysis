Bob,

Sorry, my statement was obviously a bit misleading.

I was not refering to what appear on the wire but rather what is being fed
to the "crypto-engine". If I make use of a crypto-algorithm (i.e. DSA)
through some crypto API (i.e. JCE), I just pass a reference to or the value
of the private-key. If I make use of a package such as PKCS#7, I usually
have to pass not only a refernce to the private key but also the certificate
chain. The point being that there might be a few details that should be
further investigated before taking any decision - There might be not problem
as well - I just don't know yet.

Regarding the second point, I certainly agree with you - XML-DSIG shall
support certificate-based schemes. Recall that the proposal already makes
such provisions. But, usage of certificate shall not be mandatory.

Sincerely,

Richard D. Brown
