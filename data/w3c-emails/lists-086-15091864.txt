Phill,

Agreed that CMS shall refer to the IETF specification. However, a large
majority of existing implementations are PKCS#7 and not CMS. So, I do not
understand the argument developed previously on the list - I thought that
support for CMS was motivated by the possibility to leverage existing
implementations!

Recall that CMS and PKCS#7 SignedData type are very similar, but there are
not compatible even if you disregard CMS added functionality.

Sincerely,

Richard D. Brown
