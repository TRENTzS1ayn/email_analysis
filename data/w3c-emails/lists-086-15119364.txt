I often find it helps me when their's contention to have two proposals
before me, with examples. Since I'm not sure there _is any_ disagreement,
would someone do me the favor of writing up at least one quick example
showing what a CMS blob would look like in (an extension) of Richard's
synatx? If someone then sees they disagree, it should be clear what type of
example would demonstrate the difference.
