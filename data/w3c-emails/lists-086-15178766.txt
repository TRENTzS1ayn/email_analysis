Joseph,

I noticed your comments about the absence of the DOCTYPE directive in the
C14N form. Though I tend to agree that we may do without DTD defintions, I
think that we still need a reference to the DTD. In most circumstances, this
is the main piece of information to establishing the semantics of the
document. Unless the root element is explicitly bound to the DTD namespace,
this may be a problem.

BTW: Do you known when an early draft of C14N will be available?

Sincerely,

Richard D. Brown

 James Tauber: Any need to worry about processing limited devices in RD?

 Joseph: Another motherhood note: If low on processing power use byte
 level conformance for XML-DSig.

 James Tauber: How small could a c14n processor be. Does anyone plan
 to build one? Volunteers?

 Joseph: What about extra processing by application?

 Joel: You can build it into a C14N processor if you want, but now it is
 not a conforming C14N processor, it's an application specific C14N
 processor.

 RD was published just before the meeting. We can expect a first WD
 very soon.
