I hope to have a copy next week. I expect the working group will publish it
shortly there-after. I originally expressed the same question as your own,
but my understanding is that if you want to express semantics, use a
namespace. I don't completely understand the discussion/answers to the
questions I asked, but I think they were they right questions and that is
why I'm looking forward to the WD being published so we can all have a look.

I will be in London April 30-May 3. I will not have access to email, but
will respond to your message as soon as possible after my return. I will be
in Toronto May 7-14, but I hope to have access to email during that period.
