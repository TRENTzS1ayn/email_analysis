Donald,

I was not proposing that we change anything in CMS, but rather not make use
of some of its features when signing XML. I assumed that attributes (other
that the mandatory ones for detached-signature) are not inserted by the CMS
engine unless explicitly requested by the application layer.

Otherwise, I totally agree with you regarding the huge among of data that is
replicated in the CMS blob, and be sure that I do not promote this solution.
I was trying to be objective not denying the possibility to support CMS or
Pen-OP with the current syntax.

Sincerely,

Richard D. Brown
