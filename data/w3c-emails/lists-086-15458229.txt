Colleagues,

You can find the latest information on the Workshop at [1]. I expect to get
some registrations and position papers, late this evening Pacific Time, but
you can see what we have at [2, ASCII below] -- those in Europe have missed
their deadline! </smile> One request for those late entries, please try to
use a title that is descriptive beyond "$Org's Position Paper" if possible.

I'll use this list to answer any questions, for folks to discuss position
papers, and the agenda prior to the meeting. <arm-twisting> The sooner I
have the position papers, the sooner I'll have a good agenda. </arm-twisting>
