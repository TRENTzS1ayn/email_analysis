I believe DOMHASH takes care of this by expanding the name (replacing
the ns-identifier with the URI)

I believe so.  Also, don't we have to worry about substitute strings for
general entities?  These could change the context drastically.

Yes, and I believe DOMHASH handles this.

If I understand the problem, perhaps only canonical external references (but
not the referenced content) should be included in the hash.  However, we
should allow signatures of external resources (e.g. external XLinked elements
or external documents in non-XML formats.)
