Here are some of the related questions that appear to bear on the support for
events in future versions of the DOM and XML-based languages (a.k.a. dialects,
modules, ...) and accessibility consequences of those features:

Q1.x Given the capabilities/constraints of current formats, what
information is
available which would be useful to users in making an informed decision as to
activating or not activating a behavior which the author has set to be
triggered by a device-specific event?  An adaptive rebinding is required
either
when the UI adaptation of the user does not generate that event or does not
allow the un-confirmed automatic activation of the event handler for some
reason.  How would the available information be processed in a representative
adaptive interface binding (or bindings).  Some of this is guesswork or
"repair
text."  What are the options there, and the tradeoffs?

Q2.y What would it take in the operational and programming model for
event-driven behavior for 'semantic' events to be the natural medium of
exchange?  What information (analogous to the above) would be available to the
user in support of their control of web content behavior under these "If I ran
the zoo" conditions?  There are two goals, here: a) giving effective access to
behavior under varying "delivery context" situations a.k.a. interface
bindings;
and b) constructing the technology so that authors would naturally use the
indicated model well, and populate the formats with literate content, and not
simply work around the format provisions that attempt to support UI binding
latitude.
