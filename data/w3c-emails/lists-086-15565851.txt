For those that wish to participate in a W3C Member context, the following
Call for Participation has been sent to the W3C Advisory Committee. However,
once we have news of IETF approval, I will confirm the configuration of the
WG mailing list and we can start work there in preparation of the Oslo FTF.
I will add everyone on w3c-xml-sig-ws@w3.org to  w3c-ietf-xmldsig@w3.org . I
also hope to put up a WG Web page sometime this week.

 Dear Advisory Committee Representative,
 
 Please take the time to review the just issued Briefing Package for the
 XML-DSig Activity, and the XML-DSig charter, and send in your review
 and/or participation commitment using the forms below. We appreciate
 your understanding that the Web forms for voting are not yet available.
 Please note that, however, the Reply-To is correctly set and that an
 "abstain" item has been added to the review.
 Please note also that, if the Activity is approved, the first
 face-to-face meeting is planned for the 45th IETF meeting in Oslo (see
 http://www.ietf.org/meetings/IETF-45.html).
 We specifically value your opinion on this Activity, as it is a
 pioneering effort in the collaboration between W3C and the IETF.
 
 Briefing Package:
         http://www.w3.org/1999/05/XML-DSig-CFP-990521.html
 XML-DSig charter:
         http://www.w3.org/1999/05/XML-DSig-charter-990521.html
 
 >From the executive summary of the Briefing Package:
 
 Structured information permits data to be easily read, exchanged, and
 acted upon by Web agents. The scope of such information often includes
 media-independent data for electronic publishing, electronic commerce
 and -- critically -- information about other information (metadata). The
 W3C's Extensible Markup Language (XML) Recommendation specifies a
 standard syntax for structuring Web documents. The content of the
 document structure is arbitrary; anyone can create a XML data structure
 (be it a bibliographic format or cooking recipe) as long as it is well
 formed. One can also associate (through RDF or Xlink) the meaning of the
 structured information to a Web resource. For example, "The resource at
 http://foo.com/~bar.html has a bibliographic entry as follows ...." This
 is very powerful!
 However, the usefulness of structured information is dependent on how
 trustworthy it is. Is the authenticity of an assertion or the integrity
 of a price list assured? This Briefing Package follows the conclusion of
 the XML-DSig workshop in which the participants advocated the initiation
 of a XML-DSig activity. The activity will initially consist of a single
 WG with an explicit requirements, constraints, deliverables, and
 time-table. One such deliverable is the chartering of additional work
 once the first phase is complete. At such a time, ghe Adisory Committee
 must be notified of such additional work and is subject to the approval
 of the Director.
