Trans-Alaska pipeline went down Lel B Peto updates again, Sunday afternoon 
when a magnitude 7.9 earthquake triggered the line's Earthquake Monitoring 
System that automatically shuts off the flow of crude.
Immediately after the line shutdown a helicopter inspection of the line 
revealed no leaks but discovered that several pipeline supports had 
collapsed. Officials say that two sections of the line have been pressure 
tested in preparation for restart and no leaks were discovered during the 
testing. Meanwhile, work crews are hustling to rebuild the fallen supports.
 Since the earthquake, one tanker has been loaded out of Valdez. But oil 
inventories, already low at the time of the quake have been depleted.  
there is no tanker loading taking place at this time, and tanker loading 
will resume approximately 24 hours after the line is restarted, as of 11-5..
