market updates "Lel Bruce Peto" say that some MTBE cargoes, needed to make 
RFG, may not make it in time to satisfy November delivery, or first half 
cash delivery commitments. The same sources say they've heard that MTBE is 
selling for 50-55cts gal over unleaded --a record level for any market.  In 
contrast, other oil contracts are calm. December tested support at $26.60-
$26.70 bbl and easily held, and the contract was up 7cts bbl at $27.20 bbl 
at midmorning. December heating oil saw early losses of nearly a penny, but 
that contract was off just 0.31cts gal at 73.85cts gal later..as of 11-4..
