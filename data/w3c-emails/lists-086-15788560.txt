Pressure me into delivering in spite of the low-quality.

I agree. She is just annoyed if I bring this quality issue forth because she
believes that delivering substandard work at the right time is better than
delivering high-quality work at a later date or reducing the scope of the
release.

The deadline was pretty much fixed in stone since the application won?t
deliver business value to the customer unless it contained a certain set of
features.

It is the customer?s problem since he will incur higher cost for future
work. The way to make it less of a problem for me or my company is to focus
more on delivering high quality work, use the Planning Game to gauge our
velocity and communicating more with our customer.

I must do all of the above :-)

Thanks, I?m gonna need it :-)
