For the simple reason that we are wimps ;-) Seriously, though I, and my
fellow programmers are beginners at using the XP practices and we just
crumbled under the pressure of delivering. One of my PMs says we would have
finished this damn thing a long time ago if we?d just have solely used
PL/SQL!!! When I talk about slowing down to go faster, my PMs just gawk at
me.

Dadi.
