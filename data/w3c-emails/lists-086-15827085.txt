The "something else" is, as I perceive it and hear it from my manager,
delivering the needed business value at the right time.

"Delivering soon" as you put it means delivering the needed business value
on a specific date this year because if it isn?t then it won?t be put in use
until next year. It?s important to my manager to make rather than break here
as she sees it.
