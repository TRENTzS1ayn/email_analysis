Make me feel that spending "too much time" (in her opinion) on testing,
refactoring and pairing would make us slip the date and that must absolutely
not happen. In essence, she clearly indicated that she equates delivering on
time with quality service even though the quality of the delivered product
suffered from the intense focus on prompt delivery. Also, she does not feel
that we should be "bothering" the customer with talk of technical quality.

Regards,
Dadi
