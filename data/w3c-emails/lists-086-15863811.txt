I agree, but here it?s not a matter of working or not working it?s a matter
of working with quality or without it. Quality here being linked to testing
coverage and simple, changeable design.

Again I agree and that is what we did and are doing, but the problem we are
facing is that we don?t seem to be able to find the right balance between
the 'what' with superior quality and the delivery date.
