JRG: Right now UAAG 1.0 only has a requirement information on explicit 
event handlers attached to an element, so while this function maybe useful 
it is currently not a UAAG 1.0 requirement.

Ray [1] made an interesting comment about a scenario on the annotation of 
web pages, which essentially makes every element "active" in a document and 
the author would some how know this when they were viewing the 
document.  This requirement may support your statement, but it is not clear 
to me though where annotation would be considered an "event handler" or a 
functionality of some user agent/server combination.
