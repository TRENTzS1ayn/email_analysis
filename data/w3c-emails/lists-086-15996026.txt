Business Benefits of Accessible Web Design

Hello.

This letter is in response to Judy Brewer's invitation for comment 
from the WAI Interest Group. Of course, I am not a member of WAI-IG 
but I would like to comment. In general, the document does a good job 
(as WAI documents often do these days) of describing techniques.

Please, though, help us find better numbers than those shown below. 
Show the hard stats, cite the sources. I've been reading the WAI 
lists since they began and my recollection is that these figures grew 
more from collective wishful thinking than real information. Please 
prove me wrong by providing documentation.

I would love to be able to say (and prove), "This technique makes a 
difference to 10 percent of your market. If you had a storefront, 
would you lock the door to one out of every 10 of your customers?"

Thank you for your hard work and effort. I hope this comment is helpful.

2. Increase Market Share and Audience Reach

Increasing discovery, access and usability of your Web site for all 
visitors is a major benefit from applying many of the WCAG 1.0 
checkpoints. Furthermore, the proportion of people with disabilities 
can range up to 20 percent in some populations. A significant portion 
of those people with disabilities -- in some countries as many as 8% 
to 10% of the overall population -- can benefit from Web sites' 
conforming with WCAG 1.0.
