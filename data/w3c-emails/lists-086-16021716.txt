Jonathan,

We're aware of this issue and have run some experiments with different 
browsers to try to isolate the problem, since navigation anomalies does not 
seem to be a problem in IE6 only, but to some extent in a few versions of 
other browsers as well.

The next stage will be running some experiments with some different 
navigation options at the header -- beyond the many nav options that were 
initially tested last year for this design.

It is being addressed, and your comments have been acknowledged on other 
lists already, but a new design isn't available yet. In the meantime we 
needed to get this page out for review. We will insert the new design once 
it's available & has been tested.

- Judy
