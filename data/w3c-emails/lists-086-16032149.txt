Once again I recommend taking time out.
I have been advocating that content is not quite as important as WAI seems
to believe it is, demonstration is at least as important.
Judy may be in a rush to publish, however there is already a huge amount of
material published by WAI on the web.
Most of it is only accessible to a tiny minority of the population.
There is yet to be any material published on the WAI site that is accessible
to people with a learning difficulty.

I've sent in a report suggesting that the WAI homepage be changed to only
include one anchor per table cell.
The W3C homepage follows this, and indeed I was thanked by its editor for
making this report.
I've not had an acknowledgement from WAI, and no action has been taken.

I'll be looking into how tabbing navigation can be improved.
However the editors current attitude is unlikely to encourage my efforts.

thanks
