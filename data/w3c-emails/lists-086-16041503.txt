After reviewing the draft I have two specific comments based on my
experience in dealing with requirement development and testing criteria.

1)  Under Paragraph 2, Preliminary Review, to conduct a preliminary review
complete....., item 2, 1.  The term "appropriate sequence" can mean
different things to different people .  Several testers may come up with
several different results that is perfectly acceptable to them but does not
satisfy the intent of the requirement.  Give the testers something they can
measure.

2)  Under Paragraph 2, Preliminary Review, to conduct a preliminary review
complete....., item 3, 2. Basically the same comment as above.  The term
"logical order" should have some quantitative measurements, e.g., left to
right, top to bottom, etc. for testers to perform an assessment.
