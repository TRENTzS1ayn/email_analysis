I read thru your document and could not find anything related to checkpoint 
3.4 in version 2.0 which asks the web author to include images, etc. to 
illustrate the content so that folks disabled by cognitive or reading 
disabilities can use the content.

As a person who has worked with this population for many years, I'll 
suggest that the most important need is for a topical illustration - an 
image (not text in image) that illustrates the topic or subject of the 
content on a page or site. This is a minimal need - it enables users to 
determine if the content is what they are looking for and whether to begin 
the arduous task of reading it. Further need for illustration of the 
content depends on the amount of text and the complexity of the text 
content, and of course, the target audience (if the target audience in the 
general public, there is a greater need for illustration than if it's 
editorial or content intended for a defined educated audience. Of course, 
since learning disabilities that cause reading disabilities occur across a 
wide range of intelligence and education, targeting an educated audience 
doesn't really eliminate the need to illustrate.

Please let me know if I can be of any assistance in making illustrations 
for cognitively and reading disabled users a reality ....
