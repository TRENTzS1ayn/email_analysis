>Hello,
>
>I suggest that the Web page 'Auxiliary Benefits of Accessible
>Web Design' (http://www.w3.org/WAI/bcase/benefits.html)
>should include a reference to United Nations' (UN)...
>
>  -Standard Rules on the Equalization of Opportunities
>   for Persons with Disabilities
>     -Target Areas for Equal Participation
>        -Rule 5. Accessibility
>http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/enable/dissre04.htm
>
>(This rule has been 'adopted by the United Nations General
>Assembly' in December 1993.)
>
>The purpose for including a reference to UN is to show
>persons and organizations, as an argument, that there is
>a global consensus agreeing on actions should be taken
>towards a more equal world.
>
>Referring to UN would also add weight to the importance of
>W3C/WAI activities, such as WCAG (Web Content Accessibility
>Guidelines).
>
>Regards

>The Web page 'Auxiliary Benefits of Accessible Web Design' is
>not a valid Web document according to the de facto standards
>of Web technologies, developed by the World Wide Consortium.

>Correct usage of Web technologies (e.g. XHTML) is one corner
>stone on which a healthy Web is founded.
