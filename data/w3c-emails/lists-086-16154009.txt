A www-tag participant questioned a claim
by Tim Bray that not doing WAI is bad
for business; I was going to chide him
for asking the TAG to do his homework,
noting that a google search for "WAI business"
quickly yields

  Business Benefits of Accessible Web Design
  http://www.w3.org/WAI/bcase/benefits.html

but while that document gives ample evidence
of benefits of accessible web design, it
doesn't actually conclude that the benefits
outweigh the costs; in fact, I can't see
any discussion of the costs such as those
cited in the www-tag discussion:

> For example, which studies have examined the costs of staff time
getting up 
> to speed with accessibility issues, time and costs of setting up SOPs
etc to 
> ensure that a chosen level of compliance is implemented and shown that
those 
> costs are less than the increased sales produced by addressing
accessibility?
