My answer to svgdeveloper@aol:


Not an appropriate subject for the general www-tag list.  Yes, it's good 
for business.  Check the number of Americans covered by section 508 of 
the ADA.

More evidence: I'm 47 and recently had to get reading glasses.  I don't 
like wearing them.  On accessibly-designed web sites, I don't have to. 
I'm not getting any younger and my eyes aren't getting any better.  I am 
a member of a demographic that you want to do business with.  Work it 
out.  --Tim
