Dan,

Actually the document you landed on is supposed to be titled "Auxiliary 
Benefits of Accessible Web Design" -- the correction was made in some 
places but not in all, I will follow up on that -- and it is supposed to be 
only one page of a resource suite that is still in draft stage and that 
more broadly addresses the various aspects of a business case. We do in 
fact also have a draft of cost considerations relating to implementation of 
Web accessibility, at
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/ap-impcos.html
In addition we are working on marketplace analysis, etc. -- it is a 
combination of the auxiliary benefits, cost factors, marketplace analysis, 
etc., that bring most organizations to the conclusion that accessible 
design is good for business. But you will note that all of the sections of 
the Education & Outreach Working Group's business case resource suite are 
in various stages of overlapping development, as we've been focusing on 
other deliverables recently.

We (EOWG) are actually getting back to working on this piece this month, 
and I expect the materials will become clearer shortly.
