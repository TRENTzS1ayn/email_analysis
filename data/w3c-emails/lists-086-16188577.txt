Dear Editor,

This is a suggestion regarding the method for page selection for manual and user testing described in the 'Evaluating Web Sites for Accessibility' document (http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/impl/eval/Overview.html).

Reference is made to the following paragraph in this document:

'3.1.2 - Identify and disclose a page selection for manual and user testing which includes at least one of each different type of page on the site, and all pages on which people are more likely to enter your site.'

My suggestion is to extend this idea by using the output from the automated evaluation tool's run across entire Web site (described in 3.1.3), to help the Auditor identify relevant page selections for each checkpoint (limited to a maximum number) i.e. 

- Pages containing elements specific to 10.1 - web page 1
- Pages containing elements specific to 10.2 - web page 23, web page 50, etc...

Effectively, helping the Auditor to collect examples, from the entire Web site, of the way in which checkpoint related elements have been implemented (really, I believe more akin to the Checklist of Checkpoints for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 approach of looking until found.) 

The reason for this suggestion comes from the fact that the defined page selection method (described in 3.1.2) might fail to ensure the incorporation of all the pages containing elements which need to be checked - especially with regard to larger websites. 
   
Very Best Regards
