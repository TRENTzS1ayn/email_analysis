Hi,

At http://www.w3.org/WAI/Policy/#Finland there is currently a link with HREF
value
http://www.intermin.fi/juhta/suositukset/jhs129.htmhttp://www.intermin.fi/in
termin/hankkeet/juhta/home.nsf/Pages/982
which doesn't work. It's presumably caused by a mixture of two URLs, adding
a new address so that the old was was unintentionally left there. Anyway,
the address that works is
http://www.intermin.fi/intermin/hankkeet/juhta/home.nsf/Pages/982

The ordering of information on your page is somewhat confusing. The quick
index is alphabetic by country code, which is presumably OK. The ToC proper
has country names in English in alphabetic order, which is natural. But the
actual entries are in a yet another order. It'd suggest using alphabetic
order by name, which would mean moving Germany after France.
