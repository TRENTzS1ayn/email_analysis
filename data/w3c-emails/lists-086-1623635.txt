My sincere apologies: Sometimes I confuse 4pm with 1400. 

This meeting (and the usual UAWG teleconf meeting) 
is scheduled for 2pm ET for 90 minutes.

I'm sorry for any inconvenience.

On another note of confusion: please accept my regrets
for the meeting. I didn't realize when I scheduled the
meeting that I would be in a plane. I will try to send
a summary of the current thread on events prior to
the meeting.

 - Ian
