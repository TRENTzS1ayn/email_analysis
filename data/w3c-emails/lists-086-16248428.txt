Hello,

Below are comments I received concerning the document "Evaluating web sites 
for accessibility".
<quote>
"Having looked through it I did
find it very comprehensive, but maybe to the point of being prohibitive in
terms of return on investment for companies. I was wondering how others had
faired tying to follow this process and whether it had been found to be
commercially viable for companies."
