Dear Ian,

Actually, we are changing that provision in an updated version of 
Evaluating Web Sites for Accessibility, since we realized that this 
evaluation step was not clear. If you could check back on our site in about 
two weeks' time, you should find an updated version of that section of the 
document.

Thank you for your question,

- Judy
