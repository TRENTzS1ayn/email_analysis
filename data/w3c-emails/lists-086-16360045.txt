Judy,

As I have mentioned in the past, UAAG 1.0 refers
to "How People with Disabilities Use the Web" [1] and
I would like "PWD" to be available from the TR page
by the time UAAG 1.0 advances to Recommendation.

I thought I might help this along by reviewing the
document. It reads very well, and I have only a few
minor comments.

Thank you,

  - Ian

[1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/PWD-Use-Web/20010104

1) Introduction: "guidelines for accessibility of
    Web sites, browsers, and authoring tools".

    I suggest "browsers and multimedia players", unless
    you prefer "user agents" right away.

    Also, I'd consider adding references to XAG.

2) "Online student who is deaf" scenario

     Editorial: "the material in a[n] accessible format"

3) Speech disabilities

    "To use parts of the Web that rely on voice recognition"

    There may be parts of the Web that can only be accessed
    by voice, but these are surely few in number. This phrase
    surprised me, but I'm not sure that any change is
    required.

4) Attention deficit disorder

    Suggest changing "To use the Web, an individual with an attention
    deficit disorder may need to turn off animations on a site in
    order to be able to focus on the site's content."

    to "An individual with an attention deficit disorder may need to
    turn off animations in order to be able to focus on other Web
    content."

5) ATs and Adaptive strategies

    In the first paragraph, a sentence ends "plug-ins." and should
    end "and plug-ins."

6) Scenario references (section 5). The checkpoint text for UAAG 1.0
    needs to be updated. The checkpoints are longer than they
    used to be. Perhaps the checkpoint title alone is sufficient:

    4.3 Configure text colors.   [4.3 and 4.4 combined into 4.3]
    4.4 Slow multimedia.         [4.5 is now 4.4]

7) The reference information for UAAG 1.0 needs to be updated, and
    XAG 1.0 added.
