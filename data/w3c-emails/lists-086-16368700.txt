When will the draft version [1] of the "Evaluating Web Sites.." replace the
2001 version [2] of the same topic?

Also, is there any discussion of using a "I followed this Process" logo for
those who choose to follow [1]?

Would it be required to keep test results and project evaluation
information on file for as long as the logo claim is maintained on the
site?
