Hello,
On Economic factors page: http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/econ.html
1. Consider rewording:
Additional factors for consideration are available on
other pages of this resource suite.
to
Additional factors for consideration are presented on 
other pages of this resource suite.
2. the term "accessible users" needs to be replaced by  "users who must necessarily use accessible Web content"

3. Consider using terms like "loyalty" in the statement about retained audience in  
"Retained audience - return visits from visitors due to satisfactory experience".

4. Consider using serves as a "checklist"  where it says
"features listed here are presented simply for consideration".

5. As was discussed during call, the line about "Employee retention" needs to be reworded. And It should not imply that PWD  
are employed because it is difficult to get non-PWD. Also, it is important to highlight that PWD are as productive if not more.
6. From an accessibility standpoint ( I use JAWS), I was confused by the multiplicity of listsand it required running down the doc a couple of times to  make sure I got the structure right. Perhaps using numbers (ordered lists) for main points, and/or  greater use of HTML headers(h2, h3, etc) might enhance readability/understandability.  
Thanks,
