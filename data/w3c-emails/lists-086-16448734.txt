Reminder: Several e-mails to the eo list identify policies that haven't
made it to the Policy page yet.

I had sent to eo what I learned about several countries:

1. India policies on web accessibility (2/14/2003f rom Sailesh Panchang)

2. Hong Kong Digital 21 Policy (2/16/2003 from Yammie)

Natasha had sent policies:

3. FW: Internet Accessibility in Poland (2/24/2003)

4. Russian accessibility laws (2/14/2003)

We may have failed to get these on the wai-eo-editors list, so they
were never recorded.
