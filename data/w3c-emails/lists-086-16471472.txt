Here are my answers:

@@is "regional governments" the translation of "Comunidades Aut?nomas" ?
if 
not, what is? Answer: I don't think people would understand "Autonomous 
communites", so yes, "regional government" is clearer. Historically many

were independant nations, but people won't understand the difference, I 
think.)

@@is there an appropriate?link, for example, to a list of them?
Answer: There's one at http://www.igsap.map.es/cia/ccaa/ccaa1.htm

@@is Comunidades Aut?nomas listed here because they are responsible 
ministries, rather than national? or in addition to national? is that an

important distinction?
, Comunidades Aut?nomas (regional governments)

Answer: Spain has tended to decentralise as lot, so although the 
legislation may come from national government, it's often implemented by

regional governments. They're equivalent to US states. They have 
parliaments and elections; they run the health services, schools, often
the 
police, too.

@@what is the appropriate short reference to the law?@@

Answer: The full title is "Ley 34/2002, de 11 de julio, de servicios de
la 
sociedad de la informaci?n y de comercio electr?nico" (Law 34/2002, of
11 
July, on services in the information society and electronic commerce).
"Ley 
34/2002" is the short form.

@@is this from a reliabl,e source we can quote instead of having it 
attributed to ourself, by lack of quote@@

Answer: http://www.igsap.map.es/cia/dispo/l34-02.htm
Search for phrase "Disposici?n adicional quinta." I don't know of an 
authoritative translation. What I wrote is a summary, not a quote.

BTW, hte text should read "Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnolog?a"; it's 
missing the letter "a" at the end.

I think it might be a good idea to put in a link to the Spanish
legisaltion 
page at SIDAR:
http://www.sidar.org/recur/direc/legis/espa.php
They have a specialist group, moderated by javier.albouy@sidar.org. I
don't 
know him, or whether he speaks Spanish. Otherwise, there's Emanuelle 
Guti?rrez, direccion@sidar.org, who does.
They have a page with latin American legislation, too
http://www.sidar.org/recur/direc/legis/index.php
