I've made a few suggestions in all caps. Libby

An increasing number of educational institutions (SUGGEST ADDING THE 
WORDS "and organizations"), recognizing the important role that the Web 
is playing both as a supplemental resource to classroom instruction as 
well as a primary medium for distance (SUGGEST CHANGING "DISTANCE" TO 
"ONLINE" learning, have also established requirements for accessibility 
of Web-based educational resources and online learning environments.

In some countries or regions, these requirements are part of general 
requirements for government Web sites and/or software. In other cases, 
requirements for educational institutions (SUGGEST ADDING THE WORDS "and 
organizations")may be developed separately, and may be more or less 
specific to the needs of the learnin environment.
