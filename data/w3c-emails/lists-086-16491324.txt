Alan,

Thanks much for your quick reply! I made most of your fixes in
http://www.w3.org/WAI/drafts/Policy/policy030407.html#Spain, which I
hope will "go live" (that is, replace the main page) soon.

As you might remember, EOWG decided not to include any of our own
material (see "do not include any editorial, summary, intrepretation,
etc. that is beyond W3C scope. include only links, or direct quotes with
link to reference" in
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/policychangelog.html).

So I think this should not be included, yes?

These look like very good resources; however, I'm not sure they fit
here. I seem to remember when I reviewed them a month ago (sorry it's
been that long ago!) that there was not substantive additional
information about specific legal and policy information. What do you
think?


Thanks,

~Shawn
