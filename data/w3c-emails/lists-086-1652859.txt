Agenda

1. How many boolean functions to test for listeners?
a. Nodes with excplict event handlers
b. Nodes with event handler attached

2. Semantics of describing event handlers
Some ideas:
a. Some type of label type element
b. Title
c. Script documentation
d. Listner (handler) based description

From the chairs view something like LABEL for form controls would seem to
be a good potential solution.  One label could point to several event
handlers IDs to indicate there purpose.

3. Device independence event hadlers
a. DOM working group has said that this is the job of other
specifications.  Since DOM does not define any event types.
