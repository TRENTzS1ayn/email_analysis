Hi Judy, 

Please find below the updated UK Policy section, noting the new Legislation and the removed DisInHE links (as the DisInHE website seems to have ceased working).  I believe this provides a solid platform on which to pile additional material as and when it becomes available.  It might also be worth asking Grace de la Flor about further education policies etc...

Here it is...

Legislation: 
  a.. The Disability Discrimination Act 1995 - Part III Access to Goods and Services - (http://www.legislation.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts1995/1995050.htm). 
  b.. Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001 (http://www.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts2001/20010010.htm) - When the Government introduced the Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001 it amended Part 3 of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 to remove the exemption of education and introduced the new Part 4 (Education).
  c.. The Disability Discrimination Act 1995 - Part IV Education (http://www.legislation.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts1995/1995050.htm).
Jurisdiction:
  a.. Disability Unit in the Department for Work and Pensions (http://www.disability.gov.uk).
  b.. Office of the e-Envoy (http://www.e-envoy.gov.uk/).
  c.. Disability Rights Commission (http://www.drc-gb.org/drc/default.asp). 

Relevant Documents: 
  a.. The New Code of Practice to Part III of this Act (http://www.drc-gb.org/drc/InformationAndLegislation/Page331a.asp).
  b.. Guidance notes from the Disability Rights Commission regarding The Disability Discrimination Act 1995 - Part IV Education (http://www.drc.org.uk/drc/Campaigns/Page431.asp).
  c.. Guidelines for Government Websites (http://www.e-envoy.gov.uk/oee/oee.nsf/sections/webguidelines-handbook-top/$file/handbookindex.htm). 

Very Best Regards 

Alistair
