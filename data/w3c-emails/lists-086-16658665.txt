Dear Pavel,

Thanks a lot again for all your information regarding Russian laws and the
state of web accessibility in RussiaDirector of Web Accessibility Initiative
of W3C organization, Judy Brewer, is very interested in your work, and would
like to ask you a couple of additional questions.



Below is the text of her response to my report on the web-accessibility in
Russia and Judy's and my questions in red

Natasha,

Thanks so much for compiling this info.

Please see a few questions in the text below.

FYI I'm copying this to wai-eo-editors instead of w3c-wai-eo so that it
gets logged properly.

Interesting -- could you provide a URI for this law? And a translation of
the name of the law into English?   

Ya videla kopiyu teksta zakona na Vashem saite. Suchestvuet li ofitsialnyi

pravitelstvennyi sait na kotorom mozhno naiti etot zakon?  Sushestvuet li
angliiskii perevod etogo zakona?  ili ?otya by

Could you provide us perhaps three or four specific links within his site
that contain documents either regarding relevant government regulations,
policies, or advice relating to Web accessibility or in general ICT
accessibility?

What we need, to be able to link to them from the WAI Policy page, is a
format roughly like this, in the section on Denmark:
 <http://www.w3.org/WAI/Policy/Overview.html#Denmark>
http://www.w3.org/WAI/Policy/Overview.html#Denmark   - na etom saite Vy
uvidit primer toi informatsii kotoraya nam nyzhna.  Mne nuzhno tolko Russkoe
nazvanie - I perevedy sama esli net ofitsialnogo pravitelstvennogo saita s
perevodom
Note, for instance, that the documents are named first in English, and then
linked to (if English translation not available) from the appropriate name
in Danish. Please let me know if you have questions!

Should we include Pavel directly on this thread?   Pavel, Vy ne vozrazhaete
esli my vklyuchim Vas v nashy perepisku?

There are some interesting accessible chat methods that have been developed
by other organizations, including the Assistive Technology Resource Centre
at the University of Toronto. Perhaps you might let him know.   Pavel, esli

Okay, thanks, we may include that info on the links to other resources on
the following page

http://www.w3.org/WAI/References/#projects
though it may take a while before we start editing that page again.

OK thanks this is interesting info.

Then it would be a good opportunity for people in Russia to start thinking
about accessibility now, while there is relatively little Web development
compared to what there will be soon.

Thanks again,
