Andrew,

We were discussing the policy page in the phone meeting on Friday and I
mentioned that you were updating the Australia information, but I couldn't
find your message. If you feel up to it you can make up the page ready,
otherwise I can do it. It would be a good idea to send it to Judy and me.

Alan

Alan,

Just checking all the Australian Legislation and Government Policies for
another purpose and thought I should update the WAI Policies page.

Is the best thing to do to take a copy of the Australian Subsection and
rebuild it and then send you/Judy the code to cut back in?

Are there any plans for industry policies?

Cheers,  Andrew
