from the agenda for today's events call, hosted by WAI/UA:

1. How many boolean functions to test for listeners?
a. Nodes with excplict event handlers
b. Nodes with event handler attached

There is another possible solution: one bit per node which is True if any event
handlers are bound at that node (without regard to type or number), plus the
inclusive query (for what event types are there handlers applicable if an event
is fired at this node?).

That way the navigation list gets built to the larger set of navStop nodes, and
the information the DOM offers is in line with the response to firing an event
there.
