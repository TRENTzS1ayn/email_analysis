Hi Folks;
     Sorry to be bothering you with this question, but
I've been looking for a solution to a condition related to
your Client-Side Redirects Using HTTP-EQUIV="refresh"
checkpoint 3.6.
     Here is my problem: I use HTTP-EQUIV refresh
constantly to refresh a page for an internal company
website.  Since some of these users are half the world
away, network delays/problems can cause the refresh
to fail.
     Here is my question: what mechanism exists
to give the client control over the failure to refresh?
Preferably so that a JavaScript alert window could be
opened to inform the client via pop-up window that the
refresh has failed.
Thanks for your time and my apologies if this question
is inappropriate.
