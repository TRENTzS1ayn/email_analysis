I sent comments in [1] on this proposal. Ray's proposal is
very thin on explanation for the uninitiated. I'm not sure
how this proposal intersects with the subsequent discussion
on 17 Jan [1]. From your summary [3], it sounds like the
ball's in the DOM WG's court to draft a more detailed proposal.

> 2. Implementation Report Update


I recently visited Microsoft (Mac IE), Netscape, Adobe,
and Apple. I am hoping that as a result of these visits,
we will receive evaluations of Mac IE, Netscape, Adobe's
SVG Viewer, and Apple's Quicktime player. I also expect
a review of Grins from Geoff Freed in the near future.


> 3. Test Suite Update


I have stopped work on this. However, I'm paying
some attention to deliverables of the QA Working Group
(which, by the way, use the WAI guidelines/checkpoints
model).

 
> 4. UAAG vs. 508 comparison


No progress here from my end. I am hoping that JG
and I will have a chance to talk about an XML or
RDF representation of relationships between the
two documents. I would like two documents at
some point:

  a) "If you satisfy 508 requirements and these X
      extra things, you can get UAAG 1.0 Level A
      (for the following content types labels, etc.)."

  b) "If you conform to UAAG 1.0 in the following way,
      you also conform to 508 if you do these extra
      things."

I think that UAAG 1.0 and Section 508 are sufficiently
different that documents a and b may be suprisingly
different.
