AG::

People are populating the template that describes how their products address
the 508 provisions.  If you want to think about what we really want we want
them to be able to publish one page that serves both questions.

So: a key report generator application is one that gathers these pages and
presents the information contained there appropriately for UAAG-driven queries.

One way to get a more robust engine is to kick ideas around in ER.  There is
technology and tool-building capability lurking there and susceptible to
recruiting for the right compliance assessment tasks.

And we should be coordinating with BuyAccessible at Section508.gov.  They want
to be able to treat the template-following pages that live on the Web as a
database, too.  If people should actually be putting these pages up in some
strict flavor of HTML for post-processing into the BuyAccessible database, it
will help 508.gov and it will help us.  Or they may have an XML or other
data-entry format for submission to the database that we can learn from.
