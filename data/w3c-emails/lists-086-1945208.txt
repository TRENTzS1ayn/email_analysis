Belated congratulations on your UAAG Candidate Recommendation [1] and
Techniques [2].

The overall impression is beautiful, direct writing with no wasted
resources.

I think you could improve readability by pruning meta-information, and
listing all parts in the introduction (less prose, one list). For
example, write in the introduction some variation of:
- Guidelines
- Checkpoints
- Linear Checklist
- Tabular Checklist
- Summary
- Techniques
- Techniques Topics
This sets expectations. The reader will know ahead of time that after
reading the eventual Recommendation, there is more to know.

Related, it wasn't until I reached the summary, after reading the whole
spec, that it was clear the checkpoints are what UAs need to conform
to. As UAAG goes beyond "Guidelines," this can be said up front.
Apologies if I missed a cue.

Where possible, UAAG could use XHTML examples instead of HTML. For
example, in chapter 4, Empty content under Content:
   (e.g., the HR element in HTML).
becomes:
   (e.g., the hr element in XHTML).

Globally, elements, attributes, and properties can all be marked up
<code> (or not). Right now some are; some are not.

ECommerce/Micropayments is a closed Activity. I am not certain that
UAAG can refer to [MICROPAYMENT] as anything more than a "Working
Draft" or a "work in progress."

When referring to "National" organizations, say USA National.

The selectors in the local style sheet should all be lowercase (div,
span, dt, dd, p, hr, img, ul, li) for XHTML.
http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/CR-UAAG10-20010912/style/default.css

Every chapter except cover could link to the style sheet
http://www.w3.org/StyleSheets/TR/W3C-CR . I guess what you have makes
sense for printing, but for online reading, the TR style sheet keeps
"W3C Candidate Recommendation" in view at all times in smart browsers,
part of the W3C brand. Compare to, for example, another multi-page
Recommendation, XHTML 1.1.

There could be a [next] or [next chapter] link at the bottom of cover.

Globally, "level" or "Level" for WCAG (probably not both).

Globally, Document Type Definition -> document type definition

Below, minor editorial comments are a quote followed by a suggestion on
the next line.


Guidelines
==========
In checkpoint 3.3 (guidelines, checklist and linear checklist), cut the
period in "content. as".

In the checklist and linear checklist, "This document has been produced
as part of the Web Accessibility Initiative. WAI...." could say "...Web
Accessibility Initiative (WAI). WAI...."

Chapter 3
---------
It might be easier to follow the examples if the terms were given
first. In other words, build up to a claim rather than take one apart.
Just a thought.


Chapter 4
---------
Could "state" be defined (if only in a definition that uses the term)?

In Configure, control, this sentence is too long:
   Furthermore, the term "control" typically means that the change can
   be made easily (such as through a keyboard shortcut) and that the
   results of the change occur immediately, whereas the term
   "configure" typically means that making the change requires more
   time and effort (such as making the change via a series of menus
   leading to a dialog box, via style sheets or scripts, etc.) and
   that the results of the change may not take effect immediately
   (e.g., due to time spent reinitializing the system, initiating a
   new session, rebooting the system).

Then a new paragraph could start before "In order to be able to...".

Minor point in Content, "context" sounds like both content and text.
   3. It is used in the context of the phrases non-text content and
   text content.

"invisible content" is marked up under Content like this:

but Text content, non-text element, text equivalent, and
non-text equivalent are simply quoted. Should they be bold?

Use the real titles of CSS1 and CSS2; "Recommendation" looks like it
was added.

Summary
-------
Present the concepts of guidelines and checkpoints in the same order
they are presented in the spec.

I clicked the [guidelines] link at the bottom and accidentally went to
the 300+k single file. I think this link should go to the cover page
(or to guidelines.html).
