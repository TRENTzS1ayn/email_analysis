in HTML 4 I believe that you can specify the player to be used for a given
object, but I don't think it is required. You should be able to specify the
data source, and type, and have your browser find you a player if it has one.

  I am unaware of ways to author content where the author
  specifies what piece of software should be used to render
  something at the other end.

  Thus, I interpret your question to be about IE options,
  and for those questions I suggest that you consult
  the IE documentation.
