Ian and I have reviewed UAAG and 508 and published a new draft of the 
comparison.  The main conclusion is that there are many differences between 
the requirements of the two documents.  Please review the new draft 
comparison [1] and send comments to the list.

Thank you to Katie and Jim for getting this started.

Jon
