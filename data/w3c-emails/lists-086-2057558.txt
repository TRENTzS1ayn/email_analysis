Hello,

Please review the revised UAWG charter [1]. The
only changes since the previous discussion of
the charter (20 Dec 2001 [2]) are in the IPR section.
This section has been updated to reflect W3C's "Current
Patent Practice" [3]. Similar language has been included in
recent charters for the Web Services Activity.

Please note in particular the following paragraph:

   "Members of the Working Group are expected to disclose
    any intellectual property they have in the area. This
    WG will work on a royalty-free basis, as defined in
    the W3C Current Patent Practice document. The Working
    Group is thus obliged to produce a specification which
    relies only on intellectual property available on a
    royalty-free basis."

We can discuss this revision at today's teleconference.

  - Ian
