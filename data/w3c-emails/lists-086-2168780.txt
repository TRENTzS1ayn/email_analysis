Dear UAWG,

In response to concerns expressed by some participants
about the language in the IPR section of the revised
UAWG charter [1], the language has been changed to
the simplified in referring to the Current Patent
Practice document of 24 Jan 2002. From the charter:

<blockquote>
W3C promotes an open working environment. Whenever possible, 
technical decisions should be made unencumbered by intellectual 
property right (IPR) claims.

This is a Royalty Free Working Group, as described in the 24 January 
2002 version of W3C's Current Patent Practice.

Working Group participants disclose patent claims by sending email 
to <patent-issues@w3.org>; please see Current Patent Practice for 
more information about disclosures.

If and when W3C institutes a more formal patent policy, the UAWG 
charter will be revised, following the recommendations of the Patent 
Policy Working Group, in a manner consistent with the IPR goals of 
the current charter: that the UAWG produce deliverables that ought 
to be implementable royalty-free.
</blockquote>

Please indicate any objections to this language by 28 Feb 2002
at 2pm ET. Thank you,

   - Ian
