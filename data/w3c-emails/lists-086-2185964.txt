==========
Discussion
==========

1. Revised IPR provision of UAWG charter
    http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/charter-20011218

IJ discussed changes to the UAWG charter that simplify
the language and refer to the Current Patent Practice
document:
    http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/charter-20011218

Revised Action Items:

TL and RS:
  Let Ian know about IPR requirements in new charter by 28 February

-------------------------------
2. Implementation Report Update
 
http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/implementation/report-cr2-checkpoint-summary
-------------------------------

IJ: New Mozilla report:
     http://www.mozilla.org/projects/ui/accessibility/w3c-uaag

RS: I think that requiring two implementations of each feature
     of UAAG 1.0 is asking too much.

DP: I have most of work done on my review of IE 6 with Jaws for
Windows 4.01 on Windows XP. Should be ready by next Tuesday.

IJ: I will meet with Tantek Celik re: Mac IE next week.

IJ: All of this data gathering will help us make decisions about
how to move forward with the document. Please continue to ask people
to evaluate products and find existing implementations.

JG: By next week, I will have:
  a) Integrated reviews
  b) Updated report structure

3. Next meeting: 14 March

JG: Please note: We will meet at 1pm ET rather than 2pm ET so
    that people can meet with the W3C QA Working Group to talk
    about test suites.

JG: We will talk about extent of implementation experience
on 14 March, having incorporated all the reviews we have
into the implementation report.

4. Internet Explorer Comm Bands and Browser Helper Objects

JG: Refer to student project on BHO's.
     Apologies: The document is not very accessible.
     http://slappy.cs.uiuc.edu/fall01/team1/

    a. Outline view (Band Object)
       Headers
       Links
       MAP elements
       Accesskeys
    b. Navigation and activation of mouse event handlers
       with the keyboard (popup)
    c. Dynamic application of user style sheets (popup)

JG: These should get us some more checkpoint implementation
experience.

JG: When done, I will send URIs to people who can
download and test this software.
