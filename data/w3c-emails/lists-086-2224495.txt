I have readied an implemantion report on the Windows Mozilla Browser's 
UAAG conformance.

Please keep in mind this is for Mozilla, not Netscape. We also did not 
evaluate Mozilla on UNIX/Linux or Mac.

Here is the report:

If you're interested in more about Mozilla accessibility, visit our 
project page:

I'm interested in any and all feedback.

Thank you,

Aaron Leventhal
