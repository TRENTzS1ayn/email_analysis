Hi Rich,

The good news is that I've been using the document
with a lot of different developers and we haven't seen
any really major issues. On the other hand, because
the document continues to be scrutinized, it's only
natural for people to request clarification. For instance,
Tantek Celik has now reviewed the document in depth
with me on 3 occasions for a total of about 20 hours
of work. Each time we find a few things that require
clarification, but less and less. The major principles
seem quite stable; the comments below are largely
just requests for clarification.

  -Ian
