Freedom Scientific markets their products as making use of the DOM. 
However, they are not talking about the W3C DOMs -- they are talking 
about proprietary DOMs such as those that exist in Microsoft Word or 
Microsoft Excel via very powerful COM or ActiveX interfaces. For their 
Internet Explorer support they currently parse the HTML themselves.

Anyway, I think what a "DOM" is, is clear to us in the context of W3C 
document, but may not be clear to AT vendors who use many different 
kinds of DOMs. They are probably interested in any kinjd of 
cross-process interfaces that give them content..

In addition, the W3C DOM does not say anything about user intefaces, 
unless they are written in markup, which is not always the case. How 
does the UAAG suggest we expose information about our user interface 
widgets?
