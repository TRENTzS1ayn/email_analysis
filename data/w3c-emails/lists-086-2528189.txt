This is covered in checkpoint 6.4:

    1. Provide programmatic read access to user agent
       user interface controls.

The checkpoint goes on to explain our preferred API "cascade",

  - A W3C Recommendation (if applicable)
  - A publicly documented API for communication with ATs.

Either one will work to satisfy the requirement.
