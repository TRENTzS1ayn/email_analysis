Hi Jill,

This is my responce to Jill Thomas president of ION System about Web Eyes. 
The original message was posted to several mailing lists, but because Jill 
seems not to be subscribed to all these lists the message was not deliverd. 
You find the original message from Jill Thomas after my comments.

First I'm glad to read, that ION Systems agree with us, that Web Eyes is 
not the solution for domain owners to make there web sites accessible. I 
also hope, that they change statements about this on their web site. At 
this moment the only way to make web sites accessible seems to be to 
implement the W3C accessibility guidelines. Most users need specific tools 
to access the Internet. These tools work best if web sites respect and 
implemented the W3C accessibility guidelines.

Web Eyes is a tool, that reformats web pages with low vision people in 
mind. We already know more tools like this, like WebFormator and Web Wizard.

As I already told you. In my opinion Web Eyes can be a useful tool for a 
group of people, but I absolutely do not agree with the registration 
pollicy. This will not work at all. You now suggests, that people can use 
Web Eyes for free, but how much domains will register do you think? And if 
some register, what if the number of tools grow with the same concept? Must 
domains register for 100 or more tools, that improves access to their web 
sites. Users do not only want to read web sites that pay, but only those 
not paying or can not pay?
Do not sell this tool like a way to make a web site accessible!

You have a good point, that the W3C accessibility guidelines and section 
508 pay less attention to the growing group of low vision people. I 
discussed this with the WAI in the past and I agree with the WAI, that 
solutions should be solved in user agent definitons, but I do not see any 
improvements in this area.  Internet Explorer gives some options for 
accessibility settings, but most of them causes a lot of problems on a lot 
of pages. The largest font setting in Internet Explorer is much too small 
for low vision users and setting a large font in Internet Explorer causes 
text to hide on web pages and a lot of track bars, that are difficult to 
handle for low vision users.
In Opera it is possible to set a much higher font size and this browser is 
also resizing images, but also here you get the problem of hidden 
information and trackbars.
For this reason Web Eyes can be a very helpful tool if it will be highly 
improved in  next releases. For example images are not magnified, the color 
scheme make pages sometimes unreadable, setting the largest font causes 
also information to hide, some screen readers can not read the Web Eyes 
page at all, the application menu and buttons are as inaccessible for low 
vision as those in Internet Explorer, because they are also too small  etc. 
etc.
If Web Eyes realy wants to be an alternative for a screen reader or screen 
magnifier I should handle JavaScript, flash and Java.

I agree with you, that too less attention is paid to the growing group of 
elderly people with vision loss. Every day I receive messages from this 
group and their children asking me to help. For a lot of them a screen 
magnifier seems not to work, because of the complexity and the difficulties 
they met in moving the magnification.

In my opinion the WAI should specify more guidelines, that improves access 
for this group. To be honest I wished, that user agents were much more 
flexible than they are now. That the user can reformat pages with a press 
of a key. Load and unload images with a press of key. That there was an 
option to present text on a screen without trackbars, without loss of 
information. For example there are a lot of web sites where I can select 
something in a top frame and see the result of the selection in the bottom 
frame. If I specify a large font in Internet Explorer and check to always 
use this font in the IE Accessibility options I can not select anything on 
these pages, because trackbars are disabled and the selection options hide 
under the bottom frame. I see this on thousans of web pages. Why such 
problems can not be solved in Internet Explorer? A growing group of web 
designers is designing their page on a 800 x 600 resolution with a specific 
font size specified in the web page. If the end user sets the display 
resolution to 640 x 480 to get larger text the result is pages that are 
realy difficult to access.

For these problems Web Eyes can help much and I also like to help ION 
Systems to improve the product, but please stop the statements about "cost 
effective" and suggesting, that by registering Web Eyes web sites can  be 
made accessible.
