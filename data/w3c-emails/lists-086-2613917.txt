I noticed that your charter said that DOM implementation issues was out of 
scope for you document.  I have concerns here, since one of the issues in 
the User Agent working group is dealing with is access to secure documents 
for alternative rendering.  Ideally this would be a lot easier if there was 
an interoperable way for security information to transmitted through the 
DOM.  UAAG has a requirement to export the DOM to assistive technologies 
for them to provide alternative renderings of alternative controls.

I think that a standard dom implementation for people to gain access to 
content in a secure way is important for accessibility.  I am not sure how 
this translates into your requirements document.
