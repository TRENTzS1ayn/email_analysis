Discussion

1. DOM requirements for UAAG 1.0 (AT developers invited)
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2002JanMar/0085.html

AT Developers invited:
Aaron Smith (GW-Micro), confirmed
Cathy Laws (IBM), confirmed
Glenn Gordon (Freedom - Scientific), confirmed
Randy Marsden (Madenta), confirmed
Mark Nelson (AI-squared)
Jill Thomas (Ion Systems), confirmed
Loretta Guarino and Richard Potter (Adobe), confirmed
Larry Lake (Alva), will not be attending

Question: Central question is whether the W3C DOM should be the only way to 
satisfy communication between user agents and assistive technologies. We 
really need to understand what AT developers need from mainstream 
developers in terms of communication of web content information. We have 
long held the position of the W3C DOM, but there has not been much 
implementation of this technique by AT developers. Is this still the 
direction UAAG 1.0 needs to go or are other options needed to satisfy this 
requirement?

2. Ian's proposals based on UAAG evaluations with developers
