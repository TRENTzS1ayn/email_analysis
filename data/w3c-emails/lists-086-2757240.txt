Recently the discussion of thread safety came up - the question was:
Is thread safety necessary to make a DOM implementation useful to AT 
vendors.

Originally I thought thread safety was critical. I have since changed my 
mind.

It's possible for an AT vendor to install a stub component that talks to 
Gecko's DOM, on the main thread.
This component can act as a bridge, and talk to the main AT process. 
Thus, it is entirely possible to use all of Gecko's DOM interfaces in a 
safe manner without requiring thread safety.

We can come up with some sample code, if any AT vendors are interested 
in pursuing this further with us.

Thank you,
