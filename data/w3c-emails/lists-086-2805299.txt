Here is a list of information requirements that I believe need to be met to
implement an AT like Home Page Reader:

1. For each element (DOM node) as well as at the page and frame level, be
able to:
- Retrieve and change all content
- Retrieve and change all attribute information
- Receive event notifications and all related information:
      - For all mouse events and their character and pixel location
      - For all keys pressed and all their information, like is it from the
numpad
      - For all changes to any content or states/attributes
      - Others
- Determine it's containing structure (form, table, frame, page, etc)
- Simulate events on every element even if not a link or control-type
element (left or right mouse click, mouseover, set focus, etc)

2. For each character on a web page, be able to:
- Retrieve and change the actual presentation attributes as displayed
- Determine where it is in the document (DOM node and character offset) as
well as pixel location
- Simulate an event even if not in a link or control-type element (left or
right mouse click)
- Receive event notifications for all mouse click and keyboard events

3. Ability to find the process/window for and place keyboard focus on an
embedded object or applet.

4. The information and events from the APIs and DOMs must reflect the web
document displayed (i.e. both must include error correction or not).

5. Ability to select/highlight text, controls, and images at character
offsets programmatically like you can select with a mouse.

I may think of more later...
