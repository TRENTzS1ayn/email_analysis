This is a summary of yesterdays DOM meeting discussions.  Please correct or 
add to this summary.

AT developer use of the DOM:
1. Availability of standard C++ interfaces to the DOM would simplify 
development

2. DOM does not contain browser repair information and this places the 
burden on the AT developer to repair broken HTML

3. DOM does not contain browser repair information and this provides an 
opportunity to AT developers to apply their own repair strategies

4. DOM is very useful, but does not provide everything that we need to 
create alternative interfaces for some types of disabilities, notably 
graphical rendering information. (Note:  The working group has already 
dealt with the rendering information issue and decided not to make it a 
requirement of UAAG.  Using the DOM the AT can calculate rendering 
information and some implemented DOMs provide access to run time styling 
information.)

5. Thread safety is an important feature in some OSes, especially if 
modifying the DOM.

6. DOM implementations are not stable and cause software instabilities

7. Developers are concerned with more than just browser accessibility, so 
accessibility APIs are important for within platform compatibility with 
other non-browser applications.

8. Documented APIs are the highest priority and cross platform is the 
second priority

9. Experience Summary:
a. Some developers are using the DOM plus other things for their AT product
b. Some tried the DOM, but did not work for their product and using other 
things
c. Some do not know enough about the DOM to know if it would help in their 
product
d. Some developers are actively concerned about cross platform product issue
