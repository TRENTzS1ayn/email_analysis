One place to start would be in what is in use in the field, see for example:

 http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/implementation/eval_win_wineyes411.html#missing-alt

 http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/implementation/eval_win_jaws402.html#missing-alt

  Verbose Images
         Controls whether or not Lynx replaces the [LINK], [INLINE] and
         [IMAGE] comments (for images without ALT) with filenames of
         these images. This is extremely useful because now we can
         determine immediately what images are just decorations
         (button.gif, line.gif) and what images are important. This
         setting can also be toggled on startup via the -verbose switch.
