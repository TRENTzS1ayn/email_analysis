Ian,

The note on checkpoint 1.1 makes it sound like mouse keys can be used to 
conform to the keyboard input requirement.  We don't want to imply that.  I 
think it should be clearer that user agents need to be compatible with 
mouse keys, but that supporting mousekeys does not satisfy the conformance 
requirements for checkpoint 1.1 for keyboard access.

Jon
