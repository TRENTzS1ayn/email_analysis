Ian,
Suggested change:

Note: User agents should support at least two types of keyboard access to 
functionalities: direct and sequential access (where user awareness of a 
location "in space" is not required, as is the case with keyboard shortcuts 
and navigation of user agent menus).  Spatial keyboard access (where the 
user moves the pointing device "in space" via the keyboard) is required for 
functionalities that cannot be made available by direct or sequential 
access.  For example, when the position "in space" is an important part of 
the functionality (i.e. a program to manipulate a bit-mapped image).  In 
most cases the direct and sequential access techniques will be redundant 
with spatial techniques associated with a pointing device.  Furthermore, 
the user agent should satisfy this requirement by offering a combination of 
keyboard-operable user interface controls (e.g., keyboard operable print 
menus and settings) and direct keyboard operation of user agent 
functionalities (e.g., a short cut to print the current page). As examples 
of functionalities, ensure that the user can interact with enabled 
elements, select content, navigate viewports, configure the user agent, 
access documentation, install the user agent, operate controls of the user 
interface, etc., all entirely through keyboard input. It is also possible 
to claim conformance to this document for full support through pointing 
device input and voice input. See the section on Input modality labels.
