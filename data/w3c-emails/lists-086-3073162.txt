trouble with any embedded sound is it is inaccessible to a large
population without sound cards or the appropriate platform no matter
what audio format you use.  Trouble with real audio is that it is not
available to all platforms and even on those that it is available for,
requires additional software/plug in.  best audio is .wav or other
native formats since they require only the existing built in processors.

Ian,
Suggested change:

Note: User agents should support at least two types of keyboard access
to
functionalities: direct and sequential access (where user awareness of a
location "in space" is not required, as is the case with keyboard
shortcuts
and navigation of user agent menus).  Spatial keyboard access (where the
user moves the pointing device "in space" via the keyboard) is required
for
functionalities that cannot be made available by direct or sequential
access.  For example, when the position "in space" is an important part
of
the functionality (i.e. a program to manipulate a bit-mapped image).  In
most cases the direct and sequential access techniques will be redundant
with spatial techniques associated with a pointing device.  Furthermore,
the user agent should satisfy this requirement by offering a combination
of
keyboard-operable user interface controls (e.g., keyboard operable print
menus and settings) and direct keyboard operation of user agent
functionalities (e.g., a short cut to print the current page). As
examples
of functionalities, ensure that the user can interact with enabled
elements, select content, navigate viewports, configure the user agent,
access documentation, install the user agent, operate controls of the
user
interface, etc., all entirely through keyboard input. It is also
possible
to claim conformance to this document for full support through pointing
device input and voice input. See the section on Input modality labels.
