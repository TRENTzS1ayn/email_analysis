Ian,

Didn't we talk about including information about the types of bindings to 
the DOM.  ECMA script and Java are defined by the DOM spec, but I think we 
also wanted to mention that other types of bindings (e.g. C++) are useful 
to assistive technology vendors, even though they are not required by our 
document and many not support interoperability.
