The way that CSS handles this, with computed values and actual values, is
probably a good model. Basically there is the theoretical value of something,
which might be rounded off, but some calculations are required to be done on
the theroetical value while others can be applied to the actual value being
used.

In CSS1 the relevant paragraph is the last in the section 6 - units at
http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS1#length-units (helps to have an outline
navigation function I guess) as part of the chapter on units, and in CSS2 it
is at section 6.1 "Specified, Computed and Actual values" at
http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/cascade.html#q1
