    1. Allow one master configuration setting the general sizing of visually
       rendered text.  Preserve larger/smaller relationships 
       between text fragments of different sizes as their respective 
       sizes change in response to this setting.

<option2>

    1. Allow configuration of the general sizing of visually
       rendered text.  Preserve text-size distinctions in 
       the text as the general sizing increases and decreases.

</option2>

Note that either optional language offered above does not _disallow_ meeting
this by proportional scaling, it just does not *require* proportional scaling.

The second option is more compact, but is more likely to be misunderstood.
What we want to be true is that if text A is smaller than text B at one value
of this configuration setting, that text A will still be smaller than text B
at another value of this configuration setting.  I think I favor the shorter
one, but I could live with any of the above.

The as-is version does have the difficulty that some will read it literally
as the numeric difference in the size number should be preserved, and it is
not our intent to require that, specifically, either.  It is also confusing
as to the sense of 'global' configuration.  It is meant to imply global across
the whole corpus of pages processed through the User Agent at that setting, 
as well as an adjustment that applies globally to all the sizes applied to
distinct classes of text content.

[Aside: In my model of the extreme style adjuster, this is not always true, just
a guideline to follow so far as possible.  Eventually we start shifting the
means of conveying distinctions from text size to other property dimensions 
such as bolding and prefix/suffix text inserts such as we use in Braille.  The 
ultimate rule is that a) distinctions and b) relative prominence shall be 
preserved so far as possible.  And that to the extent possible, distinctions 
that the author conveyed in text size will be expressed in text size etc.  But 
the latter will be violated before we give up on the former.  However, we are 
not asking them to implement the extreme capability.  That's for the 
experimental agenda.]
