I don't mind option two, in particular the second sentence (with a 
clarification along the lines of proportional scaling is not 
required, and the recommended approach is the one along the lines Al
described.

I have trouble with "general sizing". I prefer "scale", unless
that necessarily connotes proportional scaling. Would it
be sufficient to say the following:

<proposed>

  1. Allow global configuration of the scale of visually rendered
     text. Preserve distinctions among the size of rendered text as
     the user increases or decreases the scale.

  Normative exclusion: The user agent is not required to satisfy this
  requirement through proportional scaling. What must hold is that
  if text A is smaller than text B at one value of this configuration
  setting, that text A will still be smaller than text B at another
  value of this configuration setting.

  In the techs document:

     The ratios of the sizes should be compressed at large
     text sizes, as the same number of different sizes must
     be packed into a smaller dynamic range.
</proposed>

If scale doesn't work, I could live with "general size" rather
than "sizing". I thought about "overall size" but people may think
of pants...

Please refer to the glossary for the answer to your question. You 
may respond "I shouldn't have to refer to the glossary". But there 
are enough questions about the scope of the configuration to have 
earned a term, and "global" seems no worse than "master" to me: you 
still have to look at the glossary for details.
