AG: this works for me.  With the very explicit "normative exclusion" the term 'scale' 
has to be interpreted loosely.

Editorial nit:  Prefer "distinctions in the size of rendered text," as with "among" one 
expects a plural object.  Make it a blorp of stuff rather than a number of things.

But there are enough questions about the scope of the configuration to have earned a term, and "global" seems no worse than "master" to me: you still have to look at the glossary for details.
