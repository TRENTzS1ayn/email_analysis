"JustVanilla is the 'web-accessibility' service that enables people
with disabilities, especially visual disabilities, to easily access and use
the Internet. ..."

"There are over thirty web accessibility features designed into JustVanilla and
stored on the web to help people with disabilities. Any combination of these
features can be selected and retained by the user to suit their individual
accessibility needs. Most web page content of the 30 million sites on the web
can then be automatically delivered through our 'Access Gateway' in a form that
overcomes many of the problems of inaccessible website design,  technology, and
downloading of unnecessary material. A separately purchased state of the 
art, and
feature rich, talking browser called VanillaTalk complements the 
'accessibility'
features on the website and extends its use."
