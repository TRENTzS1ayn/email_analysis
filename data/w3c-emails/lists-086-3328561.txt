> Dear Chairs,
> 
> The User Agent Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (UAWG) 
> is scheduling its fourth last call for the User Agent 
> Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG) 1.0. The UAWG will conduct 
> this last call review in light of some substantial changes 
> (primarily deletions) made to the document following an 
> 11-month Candidate Recommendation period.
> 
> The UAWG expects to start last call between 9-16 August, and 
> to end around 13 September (approximately 4-5 weeks later). 
> The UAWG has already received substantial technical review 
> from developers, W3C Working Groups, and people in the 
> disability community. Though some of the changes since the 
> Candidate Recommendation are substantive, most are 
> clarifications based on user agent evaluations conducted with 
> developers.  The proposed dates take into account this 
> experience, as well as August vacations.
> 
>                        Deadline: 22 July 2001
> 
> By 22 July, please send email to w3c-wai-ua@w3.org (archives 
> publicly visible) indicating your commitment to review the 
> upcoming last call document during the indicated dates. If 
> you cannot review the document during this period, or if you 
> do not intend to review the document, we request a reply stating this.
> 
> While we will welcome review from all interested groups, we 
> request review specifically from the following groups:
> 
>     DOM WG
>     HTML WG
>     Internationalization WG/IG
>     SYMM IG
>     SVG WG
>     Protocols and Formats WG
>     Web Content Accessibility Guidelines WG
>     Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines WG
