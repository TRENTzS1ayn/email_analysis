Mission

Equality of opportunity, equal access to accommodations, and equality
before the law are recognized as basic American principles. These principles
entail another equal access to information. Project Archimedes seeks to promote
equal access to information for individuals with disabilities by 
influencing the
early design stages of tomorrow's computer-based technology.
