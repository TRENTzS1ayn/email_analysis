These guys have an approach which is based on making the system figure out
what is going on - in other words, the focus is in the user agent. They also
take the approach of developing an off-screen model in explicit contrast to
working through APIs - this requires more processing but it is flexible
across changes of systems (since user interface conventions change much
slower than the underlying systems as a rule).

Nonetheless it is interesting stuff and I think they would be useful
reviewers.

My sole contact with them is that I saw a presentation by Neil Scott in New
Zealand (where he is from) last year, and had a short chat.

cheers
