Ian,

Per our last phone call, I did a review of section 6 and agree with its
content. What I would recommend, however, is that the pixel-level
information mentioned in Note for 6.4 be explicitly called out for in the
techniques document for example:

- Do we want the foreground and background color at the pixel location?
- Do we want the bounding rectangle for an element at a given pixel
location?
- For a given pixel location do we want the corresponding DOM node and
offset of the element?
