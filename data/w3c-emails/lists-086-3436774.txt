Hi Harvey,

Thanks for sending in your review! I have snipped out
your editorial comments (and will incorporate them) or suggestions
for clarification.

We are saying what functionalities are "not required". Another way 
to talk about this is to say that something is "optional" (see
RFC 2119), but I find "not required" is clearer.

They are appendices conceptually, but not in the same physical
file as the guidelines.

I don't know that that would substantially improve the document.

Right. If they are there, they are normative. They are not
in every checkpoint.

If you conform unconditionally, you support the events checkpoints.
But you may conform conditionally and not support them.

I don't think the word "back" is necessary or adds much to the
sentence.

I think we meant element instances here: move focus, for example
to an element instance and query it. The element type information
may be useful in configuring structured navigation.

I think that that developers would explain why in the alert.

If there is strong support for adding this, I'm ok with it.
We had not decided as a group to include this in the list.

Does changing this to "animated or blinking"?

We discussed the definition of blink and chose
not to restrict requirement on blinking text to the range of 2 Hz to 
55 Hz (as is done in section 508). See issue 502 [1]

That's either defined by the specification or covered by
checkpoint 2.3.

Yes.

Yes, after the publication of this document. That change will
appear in the next draft.

The requirement is not to advance 3 second. The "that last three
or more seconds" qualifies the content. Brief sounds etc. are not
covered by this checkpoint.

I am happy to add this to the Techniques document.

This is a known feature of UAAG 1.0 (see issue 127 [2]). The UAWG
has chosen to leave this requirement in UAAG 1.0 with details
in the Techniques Doc to give an idea of what's expected.

That's interesting, but I'm not sure that it's desirable.
For instance, I don't see why the "print" function should be
less accessible because the developer didn't follow the
operating environment's input config conventions.

Described in the Techniques Document:

     "1. Refer to the HTTP/1.1 specification for information about
         history mechanisms ([RFC2616], section 13.13)."

We chose not to require reverse search in this checkpoint. I don't
have a pointer to the decision, however. That functionality is 
listed in "Doing more" in the Techniques Document.

>

We discussed this (issue 418 [3]) and concluded "only if
rendered." Hence the current wording of the checkpoint.

I don't understand this.

Horizontal scroll bars are one way to indicate position in a
two-dimensional rendering, and that's required per this
inclusion. I'm not sure what "alterntive" presentation means.

This has been the requirement since the 28 July 2000 draft:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20000728/

We resolved not to require override of author-specified bindings
at the 24 July 2000 teleconference:

I am happy to expand the acronym, but I don't want to define DTD.

I don't think we need to define that. We explain in Guideline 6
that other ATs may use the keyboard API. We have no requirements
related to a keyboard equivalent.
