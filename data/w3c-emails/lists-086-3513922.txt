Lisa,

HTML 4.01 does not define a low resolution alternative to the SRC image of 
an IMAGE element and the UAAG documents do not require this feature.

Some browsers like Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator 4.x do support 
an attribute for images called LOWSRC.  Apparently this is used if the user 
has slow Internet access.  The browser would load the LOWSRC image I guess 
while it continues to download the primary image.  I don't know if you can 
set the browser to always load the lowsrc if it is available.

Hope this helps,
Jon
