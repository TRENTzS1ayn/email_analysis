The more I think about this checkpoint, the more I fear
that it's extremely vague as written:

    "1.  For graphical user agents, provide programmatic read access
         to visually rendered information."

This is the first appearance of this checkpoint. It has not
received the same level of scrutiny as other checkpoints
in pursuit of minimal requirements. Rich's comment highlights
that fact.

I think the Working Group needs to spend some time identifying
a minimal set of requirements for rendered information that
must be available through an API.

Input from people with experience using MSAA and other
APIs is extremely important here.

Thank you,

  _ Ian
