Tom Gilder raised in wai-ig the fact that the above also needs to cover
elements with CSS overflow property set to produce scrollbars - the
element with the scrollbars needs to be able to recieve focus - Mozilla
currently does not make these elements accessible, and IE requires the use
of the proprietary tabindex extension as an author.

I propose changing "including frames" to "including frames, and any
element which can be scrolled" (or similar)

Jim.
