I suspect that what you are asking for is already covered:

  * You must be able to move the content focus to any
    enabled element. Whether you consider the scrolled
    element as part of the same or different viewport,
    checkpoint 9.1 as written covers what you're asking
    for.

  * If you are talking about operating the scrollbars
    themselves through the keyboard, that's covered
    by checkpoint 1.1.

Does this sound correct?
