Dear UAWG,

I am pleased to announce the publication of the 28 July 2002 UAAG
1.0 [1] and Techniques documents [2].  Please consult the list of
changes [3] from the 8 July 2002 draft.

The primary changes are:

  * Conformance section revamped and simplified. If you've never
    understood conformance to UAAG 1.0 before, I suggest reading
    this draft.
  * Incorporated resolutions from 11 and 25 July teleconfs.
  * Lots of editorial improvements based on reviews by
    Harvey and Eric.

Still to do:

  - I am still expecting to incorporate comments from Eric
    on the Techniques Document.

  - I think checkpoint 6.4 needs review and needs to be
    much more specific (along the lines of comments made
    by Rich [4]). We need to settle on language quickly.


- Ian
