Hi Lisa,
while there is not a specific tag, you could add information about the
purpose for the graphic in the "alt" or "title" of the picture. That
information would alert a blind user to the purpose of the graphic. I think
it is a great idea!

Subject: question about accessible pictures



Hi,
I am a reader of this list. I have a question
and  hope it isn't too stupid, and not wasting
your time.

I work with tactile graphics for the blind and
visually impaired.

With alternative text I know there is long
discription tag and etc. I was wondering
if there is something similar for a graphic that
is alternative to the regular graphic.

I am thinking of a tag for a graphic that is specially
designed for graphics on microcapsule paper (a black and
white gif that is later copied to a special paper)or an included
embosser file or for visually impaired an adapted graphic.

Something similar to the low source for graphics which wouldn't
show up for most but there and available.

Thank you for your time.

Lisa Yayla

IJ: For checkpoint 4.14: Indicate in Note that allowing the user to
select
more than one style sheet may be a useful way to implement other

requirements (e.g., available on the Web; this would allow user agents
to
improve accessiblity of deployed user agents).
