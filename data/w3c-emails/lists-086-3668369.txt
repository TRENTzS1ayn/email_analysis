Ian and I have been discussing the lack of requirements in Checkpoint 
6.4.  This kind of sticks out in a document that has specific requirements 
for almost all of the other checkpoints.  The checkpoint point would have a 
total of 3 required provisions (2 more than now) and 2 optional 
provisions.  The changes were based on information gathered from AT 
developers and the working group.

Please RESPOND as soon as possible to this e-mail on whether you agree or 
disagree with the changes.

I would like to proposed the following change to checkpoint 6.4:

Checkpoint 6.4 Programmatic access to information about rendered content.. 
(P1)

Provision 1: Make available bounding dimensions and location of rendered 
graphical objects

Provision 2: Provide access to the following information about each piece 
of rendered text:
a. font-family
b. font-weight (e.g. bold)
c. font-style (e.g. italic)
d. font-size
e. text decorations (e.g. underline, strike through)
g. foreground color
h. background color

Provision 3: As part of satisfying the provisions of this checkpoint, 
implement at least one API according to the API cascade described in 
provision two of checkpoint 6.3.

Note(1): The API used to provide access to visually rendered information 
should provide access to both structured information and pixel-level 
information. User agents should also provide information about the 
correspondence (in both directions) between locations in content and 
related locations in the rendering structure."

Note(2): The user agent should also provide access to information about 
each graphical object, such as its role, a text description and other 
useful information in describing the state and content of the object.
