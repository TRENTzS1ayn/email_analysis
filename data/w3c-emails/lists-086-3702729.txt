Works  for me.

Does this have to be the rendered form, the author-specified form, or are
either OK? (For example, an author may have specified two different fonts,
and the User Agent may render the first one, or the second if it lacks the
first, or neither, if it doesn't have them. Alternatively they may have been
overridden by an author style sheet, or a high-contrast setting might be
causing rendering in black and white when the autor has specified several
colours).
