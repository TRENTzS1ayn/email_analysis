We need to have information about:

object 's bounding rectangle in screen coordinates
bounding rectangle of active elements withing an image map in screen
coordinates

These would assist magnification software in knowing where to focus on
elements.

I think that this is a good improvement.

The only thing that seems a slightly vague concerns the last note:

But maybe that is about the very best that can be done at this time.

I am supportive of the change.
