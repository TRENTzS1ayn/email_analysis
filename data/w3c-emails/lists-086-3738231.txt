That's covered by the proposal ("bounding dimensions" just
in case it's not a rectangle).

Checkpoint 6.6 requires notification of changes, including changes
to focus. So through 6.6, a screen magnifier should know which
element has focus.

Checkpoints 6.5 and 6.6 do not say explicitly: You must be able to 
find out which element has focus. However, the definition of
"user agent user interface" includes selection and focus explicitly.
I think no change is required to accomplish Rich's goal. However,
if people feel it would be clearer to say in 6.5 "including
selection, content focus, and user interface focus", that's fine
with me. Furthermore, it would make 6.5 and 6.6 almost identical.
