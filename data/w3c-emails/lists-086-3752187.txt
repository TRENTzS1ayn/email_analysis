I agree with it, but I'm concerned it may be expensive to implement in
current scenarios, and will also rely on the end renderer providing the
information - so if I wanted to make a UA that re-used some components
which doesn't provide exact pixel locations, I have no way to achieve it
(but can get close, it will be what I tell the renderer to do.) - is there
any implementation experience?

Jim,
