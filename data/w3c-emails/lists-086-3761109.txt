Hi Jim,

Thanks for taking the time to comment. Can you say more on what you
think would be expensive to implement? Jon and I reviewed existing
APIs and both MSAA and Java APIs (and probably others) cover the
indicated requirements. In what way would the end user have
to provide information? The user agent ultimately determines the
choice of font families, for example, after taking into account
author preferences, user preferences (in the UA and the Operating
Environment), and available font families (and probably other
factors as well).

Please expand on your scenario.

Thanks!
