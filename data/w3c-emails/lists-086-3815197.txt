Jim,

This requirement was put in because the needs of AT developers to know what 
is on the screen.  They identified that the source as represented by the 
DOM does not always represent what is rendered on the screen.  This is due 
in large part because the HTML is not valid and the DOM and rendering 
engines use different repair strategies.

In the use case you describe this also would seem to be an issue as none of 
the tools knows the exact rendering.  In this case it would the a 
requirement of the final rendering system to make available what actually 
was rendered.

Jon
