Dear UAWG,

I am pleased to announce the publication of the 7 August 2002
UAAG 1.0 [1] and Techniques documents [2].  Please consult the
list of changes [3] from the 28 July 2002 draft.

The primary changes are:

   * Edits to the Techniques Document based on an
     extensive review by Eric Hansen.
   * More clarifications to the introduction of UAAG 1.0
     and chapter 3 on conformance.

Still to do on the document:

   - I expect the UAWG to reduce the scope of checkpoint
     6.4 and decide language at the 8 August teleconference.

Other than changes to checkpoint 6.4, I don't expect to make other 
changes (except for minor tweaks) to the document before returning 
to last call.

Meanwhile, Jon, Matt, Colin Koteles, and I are making progress on
implementation reports and test suites. More on that at
tomorrow's teleconference.

  - Ian
