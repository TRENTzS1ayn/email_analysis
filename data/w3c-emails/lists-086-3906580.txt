Hello all,

I've published the 9 August 2002 UAAG 1.0 [1]
(but no Techniques Document to go with it since
no changes from the 7 August draft). The only
change in this draft is the revised checkpoint
6.4, as decided at yesterday's teleconference.

[Note: the minutes aren't available yet due to
a glitch in the mailing list archive; I'm trying
to have it fixed.]

I don't expect any further changes (other
than minor editorial) before we return to last
call, which I hope will be next week.

Thanks everyone!

  _ Ian
