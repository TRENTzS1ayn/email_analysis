On http://www.hicom.net/~oedipus/wai/ua/tests/scrolling_text_test1.html it says "The first test paragraph contains text which should scroll from right to left 
across the physical screen. The second test paragraph contains text which should scroll from left to right across the physical screen." but it should be 
"The first test paragraph contains text which should scroll from left to right across the physical screen. The second test paragraph contains text which 
should scroll from right to left across the physical screen."
