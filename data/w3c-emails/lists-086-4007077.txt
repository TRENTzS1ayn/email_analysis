Thanks Jim!

Conditional content is defined by specification. For the most
part, UAAG 1.0 says "if you recognize it and it's part of
a claim, you are responsible for it." In some cases (e.g.,
blinking text, image control), UAAG 1.0 says "if you recognize
it and even if it's not part of a claim, you are responsible for
it."

If the content of the foreignObject is defined by specification S,
and S says that it's conditional content, and the user agent
implements S, then the user agent is responsible for making
it available. The "user agent" may include a plug-in specifically
for this rendering.

Otherwise, if the user agent does not implement S or does
not recognize the content as being conditional, it's not responsible
for knowing that it's conditional content. Per checkpoint 2.1,
the user agent is responsible for following specifications for
rendering, so if the content is xml and has associated style sheets,
and the user agent implements xml+style sheets, then the user
agent is again responsible for proper handling.

Where do you define your own semantics?

No, the user agent is not responsible for rendering all formats. You
can define your user agent to encompass as many formats as you wish:
if your user agent consists of an SVG agent and a PDF agent, then
it's responsible for both. Otherwise, you can claim conformance for
the SVG part alone.

Please let me know whether this is clear enough,
