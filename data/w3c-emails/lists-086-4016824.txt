My concern was that SVG defines the content of switch as conditional
content, and therefore when the foreignObject is in a switch element it
is conditional content and therefore a UA would have to render it (even
though it doesn't know anything about HTML, or MathML or whatever)

ie 23.4 in http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/extend.html

which defines conditional content of a foreignObject containing some
HTML, and some SVG text, the UA can safely ignore the HTML portion if it
doesn't understand HTML?

Jim.
