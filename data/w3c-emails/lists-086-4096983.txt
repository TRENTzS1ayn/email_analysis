Hi Ian, etc.

My pleasure; thanks for writing it ;-)

That's good to hear he's aware.  It might not hurt to talk to him and
send a collective e-mail to the devel lists for Konqeuror and maybe
kde-multimedia (or devel lists for specific KDE / GNOME multimedia
projects).  I'd be glad to help / get in on this.  I'll do some
searching for pertinent Nautilis mailing lists or people.

There's also the problem that no non-GNOME user agent is going to be
fully UAAG compliant for a while -- in the KDE accessibility realm,
we're waiting for the GNOME Accessibility Architecture to finish so
then we can adopt it as a common arch.  In other domains (e.g., TCL/Tk,
Motif, etc.) I would suspect it will take even longer because I doubt
they are very accessibility-aware at all.

Ok, thanks for the clarification.

Not exactly, sorry I was a little unclear.  In my mind, there are a
couple tricky points.

1) What happens if an user agent provides multiple ways of installing a
product (say .rpms, .debs, a custom installer) and a couple
documentation formats (e.g., html, latex, custom format).  Do they have
to make sure that all installation methods and documentations formats
have accessible installers and viewers respectively.  How do they
choose which one is "standard" or "conventional"?  Do they have to drop
or make inaccessible installers / format less prominent or harder to
get to?  I'm just worried that might confuse / overwhelm people.

2) There are probably KDE, Qt, and (perhaps several) low-/kernel-level
APIs for things like keyboard access and character encodings.  I think
the logical answer to which API you should choose is "whichever one is
closest to what you write your user agent in and trust that your
toolkit will be smart about it."  In other words, for Konqeuror use
KDE's APIs, for a straight Qt app, use Qt's, etc.  But I think these
needs to be communicated to user agent developers so we don't have a
situation where the KDE media player using a kernel-level API by
accident.

Thanks, will do (in a bit).

I'll look into this.

Yup, gmix is what I use too.

Yes.

I hope so :-)

Aha, I see what you're saying; I should look into this; in fact, the
KDE, Qt, GTK, and C keyboard APIs may all be getting the same
(standard) information in their own, language-specific ways.

No prob.; I think I'll do that.  Yes, a telecon might not hurt.

Best,
