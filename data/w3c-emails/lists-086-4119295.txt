A couple of points:

1) Clearly the folks producing the installation tools need to be
    made aware if the standard mechanisms aren't accessible. This
    would be a problem not specific to user agents.

2) You don't have to claim conformance for everything you do.
    So you could say "Conforms to UAAG 1.0 in the Redhat environment
    but not in Debian" (which would be too bad...). This information
    (which operating environment you are running in) goes in the
    conformance profile.

You don't have to drop anything. But you can't claim conformance
if the requirements aren't met. And, as pointed out above, you can
pick and choose which formats/environments/components/etc. about
which you wish to make a claim.

Right.
