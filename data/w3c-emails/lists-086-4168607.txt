Some comments on the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 (21 August
2002 draft).

Apols if these have been addressed previously.

Printing

The document does not appear to address the printing of resources.  A
page may be rendering correctly on screen, but is corrupted when
printing (as has happened in Netscape).  It would appear that a user
agent could comply with the UAAG, but provide inaccessible hardcopy
output.

LONGDESC

The LONGDESC attribute is poorly supported in user agents and so there
is very limited deployment experience.  Should the guidelines mandate
support for it and give guidence on how it should be used?


Guideline 3 - All configuration not to render some content ...

I think there is an issue concerning the granularity of this control.
For example, it may be necessary to switch off JavaScript to disable
certain features (e.g. animated text), but JavaScript may be needed for
other reasons.

I guess related to this is the ease of disabling features.  For example,
blinking or animated text could be implemented in various ways (e.g.
proprietary HTML tags, through CSS, through JavaScript, through animated
GIFs,  through Java, etc.).  An end user would want to switch off the
animation, and not CSS, Javascript, etc. as they won't necessary know
about these technologies.

Guideline 9 - Provide navigation mechanisms

Does this mean that a compliant user agent should (must) support <LINK>
e.g. the nexp, previous, up, etc attributes.  I think this would be
great.  This element has been aound for a long time, but user agent
supporty is very limited.  If this is the intention, shouldn't the
document mention it explicitly?
