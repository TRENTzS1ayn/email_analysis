JRG: COuld you provide more information here.  I am not sure what you mean 
by inaccessible hardcopy.

JRG: UAAG requires access to all "conditional content".  LONGDESC is one 
example of conditional content and access is required at the P1 
level.  (see checkpoint 2.3)

JRG: We could certainly add this to the techniques document.  But it is 
currently on an explicit requirement of the document.  Navigation is an 
important, but complex issue.  One of the limitation of the HTML 4.01 
specification is that in many cases it does not state what behaviors should 
be associated with an element.  In the case of LINK, it implies behavior 
but does not state what the browser should do to comply.  This would help 
UAAG alot since it could point to a spec and say do this.

Thanks for your comments,
Jon
