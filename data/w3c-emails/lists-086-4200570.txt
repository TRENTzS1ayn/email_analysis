I think there's a link (sorry, relationships) between the comments about
LONGDESC and LINK.  Use of LONGDESC doesn not appear to be described and
the poor support for it is leading to inconsistencies and ambiguities
(the format of a LONGDESC file, should it contain navigational links or
can be left to the browser).  There was a brief discssion on this on
wai-ig a month or so ago. 

I assume you are making a similar point about LINK.  In this case a
small number of specialist browsers have provided support.  I used
EDIwww out 6 years ago.  A Google search finds:

http://gutfeldt.ch/matthias/translation/LINK/ENaddendum.html

Which usefully provides some screen shots.

I guess there it is questionable as to whether this would ever take off.
I assume developments within W3C would now recommend Xlink, RDf, etc.
