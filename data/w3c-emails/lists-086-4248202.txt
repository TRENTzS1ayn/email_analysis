Brian,
I think the hard copy printing issue sounds more like a bug in 
Netscape.  The user agent guidelines doesn't really address bugs per 
se.  We currently do not have any requirements specific to printing, but we 
could add it to the list of issues we consider for a future draft.  I think 
there would need to be a clear case of how printing bugs affect people with 
disabilities more than people without disabilities.

Jon
