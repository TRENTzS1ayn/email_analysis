> aRts simulates a complete "modular analog synthesizer" on your -

> 
> GStreamer allows the construction of graphs of media-handling

> and video (non-linear editing) processing. Applications can take
> advantage of advances in codec and filter technology transparently.
> Developers can add new codecs and filters by writing a simple plugin
> with a clean, generic interface. GStreamer is released under the
