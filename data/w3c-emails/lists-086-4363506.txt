Jon,

IBM is satisfied with the last call draft (noting our previous objection
about the priority of checkpoint 12.1 document at
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2001JanMar/0528).

Neither Phill nor I have read this draft but we were satisified with the CR
draft and the changes that went in.
