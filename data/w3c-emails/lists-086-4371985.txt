This seems to have gotten lost when I sent it before.

The DOM WG has reviewed the UAAG, and has the following issue / comment:

We believe that 6.5 should require the HTML DOM in addition to requiring 
the core DOM.  The reason for this is that there are certain current 
values or states of forms that are not available through the core DOM, 
but only through the HTML DOM.  This might be, for example, the value in 
a text field after the user has typed in it.  These states might prove 
significant for an accessibility agent.  The core DOM does not deal with 
the state of the presentation, but only the content that was actually in 
the info set of the document, and the DOM WG never continued work on the 
Views module to provide alternative ways to access this sort of information.
