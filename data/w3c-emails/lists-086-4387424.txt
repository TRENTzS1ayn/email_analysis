Microsoft is satisfied with the Last Call Draft - I sent it out to quite a few internal W3C-interested folks, and the comments were positive, with one exception (which is not an objection, but an unofficial observation):  
 
5.3 (P2) - for several reasons, it is unlikely that we will implement this.  There are a number of 3rd party applications that provide some of this functionality on a user-configurable basis, and authors can provide non-intrusive warning mechanisms as well.
 
-Thanks
