We have not turned up any issues against the present Last Call.

I must admit we have not done a systematic search for them, either.

Anything we would have to say would be supplemental to the information to
be obtained from the working groups whose technologies we review and you
depend on.

So with a mild regret that we haven't looked at it more closely, please
be advised not to expect any comments from the PF Working Group.

Thanks,

Al

PS:  The innovations that you have worked in this document genre with the
'sufficient techniques' and 'normative inclusions/exclusions' are creative
and it will be very interesting to see how they wear over the years in use.
