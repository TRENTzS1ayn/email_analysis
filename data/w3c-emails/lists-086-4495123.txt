Ah, but the DOM WG considers this a change in state, not a change
in the DOM tree.

Our intent has been to provide access (read + write) to changes
in form controls (or analogous things that can be changed through
the UI). Whether we call that 'content' or 'state' doesn't really
matter as long as the capability is there. However, if we call
it 'content' (as we currently do in the last call draft), that's
inconsistent with the DOM model. Hence the proposal to shift
to 'state'.

Could you start by proposing some text? We can discuss this
at Thursday's call.

Thanks Rich!

P.S. I'm in another meeting until Thursday...
