JRG: The same as other groups.  Two independent implementations of each 
requirement.  Although we may need to ask for exceptions for a few 
requirements, that have low implementation.  See implementation report:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/impl-pr2/

Right now we have 2 implementations for about 92% of the requirements.

JRG: This needs to be clarified for events that can be fired through user 
interaction.

JRG: Thank you for the suggestion.

JRG: Good point, we want to cover this too.

JRG: Refresh can be disorienting to some users with disabilities and the 
refresh needs to be controlled by the user
