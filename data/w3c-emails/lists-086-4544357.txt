Please find enclosed some personal last call comments on the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0
Version reviewed was 21 August 2002
I18n WG comments will follow.


#ri-1:
Sec 2, 1st bulleted list
It would be useful to clarify the intent and normative status of the bold text that immediately follows a guideline title.

#ri-2:
Checkpoint 1.1, checkpoint provisions for this and all following checkpoints Consider naming the checkpoint provisions 1.1.1 or 1.1.a and so on, so they can be easily referred to directly.

#ri-3:
Checkpoint 1.1, last para 
Shouldn't this para have some more formal status (perhaps within normative inclusions and exclusions)?

#ri-4:
Checkpoint 2.2, Sufficient technique 1
Suggest: 'text format, not just implemented" -> "text format, in addition to implemented" 

By the way, note that the numbering in the document is a little confusing.  Eg. there appear at first glance to be two sections labelled 1.1.

Hope that helps,
Richard.
