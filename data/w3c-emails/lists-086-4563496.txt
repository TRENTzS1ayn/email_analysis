> #7:
> Checkpoint 4.1, Sufficient technique
> Suggest: "render text at 36 points" -> "render Latin text at 
> 36 points".  Reason: rendering Chinese or Arabic fonts at 36 
> points may not produce the same degree of clarity as 
> rendering Latin text at that size, and different settings may 
> be more appropriate.

> #8:
> Sec 4.2
> Since global imposition of a Latin-only font could break text 
> in other scripts, perhaps this should be finessed to say that 
> it should be possible for the user to specify different user 
> preferred fonts by script group (much like eg. the common 
> browsers allow you to set default fonts for Unicode ranges).
