Ian,

Regarding the proposed wording to address state information I believe it is
important that we define the correct terminology as it crosssections
accessibility infrastructure terminology. Note: we may want to extend
content value to include text of a document element such as a text input
field.

I propose using the following definitions to the working group and then
expanding on Ian's proposed changes to incorporate these definitions:


Content state - Document content has a condition of being in a stage or
form during its use known as its "state." The state of document content is
ususally defined in discrete pre-defined values as should be known by
assistive technologies designed to support the document. Examples of
possible object states are:  has focus, selected, visible, is selecteable,
checked, focused, activated, pressed, expanded, collapsed, iconified,
editable, multi-line, resizable, vertical, horizontal, collapsible,
expandable, and enabled.

Content selection - A collection of document content often selected by the
user through some means.

Content value - An amount assigned to document content. Some document may
have an assigned value that may change during the course of its use. An
example of a the use of content value is the currently value of an HTML
selection object.

Ah, but the DOM WG considers this a change in state, not a change
in the DOM tree.

Our intent has been to provide access (read + write) to changes
in form controls (or analogous things that can be changed through
the UI). Whether we call that 'content' or 'state' doesn't really
matter as long as the capability is there. However, if we call
it 'content' (as we currently do in the last call draft), that's
inconsistent with the DOM model. Hence the proposal to shift
to 'state'.

Could you start by proposing some text? We can discuss this
at Thursday's call.

Thanks Rich!

P.S. I'm in another meeting until Thursday...
