Ian,

>"the selection" refers to the set of all things selected?

Correct. Furthermore (since you are on the DOM spin), much of the "state"
information can be retrieved from the DOM through the attributes.


Here is an example from the HTML DOM API for an option element:

interface HTMLOptionElement : HTMLElement {
  readonly attribute HTMLFormElement form;
           attribute boolean         defaultSelected;
  readonly attribute DOMString       text;
  readonly attribute long            index;
           attribute boolean         disabled;
           attribute DOMString       label;
           attribute boolean         selected;
           attribute DOMString       value;
};


Where, the current value is the "value."

Some of the state information can be found in states are disabled,
selected. Not included her is if it has focus. This information would need
to be provided by the browser through some alternative means.


Here is an example for an html style element:

interface HTMLStyleElement : HTMLElement {
           attribute boolean         disabled;
           attribute DOMString       media;
           attribute DOMString       type;
};

The state of disabled indicates whether this style sheet is disabled. Media
and type type are values.

So "is selected" refers to a state of a piece of content, whereas
"the selection" refers to the set of all things selected?

I'm mostly interested in hearing from Ray and Philippe whether
this aligns with the DOM model.

Thanks Rich!
