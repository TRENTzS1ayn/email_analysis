Hi Richard,

Thank you for your comments. I'm only sending a quick
reply here since I'm on the road.

See the beginning of section 2, which gives a succinct explanation
of the normative and informative parts of each checkpoint definition.

"Each checkpoint definition includes the following parts. Some parts 
are normative (i.e., relate to conformance); others are informative 
only. ..."

and so on, so they can be easily referred to directly.

We refer to them as checkpoint 1.1, provision 1 but I see no
harm in also people referring to them as "provision 1.1.1". The
anchors are already in place to link to these provisions (and
checkpoints, and guidelines), but the anchors are names, not
numbers, to survive edits across document versions.

The UAWG left this as a "should" as the WG was unable to
"draw the line" about what needed to be available through
each input mode.

Or: "Text formats beyond those implemented."

That's in part a historical artifact. I propose to leave
the numbering as is, but include a Note saying "Heads-up:
the numbering works this way:
  a) Chapter 2 has no subsections, only guidelines, checkpoints
     and provisions.
  b) Checkpoint 1.1 is discussed in Guideline two; that's different
     from "section 1.1".
