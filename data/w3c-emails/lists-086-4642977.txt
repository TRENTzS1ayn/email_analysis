Yes, thank you Steven for doing this. My comments below.

Yes, I think this is a bug in the spec. 9.6 says "the list of input 
device event types", and the previous version of the spec (the
CR draft) says: "any explicitly associated input device event 
handlers", and the second provision only talks about input
device event handlers.

So this is just a bug that should be fixed per SP's suggestion.

Yes, I agree that that update is appropriate.

"Between two colors" seems like a generalization of
"between one color and the background color", which is
what 3.3 currently says.

No, that's browser-specific behavior that is not the same
as an HTTP redirect.

Yes, that's covered by the should.

Proposed clarification:

  "For example, if an HTML author has used a META element for
   automatic content retrieval, the user agent should allow
   configuration to stop the automatic retrieval. Users can
   retrieve the content manually (e.g., "reload").

Point taken.

Yes.

Yes. Should be "unless those changes affect the document object"
or something similar.

Yes. I think "broken" came from Martin Duerst a long time ago. :)

We don't want forward references. We'll republish if we need to.

I don't think we have much more detail on this; what problem
do you see that is not solved?

What you described satisfies the language and I think intent of the 
checkpoint.
