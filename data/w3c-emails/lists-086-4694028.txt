I propose the following changes to Provision 1 of Checkpoint 1.2 to limit 
the range of event handlers to those that can be activated through the user 
interface:

Old:
"Allow the user to activate, through keyboard input alone, all event 
handlers that are explicitly associated with the element designated by the 
content focus. "

New:
"All event handlers that can be triggered through user input devices (i.e. 
onMouseOver, onMouseOut, onFocus, onBlur... ) must include at least one 
activation method through the keyboard."
