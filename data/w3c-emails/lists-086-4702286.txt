I suggest we not modify the checkpoint this way, but just
add the "input device" part that was inadvertently left out:


   "Allow the user to activate, through keyboard input alone, all
   input device event handlers that are explicitly associated with
   the element designated by the content focus."

That's all that's needed, in my opinion. This was just a bug.
