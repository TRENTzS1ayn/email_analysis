Richard,

Thanks to you and the I18N WG for reviewing the document and sending
comments. Some replies below.

That seems ok to me.

I note that the checkpoint used to include requirements that applied
to pre-recorded audio, but we removed them. Our primary use case for
this checkpoint is to turn off the visual rendering of meaningless
characters.

Do you consider the information in the Techniques Document
sufficient? What text would you add there?

I think that falls under checkpoint 2.1: "Render content according
to specification."

Ok.

Yes, I agree that would be clearer.

Ok.

I'm not sure that we need it as an additional UAAG requirement;
this seems primarily to be an internationalization requirement.
Rather than add this as a requirement, I suggest we make your
point in the Techniques document.
