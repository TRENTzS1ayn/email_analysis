Is blinking text distinct from animation, I had considered it the same,
with the above more specific point clarifying and re-enforcing it for
those people with photo-sensitive epilepsy ?  I almost universally stop
all blinking text (including colour change) because it's very distracting,
and I would find it difficult to access the non-blinking content on the
page where some other content "flashed". (I'd have to kill it, or position
my viewport such that the animation wasn't relevant.)

Flashing between my own colours in my stylesheet is just as bad as any
other colours, so I don't feel the css requirement covers it.

Jim.
