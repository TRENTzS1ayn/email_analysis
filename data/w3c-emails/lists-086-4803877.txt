Hello,

At today's teleconference [1], the UAWG resolved issues raised
during the fourth last call and expects to ask the W3C
Director to advance UAAG 1.0 to Proposed Recommendation.

Before we do so, I will respond to last call reviewers and ask
them whether they are satisfied with our resolutions.

Then, I will publish a revised UAAG 1.0 that incorporates
changes. I expect to have this done in one week.

I will keep you posted of our progress. Thank you,

  - Ian
