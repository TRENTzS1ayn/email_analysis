Hi Ian,

I have forwarded your responses to the i18n group comments to the i18n group for review. Thankyou.

I wanted to come back on the following:

I was actually referring to the text related to guidelines, not checkpoints.  The first bulleted list in ch2 mentions the guideline number and guideline title (which I assume are both inside the box), but then goes on to the rationale without mentioning the intervening bold text (eg. From Guideline 1: "Ensure that the user can interact with the user agent (and the content it renders) through different input and output devices.")  It is this bold text I am querying.

Cheers,
RI
