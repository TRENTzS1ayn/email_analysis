Dear UAWG,

I have published the 3 Oct 2002 UAAG 1.0 [1] and
Techniques [2] documents. The complete list of
changes [3] since the last call draft is on the Web.
A diff file [6] is also available.

This document incorporates comments from last call reviewers
and closes our fourth last call issues list [4]. I have
sent replies to all reviewers who went substantial comments
(list of reviewers and replies [5]); I am awaiting confirmation of 
the changes we have made. Steven, Richard, and Ray, please review 
the changes as incorporated in the new draft. Please indicate 
whether you have any objections to these changes, or suggested
improvements.

Note in particular the changes to the checkpoints in Guideline 6,
which now refer to changes to state/values rather than content
(per the comments of the DOM WG).

Comments are welcome on this draft. I do not expect to make 
substantial changes from the document before requesting that the 
Director advance it to Proposed Recommendation status, as we 
discussed at our 26 Sep teleconference.

Thank you,

  _ Ian
