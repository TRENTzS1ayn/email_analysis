I don't think that this is a question of control over colours, but an
effective definition of 'blinking text'. I believe you will regret this
eventually, because I believe that blinking text is *not* only text that
alternates between visible and invisible, but if you want to stay with this
definition, so be it.

[Usage of http-equiv in examples]

According to HTML 4, http-equiv is a server-side redirect, not a client-side
redirect (though extant UAs seem to interpret them). Please remove examples
of using http-equiv for client-side redirection. You may use them in a
techniques section, pointing it out as UA behaviour, even though it is
strictly incorrect.

Agreed.

I think this misses the point. The point is to avoid users being presented
with new stuff without warning; whether this happens because of something
that happens on the server or on the client is not important to the
requirement (a server can send a timed redirect too).

It may be that existing UAs react more in keeping with this requirement if
the redirect comes from the server, but this is neither sufficient nor
necessary.

Please remove the bracketed (e.g.)

Accepted.
