Dear Working Group,

I would ask each working group member to submit one or two questions they 
think would be useful to include in our UAAG Frequently Asked Question 
resource.  These are questions can be technical or more general.  For 
example policy makers or administrators may have questions on how to use 
UAAG requirements in their procurement process, consumers may want to use 
UAAG requirements to provide feedback to developers on new features and 
developers may have questions on how to use the features of the 
guidelines.  If each working group member can submit a few questions and 
suggested answers, this would help start out this resource.

Please send them to the list.

Jon
