We only produce plugins for multimeida content. Do the guidelines apply to
us?

I have a few specific needs, but not everything that is in he guidelines. Can
I find out which browsers are available that meet a profile of checkpoints
which are what I need? (Whether or not they conform to the guidelines)

cheers
