Hello all,

Please Help me for this Question.

Image Transformation 

TASKs

1. Get 1 image, it can use scanner, take from presented picture/image, or you can make your own image. Suggest the size between 64x64 pixel till 256x256 pixel (max).

2. Use the graphical program that presented. transform to RAW format. If the recent image have colouring, before the transformation to the RAW format, first transform  to the gray level image.

3. Make the program to read RAW file which output from the step 2, display intensity value of the RAW file to monitor display.

4. Display the image of RAW, not he intensity but the pixel. Use library function to change the intensity value to RGB value.

5. Make the other program that could transform intensity value of RAW file to the inverse from true intensity value. Save the file which different names. Display the new intensity value (invers value) and also image output (negative image).

6. Make the another program which doing thresholding for the intensity from true RAW file. Save the output from the new  RAW file. Single thresholding is limited for the taken pixel value, where the quantity of the limit value is single. Thresholding value must be input, including value range from 0 - 255. The new image which produce is binary image (only have 2 type of intensity)
