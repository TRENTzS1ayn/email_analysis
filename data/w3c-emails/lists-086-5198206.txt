Dear UAWG,

I'm very pleased to announce that the Director has
advanced UAAG 1.0 [1] to Proposed Recommendation status [2].
This is a four-week review period during which time the
W3C Membership expresses its endorsement of the document.
After the review period, if there is consensus, the document
will become a W3C Recommendation; I hope this will happen
by mid-December.

During this time, the UAWG should:

  * Develop a UAAG 1.0 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) sheet;
  * Continue to gather implementation experience;
  * Encourage W3C Members to endorse the document in their
    review comments.

Thank you, and congratulations.

  _ Ian
