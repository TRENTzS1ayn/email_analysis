Hi Tim,

I get up to 200 unsolicited emails per day myself. I use a tool
called spamassassin in conjunction with a "whitelist" to keep
mail manageable. The result is that:
  a) Mail from people I know goes into my "ok" box.
  b) Mail from known spammers goes into a junk box that I don't
     read, but only delete.
  c) Mail that is "unknown" goes to a third box that I review
     quickly a couple of times per day.

This setup works better than anything I've tried before.
I sympathize with your plight. I moderate this particular
list, so you are not getting spam through it (or at least
only one or two per month). But now that your email is
public (on this list or others), and in the hands of
spammers, that damage can't be undone.

  - Ian
