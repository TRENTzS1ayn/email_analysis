1. Since we have not received any reviews that have raised issues the group 
needs to response to at this time, we will postpone this weeks meeting 
until 14 November.

2. Please keep working on preparing testimonials for publicity when the 
document goes to recommendation.

3. Ian will review the current FAQ at the 14 November teleconference.

4. If your member organization has not drafted comments for the PR draft, 
please contact your W3C representative and work with them to form a 
response.  If you have any questions, please contact Ian.

Thanks,
Jon
