An OASIS technical Committee for the User Interface Markup Language
(UIML) is being formed to develop a specification for an abstract meta-language
that can provide a canonical XML representation of any user interface (UI).
The language should be capable of specifying the requirements, design,
and implemenltation of any UI. The TC will use UIML v3.0 as a starting 
point and
expects to deliver a revised spec within eight months.

I see no awareness of explicit accessibility concerns in that reference.
