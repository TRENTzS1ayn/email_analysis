Hi All,

Sorry for late reply, I was quite busy in recent months and found some time to 
read WAI archives just now.

You are wrong here.
Konqueror (http://www.konqueror.org) is based on W3C standards.
It has very good CSS and DOM support (much better than, say, MS IE).

as about "developers of Linux user agents":
*  those peole develop *browsers*, not user agents; and do it, in most cases, 
for fun.  They are not paid for those jobs.
* they are aware about accessibility issues. 
But, in most cases, they have other things to fix. There are numerous bug 
reports filed for both Konqueror and Mozilla, if you think that developers 
missed something - go to http://bugs.kde.org or Bugzilla, and file bug report 
for accessibility problem.

Is this bad that those browsers or players are "still in active development"?
Or do you prefer Microsoft approach, where bugs ar enot fixed for 6-7 years?

Susbscribe to <kfm-devel@kde.org>, post your suggestions/ideas.
If you have some code ready - feel free to share it.

You can think of XFree86 as *standard* and installed on 99% of Linux Desktops.
According to recent surveys, KDE is used by at least 60% of people, and GNOME 
by 20%. I think the rest (20%) is not interested in *Desktop* functionality, 
they launch Mozilla or Netscape 4.7 from xterm and use minimalistic Window 
Manager, like IceWM or BlackBox.
So, you should ask yourself: what part of those people you target?
Than I can help you on possible paths getting things *done*.

|
|  1.5: Does a common security arch exist?

Pardon?  What do you speak about here?

|
|  4.7: Does a truly global volume control exist (/me thinks so)
|
|  6.1 - 6.6: I don't think these APIs exist (e.g., Konqueror)
|
|  6.7: Are there more than one keyboard APIs?
|
|  Possible Action Item (for me and others who are interested): Continue
|  to think about if there is a reasonable way to determine what is
|  standard and conventional under Linux?  For example, can we base it off
|  the Linux Standard Base?  Also, can we incorporate
|  accessibility-related APIs into the LSB? (URL: www.linuxbase.org)

LSB covers just part of typical Linux distro.
I work in KDE3, and it feets my needs quite well.
If you want to add some accessibility features to KDE - you should talk to 
KDE-devel.
But pls don't think that someone would implement some complicated features 
which you think are important. Most people developing KDE are volunteers.
