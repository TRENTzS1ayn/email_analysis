Just a small note:  I recently asked people on Nautilus list, what is their 
position on web browsing/Mozilla integration in nautilus.
Short answer:  Nautilus2 is File Manager (and there is no Mozilla dependency 
in current builds, or in ver. 2.0).  GNOME's Web Browser is Galeon.
Nautilus 2.2 would have Web View (and would use Galeon2 for this task, when 
Galeon2 is ready)
AFAIK release is planned for January, but it may be delayed, though.

Hope this helps a little bit.
