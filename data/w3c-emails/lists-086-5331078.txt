Vadim,

We currently have a partial implementation report of Konqueror [1] and have 
recently created test suites [2] for UAAG.  I was wondering if you could 
review implementation report for Konqueror for accuracy and the test suites 
to see if they would be helpful in the development of Konqueror?

Thank you for comments,
Jon
