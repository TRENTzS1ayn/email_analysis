Agenda

1. Update on proposed recommendation comments (IJ)

IJ: Some review, no substantive issues yet.

2. Update on FAQ (IJ)

/* IJ reads 25 questions, not yet available */

HB: "What accessibility policies of different governments refer to
UAAG 1.0?"

[Answer: Visit the policy page for updates.]

HB: I suggest the word "translation" appear in the title.

IJ: I will also add link to W3C Translations.

IJ: I suggest "Tell me in 100 words or less what UAAG 1.0 is
about" or similar. And link to the executive summary.

IJ: Most answers are pretty obvious to me, but I will be talking
with Judy about some of the tougher answers.

IJ: This is a dynamic document that we will update as we
get more comments, questions, etc.
