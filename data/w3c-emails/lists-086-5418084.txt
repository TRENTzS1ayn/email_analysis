Since there are currently no issues for the working group to address, we 
will not meet on 5 December.  The next planned meeting is scheduled for 19 
December.

Document Status: Document is still under W3C review, no new issues have 
been raised that need the attention of the working group.

Reminder: Next scheduled FTF meeting is 6-7 March 2003 in Boston at the W3C 
All Working Group meeting.  This is an important meeting to define new 
directions of the working group.

Test Suites and Implementation Report: People interested in working on test 
suites or the implementation report please contact Jon Gunderson.
