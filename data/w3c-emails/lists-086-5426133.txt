Hi,

When I first heard Mozilla was going to implement <marquee> I was rather
miffed asI primarily use an LCD monitor. Even though it's TFT the
scrolling text becomes blurry and hurts my eyes even when I'm not
looking at it. Luckily though Mozilla is configurable enough so that I
can return <marquee> to its previous non-scrolling state. I am now
happy. :)

In answer to your 6 pts on the webpage:

1. Linux v2.5.50 (Debian 3.0 - woody)
2. no assistive tech
3. Mozilla nightly build 2002120605 but about half a years worth
   implement this beforehand.
4. Only personal customizations that do not affect <marquee>. Too many
   to list really.
5. It does. all three tests scrolled previously.
6. I was able to stop the text scrolling
   A. I have the directions at http://mozilla.weebeastie.net/marquee.shtml
      so that others may make their browsing easier.
   B. The fix is permanent.
   C. No. You either get it at webpage specified speed or off as per
      the above URL.

Hope this helps and thanks for the test page. It came in rather useful. :)
