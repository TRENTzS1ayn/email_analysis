Congratulations, and many thanks, to the participants of the User Agent 
Accessibility Guidelines Working Group, for all your hard work; and 
especially I would like to thank Jon Gunderson, the Chair, and Ian, the 
Team Contact and lead editor, for their leadership and hard work over the 
development of these guidelines. I know that these guidelines will help 
lead to a more accessible Web for people with disabilities.
