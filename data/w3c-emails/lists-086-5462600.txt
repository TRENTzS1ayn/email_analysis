I would just like to add my thanks and congratulations to the working group 
and the W3C staff in bring UAAG 1.0 to recommendation.  I especially would 
like to thank Ian for his dedication to the working group and the document, 
this document would not be what it became without him.  I would also like 
to thank Judy Brewer for all her behind the scenes work that supported the 
development of the document, she does many things that we never see or hear 
that have been critical in developing the document.

I look forward to working with you to see the requirements of this document 
become standard features of all user agents.

Thanks again and my applause to all the people who have contributed to this 
document!
Jon
