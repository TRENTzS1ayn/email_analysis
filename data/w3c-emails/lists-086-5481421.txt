I just would like to make a special appeal for all people who have been a 
part of the user agent working group or have reviewed the document to come 
to the User Agent Teleconference tomorrow.  It would be great to have as 
many people as possible who have contributed to the development of this 
document to be present at the meeting.  It will be short meeting.  Hope you 
will be able to participate.
