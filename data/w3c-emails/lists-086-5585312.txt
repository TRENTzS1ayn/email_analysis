There were no ideal dates for everyone to meet this month.  But the two 
best compromise dates are: April 10th and 17th.

Issues we will be discussing:
1. Test suite development and maintenance
2. Evaluation reports
3. Working with developers to make conformance claims
4. Creation HTML modular recommendations (i.e. navigation or tables)
5. XHTML 2.0 working draft comments (with PF)
