Hello,

Per my action item from the 1 May UAWG teleconf [1], I have
drafted some comments [2] about the 6 May 2003 draft of XHTML 2.0 [3].

The list of comments is long, and I have further comments
that I didn't include. These comments are grouped into four sections,
the first two being, I think, the most relevant
for our UAWG discussions.

 1. Comments related to user agent conformance
 2. Comments related to accessibility themes
 3. Miscellaneous comments
 4. New elements?

I look forward to discussion of these points. 

 _ Ian
