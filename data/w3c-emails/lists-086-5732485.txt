Review of comments on XHTML 2.0

   Refer to [3]IJ summary of comments on 6 May 2003 XHTML 2.0

      [3] http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2003/05/xhtml2-comments.html

   [JRG]
          IJ: Sent update about 90 minutes ago
          IJ: Frames discussions as starting points for discussion
          IJ: We should prune things, since HTML working group is over
          whelmed

   [Ian]
          How these comments are organized
          1. Comments related to user agent conformance
          2. Comments related to accessibility themes
          3. Miscellaneous comments
          4. New elements?

   [JRG]
          IJ: Reviewed example in comments related to ordered and
          unordered lists
          IJ: Defined difference between processing and rendering content

   [Ian]
          IJ: HTML WG has an opportunity to clear up spec (and not just
          import html 4.0 text) and promote interoperability; good for
          authors.

   [JRG]
          JG: Is there pressure from other groups
          IJ: QA
          JG: Are there other memeber companies pushing for this?
          IJ: We will be dicussing general QA issues with the AC
          IJ: They should have inline or at least references to
          UAAG/WCAG/XAG
          IJ: Currently no references to WAI documents
          MM: I have a page worth of comments
          IJ: Please insert them into the draft
          IJ: Can you merge them?
          MM: Yes
          *** Accessibility themes
          IJ: Rendering should reference stylesheets
          IJ: They have alot of rendering information in the
          specification
          IJ: Table of contents should be about representation of
          information, not rendering
          IJ: Styling through default, author and user stylesheets
          IJ: We can add items here related to UAAG 1.0
          We say that users should be able to provide a simplified view

   [Ian]
          JG: Opera has an outline view.

   [JRG]
          IJ: Oultine views can be generated by Amaya, Mozillia
          IJ: They claim they are just about markup, not behavior
          IJ: Styling conditional content is important, alonng with
          controling styling
          IJ: Definition of content
          IJ: Our defintion is what is in the DOM
          IJ: Other WAI groups have other definition
          IJ: We want them to define content
          IJ: Conditional content
          IJ: There is less conditional content in XHTML 2.0
          IJ: ALT and LONGDESC have been removed
          IJ: The new model is using SRC on any element and the element
          content becomes the conditional content
          IJ: Important content
          IJ: Letting authors say this thing is important
          IJ: There are useful things
          IJ: important things can be styled to stand out
          IJ: Rather than relying on markup, use an attribute to indicate
          importance
          IJ: Some user may want to hide less important content and let
          the important content remain
          CL: Would it be an element or attribute
          JG: I think attribute is more flexible
          CL: Important would still be generic
          IJ: I think so
          CL: You could use it to skip navigation bars, indciate key
          words
          IJ: This is pretty vague, in order for authors and developers
          to use IMPORTANT there needs to be better definitions
          CL: We need to define important
          CL: Exapnsion
          IJ: For abbreviations
          IJ: I will update commments
          IJ: One interesting side effect of getting rid of ALT and
          LONGDESC is that there is no way to differentiation between the
          two
          IJ: It maybe useful to users to have both short and longer
          descriptions
          JG: Is TITLE still there
          IJ: yes
          IJ: There is a role attribute
          CL: One problem with not having LONGDESC is that you would not
          know what the conditional content is
          IJ: OBJECT will replace IMG, and you can embed OBJECTS to give
          the user more options
          IJ: Probably most authors will not do this
          IJ: All long descriptions are out of band
          IJ: There are times when you do not want to download and
          separating resources is useful
          IJ: Will put in a description
          IJ: Problem for visual and auditory user agents is how do you
          show options for rendering of an OBJECT
          DP: We are talking about descriptions, I don't hear about
          replacement
          DP: I need what the image is conveying if I cannot see it
          DP: I don't see the discussion
          DP: This is a third peice
          JG: This is a WCAG issue
          DP: When ALT is taking away ALT and LONGDESC, but the third
          issue is what the image represents
          CL: Ordering issues?
          IJ: There are processing instructions
          CL: The problem is that the element can have both content and a
          TITLE attribute
          IJ: Maybe what we need, I suspect that they are independent of
          each other
          IJ: We need more specific rendering information for title
          IJ: This about conditional content rendering when there are
          more than one piece of conditional content is available
          IJ: By default no conditional content is rendered
          IJ: The the next step is user configuration of what should be
          rendered to the user
          CL: Some people what to render ALT instead of TITLE or TITLE
          instead of ALT
          CL: XHML 2.0 problem is now TITLE versus content
          IJ: Just leave this as a question in the current comments
          IJ: They want to include a REL redirect
          IJ: We do not want the feature, although some authors like it
          *** Navigation
          IJ: We need a better defintion of focus
          IJ: Other groups have other different defs of focus
          IJ: We can use this to clear up other defintions, for example
          activating a link
          CL: First element after a navigation bar or first active
          element?
          IJ: If navigation is defined as focus, then only active
          elements
          CL: Not always defined as active element
          CL: First element is not always active element
          JG: Point of regaurd
          DP: If you have an anchor, it will move to any element you tell
          it to
