On Maccessibility.com, I've started an intermittent series on Safari's
status with regards to UAAG.  It's not a full analysis as per
http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2001/10/eval -- since Safari is still in the
"public beta" stage -- but it hopefully will be read by the developers
at Apple and could have some effect on the discussion of what should go
in Safari next.

Here's what's been published on Maccessibility so far:

OBEY UAAG, Part 0:  Understanding UAAG
