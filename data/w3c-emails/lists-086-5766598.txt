Hi Kynn,

This is too weird: I was reading it when suddenly this
message appeared in my inbox. Were you watching me? <grin>

This is a nifty annotated UAAG 1.0 evaluation of safari. I
like your editorial comments like "Huh?" and "Whew!" <big grin>.

Thanks for doing this. I'm thinking about linking to
it from the UAWG home page. Do others have thoughts on
that?
