I agree, linking to the series would be a good thing. The editorial comments
and explantory expansions go a long way to demistifying the guidelines; and
present them in a way that the non-techy, or even those techies who did not
participate in the development of the guidelines, can understand.

I think linking to this resource would be appropriate.  Propagating this
kind of awareness is very important for UAAG.

Beyond the evaluation, this also nicely distills some of the Recommendation?
