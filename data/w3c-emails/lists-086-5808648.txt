Hello,

A colleague asked me if I was aware of any user agents
that support MathML and that are accessible to users
with blindness. I welcome any advice that I may
forward to my colleague. 

It may also be that there are accessible solutions
for putting math on the Web that don't involve MathML; if so,
please let me know.

It would also be valuable to conduct a UAAG 1.0
evaluation on a MathML user agent.

Thank you,

 _ Ian
