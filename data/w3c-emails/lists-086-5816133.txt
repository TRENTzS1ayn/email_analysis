A few other threads on this:

1) Email from B.K. DeLong (3 Mar 2003) on some attempts
   to make math accessible on the Web
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2003JanMar/0041

2) Mozilla seems to support both MathML and APIs for access
   by screen readers:
 
   Refer to:
   http://www.mozilla.org/projects/ui/accessibility/accannounce.html

   And MathML in list of supported specs:
   http://mozilla.org/why/users-features.html

   I don't have any experience with Mozilla and MathML, however.

Comments and suggestions from Mozilla folks welcome.
