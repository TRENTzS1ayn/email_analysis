Hello,

Unfortunately, although Mozilla supports accessibility APIs, as well as 
DOM extensions to accessibility APIs, there are no screen readers 
available yet that take advantage of this fact. We're getting pretty 
close with Window-Eyes, but Window-Eyes uses MSAA, and there is nothing 
in MSAA which contains support mathemetical objects. GW Micro, or 
another screen reader vendor that develops compatibility with Mozilla, 
would have to decide that it's a priority and go to the directly DOM 
nodes for the MathML info. I doubt this would happen without some kind 
of major grant.

Screen magnifiers will probably have much better luck, because they 
won't have to translate the structure into a voice or Braille stream .... :/

I believe that it would be great to support MathML, and even SVG, via a 
screen reader on top of Gecko/Mozilla, but I'm afraid we're not very 
close to it yet.

Cheers,

- Aaron Leventhal
