We are approaching the time to renew the telephone bridge for the W3C user 
agent working group.  Attendance has been light at recent meetings and I 
would like to know how many people would be able to attend the 
teleconference if it met at a different day or time.

Please let me know if you would attend the teleconference at a different 
time or day and what days/times would be better for you.

Thanks,
Jon
