Hi,
 
I am experiencing a problem with Active Accessibility. This is what I
want to do. When I point to any object on the screen it should give the
accessible information of that object. I am using windows journal hook
to detect the point and AccessibleObjectFromPoint to get the accessible
information. My problem is it not giving an accessible information if I
process AA within my hook procedure. An error 'An outgoing call cannot
be made since the application is dispatching an input-synchronous call'.
It is possible to collect this data if I use a Timer as specified in the
workaround prescribed by the Microsoft. But this will not be sufficient
for all cases, because we are collecting information after the event
occurs and that can be a window close that leads to be a false
information. Anybody can help me?
