There are no immediate agenda items for tomorrow's User Agent meeting, so 
it will be postponed until January 23rd.

Please remember to register for the FTF meeting on March 6-7 in Boston at 
all working group meeting[1].
We will be having a joint meeting with Quality Assurance, HTML and WAI 
Education & Outreach.  We will be talking about the implementation report, 
test suite development, education efforts and new guideline development 
directions.

Jon
