Tooltips are not themselves directly controlled by HTML, because they 
are user-interface widgets tacked on ad hoc by user agents.

Some browsers have chosen a tooltip UI widget of exposing existing 
(meta)data. Internet Explorer, for example, has applied tooltips to the 
"alt" attribute for images, and the "title" attribute for everything 
else. But there is nothing in the HTML or DOM spec that defines how to 
control the display of tooltips per se.
