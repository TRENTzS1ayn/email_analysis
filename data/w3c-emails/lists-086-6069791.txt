Ian,

The recommendation is there, we seem agreed that the implementation is 
not difficult, however the reality is that no one knows of a browser 
that exhibits this behaviour. As stated to wai-ig, it is not so much 
this example as the 'process' that may be faulty.

W3C groups are recommendation focused, and implementation is left to 
bug reports.
Where is the discussion group that draws attention to a failure in 
understanding?

It is very hard to imagine how this slipped through the net*, and yet 
it did.
People with severe learning difficulties have individual and particular 
needs.
We will need excellent channels of communication in order to implement 
recommendations to their benefit.

thanks

Jonathan
