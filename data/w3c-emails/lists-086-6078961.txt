Developers read this list, so this is one place to start. And
we talk with developers during teleconferences or in person. So this
may be the most appropriate W3C list for your bug report.

However, it may be necessary to send a bug report to individual
vendors. Unfortunately, the UAWG can only enter into discussion
with developers; we have no enforcement powers.

I agree. We have already heard positive feedback from developers about
our test suite. Perhaps a test for this feature can be added to it.
