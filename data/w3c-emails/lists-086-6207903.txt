I for one support contributions to the test suite. The UAWG does not
yet have a process set up for handling them. This issue is addressed
in guidelines 7 [1] of "QA Framework: Operational Guidelines", which is
currently in last call. This is a good topic for discussion at upcoming
meetings.

Jon, it sounds like we could use an issues list for the test suite,
linked from the test suite home page (and the UAWG home page).
