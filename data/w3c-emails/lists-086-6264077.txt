Hi Jon,

Here is the status of my action items from last
week:

  Action IJ: Say to Lynne Rosenthal that we are fine with that; 
  maybe by talking to her we can get AAA.
 
  Status: I told Lynne that we were happy for the comments
  to be public. We've exchanged email and spoken on the phone
  as well; I will be working with her on some details of
  the report.

  (Action Colin: Debug this XML problem in test suite sources)

  Status: Colin did this and announced it looks like
  it might be various user agent issues. I said I would
  look into it but haven't. It might be safer to assign this
  (i.e., further investigation) to somebody else.


  Action IJ: Ask glossary authors if they can/intend to update the  
references to UAAG 1.0.

  Status: I asked them but have not heard back from one of
  the editors. 

 _ Ian
