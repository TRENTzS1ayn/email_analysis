Hello,

After last week's UAWG/HTML WG meeting, Masayasu Ishikawa
showed me a demo of some extensions [1] to the Mozilla user
interface that I suspect satisfy some UAAG 1.0 requirements.
These extensions are available from the content menu and
provide access to alt text, create an outline view of
content, and more.

I think that some of these features would require some
additional work to make them more accessible, but they
seem like an interesting start. I have not yet downloaded
them, but I intend to have a look.
