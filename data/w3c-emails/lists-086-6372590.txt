Ideally there would be more than one way for users to access information on 
the title attribute of an element.  I agree with Ian that there are will 
probably be several checkpoints involved with a implemented solution to the 
access of title information.

I think one part of the solution can be to use the tooltips on pointer 
hover, as long as the user can configure this feature to be turned 
off.  For keyboard access there would need to be a way to move the keyboard 
focus to each element and then have the element trigger the hover event or 
for title information to be displayed in the status bar.
