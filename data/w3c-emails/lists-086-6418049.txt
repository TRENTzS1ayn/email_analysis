You're welcome.

Ok.

Ok. 

I wonder whether it might be valuable to provide access to
longdesc in the same mode, as in:

 "this is the alt text" [londesc]

(I haven't thought about this in detail.)

I think tooltips probably deserve more attention than they get.
For instance, users with low vision or color blindness may wish
to style tooltip text.

In the strictest of UAAG 1.0 terms, it's a viewport. However, that
doesn't mean that it needs to implement every functionality every
other viewport implements. For instance, if you can't interact with
any of the elements in the tooltip, you don't need content focus
there. Also, I don't expect tooltips to come with much of a user
interface.

Still, there are things that one should be able to do such
as use style sheets to affect rendering of text size and colors,
control automatic behavior, control blinking (if that's possible),
etc. 

Still, I agree with you that there probably aren't too many
UAAG 1.0 requirements that apply to a viewport with such limited
functionality.

I don't believe that the word "tooltip" appears in HTML 4 or XHTML 1.
I looked in HTML 2.0 (RFC1866) and didn't see it there, either.

As far as I know, HTML specs do not say anything about using title,
alt, or anything else for tooltips. UAAG 1.0 doesn't either.

In short, I don't know that there are any W3C standards to point to
for definitive info on tooltip behavior. 

It's possible to ask the HTML WG to state in XHTML 2.0
more explicitly what user agents that provide tooltips (or their
equivalent) should do. However, such a requirement on behavior
in this specific case (though common) may be too detailed for the
WG's tastes.

What about allowing the user to configure what to render for tooltips?

 [ ] Render both title and alt (Default)
     In this case, if both are present, distinguish them.

 [ ] Render title, but if not present render alt.

 [ ] Render title only, even if alt present.

 [ ] Render alt only, even if title present.

 [ ] No tooltips

Are all these useful? Any others?

While you probably wish to avoid too many configuration
options, you may be able to satisfy users in a timely
manner this way. I'm not sure that a W3C spec will solve
this for you in a timely manner. 

I am still interested in hearing from the WAI PF folks about
whether they think that a format specification should talk
about this type of behavior explicitly, whether this
belongs in UAAG 1.0 Techniques (nothing there currently),
or where else this might be dealt with.

Thank you,
