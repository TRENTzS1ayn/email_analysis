Must be my day to respond to listserv postings.  Regarding state
initiatives, you really have to divide web access from procurement as the
level and type of activity is different.  Also its important to understand
that really no state has passed "508 legislation."  Many state laws focus on
a "procurement clause" (don't address all forms of IT development or
deployment), some are an expansion of ADA general anti-discrimination
language, and few specifically address standards adoption.

At last count, over 40 states have adopted some form of law, policy,
executive order, guidelines, etc. related to web accessibility.  These vary
dramatically in content, some adopt Section 508 web standards, some adopt
W3C, and others have a hybrid of those standards.  Very few of the 40 plus
web access requirements are in statute.

With procurement the situation is different.  I'm aware of twelve states
(Maryland, Minnesota, Texas, Arkansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Kentucky,
Indiana, North Carolina, California, West Virginia, and Louisiana) who have
statutes that address the procurement of accessible IT and one additional
state (Maine) with a policy that does so.  A few other states have had
legislation introduced in the past and some are still active this session
(Arizonia is an example.)  I have links to state statutes and any technical
standards or policies that have been developed for 10 of the 12 states with
laws along with a link to Maine's policies.  There is an analysis of the key
features of those 10 laws and 1 policy at
http://www.ataporg.org/summary.htm.  The two states I do not have statute
info on are West Virginia and Louisiana (have never been able to locate web
links to the passed statute.)

This and much more information related to the current status of state IT
access laws and policies will be published shortly in an article for a
special issue of the Journal of Information Technology and Disabilities.
I'll be happy to share any link info I have if it would be helpful.

Could anyone tell me which states have enacted Section 508 legislation?
And which ones are about to pass it?

Or point me in the right direction to find out?

Thanks for any help.
