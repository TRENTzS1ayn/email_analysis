Hello everybody,
   Thanks to owner of this group for helping all of us to know abt 
the job opportunities. I have applied to sristek through 
sristek@hd1.vsnl.net.in. They have conducted written test, 
shortlisted and called for seminar, again short listed and called 
for interview, in interview they asked me to pay Rs.20,000/- for 
training 3 months. They said that they will give training on SAS 
technologies. Is there anyone who knows abt SAS.... They also said 
that there is lot of requirement for this technology in India and 
abroad. Please help me wat to do, whether to join or not.
   Thanking u,
   Tejo.
