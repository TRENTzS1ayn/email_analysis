Hi
 

Hi Friends

Recently I have been seeing many openings for 2003 freshers and thought that I could collect and summarize them. Some of the openings may be closed by now. But better try applying for good reasons. I am a 2002 BE pass out still striving to get a good job. Last year at the same time ( 2002/June ) there wasn't so much openings for us. Normally in summer season recruitments will be dull. Only from Nov 2002 to March 2003 we had many openings. Lucky this year that 2003 freshers have a good chance to get placed soon.

Hats off to Chetana, Surendra Reddy, all groups moderators and members who are actively forwarding openings and use full materials round the clock. But I wish to say one more thing. Often I find many mails like " I am having so and so test this Friday, do send me the papers " etc... but after they appear the test they seem to forget about the groups. Only very very few persons mail about the test that they faced. What about the rest. At least they could share their experience about the test and interviews, so that it will be useful for the rest of the group subscribers.

Then, I see some mails " I got the job. Thanks to the groups. Bye ". Why can't these people tell more about their preparations, interview questions and how they answered. Can't they spend few minutes for the groups which provided an opportunity to get his/her job. Don't think I am harsh, but I personally consider these people are selfish to just keep mum after getting their job. And don't say silly reasons like "No Time". Just recollect the times that u used to spend on browsing your inbox for materials, openings, guidance and advices from other people. When will u repay to all those helping hands. Please think it over and don't repeat the same mistake when u attend the test or get the job. Say if each person attending a test forwards a single question they had, then within minutes the groups will get all the test questions.

Also when u post a message in groups please use relevant words in the subject column. Many times it's confusing whether the mail is about an opening or requesting more info about a company.  If u know please mention the locality of the company and from where and when u came to know about the opening.

Good luck to u all and don't forget to fwd your experiences about the test and interviews that u face. And if u happen to see any openings for 2002 Fresher, BE CS graduate, 76%, CCNA/MCSE certified ..... do pass it to me or the groups. I am ready to work even without salary in the first few months to prove my worth.

Friendly mails are welcome, but don't forward your resumes to me. I am not a recruiter or a HR. This mail was edited in June 28 2003

The happiest of people don't necessarily have the best of everything; 
They just make the most of everything that comes along their way.

INFOSYS Test Preparations

A Clarification:

If you got call letter and if you are not able to attend the test because of any reason (exams, or lack of preparation etc), the 9 months gap rule will not be applied to you. You can attend the test next time. But it's better to send a mail to HR and say that you will not be able to take the test this time and you will take the next test.

You have to wait for 9 months to take the test ONLY IF you failed in the test. It's not for those who do not attend the test. But my suggestion is that to attend the test if you get a call letter. If you drop the test this time, you will never know whether there will be another test or not. Or sometimes you may not get call letter again.

So, do NOT drop the test even if haven't prepared that well. Test will be very easy, if you have sufficient Analytical skills. If at all you drop the test for genuine reasons, send resume again to freshers@infy.com, mentioning that you weren't able to attend the test last time when you got call letter and you want to attend the next test.

If anyone is having very good academics throughout career, send resume to : freshers@infosys.com or careers@infosys.com
It's better to have subject line as "Resume -- Full Name -- fresher -- (Year of Passing)", even though it's not mandatory. 

Some guidelines for applying :

You should not have taken the Infosys test or interview in the last 9 months. If you did that, you are not eligible for writing the test again. Even if you apply, you won't get call letter.

You should have very good academics. Preferably above 70 % in 10 th, Intermediate and Engg (or BSc and MCA) Probably you can apply with above 65 %. But I am not sure whether you get call letter or not. It depends on your luck.

At the top of the resume, clearly mention your Full name, Date of Birth, Aggregate marks in 10 th, Inter, Engg. Without the above details, your resume will never receive a call for written test.

Do not write the marks semester-wise. Aggregate marks are sufficient. Also do NOT write stupid stuff like 'I am synonym of hard  work' etc Resume should be as simple as possible.

In Infosys, there is no Employee Referral Scheme for freshers. So, do NOT try to catch some employee for the purpose of  applying. It will not fetch you anything better.

It's same whether you apply directly to the given mail IDs or any employee applies for you. So, do NOT bother any employees. 

Above all, getting call letter depends on your luck. If you apply now, the call letter may be sent for next test.
Sometimes, you may not get call letter even if you satisfy required criteria.
Remember that the HR will be receving lakhs of resumes and they can provide call letters only for few people. 
Even if you send any enquiry mails to those mail IDs, you will not get any replies.
You just need to wait for your turn to get call letter.
Or if you don't get call letter for long time, apply again. 

Even if you have less than 3 years of experience, you have to take this test. So, apply to the above mail IDs, clearly mentioning your experience, in addition to above details. 

Test Pattern :
This is all that I know. This may or may not be 100 % true. 

There will be 10 puzzles (this number can vary slightly depending on marks). They may not be puzzles alone. There can be Analytical questions.
Duration - 1 hour

After 1 hour, this paper will be taken back and English paper will be given.

Test of English consists of ----
Reading comprehension, Correction of sentences, Finding sentence with errors, Correct verb completion in the sentences, Spellings, Finding exact meanings that match the sentence, Grammar Questions etc. It tests basic English grammar. (almost GRE pattern, but it seems to be much more easier than GRE test) So, I think you need not worry much about this English test, if you are good at basic English.
Duration - 1 hour. 90 to 95 questions. (or sometimes, it can be 1/2 hour and 45 questions) 

NO negative marking. (I suggest to answer all the questions)
NO Essay Writing (Previously Essay writing was there and now it's removed) .

Even if you get selected or not, the results of the test will be intimated to you in mail. Sometimes, the result intimation takes lot of  time. No one except HR can tell you whether you got selected or not. There is no other way. The details won't be told even to employees of Infosys. 

Some Suggestions :

When you answer a puzzle, you will get full marks if it's right. Or zero marks if it's wrong. That's it. NO intermediate marks There are no marks for procedure . Even if u do it half-right, you will get only zero marks. So, whatever you answer, answer it perfectly and check the answers, if possible. Even if you answer only 6 or 7 questions, make sure that answers are perfect. When paper is difficult, cut off mark will be low. In such cases, do not worry about paper and questions and do not make a mess  of paper. 

Think with absolute cool mind. If paper is difficult for you, it is difficult for everyone. If you can answer only 5 questions, answer them perfectly. There are every chances that you get through. If you try all questions and do not answer anything perfectly, there won't be any use. Worry will not solve any of your problems. So, it's very important that you keep your cool, despite of any typical situation. It holds good for any written test or interview. 

You can get some old Puzzle papers at 
www.freshersworld.com and http:\\vvasan.hypermart.net
But I don't think there will be much use in preparing them. The reasons for that are :
1. Normally, the questions will not be repeated in Infosys.
2. Most of the answers given at these websites are wrong. Or there won't be any answers given. So, you will get confused unnecessarily.

If you are analytically strong, I suggest you to prepare the below books very well, rather than previous papers. 
Nothing else is needed for preparation.
You can just see the old papers to know how the questions look like.

Suggested Books : 

"Puzzles to Puzzle you" by Shakuntala Devi
"More Puzzles" by Shakuntala Devi
Puzzle Book by George S. Summers

Nowadays, more logical questions are given than puzzles. For that, you can refer to : GRE Barrons - Analytical questions (Take old edition of book. In new edition of GRE book, there are no analytical questions). But whatever you prepare, it mostly depends on your analytical abilities. 

Above all, Infosys test is not at all difficult. It just needs some application from you. You can work on your analytical skills and attend the test. You can easily get through.

---------------------------------

Hexaware Pattern : 2003 June

pattern - 100 qns in 60 mins

Verbal 
Find the Wrongly Spelt word 
Synonym
Antonym
Fill in the blanks

Aptitude (purely mathematical)
- Better have a look at the previous 1998 qn paper, from that we got many questions.
- Strong analytical geometric and mensurational skills needed.

Computer Awareness
- Simply like find odd man out and 10 qns regarding 2 pseudocodes given

Time Constraint was the big thing, u cannot complete the paper if u solve all the qns, its not needed also, they're just seeing the relative mark, in our college from 150 , 29 were shortlisted for GD and from it 12 were shortlisted for Interview, i missed out in GD.

Topics were War on Iraq,Leaders Born or Made

try to assess ur group in GD, if u think its of to be an debating group, pls don't follow GD rules, and create ur oppurtunities for speaking as raising ur tone, intervening the conversation going on, 'its pretty sure that u'll be going off the GD rules, but it was the case in our group", i followed GD rules and i missed it out.

---------------------------------

Starcom Test Pattern

The test for starcom consists of only 10 C programs which are multiple choice.

The programs are pretty straight forward...they basically test ur fundamentals...

1-2 questions on loops.
recursion..
one on pointers
usage of basic string functions..strlen(ptr); where ptr is a chr pointer etc.
preprocessor directives like #define..
if both macro and function are defined which one is executed if called?..etc
One on cpp which is simple swap of two integers..
the test is easy just brush up urself on pointers and strings and u'll get thro

Yesterday is History, Tomorrow is a Mystery and Today is a gift:
