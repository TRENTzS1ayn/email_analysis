Please review and comment on the draft UA charter[1].  Please send
comments or concerns before July 24th.  If no comments or concerns are
received by July 24th I will send to Judy Brewer the working groups
endorsement of the draft.

Remember that the working group only has an advisory role in the
rechartering.  It is up to the W3C Advisory COmmitte to define the actual
scope of the charter.

Jon
