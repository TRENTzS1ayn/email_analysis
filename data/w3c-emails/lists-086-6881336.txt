Hi, I was wondering what the top assistive/adaptive technologies are these
days. My company is in the process of establishing a usability lab and I got
them interested in buying and installing the top (or most widely used)
assitive technologies. Only thing is, I'm not sure what those are anymore.
At one point, I knew that JAWS was a widely used screen reader, but know I'm
not sure. Any recommendations for the following adaptive technologies would
be helpful:


Alternative Keyboards
Alternate Mouse Access
Braille Embossers
Refreshable Braille Displays
Screen Magnifiers
Screen Readers
Speech Recognition Software
Talking Web Browsers

Thanks!
