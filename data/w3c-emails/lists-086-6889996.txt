The EMBED element is not part of HTML 4, so its behavior is really 
undefined.  Different browsers will do different things with it and it will 
probably not be supported in future browsers, as browser people move to 
supporting standards more strictly.

The only way I know of to do what you want to do is through server or 
client side scripting.  You will need to use cookies or GET to keep track 
of how many times the user goes to a page.  Make sure you disable caching 
using the META element.
