I think we should rethink our FTF meeting strategy.  Currently our draft 
charter says 2- 3 FTF meeting a year.  Our last few FTF meetings have been 
sparsely attended and I think we need to rethink our FTF meeting strategy.

I would like the working group to consider developing and presenting 
workshops at various conferences to raise awareness of UAAG and to attract 
developers to participate in the working group.  The workshops could be 
followed up with more in formal birds of a feather discussions.  These 
workshops would serve as our FTF meeting for the next year.

Options include:
1. Special workshops independent of conferences or other developer events
2. Workshops as part of regular conference programs, with BOF times after 
the workshop

What do people think?
