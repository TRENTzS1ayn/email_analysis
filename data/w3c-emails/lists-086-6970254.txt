I like the idea of organizing a workshop this year for
two purposes:

  1) See where we are with UAAG 1.0 after (approximately)    
     one year. Are there conforming user agents? Do we
     have any feedback on the specification? Who is using
     the spec?

  2) Invite people interested in the next generation
     of user agent guidelines. Often, W3C organizes a 
     Workshop [1] to gather input to the charter development
     process. We do not yet have a clear plan for what
     our next generation guidelines will focus on. A workshop
     gives us a chance to gather information.

After a workshop, we should develop a charter based on what
we've heard.

I also think that a presence at conferences to talk to and
hear from developers is a good idea. I don't know whether
that needs to take the form of a Workshop each time, however
(at least in how I am using the term "Workshop").
