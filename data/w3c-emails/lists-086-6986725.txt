2. XML application development accessibility guidelines are important,
as new schemas/DTDs may ignore accessibility, and the user agents
that may be expected to extract meaning from documents.

3. The work progressing in the new "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0"
seems to have significant impact on the UA-guidelines, and the UA test 
suite items may need some refocusing.
