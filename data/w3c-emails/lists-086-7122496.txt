Sa mga mods, sensya na sa cross posting, gusto ko lang
i-warn ang mga members.

Sa mga members na walang interest sa technical
discussions at walang pakialam sa panloloko ng ibang
tao, you may ignore the rest of this email.

Rhoel yaman din lang na sa opinion mo ay may
kakulangan pa ang aking kakayahan sa pag-imbestiga, at
sinabi mong "try ko rin na i-trace sila..." ma-aari mo
ba ibahagi sa amin ang technique na ginagamit mo para
ma-trace ang actual subscribers nila? Baka ma-dagdagan
ko pa ang ebidinsyang nakalap ko. O kaya baka
makatulong yun sa abogago ni Bored Mother/Wife,
NaUgHtY mInD at Ben Tumbling.

People of HPSL/PP vs. Bored Mother/Wife, NaUgHtY mInD,
et.al.
Ladies and Gentlemen, I present the facts of the case
(see attachments).


adam


PS. Bakit ko ginagawa ito? Sabi ni NaUgHtY mInD inggit
lang ako. Totoo kaya?

INCONSISTENCIES:

A.
1. lollipop (Bored Mother)  -- lives in Manila/Las Pinas
2. robinhood (Ben Tumbling) -- lives in Taiwan
3. tiramisu (Administrator) -- works in Singapore
*** How can 3 people with demonstrated limited computer expertise use the 
same IP be in 3 different countries?

B.

nya
2. robinhood (Ben Tumbling) -- pinoy in taiwan na kalaguyo ang pinay maid 
nya
3. unknown (NaUgHtY mInD)   -- fan ni Ben Tumbling, ginaya ang pag-abuso sa 
maid nya
*** How can 3 people with the same modus operandi share the same IP?

C.
1. lollipop (Bored Mother)  -- says "I wanna meet NaUgHtY mInD"
2. shivaki (syota ni Bored) -- claims to have met Bored Mother/Wife at siete 
picados
3. unknown (NaUgHtY mInD)   -- has not yet met Bored Mother/Wife, will do so 
on Sunday 7Sept
*** How can 3 people using the same IP(61.71.0.66) claim to have met and not 
met each other?

2. lollipop (Bored Mother)  -- row 14 [bored.gif] (27Aug 7:14am): sent email 
using 139.175.57.124 IP
*** How can 2 people in 2 different countries share the same IP within a 14 
minute timeframe?

E.
1. lollipop (Bored Mother)  -- sent pics of 2 different women (sarah2.jpg & 
bored wife.jpg)
2. unknown (NaUgHtY mInD)   -- sent a pic supposedly of Bored Wife 
(sarah2.jpg)

-----------------------------------------------------

I am well aware that IP address use is not sufficient evidence but it and 
other facts should be taken in the context of the conversation.

1.)The question of Siete picados arose since lollipop/Bored (lives in 
Manila), and shivaki/Syota claims to have met there. It is logical to assume 
that the subject restaurant is the one located in Manila.

2.)The suggestion of the use of "anonymous proxy", "IP spoofing" or some 
other technique is highly improbable..... how many bored housewife do you 
know is capable of this (as was aptly explained by JunB)?

3.)The Keywords are "demonstrated limited computer expertise". It is evident 
from the crude attempt at email spoofing done by robinhood/BenT which was 
immediately discovered by the real Reggie Navato. True hackers would not be 
caught dead making stupid mistakes.

4.)Is it not true that lollipop et.al have been banned or moderated from 
HPSL/PP for their patent display of deception? If the same action is made by 
unkown/NaUgHtY, the intent is to again deceive other gullible members of 
HPSL/PP.

In the face of overwhelming circumstantial evidence, is there someone here 
who will defend the individual/s concerned? We are not talking of "what ifs" 
and "possibilities", rather it is a matter of "probability". Hence, I submit 
that the said individuals (NaUgHtY mInD, Bored Mother/Wife, et.al.), if not 
one and the same, are operating a concerted effort to deceive members of 
HPSL/PP. Therefore, should be metted appropriate action which the mods alone 
may determine.

If one disputes my allegations, can you at least submit proof how these were 
done in this particular case.

Your honor/s, I rest my case. :-)
