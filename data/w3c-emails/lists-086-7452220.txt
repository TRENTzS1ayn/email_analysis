User Agent Working,
This is a tool we have been working on at UIUC for the past year.  I just 
wanted everyone in the UA group to know about the tool.  I would ask you to 
try it and if you think it is useful to help promote the use of the 
tool.  I beleive this is one of the first tools where you get accessible 
markup by default, authors do not need any detailed knowledge of 
accessibility or HTML to use the tool to create highly accessible HTML 
versions of Power Point Presentations.

The Accessible Web Publishing Wizard Version 1.0 is available for Microsoft 
Power Point.  It allows authors to create highly accessible HTML versions 
of Power Point Presentations with little or no knowledge of accessibility 
or HTML coding techniques.  The tool makes it easy to not only conform to 
Section 508 requirements[1], but also to conform at the Double-AA level to 
the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines[2].  I encourage anyone who 
uses Power Point to create presentations to try this tool to make them 
accessible to people with disabilities.

The free download is available from:

Please feel free to share this URL with other lists or people you feel 
could benefit from this tool.
