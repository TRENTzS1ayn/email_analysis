It depends on the user agent what it does. Implementations such as iCab and
Opera ensure that their activation method removes the possibilities for
conflict. Others, like IE are not clear - sometimes do one thign, sometimes
the other.

WCAG recommends that accesskey be used. Personally, so do I, and that a page
about accessibility explains what they are, how they might be used, and why
they might not work. If you know there is a key that will override a user
agent fdunctionality it is a good idea to try and avoid it, but in the end
user agents have to get fixed or replaced. IMHO
