Our charter is being submitted very soon (i.e., Friday or Monday) for 
review by W3C management, the Advisory Board, and later the Advisory 
Committee for a vote. Please review the latest draft of the charter[1] 
and make comments as soon as possible. There is one major issue to 
resolve (Rec-track documents, if any), and a number of smaller edits 
which the list should look at.

* Judy is concerned that we are not chartered for any new Rec-track 
documents. If we are planning any Rec-track work, we will need to 
declare it in the charter.

* In deliverables, I propose to change:
Publish an updated assessment of implementation of UAAG 1.0 at least 
every six months;
to:
Publish an updated assessment of implementation of UAAG 1.0;

* Voting has been updated to current patent policy document.
* Confidentiality has been pointed to same.
* Material quoted from the Process Document has been removed, and a 
link has been put in its place.
* Added a Meetings section.

* Patent policy has been updated. I have mentioned this on the calls 
before. If you have not read this yet, you will need to read and 
approve of it to remain in the working group after this charter has 
become active.
