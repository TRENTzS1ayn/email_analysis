Bart,
The use of THEAD and TBODY may not be of use to JAWS, but it
can be used to create more usable visual renderings of
information that support all users, but also users who magnify
font size and want the table headers to remain visible while
scrolling through data cells.

The following examples demonstrates how headers can be fixed
and allow data cell scrolling.

Currently the only browser I know that supports this type of
markup is Mozilla.  Please try the following example in the
Mozilla browser.
