I've been working in a task force in the Education and Outreach WG on 
redesigning the WAI portion of the W3C site. Part of that has been to 
work on introductory pages to the guidelines documents, instead of 
throwing users into specifications without explaining thoroughly enough 
what they are.

I took an action item to write up the page for UAAG 1.0, and would like 
the group to review it:

http://www.w3.org/%e2%80%8b%e2%80%8bWAI/%e2%80%8b%e2%80%8bEO/%e2%80%8b%e2%80%8bDrafts/%e2%80%8b%e2%80%8bsketchpad/%e2%80%8b%e2%80%8buaag

Note that this has no visual style. This is by design. We're concerned 
with the content in these documents first and foremost. Does it have 
all the relevant links? Is the text simple and descriptive enough? Is 
anything missing? Should anything be taken out?

Please have a look and send me any comments.

Thanks,
m
