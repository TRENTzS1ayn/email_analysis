Hello all,

Some colleagues were just showing me some "Extension" tools
they are using in their browsers, some of which provide
interesting features that are required by UAAG 1.0.

See the Mozilla extensions:
  http://extensionroom.mozdev.org/

And the firebird extensions:
  http://www.texturizer.net/firebird/extensions/

See in particular:

 - Autoscroll
 - Style Sheet switcher
 - Web Developer
 - Things they left out
 - Checky
 - ChromeEdit (for GUI configuration)
 - CompactMenu
 - Adblock
 - EditCSS
 - EZNav
 - ImageZoomer
 - LinkIT and Link Toolbar
 - Popup Count
 - Popup ALT attributes
 - Text Zoom

I haven't tried them all, but the descriptions sound promising.

 _ Ian
