Hi,

If we highlight a certain part of a page with a DIV, and TITLE it 
appropriately, should AT be able to pick up when it enters and exits 
that certain part of the page?  In other words, much like TABLEs, should 
AT be required, or are they required, to notify the user when they have 
gone into and out of a DIV.

Thanks,
-Kerstin
