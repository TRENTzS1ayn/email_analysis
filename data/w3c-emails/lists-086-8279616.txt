  *********************************************************************

  A vast manifold of tiny, embedded and autonomous computing and
  communication systems have started to create and populate a pervasive and
  ubiquitous computing landscape, characterized by the autonomy of their
  programmed behavior, the dynamics and context-awareness of services and
  applications they offer, the ad-hoc interoperability of services and the
  different modes of user interaction upon those services. This is mostly
  due to technological progress like the maturing of wireless networking,
  exciting new information processing possibilities induced by novel
  microprocessor technologies, low power storage systems, smart material,
  and motor-, controller-, sensor- and actuator technologies. A future
  computing scenario is envisioned in which almost every object in our
  everyday environment will be equipped with embedded processors, wireless
  communication facilities and embedded software to perceive, perform and
  control a multitude of tasks and functions. Since many of these objects
  are already able to communicate and interact with global networks and with
  each other, the vision of context-aware "smart appliances" and "smart
  spaces" has already become a reality. Service provision is based on the
  ability of being aware of the presence of other objects or users, and
  systems can be designed in order to be sensitive, adaptive and responsive
  to their needs, habits and even emotions. With pervasive computing
  technology embodied into real world objects like furniture, clothing,
  crafts, rooms, etc., those artefacts also become the interface to
  "invisible" services and allow to mediate between the physical and digital
  (or virtual) world via natural interaction - away from desktop displays
  and keyboards. Novel interface concepts for situated interaction give rise
  for bringing the interaction with computers "back to the real world" .

  All these observations pose serious challenges to the conceptual
  architectures of computing, and the related engineering disciplines in
  computer science. PERVASIVE 2004, the Second International Conference on
  Pervasive Computing, provides a premier venue to bring together
  researchers and practitioners working in all foundational and applied
  research areas of pervasive and ubiquitous computing. It will include
  presentations, workshops, tutorials and multimedia demonstrations on
  subjects like:

* Focus

  Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing Architectures
  Sensors and Actuators / Computational Perception
  "Smart" Appliances / Ambient Intelligence
  New Technologies / New Materials / Small Artefacts
  Displays / Vision / Mixed Reality Systems
  Spontaneous / Wireless / Mobile Communication
  Networked Embedded Systems
  Context Awareness / Autonomous Computing
  Coordination Models and Systems
  Middleware and Software Frameworks
  Interaction Models / Interaction Design
  User Interfaces (e.g. Situative/Tangible/Attentive)
  Emerging Industrial / Business Scenarios
  Social / Privacy / Security Issues


  PERVASIVE 2004 will present cutting edge research results in the following
  formats and categories:

* Regular Papers and Tech-Notes

  Regular papers will present original, highly innovative, prospective and
  forward-looking research in one or more of the categories given above.
  Just like regular papers, tech-notes will present directing research, but
  in very focused and compact format. Tech-notes are not understood as short
  papers condensed into less page space, but present pointed results at a
  high level of technicality.

* Hot Spot Papers

  Hot spot papers aim at presenting very topical issues and late breaking
  application oriented results in all areas of pervasive and ubiquitous
  computing. Depending on the type and style of the hot spot paper, demo
  exhibition space, poster space and short presentations  to the
  PERVASIVE 2004 plenary audience will be given. They will be included in 
  the PERVASIVE 2004 DVD.

* Doctoral Colloquium

  The PERVASIVE 2004 doctoral colloquium, to be held right before the main
  conference during April 18-19 in Linz, Austria, invites PhD students and
  candidates to present, discuss and defend their work-in-progress or
  preliminary results in an international, agile and renowned audience of
  junior and senior researchers and developers in the pervasive computing
  field. Thesis position papers will be defended in the colloquium, relating
  a problem statement, methodological approach, potential for innovation and
  expected contribution to the international pervasive computing literature.

* Videos

  Short videos will present novel pervasive computing systems, devices or
  just designs, or demonstrate innovative styles of interaction or usability
  of those systems - in a lively format. They will be presented during the
  PERVASIVE 2004 Video Night - a special event at the festival hall of the
  University of Vienna. All video clips will be presented in the
  PERVASIVE 2004 Video DVD.

* Tutorials and Workshops

  PERVASIVE 2004 tutorials will provide the dissemination of advanced
  concepts, technologies and skills to the participants. Tutorials will
  focus on seminal and pioneering topics of pervasive computing or cover an
  outstanding new branch of pervasive computing research. Workshop sessions
  will provide inspiring and influencing discussion on pervasive computing
  topics. Each workshop aims at the sharing and consolidation of new
  research ideas and fosters future co-operations. The following workshops
  are scheduled: W1: Gaming Applications in Pervasive Computing
  Environments, W2: Toolkit Support for Interaction in the Physical World,
  W3: Memory and Sharing of Experiences, W4: Computer Support for Human
  Tasks and Activities, W5: Benchmarks and a database for context
  recognition, W6: SPPC: Security and Privacy in Pervasive Computing,
  W7: Sustainable Pervasive Computing
