Subject: Nestcape 6.2 and tabindex

I stumbled across your Tabindex test page today while trying to resolve
some issues.  I have setup tabindex on an HTML form to control user
navigation.  In Netscape 6.2 the tab key works properly to move from
index to index, however SHIFT-TAB alternates between the URL and index
1.  This does not appear to be a problem in Netscape 7.0, and Netscape
4.x does not support tabindex.  It also is fine in the versions of
Internet Explorer I have tested.  I could not find anything on the
Internet regarding this problem with Netscape 6.2 and was wondering if
you have experienced it.

Thanks,
