this is all well and good, and I applaude your efforts, but how does this
make the internet accessible, nor does it fully meet the standards set in
508 unless this software and the required supporting software must be
provided at no cost to the user for it to meet the standards.  and people
who write websites expecting this software to make them compliant would be
decieved since it only supports certain proprietary software and operating
systems that must be purchased at sometimes great cost.
