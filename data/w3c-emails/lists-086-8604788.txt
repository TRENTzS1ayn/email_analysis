       I am especially interested in discussing text-to-speech standards and 
       interfaces.

Jim, is there anything up on the web that would pass for a
situation survey?  Something about what is in practice in the
field, and possible opportunities to improve things by defining
standards?

For example, lots of Lynx users have screen readers that
don't even distinguish the flavors of highlighted text that the
VT-100 is capable of.  This is a real drag in composing
accessible HTML.

For that sort of a screen reader, I basically have to write
Gopher screens.  I would prefer hypertext, i.e. links embedded in
naturally flowing prose with just enough hint as you drive over
the hot spots.
