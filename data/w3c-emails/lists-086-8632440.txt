I have put some thoughts on the opportunity that the Initiative is facing
as it organizes itself in an informal whitepaper at 

http://www.access.digex.net/%7Easgilman/web-access/process_points.html

Sorry I won't be with you in Nice to explain this.  But I hope that some
people will have a chance to read this, and that the tasks and teams that
come out of this meeting fit the present state of knowledge better than
the plan going in.  

For example, it is premature to form separate teams on protocol writing
and guideline writing at this time.  We need to pound on protocols and
guidelines as a unit until the guidelines are so lightweight that they
will fly.  We are not to that point yet.
