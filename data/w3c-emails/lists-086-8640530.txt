Thanks for the input, Al, comments on your document will follow.

Actually, I think we need to work on protocols and languages first,
and then on guidelines. But of course there will be overalp, since we
won't be done with technology before we start working on guidelines.

As far as using one forum/team to discuss that, I agree, and that's
why you only see one w3c-wai-wg list for now.
