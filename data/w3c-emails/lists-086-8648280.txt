OK, I liked the mailto extension proposal too
(http://www.internic.net/internet-drafts/draft-hoffman-mailto-url-01.txt)
but I think authors using these extensions should be made aware of the
incompatibility with browsers that do not support them.

In other word a mailto:dd@w3.org?subject:foo will either produce an
error on the browser side or later bounce if my browser doesn't parse
the ?header part correctly.

As a rule of thumb, it is a good idea to always provide a separate
"simple* mailto URL as well (much like before the time mailto itself
was supported widely, people were asked to provide FORM alternative of
mailto URL)
