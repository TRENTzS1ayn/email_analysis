Hello everybody,

I'm technical advisor of a couple of handicapped associations in Spain. We've
been working on a Spanish standard for Computer Accesibility, both hardware and
software, which is almost finished and should be approved during this year.
We've also considered web accessibility, from the user's perspective.

I'm new in the list w3c-wai-wg@w3.org, and althogh my technical background is
not bad, I did not understad the word "Imprint Page"  from your message

>           "BPP-[0-9]+" or "IPP-[ivxlc]+", etc.

>         - Use REV="BPP" or REV="IPP"
I would appreciate your sahring your knowledge.

I'm afraid I won't be able to attend to the Nice's meeting, due to budget
restrictions, but I'm very interested in web accesibility and hope to learn and
contribute to the project.
