I agree with Daniel on his reactions to Murray's suggestions about
IPP and BPP.

I also have a general comment about the direction I see Murray's
message leading, namely, tag-mania all over again.

Daniel--  so you have some background about IPP and BPP:

The ICADD 22 was designed to help in the production of etexts and
braille texts --these were necessarily looking at documents that had
already been published.
This is why tags representing post-processing information such as IPP
and BPP made their way into that DTD.

As you point out, these do not have a place except in the printing
spec, and I'd redirect this to that working group.

Hopefully there wont be a pagebreak tag coming out of that work, but
if there is indeed a pagebreak tag that emerges for inkprint,
there may be a corresponding need for a Braille pagebreak tag
to indicate to Braille printing software where in the Braille output
it is okay to start a new page.

As far as I can tell, all the <FIG> tag outlined in the message below
is doing is to introduce a logical grouping--
again, do we need a new tag for this? (I hope not)
