Two footnotes for this thread:

Lloyd Rassmussen did a good job of introducing WebHeads to life
with Braille in a note on the lynx-dev mailing list, archived at

http://www.flora.org/lynx-dev/html/month0597/msg00622.html

The "content" and "presentation" of braille documents are not so
independent as in the visual-print realm.  Braille is very 
physical; it must fit the fingertip.  Disasters occur when a non-user
tries to do something without checking with a user, as seen in 
the "monumental scale" braille in the new FDR memorial.  A news
article about this can be found at
