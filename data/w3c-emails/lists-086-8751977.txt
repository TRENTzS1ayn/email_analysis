  From: "T. V. Raman" <raman@adobe.com>
  
  I agree with Daniel on his reactions to Murray's suggestions about
  IPP and BPP.
  
  I also have a general comment about the direction I see Murray's
  message leading, namely, tag-mania all over again.
  
On the whole, I agree with the trend established by Daniel and
seconded by T.V.  The place where I fall off the track laid down
by T.V. has to do with making references to print versions in 
the accepted indexing medium of the print realm.

[picking up the quote from T.V.]

  Daniel--  so you have some background about IPP and BPP:
  
  The ICADD 22 was designed to help in the production of etexts and
  braille texts --these were necessarily looking at documents that had
  already been published.
  This is why tags representing post-processing information such as IPP
  and BPP made their way into that DTD.
  
  As you point out, these do not have a place except in the printing
  spec, and I'd redirect this to that working group.
  
[Al, here...]

This is where my agreement breaks down.  Specifically, "these do
not have a place except in the printing spec" goes too far.  The
Braille user with an ICADD 22 document can get an answer to the
question "Where am I in the print-version coordinates?"  That
question should be answerable by some mechanism we support.  It
is not just a matter of instructing the printing device.  This is
required for coordination [over the phone] by people using print
and Braille variants of the same document.  The same goes for
print and Web versions of the same document.  Braille users are
not the only users needing cross-index or coordinate
tranformation services.

Compare this with the issue of the West Publishing copyright on
the pagination that is required as the means of indexing in court
proceedings in the U.S.
