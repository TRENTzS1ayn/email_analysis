The above is not a true statement.

What is true is that
the presentation of Braille cannot always
 be directly derived from the visual
presentation of the content.

But  to say that Braille formatting is in some way different from visual

Yes-- Braille formatting needs to take into account the needs of the finger
  tip just as much as visual formatting takes care of the needs of the eye.
But the above is just to acknowledge that Braille formatting is different from
  and distinct from visual formatting for the eye--
it does not assert that Braille formatting requires formatting specific
  knowledge  to get tangled up in the information content.
