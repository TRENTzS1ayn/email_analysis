Al--

I do not disagree with you on the need for synchrony between Braille and print
versions.

However, mixing in either print specific or Braille specific
markup into the document is wrong --and it is wrong to mixin Braille
pagebreaks into the markup for the same reasons that it is wrong to mixin
visual printing specific markup into the document.

Both of these belong in the style sheet arena plus the specs like the printing
spec that is trying to solve precisely the same problem.

The "synchrony" problem between Braille and print that you point out exists in
a much more dramatic way for all WWW users today,
namely, synchronizing between the printed copy and the online scroll.
Let's piggy back on the solution that the WWW invents to that problem--
you can bet that that solution is likely to be invented far faster than any
access specific thing.

This could also serve as a model for the way the WAI addresses access issues
by bringing them into the mainstream; there is a good chance that the current
debate about printing has not considered Braille, and there is an even better
chance that once the topic is introduced in that forum
along with knowledge about Braille printing,
it might well be possible to come up with an integrated approach that solves
the three-way synchrony problem,
namely, persons A, B, and C carrying out a phone conversation about a document
where:
A reads a printed Braille version
B reads an online scroll
C reads an inkprint version.
