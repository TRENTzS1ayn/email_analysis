For people that cannot travel to Nice for the WAI meeting but want to
call in, I have set up a conference phone line at:
(+33).1.49.57.40.52

I have booked the line from noon to 5pm Sophia/French time, which is 6
hours ahead of Boston and 9 hours ahead of SFO (note that we will have
a one hour lunch break from 1pm to 2pm french time).
 
Please do not redistribute, since there is a limit on the number of
callers and I'd like to give it in priority to people on this list.
