I agree with Larry--
except that rather than defining an uncountable number of languages of the
form
blind-english, low-vision-english, ...
the "special need" should be a separate axis that takes values and can be
specified by the user agent, e.g. the WWW browser, just as the language is a
separate acix.

The protocol at the server end should map <special-need>_<language> to the
appropriate type of content.

If the server has content in the language at the top of the list, it will respond in that language. If not, it will try the next language in the list, and so on.

It would be inefficient to send that much text data for every image on the page when all users (vision-impaired or not) are only interested in one version of the data. In addition, the REL attribute and the FIG tag have been around for quite a while, but no browsers have implemented them -- they may be a dead-end street.

Servers would then respond in the most appropriate "language" without sending redundant information."
