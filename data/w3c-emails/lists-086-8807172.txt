  Here is a view on the D-tag discussion from one of WGBH's web authors:
  
  "The latest version of the HTTP standard (1.1) allows browsers
to send an ordered lists of language preferences when they
request a page from a server. If the server has content in the
language at the top of the list, it will respond in that
language. If not, it will try the next language in the list, and
so on.
  
  Currently, only the Apache server supports HTTP 1.1 and as far
as I know, none of the browsers are using it yet either.
  
  The solution(s) presented in the first message seem
unnecessarily complex. It would be inefficient to send that much
text data for every image on the page when all users
(vision-impaired or not) are only interested in one version of
the data. In addition, the REL attribute and the FIG tag have
been around for quite a while, but no browsers have implemented
them -- they may be a dead-end street.
  
[Al, here...]

Learn about Lynx.

Lynx gives you the chance to experience various features of HTTP
1.1 and HTML 3.0 that you may not realize have been implemented.
