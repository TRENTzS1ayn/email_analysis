Recently there was a rough consensus on the list in favor of
special-need descriptors being sent from client to server as
part of format negotiation.

I think that we should make "the taxonomy of abilities and
special needs" that these message attributes employ a development
item, and that we should try to rope the doctors mentioned below
into this task.  Paul has contributed on this point on the
dev-access mailing list.
