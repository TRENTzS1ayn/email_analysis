We found in our work that people wanted layered descriptions.

Something very short and succinct
Something more descriptive
Something which catches all of the information available visually.


They don't want to pay for the latter unless they want or need it.


Suggest we think of Alt Tag as the first level.

Perhaps the second level could be embedded in the page if it is short.

The third would be downloaded on request from the server.  The link for 
this extended description might be embedded in the second level information 
somehow.    This suggestion is not made from the basis of technical 
feasibility but rather from the fact that it buries it away a bit so that 
it does not confuse the regular page any more than it has to - but makes it 
available to those seeking more descriptive information.

My text for this message:

  From: "Larry Goldberg" <Larry_Goldberg@wgbh.org>

                                         ... all users
  (vision-impaired or not) are only interested in one version of
  the data.

[Al, here...]

Not many of our users would agree with that.  If there are
alternatives, our users want to know that the alternatives exist,
and control the selection of alternatives, including going back
for more or different data if the rules applied at the server
didn't work well.

Yes, they are willing for the server to guess.  The don't want
all the data delivered at first blush.  But they want the guesses
to determine defaults, not stone walls.

We've had some heated discussions on lynx-dev over this one.
