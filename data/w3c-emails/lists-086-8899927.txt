[note that I change the Subject to a better naming, this is not about
a tag and more about a link]

Yesterday at the WAI meeting we discussed that at length, and
eventually decided to first work on and write down the requirements
related to this functionality (pretty close to what you just posted,
Gregg, with some additional things like: we want something that can be
deployed NOW)

Once we've done that, we can decide if the D link is better than
OBJECT or else, or both.

Next week I'll post the minutes and the action items from the meeting
(including D-link of course).
