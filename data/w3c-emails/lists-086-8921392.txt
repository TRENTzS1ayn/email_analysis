          I don't have the problem with the label itself, nor do most
          of the people with disabilities that I know.  However, it's
          a different matter when to use some features on the
          Internet, you must wear a badge stating your disability.  I
          believe that we should identify a certain capability that is
          needed (such as text-only) and make it available.  In
          explaining why it is needed, we should say that it's
          important for disability access and say why, for people with
          older browsers, for people driving automobiles and the like.

          For the other disabilities you mentioned, what specific
          changes are needed?  I agree that Web access is not limited
          to the blind, low vision and dyslexic people that I know
          best.
