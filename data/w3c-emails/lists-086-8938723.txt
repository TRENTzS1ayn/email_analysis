Hi Al,

I would suggest we work from either a functional viewpoint or from a 
preferences viewpoint and not from a disability etiology.

That is that the client say

"cannot view graphics"
or
"prefer that you send text only"
or
"prefer that you send
- text only
- or voice enabled applets


and not that the client send
"blind" or "low vision"


the former has much more application beyond disability - and will extend to 
hand held and nomadic devices.

The latter doesn't really help much anyway since people who are blind can 
have very different skills and different browser / reader capabilities.

I'll be short - but if what I'm saying isn't clear. Drop me a line.

Thanks


Gregg

Recently there was a rough consensus on the list in favor of
special-need descriptors being sent from client to server as
part of format negotiation.

I think that we should make "the taxonomy of abilities and
special needs" that these message attributes employ a development
item, and that we should try to rope the doctors mentioned below
into this task.  Paul has contributed on this point on the
dev-access mailing list.

Al,
Sure. Thank you for considering me. Dennis Anson may also be
interested (dennis@u.washington.edu).
