I agree with Gregg, to the extend that if we ever get to extent HTTP
to have the client send info to the server (we need to look at what
HTTP already handle, e.g, instead of "cannot view graphics", the
client just doesn't ask for them, or things like regular content-type
negociation), we will have to work at the functional level.

The latter also involves some privacy matters.

but for our own education/requirement process, I agree with Al that it
would be useful to have such a taxonomy document. So I'd like to see
someone volunteer to drive that effort.
