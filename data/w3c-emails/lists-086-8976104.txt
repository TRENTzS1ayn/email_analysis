Hello all,

I agree with Mr. Vanderheiden. While developing our national standard on
hardware and software accessibility we realized tha the same problem/solution
could:
- affect more than one disability
- affect non disabled people
- not all the people with that disbility may be affected

therefore it makes sense to choose by client's preference, rather than by
disability.

Concerning physical disabilities, as a quadriplegic with some movements in my
arms and hands, I believe that most of our problems have to do with the
navigation/mail/tools. If the tools are acceisble, so are the contents of the
pages.

Regards,
Javier Roma?ach

: Hi Al,
: 
: I would suggest we work from either a functional viewpoint or from a 
: preferences viewpoint and not from a disability etiology.
: 
: That is that the client say
: 
: "cannot view graphics"
: or
: "prefer that you send text only"
: or
: "prefer that you send
: - text only
: - or voice enabled applets
: 
: 
: and not that the client send
: "blind" or "low vision"
: 
: 
: the former has much more application beyond disability - and will extend to 
: hand held and nomadic devices.
: 
: The latter doesn't really help much anyway since people who are blind can 
: have very different skills and different browser / reader capabilities.
: 
: I'll be short - but if what I'm saying isn't clear. Drop me a line.
: 
: Thanks
:
