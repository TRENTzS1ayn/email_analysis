  What is meant is that all users want one version that works for
them regardless of their needs, that people don't want multiple
copies sent to them if they can get one that truly works.  Of
course this may mean that multiple versions and alternates are
available and that users would like to know about these versions,
but ultimately just want the one that works for them.
  
  Still disagree?
  
[Al, here..]

Sounds like we are in flaming agreement.

To carry the point a little further, I want to get a little
distance between "user wants" and "what is sent."  The users want
a form of dialog that works for them.  This dialog is seen
between the user and the client program(s).  Precisely what the
server sends the client is of a lesser concern to the user.  How
much redundancy is used in the client/server messages is, I
think, an issue where the developers will take the lead and the
users mostly check that the end-to-end capability is not broken.
