Greg,
That sounds like a good approach. Efforts on the client side-
browser/desktop/viewer/player- might be more fruitful in terms of
extending web access into the realm of the motor disabled (my patients). 
On an interesting aside: I happen to be at an institution which
has adopted thin-clients (NCD's). It seems to me that this type of
hardware, while apparently cheap to own and operate, is going to be
very difficult to make accessable.
