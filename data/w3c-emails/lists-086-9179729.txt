Shouldn't the TITLE attribute convey the information about the
destination of a link ?

I'd rather separate the meaning of the image from the meaning of its
application in a particular context using different attributes.

e.g
  <IMG SRC="w3clogo.png" ALT="W3C logo">
is one thing
and 
  <A HREF="http://www.w3.org" TITLE="W3C Projects Status">
     <IMG SRC="w3clogo.png" ALT="W3C logo">
  </A>

(TITLE is now a core attributes in Cougar but was in A since day one)

You realize of course that it's better not to depend on a particular
browser, but could explain why one is better in one context.
