Dave--

I'd separate the issue of acronyms from pronunciations.

Reasoning:

Commonly used abbreviations tend to be universal and context independent
e.g. UNO means the United Nations independent of the document in which it
occurs.
These abbreviations can be handled by client-side dictionaries that apply
across the board to all documents; marking them up in an individual document
instance is unnecessary.

On the other hand, there are many commonly used acronyms that are heavily
context-dependent.

Jan in a calendar is January;
but you dont want the speech UA to say January every time it sees Jan.

This latter category of acronyms would be useful to markup.

In fact marking up "lb" might help both speech users as well as non-native
speakers of English
i.e. <acronym title = "pounds">lb</acronym>
