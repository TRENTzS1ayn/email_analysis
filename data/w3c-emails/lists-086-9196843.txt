The suggestion is that TITLE would be used for the full name, e.g.
MIT becomes "Massachussetts Institute of Technology". For
pronunciation I have been arguing for a new attribute, for encoding
phonemic and prosodic info. This is still at an early stage of
discussion though.

The people I have been talking to don't consider acronym and
abbreviation as navigation elements. Rather they are there
for people to find the expanded form, and as an aid to user
agents to speak the phrase reasonably.

TITLE as used for tool tips or balloon help is intended in a rough
sense to be used in this way. That is as a means for people to
clarify the intended purpose/meaning.
