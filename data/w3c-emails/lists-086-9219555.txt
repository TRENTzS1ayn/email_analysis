That makes sense and is what I was intending. We should work towards
handling pronunciation in a new attribute that encodes phonemic and
prosodic information. The TITLE attribute amplifies the meaning by
expanding the acronym. An example peculiar to the UK:

     <acronym title="Womens Institute">WI</acronym>

Except this is really an abbreviation, that is easily handled by
client-side dictionaries.

Yes, that is how I would use it too.
