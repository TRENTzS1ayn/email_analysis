In fall of 1995, Dave Ragget and I worked on a set of extensions to the then
proposed HTML 3 to improve the performance of HTML forms with speech
interfaces.  HTML of today fails rather dramatically at providing semantic or
syntactic information about a form -- even more so than Graphical Interfaces
like Windows; for instance, consider the fact that HTML markup of today has no
provision for any kind of association between an input field and its
associated label.
