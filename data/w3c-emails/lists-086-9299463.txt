I forgot to include a specific proposal in my previous message concerning
this issue. More concretely then, I would suggest an optional element
within the HTML head element which would specify the principal language of
the document by way of an attribute. In the body of the document there
would be an optional element that could be included in headings,
paragraphs, lists or other desired contexts, and which would enclose text
that was written in any language other than the principal language as
already defined. This element would also include an attribute in which the
name of the language would be given. I recall having read that there is a
standard set of abbreviations for the names of languages but can not
remember the source of this information.

Jason White.
