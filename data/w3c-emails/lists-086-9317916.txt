I think that's exactly what HTML Cougar (next version of HTML)
supports.

Things like

<HTML LANG="fr">

<HEAD>
<TITLE> En Francais </TITLE>
</HEAD>

<BODY>

<P> En Francais

<H1 LANG="en"> In English </H1>

</BODY>

</HTML>

Dave answered this one: [RFC1766] 
    "Tags for the Identification of Languages",
    by H. Alvestrand, UNINETT, March 1995. This document can
