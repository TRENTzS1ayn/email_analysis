Thanks for explaining this.  May I check to see if I got the
story straight?

In the current W3C recommendation (14-Jan-1997) there is no
support for language identification other than by putting an
HTTP-EQUIV META tag in the HEAD which is perforce for the whole
document.

We can see in the Cougar DTD (that's all we can see) that LANG is
a generic attribute.  This means that it can be used on P,
BLOCQUOTE, and generally enough varieties of container to handle
mixed-language documents.

Is that substantially correct?
