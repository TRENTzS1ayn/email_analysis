Thank you for clarification of the language issue. May I suggest that when
defining style guidelines for the accessibility of HTML documents, that
proper use of the lang attribute be included as a requirement? Also, web
page developers should try to avoid cases in which a language change
occurs within a paragraph without any surrounding markup; thus, text in
the new language should always be distinguished by emphasis, a block
quotation etc. wherever possible, so that the lang attribute can be
specified.

Has the subject of markup for designating computer notation (namely,
extracts from computer programmes etc. that are presented within the
document) been raised as an issue in the discussion so far?

Regards,

Jason White.
