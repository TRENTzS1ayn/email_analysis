Actually, there is a <SPAN> and a <DIV> element in Cougar providing
just that, so there's no need to emphase of blockquote articifially
(not sure these 2 elements are new in Cougar, I think so). They both
supports establishing markup context, adding structure to the document
if you want.

<P>Hello, you know <SPAN LANG=fr> je suis francais </SPAN> from France.
