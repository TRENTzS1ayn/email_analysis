I assume by "HTML of today" you mean 3.2 or any variant that exists on
the market.

True, but Dave has not been in rest for the past 2 years :-) and he
told me recently that most of your past work on FORM has fed into the
Cougar spec, albeit with some pain in convincing some of the working
group members (with the WAI in place, one could expect that this
shouldn't be that hard in the future: we have a common voice now).

Anyway, in cougar

Label -> LABEL
Grouping -> FIELDSET
