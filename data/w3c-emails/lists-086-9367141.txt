Subject: Timeliness and scope of our work

I also expect to discuss things like naming for accessible user-agent
(smart vs dumb).

Here is some background notes.

In both cases (timeframe and scope), the issue is about providing
solutions (guidelines, techniques) based on existing market presence
or/and based on newer specification not yet supported by all tools.

Examples:
  - should we rely on the new OBJECT tag to implement LongDesc (aka
   d-link) functionality or on already deployed CLASS attributes + CSS.

  - should be describe guidelines for screen reader operating at a low
   graphical level or only worry about markup-smart user-agent.

Here you have my naming proposal:
* screen-reader = dumb screen-reader = tools that trap low
   level display calls (e.g. a platform DrawString)
        * markup-smart user-agent = markup-reader for short = tools
   that parse HTML/XML/CSS.

Note that I didn't use source-smart (as a generalization of markup)
since things like accessible mobile code (e.g. java) really boils down
to using dumb screen reader techniques on the client side (correct me
if I'm wrong, but I think Java accessibility is about providing hooks
to trap UI calls and such).
