          OK, Daniel, I'm operating on the assumption that I'll be
          working the phonetic pronunciation issue.  I'll make the
          June 18 phone call on the assumption that timeliness issues
          affect this effort.

          I'll be out of email touch next week, so I'll talk then.

          A few ideas that come immediately to mind:

          1.  I'll try to summarize the material in reference docs and
          what the current TTS devices are capable of.

          2.  I'm assuming we're mapping out a plan that should
          stretch over what we expect over the next decade, but be
          mindful of what can actually be delivered when these tags
          are first supported.

          3.  We need to worry both about the authoring tool side, and
          how these tags are generated easily by creators of content,
          and on the browser side.

          4.  We need to have a consensus on the objectives for
          phonetic markup.  My aim is to try to synthesize the
          comments of the past traffic and that of the next week, and
          deliver a draft week after next.
