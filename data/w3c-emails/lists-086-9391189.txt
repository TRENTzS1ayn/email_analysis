Most action items have found takers.

Here's the list with names.

- Cougar: W3C (myself and Arnaud Le Hors  - this one also includes
     topics such as ABBREV and ACRONYM that were discussed recently)
- LongDesc: Mike Paciello and George Kersher (Larry Goldberg from WGBH
       is also interested)
- ICADD: DanielD (really a report that Murray Maloney sent us a while ago)
- Phonetic: Harvey Bingham (I know Dave Raggett and Kevin Schofield
       from Microsoft are also interested in this one)
- ACSS: Al Gilman
- DOM: [still looking for someone, but since DOM is just starting,
       that can wait a little more]
- XML: Mike and Georges
- MATH: Probably Dave Raggett 
- HTTP: Javier Roma?ach

(details at
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-wg/msg00255.html)

Since some of you asked to work on the same topic, I highly encourage
to start discussion and send draft requirements and proposal document
early on this list.

The output of our work is going to feed both to the various 
W3C working groups (HTML/CSS/DOM/MATH/XML/HTTP) and our own work on
guidelines.
