I created a parallel area of the WAI WG member restricted site so that
you can access it without password and I can manage the project using
the Web and not just emails (see recent mixup due to lack of state...)

http://www.w3.org/WAI/group/

(note that from w3.org/WAI, the WG page is still pointed at Group -
capital G - so you have to access it "manually" til we set up our
authorization process accordingly)

New on this page:

- how to subscribe to mailing list and pointers to *new*
archive pages (Al's feedback not yet incorporated by Jose but 
not dropped either).

- Past and future agenda and minutes.

- Action items pool

- Conference call info

Send you feedback to me or the list.
