On the telecon today, we were talking about servers on the 'Net that
give a preview of how a page looks in Lynx to content developers who
work in a graphical environment and don't have Lynx running on their
site.

In addition to References 7,8 and 9 below, there is also

     Lynx-me - allows you to see how your page appears in Lynx

                              Public Lynx access
                                       
   There are a number of sites that will permit public Lynx access via
   telnet and a guest account. Web masters can also use web based
   services to see how their pages will appear in Lynx.
     * [1]Public Lynx at sailor.lib.md.us (login as 'guest') ver. 2.7.1
     * [2]Public Lynx at public.sunsite.unc.edu (login as 'lynx') ver.
       2.5
     * [3]Public Lynx at cwispub.unh.edu (login as 'cwispub') ver. 2.7
     * [4]Public Lynx at trfn.clpgh.org (login as 'trfn') ver. 2.6
     * [5]Public Lynx at lynx.cc.ukans.edu (login as 'lynx') ver. 2.5
     * [6]Public Lynx at philadelphia.libertynet.org (login as 'liberty'
       no password)
     * [7]Lynx View, see how a document on the web will appear in Lynx
       (latest versions)
     * [8]Lynx View mirror in Japan (support for Japanese charsets)
