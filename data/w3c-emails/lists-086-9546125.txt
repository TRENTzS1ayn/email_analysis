Well said, and thanks for the report.

I've always thought ALT was under-specified in the HTML spec, which
only says something like: "For user agents that cannot display
images, this attribute specifies alternate text."
The "cannot" in the above sentence can be loaded with semantics..

I'm not sure I agree that playing with the cache is too much asking
for a Screen-Reader user encountering this Netscape problem but I
agree that the Browser guidelines should make clear what we want (to
palliate the HTML specs vagueness).

I expect the LongDesc action item to cover part or all of that topic
(semantics of ALT/TITLE/DLINK).
