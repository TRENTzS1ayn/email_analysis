I'll take a look at the Unix version but I don't expect miracle here.

I remembered discussing ALT relationg to WIDTH/HEIGHT a while ago, so
it must not be new, is it ?

You're talking about some authoring image tool here ?
(or is it a new dialog in 4.0 ?)

On a related topic, the Amaya team (W3C own HTML authoring tool) has
recently asked me if defaulting the IMG ALT to the image name
(filename or image name if available in the format) was a good idea.

Somehow your page is full of encoded character replaced by "3D".
Could you point at it directly on the web at Trace ?

Yes, Al's message is about that.

Gosh, I really wish we can avoid that level of hackery.

Linking the size of the graphics to the size of the alt text is such a
bad design principle... Thousand of generations of web-surfer will
hate us for that decision :-)

The core question is to know how important Netscape rendering
compliance is to users of ALT text, and we need to weight in users of
ALT text using pwWebspeak of Lynx or whatever that smarter than
Navigator, that shouldn't pay the price of short-to-useless ALT text
that fit into a graphics.

From this study steams the recommendation for authors to constrain -
or not - their design of ALT text to Netscape peculiarities.
