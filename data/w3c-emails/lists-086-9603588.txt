Hackery.

I find the MSIE use of a pop-up containing ALT text available to replace
a graphic hole a reasonable solution for a single anchor buried in the
graphic. For the sighted, a different one for each buried one in a graphic
has some appeal. For a pure-text user choice or user agent, all such should
appear, of whatever size needed (or if there isn't room, then arbitrarily
use wrapping/truncating rules).

Venting the graphic space for buttons should be a user option,
if that space could more effectively be used for the ALT text.

If link target naming were terse and suggestive, that would be ok.
Often it is neither.

I would like to have ALT be #REQUIRED. I prefer that its content be
descriptive. 
I would also support the second semantic sense of link target. Since
the HREF="..." material is needed, why cannot the Lynx/pwWebSpeak use
that value? I believe for any user agent, both have value. The sighted
user agent may have access to the URL. I'd encourage the other browsers
to make both available, and distinguished.
