Since the media attribute is meant to designate the type of medium in
which the document is to be presented rather than the type of output
device, I would amend my original suggestion as follows:

media="braille embossed" (formatting for a braille embosser)

media="braille displayed" (formatting for presentation by a refreshable
braille display)

It may also be desirable to include extra parameters for designating the
line and page dimensions of the braille device. I suggest that it would be
premature to include these suggestions in Tuesday's HTML release and that
the entire matter requires further consideration and discussion. The
implications of recent developments in braille display technology, which
may lead to the wider availability of refreshable displays that are
capable of representing multiple lines of text, should also be examined.

Jason White.
