Adding an URL attribute to IMG is a way to handle the long description
issue. We're still waiting for the requirement report on that item to
see what's needed.

One of the requirement brought up at the meeting in Sophia was the
implementation-ness of the solution (can whatever we recommend be used
in today's browser). Extending HTML is of course not ideal, but having
rethought about other solutions, I'm not sure there is anything that
will comply with this requirement anyway (in particular, I realized
that the CSS 'display: none' feature is not in CSS1 core and therefore
is not available yet in all CSS-ready browser).

Regarding this issue and others, we need to clearly differentiate what
belongs to the HTML specs (semantics of ALT vs. TITLE vs. ALTSRC
vs. content of A, etc) and what belongs in a browser UI guidelines
(e.g. how does the user activates the ALTSRC link of an IMG used as an
A).
