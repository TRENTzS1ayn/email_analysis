One proposal quite a few years old is for authors to provide
a null value for alt as distinct from omiting alt, e.g.

  <img src=blank.gif alt="">

User agents would be recommended to default alt based
upon the url's name, e.g.

  <img src=logo.gif> would yield  "logo" as the default.

Does this sound reasonable?
