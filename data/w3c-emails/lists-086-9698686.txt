This is not just a proposal.  Lynx responds reasonably well to
this usage and there are authors using it.

There are better defaulting rules, but they take more work.  Have
you read

http://www.access.digex.net/%7Easgilman/web-access/announce-two.html

and the attached note about "metadata percolation"?

The proposal there reflects my reaction to several go-arounds on
this issue on the lynx-dev list [not a Lynx consensus, may I make
clear].  [More in reponse to Daniel...]

WARNING: I don't think that we have time enough to reach a
consensus on this issue here before you release this draft, even
if it's not tomorrow.
