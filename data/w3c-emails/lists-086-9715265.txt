I have been holding off some input to let the action item stuckees

There is a solution that does not involve any change to
standards.  This is to reference the long description from within
the metadata capabilities of the Internet Media Types (formerly
MIME types) framework.  This could be supplied as a text value
for an header field or indirectly by an URI value withing a
header field.

I don't know what fielded GUI browsers include in their
realization of an "information page" or if you can get such a
page for images referenced as the content of an IMG tag.  If the
long description is realized as the text value of an HTTP header
for the image, Lynx, for example, already gives the user an
access path for that information with its image_links mode and
head-request command.

There is a reasonable question as to whether this is too indirect
to satisfy the requirement.  I would prefer to address that with
all deliberate speed in the context of the
requirement-development action item that the WAI WG has started.
