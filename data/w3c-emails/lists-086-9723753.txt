This alt="" reliably informs the client that nothing of consequence is in 
that gif.

If the alt="..." were #REQUIRED, I would not have it default to "" in any
authoring tool, but rather to some serious reminder to the author that useful
description is required of information otherwise conveyed. Also the consequence
of  alt="" should be noted; it may get rid of some of that information-free 
noise.

That could give a "first-look" default while awaiting the response to
the head title content request Al proposes.

One of Al Gilman's proposals, as I understand it, is upon encountering a 
non-local URL with no alt="...", to get the head of that URL, and extract the
TITLE from it to provide the default value. That seems useful, at least 
for those documents that actually include the required TITLE element!
