Harvey's proposal raises the important question of which attributes should
be optional, and which should be required by the HTML specification. It
would be interesting to know why it was originally decided, when HTML 2.0
was drafted, that the alt attribute would be merely an option, and whether
the issue could and should be decided differently today. The same
questions can be asked with respect to other aspects of HTML Cougar that
are of importance to people with disabilities, such as labels in tables
and the proposals relating to forms. At least one positive outcome of
making an attribute mandatory is that software which verifies the validity
of HTML documents would report non-compliance as an error, thereby
creating a strong incentive for authors to include the attribute in
question.

Such issues can only be decided by considering arguments on both sides.
I would assume that the status of attributes has been thoroughly debated
as part of the HTML development process. Now that the WAI has been
established, would it be possible or desirable for such decisions to be
reconsidered?
