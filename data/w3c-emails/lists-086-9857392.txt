I'm forwarding a message that was sent to the list very early on.

Note that it's related to the action items under ICADD
in the list at http://www.w3.org/WAI/group/actions.html.
(I updated the list with pointers)

From: Murray Maloney

To accomodate the need to match the functionality
of the <IPP> and <PP> elements in the ICADD-22,
we agreed that we could use the existing <A> tag.
The use of <A> in this case requires the use of
standardized values for the REL and REV attributes,
and a convention for the names of target anchors.

We need conventions for pointing to a target anchor
and asserting that it represents the beginning of
an "Imprint Page" or a "Braille Page". There are
two potential and complementary mechanisms available:

- Use a naming conventions for identifying
anchors, such as "IPP-[0-9]+", "IPP-[ivxlc]",
"BPP-[0-9]+" or "IPP-[ivxlc]+", etc.

- Use REL="BPP" or REL="IPP"

I assert that it would be helpful and reliably redundant
to utilize both methods, and am recommending that.
