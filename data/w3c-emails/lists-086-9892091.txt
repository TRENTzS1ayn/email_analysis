There is no Content-Description in HTTP1.1 so this would have to be an
extension.

This is unlikely to happen soon given the speed at which 1.1 itself is
penetrating the market.

Using HEAD on an image to get a description is possible, I think Dave
Raggett mentioned it to me a while ago. The semantics is clear too,
e.g. if the image format itself has some 'comments' in the file, this
is a way to get at it without transfering the whole file.
