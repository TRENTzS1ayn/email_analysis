Jason White knows enough to do us some good, here.  I am not
going to try to recapitulate what he has said of his available
level of effort, but it's non-zero.  We should spend it wisely.

At the moment, I am interested in having examples, even
style-sheet fragments, available.  Not necessarily a global
encyclopaedia of Braille styles.  In particular, I would like an
established legacy dialect of Braille as the target, so as to
represent what is fairly established practice.  In other words,
I would be glad to take whatever Jason knows best.

I want to have concrete examples of the kinds of collapsing
transforms that go into a data-compression scheme like this.
What I remember are the compression of indents and the
_selective_ pass-through of italics.  

CSS examples for this established Braille practice would bring
home the moral:

- for CSS to work the accessibility problem, the 
class system over which the styles are layered has 
to have some semantic depth, not just
be a 1-1 precursor for visual font effects.

In general, we are going to have to develop downgrading-by-rule
recommended practices for taking documents that have been authored
with no thought to any browse mode but the wizziest, and mapping
them into less-inflected media in a comprehensible way.

I want some examples around to make it clear what kind of a beast
that downgrading filter is.

PS: I have added a few unvarnished comments on the ACSS note
alongside the action item response in

  http://www.access.digex.net/%7Easgilman/web-access/

Most of them have nothing to do with accessibility.
Please take them with more than one grain of salt.
