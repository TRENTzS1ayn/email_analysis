One reference that may be useful in planning the braille style sheet
specification is:
ftp://ftp.esat.kuleuven.ac.be/pub/CAPS/DELIVERABLES/CAPS.PILOT.PHASE/PLAIN_TEXT/oda_sgml.txt

This is an old document and it does not discuss issues of style sheet
design. However, it provides a good introduction to British braille
formatting conventions through an analysis of the RNIB's style manual, and
details the format commands that are available in a particular braille
translation programme. Incidentally, the Integrated Translation System
discussed in this document is, I have been told, no longer being used by
RNIB.

A related document discusses the conversion of SGML material into French
literary braille. The URL is:
ftp://ftp.esat.kuleuven.ac.be/pub/CAPS/DELIVERABLES/CAPS.PILOT.PHASE/PLAIN_TEXT/sgml_brl.txt

Unfortunately, the names of the authors are missing from both of these
documents, but they were written as part of the CAPS project which I
believe was funded by the European Union's TIDE programme.
