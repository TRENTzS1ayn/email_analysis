 By the way, the Responsible Ministry for the Ontarians with

By the way, one way to help get updates posted faster is to send both
the English and the French marked up in HTML. :-)
 
 For Additional Information on the ODA it might be appropriate to link
to:
"Accessibility Ontario"
http://www.gov.on.ca/citizenship/accessibility/index.html
 
Hum, I skimmed it quickly and didn't notice anything specifically on Web
accessibility. Is there? If so, should we link to the specific area for

Cheers,
