Hi, Alistair

I attempted to update the UK Policy listings per your e-mail
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/wai-eo-editors/2003Feb/0001.html.

I had trouble clarifying what are the official jurisdictions versus what
are additional informational sites. For now, I put all under relevant
documents - as drafted is available at:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/Policy/#UK. (Previous listings are at the end of
this e-mail.)

Perhaps we should discuss what should go where, especially official
jurisdictions? Feel free to ring me directly, or let me know when and
where to contact you.

Thanks much,

~Shawn
