Hi, Alan,

it's PDF. Also, maybe, indicate that the most important part from an
accessibility perspective is on page 293."

Shawn responds:

Thanks for the additional information. I have added to the list of
things for EOWG to discuss the idea of indicating PDF documents.

I think it is good to add the direction to the most relevant part of the
document. Is there a section heading that we can list in addition to the
page #? Could you provide the heading in both Spanish and English.

Best regards,

~Shawn
