Shawn,

On sober reflection (it is before noon, after all) I no longer believe that 
"Jurisdiction" is appropriate to describe Provincial sources.  All Canadian 
provincial government offices can be described as "Ministries".  Where 
jurisdiction came into my thinking was to cover an eventuality where the 
Policy pages listed requirements from municipal governments as well as 
provincial and federal sources.
