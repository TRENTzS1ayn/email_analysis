>Greetings,

>I just read over the revised document and caught a few things to consider.
>
>1. The paragraphs (from the Introduction) below have suggestions in parens.
>They deal mainly with the number of times (4) we used "different" in the
>two paragraphs and one case of having two phrases suceeding each other both
>starting with "of".
>
>"Note that the term "policy" is used broadly in this document, and refers
>to government or other official requirements that may be in the form of
>laws, policies, regulations, standards, directions, communications, orders,
>etc., and that may hold different degrees of authority in different
>(suggest "diverse") systems."
>
>"Policy factors relating to Web accessibility vary greatly according to
>setting. This document provides a basic outline of different types of
>policies (suggest "some policy types") that one might find in different
>(suggest " a various") settings. For organizations wishing to develop their
>own policies on Web accessibility, note that the document Developing
>Organizational Policies for Web Accessibility is available as part of the
>WAI Resource Suite Implementation Planning for Web Accessibility."
>
>2. Suggest inserting the word "rather" after the last comma  in the last
>question bulleted item.  If you were to take out the phrase between the
>commas, the sentence wouldn't make much sese without the word "rather"
>added.
>
>Talk to you soon.
