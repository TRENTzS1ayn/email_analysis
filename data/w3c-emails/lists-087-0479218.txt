Upside International - Searching Out Stocks with Big Upside Potential...that 
have gone unnoticed until now.

 
Upside International uncovers unusual trends and activity in stocks. We look 
for signs of block trades and insider purchasing in order to uncover insight into 
uncommon trends.

 
Eight weeks ago, on Sept. 4, we highlighted SUQU at .57. We set the target 
price at 1.20. It hit a high of 1.18 -- we were very close. Our last pick was 
TRHL at .74 on Oct. 3. Target was 1.13, it hit 1.20.
 
Our focus now is on Life Energy & Technology Holdings


OTCBB: LETH

 
New trading range (as of 11/7/03): Target -- 2.56.

 
This past week, a Long White Candlestick formed, and pressure was strong. 
The stock is in position to explode into all-time record high territory. A bullish 
gap occurred last week, which indicates an upward breakout is imminent. Stock 
volume is accelerating while LETH has just started an unusual trading pattern. 
Large blocks of shares are being bought. Is this an indication of something? 
Either an institution or large investors are picking up LETH.
 
We have been seeing indicators with LETH: The 20 - 50 Day MACD 
Oscillator is now indicating an uptrend, 20 Day Bollinger Bands have moved 
into an upgrade indication.
 
Life Energy & Technology Holdings (LETH) is rapidly becoming a leader in 
the alternative waste-to-energy sector by efficiently processing waste materials 
into electricity and other beneficial by-products. LETH's Biosphere Process 
converts into clean, "green electricity" such waste materials as: Municipal 
waste, agricultural waste, forestry wastes, agricultural and industrial effluents, 
medical wastes, industrial wastes, used tires, sewage sludge, shale oil, sour 
natural gas and many other traditional and non-traditional waste materials.
 
LETH has announced various contractual sales this year combined to exceed 
$150 Million, and recently reported an equity investment into the Company of 
roughly $10 Million along with funding per a loan agreement for 
the manufacture of Biosphere Processing Units in the United States.
