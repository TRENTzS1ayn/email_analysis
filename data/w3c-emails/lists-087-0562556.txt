Subject: Accessibility / PWD Act link for India


Hello Shawn,
Ref: Policies Relating to Web Accessibility
http://www.w3.org/WAI/Policy/#Introduction
 
1. India does have  legislation for empowering PWD passed in 1995. It
does not make any references to Web accessibility. The closest reference
to access to "electronic"   content is in Section 27. The link to the
Act is
http://www.disabilitynet.org.in/legal/pwdact1995.htm
2. The responsible Ministry is:
Joint Secretary, Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment
Room #. 610, 'A'Wing, Shastri Bhawan,  New Delhi (India) 
3. The references presently  shown on the Web page for India for two
states Maharashtra and Karnataka  only talk about right to  public
documents. These legislation do not identify special needs of PWD or
provision of accommodation. They do not relate to e-gov or accessibility
and  I believe are incorrect references on the EO Web page.
Thanks,
