Hi,

Just wanted to let you know that we recently launched
http://www.accessifyforum.com and it is becoming very popular for
accessibility discussion.

I'd be happy to host WAI discussions if you wanted to reach a wider
Accessibility community than those on the W3C lists or if you'd like to
be involved in any other way I'm open to suggestions.

Cheers,
Nigel Peck
