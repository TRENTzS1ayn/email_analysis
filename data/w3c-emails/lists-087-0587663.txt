Hi Shawn,

I was following some NZ links and dug up the following:

Office of Disability Issues (http://www.odi.govt.nz/).

Also, NZ Disability Strategy (http://www.odi.govt.nz/nzds/nzds-toc.html)

Then there is the Human Rights Commission (http://www.hrc.co.nz/) and the
Human Rights Act (http://www.hrc.co.nz/index.php?p=308) which seems to
cover disability rights.

Cheers, Andrew
