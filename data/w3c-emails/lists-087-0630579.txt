Emne: RE: Policies Relating to Web Accessibility


Dear Harald Jorgensen,

I am reviewing my incomplete e-mail and found the message below.
However, I do not find related information forwarded from Judy with
additional information from Norway.

If you have additions to the WAI Policies Relating to Web Accessibility
page (http://www.w3.org/WAI/Policy/), please read "Submitting Updates to
Policies Relating to Web Accessibility" at
http://www.w3.org/WAI/Policy/updates.html

If you can send the requested information to wai-eo-editors@w3.org, I
hope to be able to post it to the Policies page very soon...

Best regards,

~ Shawn
