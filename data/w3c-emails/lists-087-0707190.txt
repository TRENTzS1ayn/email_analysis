1. Update copyright notices to end through 2004

2.  References

Add WCAG reference even though the overview general reference section was 
removed.

Technical Factors  -- mentions many W3C technologies -- give top-level
the reference to  http://www.w3.org  where they can be found.

Suggest referencing Dublin Core -- particularly as it is addressing 
accessibility.

Also the work on EARL from the Evaluation and Repair group, which uses RSS.


3. Editorial Lint:
.
Under "Be prepared for Advanced Technologies"
     "Allow for syndication of Information" ?what does this mean -- reference?

Eric Miller's slide on it is content-free:

     http://www.w3.org/Talks/2002/02/27-tpsw/slide10-0.html

How does metatdata help?

I learn from

     http://www.washington.edu/computing/training/540/app_synd.html

Syndication And Distribution

XML systems can be used to collect and redistribute information 
(syndication) and to make available information that otherwise may not be 
found.

Syndication is a system of encouraging information providers to make 
available synopses of their resources in an XML format, then gathering the 
synopses, aggregating them into a database or menu system and then making 
them available.
    * <http://www.moreover.com>Moreover.com   [an off-topic link]
Using RSS, an XML schema, information can be maintained in many different 
locations yet easily aggregated onto a central site. The University of 
Texas uses RSS to gather campus news onto a central page.
