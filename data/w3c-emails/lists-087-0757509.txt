Hello Roberto,

thank you for sending the information to us.

I am preparing the update of italian policy section so that Shawn can post 
it on the policy page:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/Policy/

I am sorry that we replied so late to your message.

I have a question concerning the translation of the law text.

We would like to provide a link to the English translation. But in your 
first e-mail from March 31, you sent following link:
http://www.pubbliaccesso.it/biblioteca/normative/law_20040109_n4.htm

In a following e-mail you wrote that the link was not working very well and 
you sent the whole English translation.

To which document in English can we then point?

What is the English translation of the law title?

Thank you for the information.

Regards

Sylvie
