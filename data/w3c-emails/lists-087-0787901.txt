[in changelog]- Overview - Overall looks great!  As we discussed in the
call I think 
 
splitting out the Outlines to a new page (Detailed Table of Contents) is
a good 
 
idea.  I do like the Factors in a Business Case for Web Accessibility
section (short 
 
descriptions).
 
Developing a Custom Business Case Section
[DONE]     1. The Social Factors, Technical Factors, Financial Factors,
Legal & 
 
Policy Factors pages each start with questions to help identify how
these factors 
 
apply to a specific organization's and guide development of a custom
business 
 
case for a specific organziation.
    Change to: To help guide development of a custom business case, the
Social 
 
Factors, Technical Factors, Financial Factors, Legal & Policy Factors
pages each 
 
start with questions to help identify how these factors apply to a
specific 
 
[organization].
     Reason: Puts "action" at beginning of sentence - catches eye more
than list of 
 
docs.
__________________________________________
 
- Social Factors - I like this page especially.  The bolded bullets are
very easy to 
 
read visually.
 
[DONE] Web [Accessibility] is an Aspect of Corporate Social
Responsibility Section
[tweaked a few. since not necessarily common acronym to audiences, I
left it 
 
spelled out several places.]     1. CSR is spelled out in multiple
sections of the 
 
document.  Not a bad thing, but it is repetitive. I'm not sure what's
best with 
 
acronyms.
 
Web Accessibility Benefits People with and without Disabilities Section
["where" as a location might be confusing and difficult to translate so
think not 
 
worth shortening by one word for it. broke into two sentences: "Web
accessibility 
 
provides improved access, and thus social inclusion, for other groups of
people 
 
that are often a focus of corporate social responsibility. Below are
examples of 
 
aspects of Web accessibility that benefit others."]    2. Below are
examples of 
 
aspects of Web accessibility that provide improved access and thus
social 
 
inclusion for additional groups of people that are often a focus of
corporate social 
 
responsibility.
    Change to: Below are examples where aspects of Web accessibility
provide 
 
improved access and thus social inclusion for other specific groups of
people that 
 
are often a focus of corporate social responsibility.
    Reason: Sentence is a bit awkward and long.  Even with changes could
be 
 
shortened.

[noted in doc for revision]    1. @@ think this needs to be a section
below & not a 
 
question@@ Is it helpful to include the risk of failing to provide
accessible Web 
 
sites? 
    I agree that this should be in the Considerations for Different
Types of 
 
Organizations section.  I suggest calling it "Legality" and changing the

 
subheadings to be "___________ Organizations" in the Considerations
section.  
 
Or create a whole new section just on this subject.

Subject: Business Case Overview Comments and Notes


Here are some comments and notes on the Business Case Docs (Editors
discretion).  I am done with the entire document - great job to all!
Brackets are spelling/grammar issues.
