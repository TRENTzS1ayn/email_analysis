[DONE] 1. Update copyright notices to end through 2004

2.  References

[added to changelog to link specific checkpoints] Add WCAG reference
even  though the overview general reference section was 
removed.

[added to changelog to link specific technologies] Technical Factors  --
mentions  many W3C technologies -- give top-level the reference to
http://www.w3.org   where they can be found.

[did not find smooth way to reference this] Suggest referencing Dublin
Core --  particularly as it is addressing 
accessibility.

[did not find smooth way to reference this] Also the work on EARL from
the  Evaluation and Repair group, which uses RSS.
