Shawn,
- Corporate social responsibility (CSR), also called corporate
citizenship and other  terms ...
[SLH: are you saying the terminology is odd?  "corporate social
responsibility" and  "corporate citizenship" are two terms that are
fairly commonly used]
SP: "also called..." and end with "other terms" seems awkward
