Overview: http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/Overview.html

[want to leave as one sentence for several reasons, including: want to
de-emphasize the initial costs, hopefully limit chance of being quoted
w/o context,  etc. deleted "through direct and indirect benefits" to
make sentence shorter.] 1.  2nd Paragraph: Make this two sentences.
There is an initial cost for organziations implementing Web
accessibility; however,  the initial costs are often offset by full a
return on investment through direct and  indirect benefits.

case".
                - OR -

called a  "business case".

[DONE] 3. Generally would try to avoid two prepositional phrases with
the same  preposition "of the value of the project"
Business cases usually document an analysis of the value of the project
in meeting  the organization's objectives, the cost-benefit analysis,
and expected outcomes.

[DONE: corrected capitalization of "Internet" - changed beginning
to:"covers the  role of organizations in ensuring equal opportunities
through Web accessibility" -  did not add " [other than the primary page
text] " because want to keep it simple  here, confirmed that it more
clear in the Soc page] 6. Under "Factors in a Business  Case for Web
