Hello shawn,
In editing the Italy section and comparing to other sections on the policy 
page, I noticed some inconsistencies in the page :

1. Some times some sections include "jurisdiction" like in the France and 
United Kingdom sections. Other sections include "responsible ministry". I 
think we need some cleaning up.
In a previous e-mail you wrote that when no document is available there 
should be a dash after the title "responsible ministry" for example. When 
some documents are available, ther should be no dash.

2. I noticed that in the India section there was a dash after additional 
information although some documents are listed under this section.

3. Some section point to "related documents" such as the Canada section, 
and other don't.

Regards

Sylvie
