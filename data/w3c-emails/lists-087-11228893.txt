I am very unhappy with the composition of the new Yahoo search form.
Previously, it was always possible to
distinguish between UK and worldwide searches. Now that there is no such
distinction, I find that I am given
thousands of US sites, when it's a British  site I must have. I have just
been looking for a supplier of kitchen
tools in order to send for a small whisk. Instead I find 2,000 American
suppliers. I always feel that changes
should be for the good. How can this be justified?
