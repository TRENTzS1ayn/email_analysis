I received this  rip off below and checked out Teletech.com. I hope you are nothing to them because I am writing to their board complaining of gross corporate negligence. A porn pusher could be pushing filth to children on these lists and you are selling them for ?5 per whack?  You disgust me and I hope you sleep easy thinking what links all those reprobates and low lifers might push out with lists as cheap and unfiltered as this!!

Wake up , get responsible!
