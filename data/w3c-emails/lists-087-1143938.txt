As stated at "http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/policyformat.html": use
"Responsible Ministry" or "Jurisdiction" or "Responsible Department or
Agency " as appropriate for each country/state/province

That was an error. I fixed it. I skimmed through quickly for others and
didn't see any. Please let me know if you find any.

Sometime we have related documents to list, sometimes we don't. I
updated "http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/policyformat.html" to say:
* always include a "Legislation" section and a "Responsible Ministry /
Jurisdiction / Responsible Department or Agency" section, and when there
is no information available, put a dash (-)
* if there is nothing for Related documents or Additional information,
then do not include those section names

Does that make sense?
