1 Million world wide email addresses including 200,000 UK for just ?5 inc
P&P!

The list comes on a CD in 2 files, one containing over 200,000 UK email
addresses and another containing more than 1 million world-wide emails
(inc UK), both in easy to use "comma separated value" format.

The emails have been physically validated within the last month, removing
bad emails, so there should be a very low failure rate.

To purchase the CD please send a ?5 cheque/PO payable to "Teletech" (no
cash please) to:

Teletech
Office 434
405 Kings Rd
London SW10 0BB

The CD will be sent by first class post as soon as your money has been
received.
You will also be given details of a FREE download for sending software.

NOTE: This CD does not contain any personal info of email owners (eg
name/age etc), and the email address to whom this message was sent is not
on the list.
