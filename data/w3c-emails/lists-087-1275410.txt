Hi Shawn, Judy, Sylvie,

NOIE was recently disbanded
(http://www.agimo.gov.au/media/2004/03/21377.html) and the roles handed to
two new groups:
a) Australian Govt Information Management Office (functions relating to the
promotion and coordination of the use of new information and communications
technology to deliver Government policies, information, programs and
services have been placed) - see http://www.agimo.gov.au/ , and
b) Office for the Information Economy within the Dept of Communications,
Information Technology and the Arts (functions relating to broader policy,
research and programs) - see http://www2.dcita.gov.au/ie

I offer the following updates for the Policies page - Australia section:

Was:
<P class=prelist>Relevant Documents:</P><UL class=notop><LI
