Dear Jane,

WAI does not directly evaluate Web sites, and therefore we do not have
example charges.

A resource you might find helpful is Evaluating Web Sites for
Accessibility at:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/

You might also get helpful information through the WAI Interest Group
(WAI IG). You can search the archives of the WAI IG mailing list
through:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/
Information about the WAI IG, including directions on posting questions
to the list, is at :
http://www.w3.org/WAI/IG/

Regards,

~ Shawn
