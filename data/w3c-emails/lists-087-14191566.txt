             DEAR SIR

              URGENT BUSINESS PROPOSAL

I AM BARRISTER KUNLE PAYNE PERSONAL ASISTANT TO THE
LATE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND HONORABLE MINISTER FOR
JUSTICE AND ONE TIME MINISTER OF SOLID MINERAL OF
FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA CHIEF BOLA IGE (SAN) WHO
WAS ASSASINATED  ON 23TH DECEMBER 2001 WHILE ON ACTIVE
DUTY. YOU WERE RECONMMEDED BY AN ASSOCIATE WHO ASSURED
ME OF YOUR ABILITY AND CAPABILITY TO EXECUTE SUCH A
BUSINESS TRANSACTION WHICH NEEDS "CONFIDENCIALITY AND
TOP SECRET"
      
I CURRENTLY HAVE THE SUM OF FIFTY MILLION
UNITED STATES DOLLARS [50,000,000.00] CASH, WHICH I
INTEND TO  INVEST SPECIFICALLY IN YOUR COUNTRY.THIS
MONEY CAME AS A RESULT OF A PAY BACK CONTRACT DEAL
BETWEEN MY LATE BOSS AND A RUSSIAN FIRM ON OUR
COUNTRY?S MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR AJAOKUTA STEEL PLANT.
      
THE RUSSIAN PARTNERS RETURNED MY BOSS SHARE
OF USDM50 (FIFTY MILLION USD).AFTER THE DEATH OF MY
BOSS. THE MONEY WAS  LODGED IN MY BOSS SECURITY FIRM
IN NIGERIA.RIGHT NOW, THE NEW CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT HAS
INTENSIFIED THEIR PROBE ON MY BOSS FINANCIAL RESOURCES
AND THEY HAVE REVOKED OUR LICENSE THAT ALLOW US NOT TO
OWN A FINANCIAL AND OIL COMPANY.
      
IN VIEW OF THESE, I ACTED VERY FAST TO WITHDRAW
THE MONEY FROM THE COMPANY?S VAULT AND DEPOSITED THE
MONEY IN ANOTHER SECURITY COMPANY IN EUROPE AS FIRST
CLASS ARTIFICE MATERIALS TO BEAT THE STATE SECURITY
SERVICE (SSS) IN THE AIRPORT.I HAVE SINCE DECLARED MY
BOSS SECURITY COMPANY BANKRUPT. NO RECORD EVER EXISTED
CONCERNING THE MONEY NEITHER IS THE MONEY TRACEABLE BY
THE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THERE IS NO DOCUMENTS SHOWING
THAT I RECEIVED THE MONEY FROM THE RUSSIANS DUE TO THE
CURRENT SITUATION IN THE COUNTRY CONCERNING
GOVERNMENT?S ATTITUDE TOWARDS MY BOSS FAMILIY AND THIS
HAS BECOME QUITE IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO MAKE USE OF
THIS MONEY.

THUS, I SEEK YOUR ASSISTANCE TO TRANSFER THIS MONEY
OUT OF THE SECURITY COMPANY IN EUROPE. ON YOUR
CONSENT, I SHALL EXPECT YOU TO CONTACT URGENTLY TO
ENABLE US DISCUSS IN DETAILS ABOUT THIS TRANSACTION. 

BEARING IN MIND THAT YOUR ASSISTANCE IS NEEDED TO
TRANSFER THIS FUND. I PROPOSE A COMMISSION OF 30
PERCENT OF THE TOTAL SUM TO YOU FOR THE EXPECTED
SERVICES AND ASSITANCE.

I IMPLORE YOU TO EXERCISE THE UTMOST
INDULGENCE TO KEEP THIS MATTER EXTRA-ORDINARILY
CONFIDENTIAL, WHATEVER YOUR DECISION,WHILE I AWAIT
YOUR  PROMPT RESPONSE. 

BEST REGARDS, 

BARRISTER KUNLE PAYNE.
