Dear,

With due honour and respect, I am Dr. Pass Kossi, the director in charge of Audit and Accounts Unit, Union Togolaise de Banque (Union Bank), Lome - Togo. I understand that through Internet is not the best way to link up with you because of the confidentiality which the transaction demands. However, I have already  sent you this same letter by post one month ago, but I am not sure if it did get to you since I have not heard from you, hence my resending it again through e-mail  for beneficial and a 100% risk-free
business transaction. 

During our auditing and investigations in this bank for the 2001 fiscal year, my department came across the sum of Twenty-five million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars (USD25,500,000) only belonging to a Japanese international businessman who died along with his next of kin in the 5th November, 1997 aeroplane crash in Abidjan. 

Before our discovery of this development, there was no trace of claim from any person as the fund remains dormant in his account with this bank. Although, I keep this information secret within my jurisdiction to enable us put claims and transfer the said amount through a trustworthy friend overseas whom we shall present to the bank as the bona-fide next-of-kin to the deceased for a profitable and successful deal. 

Meanwhile, all the arrangement to put claims as the bonafide next-of-kin to the deceased, to get the required approval and transfer of this money to a
foreign account has been put in place. The directives and the needed information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to benefit yourself of this great business opportunity. 

Infact, we could have done this deal alone but because we civil servants/staff of a bank, are not legally allowed to operate foreign account and it would eventually raise eyebrows on our side during the time of transfer because we are staff of the bank. These  are the actual reasons it requires a second fellow who will forward claims through our support as the bona-fide next-of-kin with Togolaise court affidavit to the bank and also present a foreign bank account where the money on his/her request will be re-transferred into. 

On conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 25% of the total sum as gratification, 5% of the total sum will be used to reimburse  expenses that might arise from telephone bills and other expenses during the transaction, while 70% will be for me and my partners here. Please you have been advised to keep this information as top secret as we are still
in service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you. 

I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm the money in your account. We will then come down to your country for subsequent sharing of the fund according to the percentages
previously indicated and for investment in any sector of your economy as you may advise us. 

All other necessary information will be sent to you when I hear from you. I suggest you get back to me assoon as possible stating your willingness
to be part of this deal, through e-mail or phone. 

Yours faithfully, 


Dr. Pass Kossi
