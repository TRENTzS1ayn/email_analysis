Hi all,

On Slide 3 of the WAI overview[1], Web accessibility is defined thusly:

Web accessibility means access to the Web by everyone, regardless of 
disability.


It strikes me that this may define _full_ or _total_ Web accessibility. 
However, this is not what we mean when we ordinarily use the term. In 
recent times, I have grown sensitive to the view that we in Web 
accessibility propose the impossible, and think this definition 
perpetuates that view. I propose the following as a replacement:

Web accessibility is the measure of access to Web applications and 
content by everyone, regardless of disability.
