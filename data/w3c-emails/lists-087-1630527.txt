Installment #3

Q. Have we got the right "suite" title? It seems that we are not
'presenting' the case, but assisting a person/org to
'prepare/compile/build/compose/assemble' a case for accessibility. In the
overview we talk about using the 'building blocks' as  they apply in your
situation. Suggest changing the title to "Building ..." (even though we
changed from this on 7 Nov 03). We propose you do this as part of all these
changes and then present to EOWG, rather than discussing in EOWG before
implementing :-)
