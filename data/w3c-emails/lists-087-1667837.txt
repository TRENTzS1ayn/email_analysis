[re-worded some to try to be more broad. not comfortable listing a
specific policy here (australian bankers...)]
Note that the term "policy" is used broadly in this document, and refers
to government or other official requirements that may be in the form of
laws, policies, regulations, standards, directions, communications,
orders, etc., and that may hold different degrees of authority in
different systems. = Note that the term "policy" is used broadly in this
document, and refers to government or other official requirements that
may be in the form of laws, policies, regulations, standards,
directions, communications, orders, etc., and that may hold different
degrees of authority in different systems. It also relates to industry
developed policy that may exist such as the <link>Australian Bankers
Association Internet Banking Standards</link> and apply voluntarily to a
particular industry.

The intro needs something along these lines as we reference other
applicable policies in the body of the document, but only refer to
government policy in the intro.

[section] What policies might apply to this organization

[DONE] adequate to meet the need of people =adequate to meet the needs
of 
[will probably be reworded with next editing pass] people additional
conformance levels should be considered = additional conformance levels
should be considered depending on the nature of your organisations
online activities. 

[feels like too much of an unrelated tangent...] redesign process, than
later  = redesign process, than later. This may lead to some recognition
as a <link to soc.html#responsible>corporate socially responsible
activity</link>.

[section] Considerations for different types of organizations
[section] Individual Corporations

[will incorporate idea in next editing pass] than that required by
government policies = than that required by government policies. If the
corporation is operating in many countries with differing local
anti-discrimination acts, it is advisable to adopt the highest common
denominator in setting company policy relating to Web site
accessibility. (NB there may be better expression for this additional
sentence)

[added to http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/policychangelog] General -
makes it clear that we need to add a section to
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/Policy/Overview.html> about forthcoming policy
(eg Education Standards in Australia) and also consider a section about
related policies (so we can list industry/professional-association
policies
applicable)
