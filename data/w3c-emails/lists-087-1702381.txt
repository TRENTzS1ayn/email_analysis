Dear Roberto,

Per the messaage below, it would be helpful if you would sent the
information in the format necessary for posting on the WAI policies
page, which is described at:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/Policy/updates.html

Please send this information to:  
wai-eo-editors@w3.org
as well as to Sylvie Duchateau (who has offered to help with getting
information formatted as I need in order to post it) at:
sylvie.duchateau@snv.jussieu.fr

I look forward to posting information on the Italian law soon.

Best regards,

~ Shawn
