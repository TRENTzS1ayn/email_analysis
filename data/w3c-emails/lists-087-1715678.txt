I wanted to keep that bit in the introduction as short and simple as
possible. Do you think it's enough here to say "... from governments and
other organizations..." (as currently rewritten at
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/pol.html#intro ) since:
1. the primary focus for the legal & policy factors for a business case
are usually government policies, and industry-developed policies are
often recommendations, not requirements
2. industry-developed policies are clearly mentioned in both the main
sections.

added to first question, added description to Related Resources at the
bottom

Thanks!!!
