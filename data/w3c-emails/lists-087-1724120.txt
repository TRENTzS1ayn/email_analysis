Hi folks,

In december 2003 a new lwa has been approved in Italy about Web
accessibility. Two weeks ago has started the work to create the implementing
rules to make it really work; me and Roberto Scano are involved in the
government groups that will do that job. 

So, this is the time to add some new information to the W3C policies page;
I've read the http://www.w3.org/WAI/Policy/updates.html rules on submitting
updates, so I'm writing those notes to you; i think they're clear enough...
If not, please let me know.

Here are the most interesting points of the new italian law:

- The law is applied to public administrations, public and telecommunication
services with state  partecipation web sites

- In a time of 90 days, implementing regulations will be developed and
published, under the control of many associations (people with disabilities
associations, web developers association - IWA/HWG). These rules will be
based on the European Union accessibility guidelines; these guidelines
enforce all states to adopt WCAG 1.0 AA guidelines. So, this law is based
upon WCAG 1.0 :-)

- A control commission is going to be created (90 days max); this commission
will apply the guidelines on the public administration web sites, and also
on those private ones whose managers who will ask for its "opinion"

- Should any organization involved in this law not apply the rules, all the
contracts which do not contemplate web accessibility as a structural
requirement will be considerated as not existent, they will be  simply
cancelled, and the manager will be considered fully responsable for the
damage occurred to his organization.

- Moreover, the law will need the creation of groups of testers (teams of
web professionals and people with disabilities from various enterprises and
organizations); those groups will control all the public administration and
government web sites accessibility and usability (we're going to develop the
guidelins about it), and there will be two levels of control: instrumental
and human (we will find out later the software tools the control teams will
use for instrumental check).


Thank you for your attention, 

My best regards
