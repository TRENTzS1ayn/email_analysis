First, I suggest a late rewording to:
"Web accessibility techniques can reduce the server load, thus reducing
the need for additional servers and/or increasing the download speed"

Refs:

1. Websites for Rural Australia Designing for Accessibility
<http://www.rirdc.gov.au/reports/HCC/00-13pdf> - only available as a PDF
and not entirely correct wrt accessibility for PWD (rather refers to access
for rural Australia, but many solutions are related to WCAG, including
clean code)

2. Speed Up Your Site: Web Site Optimization
<http://www.websiteoptimization.com/speed/> - again not always entirely
accurate from a WAI perspective, but many bits relate to WCAG (though some
bits conflict)

3. Are we there yet?
<http://www.humanfactors.com/downloads/aug032.htm#susan> - talks about
Effects of Delay on User Perceptions of Web Sites

Could you provide information to support this claim - for the references
page.

Thanks!
