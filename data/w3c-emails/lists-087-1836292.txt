[discussed 5 march f2f, action: judy, send to EOWG list discussion of
title]  action: Q. Have we got the right "suite" title? It seems that we
are not  'presenting' the case, but assisting a person/org to
'prepare/compile/build/compose/assemble' a case for accessibility. In
the  overview we talk about using the 'building blocks' as  they apply
in your situation.  Suggest changing the title to "Building ..." (even
though we changed from this on  7 Nov 03). We propose you do this as
part of all these changes and then present  to EOWG, rather than
discussing in EOWG before implementing :-)
