WRT refs - good idea. This is what we do in our workshops - highlights, and
let them follow-up the rest (with our caveat) if they want to.

It seems that many of the resources that we want to reference in support
of our assertions have not so good information in them. Perhaps we
should include in our references page the bits that are related to our
points. (still link to the entire reference - but maybe having the
quoted bits will slow people down from reading the entire resource)

What do you think?
