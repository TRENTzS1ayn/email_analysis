Department</A>; <A href="http://www.hreoc.gov.au/">Human Rights and Equal
Opportunity Commission</A>; Federal Department of Communications,

to:

Responsible Ministry: <A href="http://www.ag.gov.au/">Attorney General's
Department</A>; <A href="http://www.humanrights.gov.au/">Human Rights and

I.E. change HREOC URL and remove DCITA from responsible ministries
