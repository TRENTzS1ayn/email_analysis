Editorial consideration:
1. In this document "standards harmonization" refers to the adoption of unified international standards for accessibility of Web content, for authoring tools
used to develop Web sites, and for user agents including browsers and media players. 
SP: Use a list to clearly bring out three components; or drop the "for" prior  to authoring tools and  user agents.
2. Sometimes there is one version of a guideline or standard at the national level, different versions at the provincial or state level, and yet different versions adopted by commercial and non-governmental organizations within the same region.
SP: replacing "different version" with "another" is better?
3. Availability of authoring tools conforming to ATAG 1.0 is key to making the Web accessible because so many people who publish content on the Web would have
at their fingertips tools making it easy to create accessible Web sites.
SP:...
would have tools making it easy to create accessible Web sites at their fingertips .
 4. SP: Is it better to say "not eager" in place of uneager?
5. Will active in place of passive work better : in
"Evaluation tool developers are also impacted by fragmented standards which can delay or increase the development cost of evaluation tools." 
6. Consider using "interpretation" in the statement:
". Rewording accessibility provisions may change the technical meaning of the provision, potentially creating different conformance profiles 
and requiring..."
7. Will despite or although work better in place of yet in:
". There is sometimes discomfort with a guideline not developed locally, yet WAI guidelines have been developed with input from many countries around the"
8. 
". There is sometimes a belief that disability requirements might be unique locally, yet the same types of disabilities exist around the world."
SP: Consider using "regional differences in needs of PWD" in place  of The term "disability requirements "
