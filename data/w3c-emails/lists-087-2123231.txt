Subject: Comments on the Business Case: Technical Factors page


1. Identifying Technical Factors for a Specific Organization
    * How important is it to the organization to:
          o enable content on different configurations? provide
interoperability?
          o be prepared for advanced Web technologies? provide
future-compatibility of the organization's technology?


The second part of the two bottom bullets here are not used correctly.
If they are used here as phrases and the bullets are used later in the
documents as headers then you would expect them to also be part of the
header below. They are not part of the header. The second option is that
the same phrases would be used in the paragraph under those headers but
seem not to appear though in some regards are discussed.


The question is, if the phrase is not replicated in the discussion, then
should it appear here? I believe it should not appear here unless you
are going to repeat it below either as part of the header or replicate
it in the text with explanation. Otherwise it is sort of a disconnected
piece. You may somewhat answer it but because you do not specifically
restate with this phrasiology, the normal reader will not necessarily
connect the question with the answer.


2.     * How important is it to the organization to have high-quality
Web sites that meet international standards and guidelines?
      Many of the technical factors relating to Web accessibility,
including many of the WCAG 1.0 Checkpoints listed in the sections below,
lead to high quality sites that meet W3C international standards and
guidelines for Web technology. @@maybe say that there are documents
extoling the virtues & business case for Web standards in general, and
often directly include accessibility @@



This item seems like it belongs in the document but it seems somewhat
out of place.  This too looks like you would expect it to be replicated
below as a header with further explanation but it has neither a header
or more explanation. I would suggest changing its level here so that
there is no expectation of more below but that it is a paragraph further
amplifying what the reader will be viewing as they read the headers
below.  The position is fine but the level is deceiving.
