My name is Cathy Hardman, and I have a non-profit web developement group which employs and trains the disabled in accessible web design.  I recently met with the NCBLN to discuss the upcoming web site we are doing for them, and found out that you had a national BLN web site.
When I first looked at the site I was under the impression that Hewlett Packard did the work, but come to find that it was a company called Elevation.  Anyway the site does not deserve to wear the Bobby approval statement at the bottom.  It is full of empty ALT tags, and for a full report please contact my Technical Director at 
johnfish1953@hotmail.com
You did not get what you paid for,and you needed to know. Though you are not listed with the CAST.org site as a Bobby Approved site the statement at the bottom says that your site meets their criteria.  It does not, and this needs to be removed until such a time as it can meet these standards.  

Thank you,
Cathy Hardman
