Hello,

This message comes to you from the W3C WAI (World Wide Web Consortium
Web Accessibility Initiative) report tool at http://www.w3.org/WAI/report.

Date: Thu Oct 25 22:24:36 2001

Your web site has been found to have to one or more accessibility problems.
This is not an automatic evaluation. This message is the result of an 
individual's review of your page or site (refer to the cc: field). This
person experienced difficulty accessing your page either due to a disability
(visual, auditory, physical, or cognitive) or due to device limitations
(poor connection bandwidth, no support for graphics or support turned off,
a voice interface such as a webphone, etc.). Please consider their comments
below.

with: Mozilla 0.9.5

The reviewer found the following accessibility problems with your
page or site. Each item is followed by a link to relevant information
in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 (that you can find at
http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT):

     Page inaccessible and no alternative page available
          (Refer to Checkpoint 11.4)
     Other:
 Completely blocks access to browsers other than Internet Explorer 5, including browsers that are entirely standards-compliant (I tried Opera 5, Mozilla 0.9.5, and Konqueror).  The only thing I see are links for downloading Internet Explorer for Windows or Macintosh (useless, since I use Linux).  You say you're complying to the standards, but you're not:  being standards compliant includes being *accessible*, i.e. by any standards-compliant browser.


Your name and the url of your page, along with the names of other
page reviewed using this tool, have been entered in a W3C WAI database
that we maintain (currently implemented as an archived mailing list
visible at http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/wai-report-db).

Please take the time to review this report and take action
on the problems reported. If you have questions, please notify us
at mailto:wai-report@w3.org, so that we can re-evaluate your page.

Note. These comments were made by someone who visited your Web
