To whom it may concern:

It seems I made a stupid mistake: We are the developer of the a.m. web site
and we wanted to check if it is accessible for disabled - and somehow a
faulty-report came back to us.... I think I didn't read carefully

Could you please be so kind to erase that report?

Thank you very much,
