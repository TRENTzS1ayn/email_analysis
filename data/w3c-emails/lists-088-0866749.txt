The Education and Outreach Working Group (EOWG) discussed this previously
and felt it was not a waste of space or an unnecessary repeat, but rather
was a useful reinforcement of this being the WAI home page, as opposed to
some other WAI page. We introduce the page title here in the same position
that we are standardizing for title position on other WAI pages, and
introduce the WAI acronym at the same time. For people with low vision it
provides a more readable reinforcement of the WAI logo, which is not as
ideal as we'd like yet in terms of visual contrast, and implementations of
CSS and SVG aren't yet available or consistent enough to do that logo in
markup language instead of as a bitmapped image with accompanying alt text.
And when trying the design without the page title "Web Accessibility
Initiative" in place, some people did not notice that they were on the WAI
home page, since the same logo combination on this page also appears on
many other WAI pages -- whether this was from dyslexia or ADD or just
simply not noticing is unclear, but we decided to leave in the text
reinforcement of this as the WAI home page.

We've started using a consistent set of external navigation bar links in
the upper right corner of the page on some of the new core pages on the WAI
site, and will be spreading this to more pages. We have also left the
internal navigation bar links on this page in place. We've changed the link
behavior so that the same link no longer goes to different locations --
that was an error introduced during sequential revisions of the page. For
some users the internal nav bar links do add usability of the page. The
criterion of "one screenful" that you suggest as the threshhold for needing
an internal nav bar is subjective, given that some people may be browsing
the page with up to 1000% magnification, or by speech recognition, head
pointer, on-screen keyboard, etc., as well as the standard GUI/visual/mouse
or screen-reader/speech synthesis modes to which you refer. Not all
browsers or combinations of browsers and assistive technologies yet support
the structural navigation options you mention. While this page is visually
shorter than it used to be, it has a high link density, so we've chosen to
provide an internal nav bar as a way to jump past groups of links.

I'm assuming you're refering to the stylized text designs on 
http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/
We may try something like this with a future redesign, and/or adding
something that is actually more of a graphic. Our main focus with the
current redesign was to re-organize the information and layout, which were
greatly in need of work. 

>4.  Add shading backgrounds to distinguish the other categories on News,
>About WAI, etc.

Tried this and it worked too inconsistently across different browsers,
given interaction of several methods with the two column layout used on
this page. Have added a red arrow at the H2's outside of the resource
panel, to highlight those.

The simple search entry field is gone; there is now a link to search in the
external nav bar.

>This could be added after Tim's quote.

Unfortunately there are many kinds of people who are "new." Eventually we
want a page that is either more audience-driven, according to a number of
different kinds of audiences, and/or that is customizable. My guess is that
you are thinking primarily about people who want to make their Web sites
accessible. Right now the most relevant introductory resource for that is
http://www.w3.org/WAI/gettingstarted which we feel needs a lot of
improvement before it is highlighted more.

This was rediscussed and again disagreed with by the EOWG, for several
reasons. People come to the WAI home page for a variety of reasons, not
just for access to the listed WAI resources, and we need some diversity of
link choices in those areas also. The highlighted panel of resources gives
some prominence to the resources even though they are not at the left of
the page; and leaving the internal nav bar intact as described above
ensures that people browsing non-visually will encounter a link to
"resources" as one of four primary internal choices on the page. In
addition the EOWG felt that it would be confusing to place the resource
panel on the left of the page, as that is a common position for navigation
frames on many Web sites, which would be misleading here since the resource
panel is not a good navigation framework for the WAI site as a whole.

Good point. We had tried to address this by putting "guidelines" in the
resource panel, since that is what the majority of people who want WCAG
first ask for "do you have any kind of 'guidelines' for making sites
accessible?" "where can I find the 'guidelines' that I've been hearing
about?" -- and, given that we actually have three different guidelines, the
'guidelines' link goes to a briefly annotated selection. 

I suspect this still won't be clear enough for all visitors to the site.
We'll look for an additional way to highlight this on the home page,
perhaps after updating the "getting started" page mentioned above, so that
there is something more explanatory.

Sounds like once we have the "getting started" page more useful, we need a
permanent link on the WAI home page saying "New to accessibility? Start here."

Date now flipped to end and put in normal English. Will add very brief
detail but not extensive text here, so as to keep page lean.
