Dear Judy Brewer:

Understand a 'ican' group or other (?) is meeting this week to decide on 
additional URLs, such as ".biz," etc.  

My question is: Who do I talk to to get an updated US domain mame?

I have been to several domain certifing sites, such as Network Solutions,
and I want to submit my request ASAP to max my chances/opportunties of 
getting the domain name I want for my bussines, i.e., to get a '.biz' URL
if I can.

Please respond with this week's decision & who are the companies with web 
sites for me to place my order.

Thank you for your time and references.

Leon Curtis Olson
