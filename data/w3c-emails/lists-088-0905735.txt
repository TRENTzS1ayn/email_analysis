Angela,

You may already be familiar with WAI's public comments in this area, which
are listed on 
"Policies Relating to Web Accessibility"
http://www.w3.org/WAI/References/Policy
under the US section on the ADA, specifically at
"Brewer Statement before US House Subcommittee on the Constitution, 9 Feb
2000"
http://www.w3.org/WAI/References/200002-Statement.html
but that is a more general discussion with regard to cost.

You might also look at "Fact Sheet for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
1.0"
http://www.w3.org/1999/05/WCAG-REC-fact
and specifically at the question on "does it cost more to make a site
accessible?"
http://www.w3.org/1999/05/WCAG-REC-fact#cost

Although I may not be able to answer all your questions, I would be happy
to provide some more specifics over the phone, and am reachable directly at
the contact information in my signature block below. 

Regards,

- Judy
