Hello,
Ive noticed that most accessible sites are very simple with regards to
design, and consist mostly of text.  Do you know of any good examples of
accessible sites that are more 'designed'- visually interesting to those who
are sighted and still accessible and easy to read for those who use screen
readers?
Thank you,
Tamar Ebbin
