Hi there,

I was perusing your site when I noticed your event calendar. It looks very 
nice, but I was wondering if you have checked out WebEvent at all?

WebEvent is a Web based searchable event scheduling system that runs on 
almost any web server. WebEvent is perfect for event scheduling, room 
reservation, group scheduling, and individual calendaring. Also, we provide 
the source code with your purchase so the product is extremely 
customizable. Plus, we always offer a 50% Educational discount.

If you have a moment check out our site, I think you'll be impressed.
