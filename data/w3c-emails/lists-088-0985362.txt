Greetings,
I have found the "dtab" function on the W3C website very useful in 
allowing tables to be removed if desired. I was wondering how this 
worked and if this tool was available so that I may use this function 
on my website to promote accessibility access?

See the "dtab" link at the following URI:  http://www.w3.org/WAI/Overview.html
