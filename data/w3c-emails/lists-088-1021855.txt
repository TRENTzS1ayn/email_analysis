That is a great start. I hope you can package it for highlighting to
all the W3 Member Companies, and encourage them to get on the list!

I suggest you augment the Policies reference text. That word just doesn't
convey the breadth of legal and moral weight behind what is contained
on the policies page.  Suggest "International Laws and Policies"
Current amplification is:  "Policies -- list of external policies"

In http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/sitemap.html

Please update pointers to User Agent, from the 23 Oct 2000 working draft to
the current version going to last call: 2001-04-04 working draft.
     http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10/  should get the latest.

Also the techniques document:
     http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/UAAG10-TECHS/  should get the latest.

I'm overwhelmed at the amount of good stuff on the WAI References page
     http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/sitemap.html

Is there a place to point to the surveys of books I did? Since I sent
them by email to the WAI IG, might they be available there? I still
want to get them off that site.

I do not find pointers to the mailing lists. Is that deliberate? Or
do I just not recognize how they are called?

Regards/Harvey
