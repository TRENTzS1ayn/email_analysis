I noticed, while putting together a list of resources, that there's no
mention of the w3c-wai-ig mailing list (or its archives) on the WAI
Resources page at http://www.w3.org/WAI/Resources/. I consider the archives
to be a valuable resource! -- but I only stumbled across the list itself on
another page.

Just a suggestion,
