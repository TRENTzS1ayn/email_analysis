DEAR FRIEND.


 I AM MRS.MARIAM SESE-SEKO WIDOW OF LATE PRESIDENT
MOBUTU SESE-SEKO OF ZAIRE NOW KNOWN AS DEMOCRATIC
REPUBLIC OF CONGO(DRC).I AM MOVED TO
WRITE YOU THIS LETTER,THIS WAS IN CONFIDENCE
CONSIDERING MY PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCE AND SITUATION.I
ESCAPED ALONG WITH MY HUSBAND AND TWO OF OUR SONS
TIMOTHY AND BASHER OUT OF DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF
CONGO (DRC) TO ABIDJAN,COTE D'IVOIRE WHERE MY FAMILY
AND I SETTLED, WHILE WE LATER MOVED TO SETTLED IN
MOROCCO WHERE MY HUSBAND LATER DIED OF
CANCER DISEASE.HOWEVER DUE TO THIS SITUATION WE DECIDED
TO CHANGED
MOST OF MY HUSBAND'S BILLIONS OF DOLLARS DEPOSITED IN
SWISS BANK AND
OTHER COUNTRIES INTO OTHER FORMS OF MONEY CODED FOR
SAFE PURPOSE
BECAUSE THE NEW HEAD OF STATE OF (DR) MR LAURENT KABILA
HAS MADE
ARRANGEMENT WITH THE SWISS GOVERNMENTAND OTHER EUROPEAN
COUNTRIES TO
FREEZE ALL MY LATE HUSBAND'STREASURES DEPOSITED IN SOME
EUROPEAN
COUNTRIES. HENCE MY CHILDREN AND I DECIDED LAYING LOW
IN AFRICA TO
STUDY THE SITUATION TILL WHEN THINGS GETS BETTER,LIKE
NOW THAT
PRESIDENT KABILA IS DEAD AND THE SON TAKING OVER(JOSEPH
KABILA).ONE
OF MY LATE HUSBAND'S CHATEAUX IN SOUTHERN FRANCE WAS
CONFISCATED BY
THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT,AND 
AS SUCH I HAD TO CHANGE MY IDENTITY SO THAT MY
INVESTMENT WILL NOT BE
TRACED AND CONFISCATED. I HAVE DEPOSITED THE SUM OF ONE
HUNDRED 
MLLION UNITED STATE DOLLA(US$I00,000,000,00.) WITH A
SECURITY
COMPANY, FOR SAFE KEEPING. THE FUNDS ARE SECURITY CODED
TO PREVENT
THEM FROM 
KNOWING THE CONTENT. WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS TO
INDICATE YOUR
INTEREST THAT YOU WILL ASSIST US BY RECEIVING THE MONEY
ON OUR BEHALF
IN EUROPE.I WILL ALSO WANT TO BUY PROPERTIES AND STOCK
IN
MULTI-NATIONAL COMPANIES AND TO ENGAGE IN OTHER SAFE
AND NON
SPECULATIVE INVESTMENTS.MAY  I AT THIS POINT EMPHASISE
THE HIGH LEVEL
OF CONFIDENTIALITY, WHICH THIS BUSINESS DEMANDS,AND
HOPE YOU WILL NOT
BETRAY THE TRUST AND CONFIDENCE, WHICH I REPOSE IN
YOU.IN 
CONCLUSION,IF YOU WANT TO ASSIST US , OUR ATTORNEY
SHALL PUT YOU IN
THE PICTURE OF THE BUSINESS,TELL YOU WHERE THE FUNDS
ARE CURRENTLY
BEING MAINTAINED AND ALSO DISCUSS OTHER MODALITIES
INCLUDING
REMUNERATION FOR YOUR SERVICES.

I SINCERELY WILL APPRECAITE YOUR ACKNOWLEDGMENT AS SOON
AS POSSIBLE.
 

BEST REGARDS,

 MRS M. SESE SEKO
