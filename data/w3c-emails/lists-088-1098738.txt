Hi ???(don't know if this will go to Judy or someone else I know or someone
I don't know...)

On the main page, you include an image within the heading tag as follows:

<H2><A NAME="News"><IMG ALT="" BORDER="0" SRC="/Icons/right">News</A></H2>

I wonder if there is any reason to include the image within the heading tag,
rather than outside of it?

One reason not to is that when skimming through a page via headings with a
speaking browser, I hear "heading 2. image. News"

Curious to know more...
