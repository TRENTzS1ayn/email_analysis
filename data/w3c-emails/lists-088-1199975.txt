When using alt text for images, your site says this is for short
descriptions and that for longer descriptions the longdesc should be used.
Short and long are subjective terms. How many characters am I allowed in
alt text before I switch to longdesc?

Does capitalization and punctuation help in making the alt text more screen
reader friendly?

Thanks
