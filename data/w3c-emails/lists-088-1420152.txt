IN LIGHT OF LOOKING FOR WHO COULD ASSIST US FROM OUTSIDE WORLD IN THE CLAIM OF THIS MONEY THAT WAS DEPOSITED BY LATE MR.REIJO I HAVE TO SUBJECT MYSELF TO THAT POSITION BELIEVING THAT IF WE FINALLY SUCEED IN GETTING WHO TO ASSIST WE SHOULD DESIST FROM FURTHER SEARCH HENCE YOU CAN BEAR ME A WITNESS THAT AFTER MY FIRST EMAIL NO FURTHER CONTACTS FROM MY END WAS MADE WITH YOU AND YOUR ORGANISATION.
