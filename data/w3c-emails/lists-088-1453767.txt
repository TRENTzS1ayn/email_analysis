I am writing to inform you of a resource, www.UIAccess.com, for your
listing:

- References on Web Accessibility, Projects, Research, Resources at
http://www.w3.org/WAI/References/#projects

UIAccess (www.uiaccess.com) is an up-to-date, practical resource for
universal interface design and usable accessibility information. Popular
resources include Web Accessibility Introduction, U.S. Legal Activities
on Web Accessibility, and Comparison of [Section 508] EITAS Paragraphs
and [W3C WAI] WCAG Checkpoints, as well as articles on specific web
accessibility issues such as scalable text, spawned windows, and
evaluation tools.

In order to facilitate including www.UIAccess.com on your list, I would
be happy to provide more information at your request.

Best regards,

- Shawn
