Site:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/wai-report/

is obviously only used for SPAM right now.  Surely you can remove 
this from the site or do something about it.

Why I'm interested in it is that I had a spurious report on my site, 
which I find every time I do a GOOGLE search for "stjohn-lcms.org" 
that I would love to see removed.  There is NO content there, just an 
anonymous complaint that doesn't say what they are complaining about.

This complaint is found at:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/wai-report/2000JulSep/0003.html

If there is ANY way to remove this from your archives please do so.
