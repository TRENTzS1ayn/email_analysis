WAI homepage that Judy Brewer last updated 20 December (2001)  

    http://www.w3.org/WAI/

1. Suggest date should include year, and order should use ISO standard  
date form: 2001-12-20.

2. Participation, second bullet is vacuous, except for a ".".
Source second <LI> has commented out Sponsors and how to become a sponsor.

I note that WAI does seek separate sponsors, and lists them at the bottom
of the page. So what is wrong with including that in Participation?

A second (or third) bullet could be to encourage guideline review and
comment submission on them or any WAI materials, whether or not the 
reader is an active participant in a WAI group. We certainly are using 
that approach in UA.

3. Check tab order. The fourth tab is to the invisible spot preceding the 
top-right nav bar, with no alt. Its effect appears again as the repeated
icon on both the column and linear form, approximating: || <-> |  
Suggest those differ on the two forms:  || -> |   and   | -> || .

4. Suggest using lower-case in HTML element and attribute names, to be 
forward-compatible with XHTML.

5. Suggest <html lang="en-US"> in all WAI documents, except translations,
where the appropriate lang value should be similarly specified.

6. Surprise that only one ACCESSKEY="r" is assigned. Who would know?
