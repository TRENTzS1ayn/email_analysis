Just to let you know that the URL you currently have under Relevant Documents:
Guidelines for Government Websites within your section at

updated. The new URL is now at http://www.iagchampions.gov.uk/webguidelines.htm
(page also contains a link to v1 of the guidelines).

Thanks for an excellent resource and best regards
