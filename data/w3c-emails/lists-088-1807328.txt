Amazing three hour Sales Seminar Series

Yes You Can!

unlocks the secrets of... 
 
Overcoming Sales Objections   


Unlock the secrets of helping people buy by learning what you always wanted to know about overcoming objections!


Selling has changed so much in the last 10 years that even the pros are having trouble "Overcoming Sales Objections" as they adjusted to The New Economics of Selling.

Learn how the  New Economics of Selling recognise the change in peoples buying motives, and how people object to being sold, yet love to buy...

Unfortunately  the customer still raises objections that old selling techniques no longer overcome.

Overcoming Sales Objections will show you how to structure the sales process to achieve outstanding success.

You will learn to recognise the 6 Major Sales Objections Areas and we will show you 21 Techniques how to overcome them.

We will share with you techniques that identify the 5 most common Buying Signals that often go undetected, and train you in ways to assist the client to happily buy when previously the sale was lost.

In a lively, fun and interesting three hours you will learn all this and much more including... how to recognise the 10 most common styles of objections, and  then learn at least 27 ways to overcome them.?

The result - you will win many more sales!   
   

How effective are these ideas!
Outstandingly so! 
The local sales team of an  international music company, had results, which were at best, mediocre.? 

After learning how  The New Economics of Selling applied to their service, and by implementing the new skills leaned in  Overcoming Sales Objections, the team went from producing  less than 5% of the national sales volume  to selling more than the rest of Australia combined.

So unusual was the turn around, the  International Vice President of Sales travelled from L.A. to review what the "Aussies were doing".?

Spectacular results were achieved, by the two West Australian sales teams of a fifty unit national services franchise who were always "bringing up the rear!"

After learning skills that allowed them to predict the likely objections, and by learning the 21 ways to overcome them, the West Australian's have consistently been amongst the top three teams in the country.
