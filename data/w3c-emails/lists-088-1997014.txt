Thought this information might be appropriate for the "State Policies 
Relating to Web Accessibility" page (http://www.w3.org/WAI/Policy/USA-
States.html)...

On February 14, 2002, the Governor of Illinois signed Administrative Order 
1 (2002) directing that:
"Each agency shall utilize the Illinois Web Accessibility Standards for the 
development of web sites, intranets, and web-based applications to provide 
greater access to State web sites and online services for citizens with 
disabilities. These standards are designed to provide practical and 
specific direction that meets or exceeds all standards covered in "Section 
508" of the federal Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1998 and all "Priority 
1" Checkpoints of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Content 
Accessibility Guidelines."

The Illinois Web Accessibility Guidelines are available at: 
http://www.state.il.us/tech/technology/accessibility

The Administrative Order is available at:
http://www100.state.il.us/tech/tech_administrative.cfm

(I believe that the order covers all executive-branch state agencies.)

Feel free to email if you need any additional information.

Thanks,
Mike
