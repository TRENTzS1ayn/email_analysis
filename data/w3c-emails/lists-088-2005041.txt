HELLO WAI!

We are trying to establish an ISOC Vietnam chapter and translation of documents into Vietnamese is one of the first tasks. Accessibility documents is one of the first we will translate and Getting Started: .. is one of them.

Some questions and short feedback on the different translations of The Getting started: ... ( http://www.w3.org/WAI/gettingstarted/Overview.html.en ) document.

Is the idea of the document to link to the English (original) documents or the translation? Some of the translations are linking to there own language translation and some are not even though translation is available. I would like to make a Swedish and Vietnamese translation of the document. Is it OK to put a link to the Swedish (Vietnamese) translation after the link to the English original?


Some (or maybe all) of the translations are made by copying the html file from an other language and then translate. Some of the translators have missed to change the codes underneath and it makes it a little funny when talking about accessibility. 

Ex. 
The translation into Nynorsk states it is in French (html Lang="fr" and the title is still in French). I am not even sure if lang is supported in HTML 4.01. I saw that the English version use the <abbr lang="fr" title="Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et Automatique"> in the end of the document but use no lang="en" at the <HTML> tag.

The Danish translation has still the <!-- saved from url=(0036)http://www.w3.org/WAI/gettingstarted --> code.

These are just small stuff but I would like to point them out anyway.
