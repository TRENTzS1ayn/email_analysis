Thanks.  Noted.

Indeed, my mistake (see below).

I was citing the URL I know from memory, whereas in fact I meant to say

  http://http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-CORE-TECHS/core-techniques.html

to which I could have added other WAI pages such as

  http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WAI-WEBCONTENT-TECHS/
  http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WD-WAI-PAGEAUTH/ (possibly)
  http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/techniques.htm
  http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2002/02/12-wcag20-requirements.html

Even more crucially, there is a Bobby reference in

  http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/

which I suspect is worth more in advertising terms than I have ever
earned in 20 years professional software development.

It takes a long time to undo the damage done when "Everyone Knows"
that the "Official Recommendation" is Bobby.  Some people take that
kind of legacy so seriously as to practice "affirmative action"
30 years after discrimination was outlawed.
