Well, I know that this works using an English or Spanish language UA, so it
seems having misnamed the problem: Is it really intended that only English
and Spanish UAs have immediate access to these pages, while others have not?

This is an obvious usability (and accessibility) problem, so better offer to
choose the language the user wants by providing corresponding links on the
e.g. English main page, since you don't offer additional versions right now
(at least French, Chinese, German).
