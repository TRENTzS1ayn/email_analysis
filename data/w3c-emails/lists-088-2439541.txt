Mike

Thanks for your comment. We had discussed this at one point in EOWG, and 
people liked the idea but were not sure how many good policies were 
available online at that time. I think that the situation has improved 
since then and I will bring your request to the group.

We are currently updating the page of (government) policy reference links 
(though the revisions are not yet all recorded on the page); several people 
have suggested adding a separate page of links to some sample university 
policies. Corporate policy links seem a natural and important additional 
section.

A generic framework for organizational policies is available at
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/impl/pol.html
We will be promoting this page shortly along with the rest of the 
implementation planning resource suite, on which we're making some final 
edits. "Developing Organizational Policies on Web Accessibility" was 
developed with substantial contribution by representatives of several large 
corporations, and corps. are among its intended audiences.

Assuming we list some corporate policies in the future, I'd welcome you 
suggesting links at that time.

Regards,

- Judy
