I'm confused here.

Do links on the WAI site _really_ start out purple and then turn blue 
when
visited?

This appears to be the case as I use it, and if so, ugh, that's a 
usability
nightmare!

As you know, the default as most browsers are shipped is to start with
blue unvisited links and change to purple when they've been visited.  
Many
site developers will change these colors, and that's okay within reason,
assuming they apply a little sense when doing so.

However, if you -are- going to use blue and purple for link colors, then
you simply MUST assign them to their traditional roles:  blue for :link,
purple for :visited.  Anything else is simply begging for confusion and 
is
very user-unfriendly.

Thanks,
