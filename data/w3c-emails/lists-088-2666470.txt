Hi,
I wanna suggest an italian language resource where the best italian web
accessibility specialist works inside for promote W3C guidelines of the
WAI project: http://www.webaccessibile.org.

We have developed it as IWA/HWG for support the first italian law for
web accessibility that would be approved in the next month.

Please let us know when you add the resource at:

Sincerely,
Roberto Scano
