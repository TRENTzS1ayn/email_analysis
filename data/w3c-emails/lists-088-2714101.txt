Hi,

You get this short mail because you are involved with (or, contact 
person for) one of the three W3C pages mentioned below.

For some reason, I looked at where the "W3C home" image resided, and 
whether there were several of them.
It is referred to using several different URLs, but most likely they all 
end up in one and the same place.

BUT, I noticed how the use of this image, representing a link, is 
expressed in W3C's pages.
Especially the use of "alt=".
Several different practices could be noted.
And then I, naturally looked at what WAI says.

I am often tempted to tell people: "if you want to know how W3C 
Recommendations are used, look at pages at the W3C site".
One would hope that a pattern would be seen, a didactic pattern, that 
people then could reuse.

Any comments on how the three examples below conform to the WCAG Rec ? See:
