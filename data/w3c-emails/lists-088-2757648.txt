Dear Valued Customer,
 
Let us introduce ourselves.  We are a dive education centre and diving
equipments retailer as well, dealing with a wide range of diving
equipments and NAUI dive courses.  
 
The world is covered with 70% of water and below there is very much to
be discovered.
 
We would like to introduce scuba diving as a recreational hobby to the
management and staff members. This is also a great way for staff members
to interact and practice team building. Scuba diving is also known to
release stress. Moreover Malaysia is blessed with wonderful islands and
beaches that make scuba diving an attractive hobby. There are many world
class diving spots in Malaysia like Pulau Layang Layang , Pulau Sipadan
and many other islands. So take the plunge and train by the best.
 
Apart from scuba diving, Quantum Seas organizes customize trip, off road
trips, hiking and camping trips. We believe in working hard and play
hard. That's what life is all about as the saying goes "One Life Live
It".
 
Currently we are running a course promotion, 
 
"NAUI Scuba Diver course at RM950.00 with Mask, Snorkel, Fin and Weight
Belt plus 2 day 1 night stay in Pulau Tioman", please refer attachment
for detail.
 
We also provide First Aid & CPR course under American Safety And Health
Institute (ASHI), which is a need to ensure your work force are
knowledgeable to act promptly during unexpected event.
 
In the meantime should you need further information please do contact us
and appreciate if our brochures can be circulated.
 
Thank you.
 
Regards
