My understanding is that there is NOT expected to be a version of HTML
beyond 4.01.  I will confess to being uncomfortable with that notion, if
only because I know of at least one aspect of HTML 4 which is broken that
did not get repaired with 4.01.  I will point out that problem here, and I
hope that it is not too picayune an item...

Element (tag) support for OnFocus (and OnBlur) is far less broad than the
situations where OnMouseX and OnKeyX (and related events) are allowed.
Compare the values for "related elements" at URL:
http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/index/attributes.html

Also, the specifications should give prejudice to attributes which are
device undefended.  OnFocus and OnBlur should, in my humble opinion, be the
only valid and supported script events.  OnClick, OnDblClick, OnKeyDown,
OnKeyUp, OnKeyPress, OnMouseDown, OnMouseUp, OnMouseOver, OnMouseOut should
all be deprecated.  In the interim, implementers should be encouraged to
define the mouse and keyboard oriented actions in terms of OnFocus and
OnBlur.  The purpose (aside from promoting correct thinking) is to enable
mouseover-like events from the keyboard.  Such events should be triggered by
moving the focus (that is, tabbing) and *not* by keyboard-selecting (that
is, pressing the spacebar or enter key).

At one time, there was quite a bit of discussion on the WAI list about this.
I suggest reviewing the thread starting at URL:

Thanks for listening!

Subject: Request for requirements input for XHTML 2.0

Hello everybody

The W3C HTML Working Group will meet face-to-face on October 12/13.  They
will be discussing requirements for XHTML 2.0.  XHTML is continued
development of HTML, building on the foundation laid by XML.  In XHTML 1.0
the syntax was lightly changed to make it legal XML, and in XML 1.1 the
language has been pulled apart into modules so it is easier to mix and
match language capabilities for specific applications.  
The HTML Working Group have asked for input from the WAI in time for this
meeting and the WAI-PF Working Group, who will be preparing the input,
would like your ideas in this area.  

For XHTML 1.0 and XHTML 1.1 the HTML Working Group followed a guideline
that the language would work just as HTML 4.0.1 works.  For XHTML 2.0 the
HTML Working Group will once again consider some functional changes, that
is to say things can work a little differently.  For example, the OBJECT
element has had implementation problems, and they would like to go back and
fix it.  For another example, it is desired to use the work that has been
put into the general X-Link module for all XML applications, and use X-Link
as the basis for what were A and LINK elements before.  Please refer to the
additional background information at the foot of this message.  

This does not mean that the language will change radically; there are many
pages in use and many people preparing web content with XHTML as it is.
But we would value your input in the following areas:

- If you have a suggestion for changing HTML, please tell us.  But please
back up your suggestion with how this change removes a barrier that people
with disabilities face on the Web the way it is now.

- If you feel the Web has an unsolved problem that might be helped by a
fresh look at the document format definition, even if you are not sure what
change to XHTML would resolve the problem, please tell us how you feel it
needs improvement, regardless.

We ask you that you email your input *not later than Monday, October 9* to
the following address:
   wai-tech-comments@w3.org
knowing that all the messages will be archived publicly at:
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/wai-tech-comments

We will not have much time to discuss these back and forth, but the WAI-PF
Working Group will prepare an overview of the issues raised and this will
be linked off the WAI-PF home page at <http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/> where you
can read the summary and clarify further if you feel it is needed.

Daniel Dardailler and Al Gilman
Chairs, WAI-PF Working Group

PS: Some background on XHTML 2.0

The HTML Working Group Roadmap at
   http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/NOTE-xhtml-roadmap-20000721/
says the following:

  XHTML 2.0 is a next generation markup language. In this version, the
  functionality is expected to remain similar to (or a superset of) that
  of XHTML 1.1. However, the markup language may be altered
  semantically and syntacticly to conform to the requirements of related
  XML standards such as XML Linking and XML Schema. The objective of
  these changes is to ensure that XHTML 2.0 can be readily supported by
  XML browsers that have no arcane knowledge of HTML semantics such as

  linking, image maps, forms, etc. The development of XHTML 2.0 will
  likely require the development of new XHTML modules or revisions to
  existing XHTML modules.
