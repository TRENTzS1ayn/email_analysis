This is one of the best documents I've seen come out of the W3C in a while. 
It is clear, concise, and makes a lot of sense. I'd been looking for an XML 
vocabulary design document that went beyond "should I use an attribute or an 
element here" or "should I append a version number to my namespace" for a 
long time and this is the first one I find that is really worth reading.

I personally think that it should enter its own Rec track if only so that it 
can gain better visibility. Other W3C specs that deal with XML vocabularies 
should reference it directly, specifying how and when they followed its 
techniques.
