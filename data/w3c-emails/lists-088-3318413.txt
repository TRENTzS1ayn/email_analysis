Points about defining accessible schema. Difficult for a schema author to
known
all the elements that should be put in for the various disabilty types. RDF
could be used here to further describe a given element's accessibility
features.

This applies also for style sheets. Given an element, how do we know what kind
of style sheet class to apply to it when it's not the immediate docuemnt?


Improving on point 2.7, but for style. AH, Like 2.10, but with some examples.
So with 3.1, how do we associate a particular style sheet with a accessibility
context?

In 2.8, it would be handy to have some guidelines for working with namepaces
when two elements in different namespaces have the same name.

In 4.4, it's great to give some indication of the reason for a given element -
such as the title for the TOC - but what happens if it's use depends on
context? Maybe not m,uch cn bne done about this, but it is a common scenarion.
In one case it may be the TOC person title (e.g. Resume for Steven
Livingstone)
and in another it may have a different meaning (e.g. employee name is Steven
Livingstone). Both come from the same elemenrt but are used in differeny ways.
