Nor even 2000.

If XAG is honed, then XHTML won't be anything "special" - just another item 
in parallel with MenuML, etc.

If it has a cult following, then so long as it is XAG compliant and the 
tools for writing in it are ATAG conformant we need not worry our pretty 
little heads about it.

Job One is to assure that those who use it are protected by those who 
design it who are slaves to XAG and careful to keep ATAG in mind so people 
without limbs/voices/eyes/ears/English can make nice home pages using it. 
Mainly all the "reviews" done herein should have the form "XAG conformance 
is..." in some sort of EARL assertion.
