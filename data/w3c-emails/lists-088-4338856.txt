Consult this thread on the IG list:

hiding accessibility features
 http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/2001JulSep/0037.html

What we would prefer is more like UAAG guideline 2 where there is a policy
framework which can be set to suppress display by default; but the user,
either by interactive drill down request or by applying a "try harder"
different policy at the accessibility API interface through their assistive
technology gets the information.

The point being that static and interactive content control are part of a
consistent framework of layered policies and the content is always
available for later access under special circumstances.  Arrival at a
browser with an AT registered or attached to it is a special circumstance
relative to the baseline of all hits on the server.  Interactive request
for more information [by mouseover in visual UI, by context menu item
selection in audio UI, etc.] is a special circumstance relative to the page
rendering as a whole on load.
