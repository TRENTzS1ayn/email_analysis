Hi All,

Again my point isn't to single out any web site mentioned but rather to 
explore the issues raised.? I've noticed this more and more where there are 
double links to items, often I believe because the web designer wants a 
graphic and text to both be clickable.? Maybe it is just me but it is 
frustrating to have to read or tab through the same link twice.

The most recent example of this I noticed was on
<<http://www.adobe.com/>http://www.adobe.com> 
with links talking about the new Acrobat 5.0.? In the Adobe case I believe 
even the text is really a graphic of the text which has been properly alt 
tagged.

The actual page is at <<http://www.adobe.com/>http://www.adobe.com>.? Below is
the section of the 
page in question, although you will want to visit the original page to see 
the graphics.

Is there anything we can advise to turn such designs into single links or 
is this just something that is due to the design with no good 
solutions?? Should the alt text on both images be identical?

Kelly
