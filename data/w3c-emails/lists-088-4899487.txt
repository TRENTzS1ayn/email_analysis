I still have some doubts, not so much about XML, but our ability to agree
enough for it to be useful. In my latest tirade I have criticised the new
interactive TV standard for coming up with non-standard web based standards:

I will need to look at the detail, but my immediate reaction is this would be
very useful for the iTV standard, where I criticised it for not considering
accessibility.
