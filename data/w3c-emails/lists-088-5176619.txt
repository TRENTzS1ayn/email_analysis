May I briefly introduce myself. I am Lt. Col.(rtd) John Osasa of the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire) and the former aide de camp of the Late President Laurel Kabila of blessed memory.

I am presently living in Nigeria on asylum. In case you are wondering how I got your contact, I got your contact from a source at the foreign trade office of the Nigeria Chamber of commerce, trade and industry.

The events of the past one year in my country has been very unfortunate. The Late president Kabilasuccessfully toppled the very corrupt government of the Late Dictator Mobutu Sese Seko and ruled justlyand peacefully for a few months. Unfortunately, the Tutsi from Goma, the Northern part of the country rebelled against his government and since then my country has been at war.

I am very dedicated and committed to winning the war against the rebels until recently when to my shock Ifound out that Senior Army Officers and Government officials were stealing public funds and looting government treasury and sending them to foreign countries. They have exploited the war situation to bring back the lawlessness and corruption of the Mobutu days.

After the late President Kabila was assainated in very questionable circumstances, I knew I was in danger of losing from both ends. Due to this development and as a way of survival, I have joined the train. I have in my possession funds amounting to US$21million. In the usual manner of conveying such funds, the money is in defaced form in a trunk box for security reasons. It is now in the safe custody of a security company. The company is however not aware of the real contents of the trunk box.

My problem is that the financial Law of Nigeria does not give assylum seekers any financial rights. Andbecause of the economic instability and religious crisis, I have decided that it will be unwise to attempt investing the funds here. The climate here is very unfavourable and as a result, I have not disclosed even to my hosts anything about this fund.

Now I am seeking foreign assistance to transfer the funds overseas. If you can assist, I am willing to give you 20% of the funds, that is US$4.2Million. You will understand that my entire life and future dependon this money and I shall be very grateful if you can assist me. The major thing I demand from you is theabsolute assurance that the money will be safe and you will not sit on it when it is transfered to your account.

If you are ready to be of assistance, please contact me immediately by e-mail, so that I can furnish youwith the modalities for the transaction and what is expected of you. I shall be most grateful if youmaintain utmost confidentiality and keep this message entirely to yourself.

Best Regards,

MR. JOHN OSASA.
