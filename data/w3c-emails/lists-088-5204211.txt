Hello all,

(Note: I am not subscribed to this list, so leave me CCed on 
your message if you want me to see it / respond.)

Looking over XMLGL[1], I notice that some of its terminology is 
confusing to many of us familiar with another way of looking at 
XML. It speaks about "metadata" and "data" tags, but seemingly 
goes on to specify guidelines for "document" tagsets, not data 
ones. You also say confusing things about "metadata-oriented" 
tagsets, which I think could be clarified.

  - ACTION: Clarify XMLGL Terminology

And while some of your guidelines are relevant only for document 
tagsets, many apply to data tagsets also. It'd be nice if the 
separation were clearer. Also, some data-specific guidelines 
should be added, like grounding the data in URI-space, and using 
some sort of assertion-based system to represent it. 
(Preferrably RDF.)

  - ACTION: Add guidelines for data-based tagsets

Also, even what XMLGL calls "metadata-oriented" material should 
be accessible in some ways, providing room for 
comments/annotations that are semantically available, etc.

  - ACTION: Add guidelines for "metadata-oriented" tagsets

Possibly, some guidelines could be generalized, or split to 
apply to multiple types of documents.

I hope these comments are helpful,
