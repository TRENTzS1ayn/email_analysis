URGENT BUSINESS TRANSACTION
 
MY NAME IS SIMON ANGULU, THE FORMER ADVISER ON SPECIAL DUTIES TO THE OUTTED ROBERT GUEI, THE PRESIDENT OF COTE'IVORE IN WEST AFRICA REGION, BUT LET IT NOT BE SURPRISING TO YOU THAT I AM CONTACTING YOU THROUGH THIS MEDIA. THOUGH, I HAVE NOT GOTTEN ANY PREVIOUS CORRESPONDENCE WITH YOU.  I AM PERSONALLY CONTACTING YOU FOR THE FIRST TIME, HOPING YOU WILL ASSIST ME BASED ON THE REALITY OF THE TRANSACTION.

RECENT DEVELOPMENT IN MY COUNTRY IS NO MORE NEWS TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD.  PRESIDENT ROBERT GUEI, AFTER LOSING HIS AMBITION TO TRANSFORM HIMSELF FROM THE MILITARY TO CIVILIAN PRESIDENT, HE RAN AWAY TO A NEIGHBOURING COUNTRY, BENIN REPUBLIC SEEKING POLITICAL ASSYLUM.  ALL THE PEOPLE THAT SERVE IN HIS CABINET INCLUDING THE FORMER MINISTER AND HIS POLITICAL ASSOCIATES, EVERYBODY IS AT LARGE. 

DURING MY TENURE AS THE ADVISER ON SPECIAL DUTIES, I WAS ALSO IN CHARGE OF FINANCE OF HIS POLITICAL AMBITION.  IT WAS WHILE IN THESE PRIVILEDGED POSITIONS THAT I KEPT IN MY CUSTODY THE SUM OF TWENTY FIVE MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS (US$25M) WITHOUT THE FULL-KNOWLEDGE OF THE PRESIDENT. 

MORESO, THE FRAGILE POLITICAL SYSTEM IN AFRICA DOES NOT ENCOURAGE ME ON LONG-TERM INVESTMENT PROJECT, THIS IS THE REASON WHY I AM ASKING FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE TO ENABLE ME DEPOSIT THIS MONEY OUTSIDE THE CONTINENT FOR OUTRIGHT INVESTMENT. 

THIS FUND IS CURRENTLY KEPT WITH A SAFE/TRUST SECURITY COMPANY IN TOGO, A NEIGHBOURING WEST AFRICAN COUNTRY IN DISGUISE AS PRECIOUS METAL. 

I HEREBY AGREE TO COMPENSATE YOUR SINCERE AND CANDID EFFORT TO ASSIST IN THIS REGARD WITH 15% OF THE FUND WHEN FINALLY RECEIVED BY YOU WITH OUR PRE-ARRANGEMENT STRATEGIES.  HOWEVER, I HAVE SENT MY SON TO AMSTERDAM AS REGARDS THIS TRANSACTION, EVERY ARRANGEMENT HAS BEEN CONCLUDED ON THE SAFEST WAY TO MOVE THIS FUND TO EUROPE WITHOUT THE SECURITY FIRM NOT NECESSARILY KNOWING ITS CONTENT.
 
THEREFORE, FOR THE SECURITY OF THIS TRANSACTION, YOU ARE TO CONTACT MY SON MR. MICHAEL ANGULU WHO IS CURRENTLY IN AMSTERDAM. YOU CAN REACH HIM ON TELEPHONE NUMBER:  31 62 7340506. I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS TRANSACTION MUST BE KEPT IN UTMOST CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECRECY, AS MY FUTURE WELFARE HUGELY DEPENDS ON IT.  ONE MORE THING, BE REST ASSURED THAT THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF OUR LONG-TERM BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP. 

BEST REGARDS.

SIMON ANGULU.
