Al,

         This is my first attempt at coherent discussion since the events 
this week, so if I don't express myself well, please excuse ....


         Yes, I know that text is "re-purposable" by being representable 
visually, by sound (with special equipment), and in braille (with special 
equipment), but as unspecific as images and real-life visual experiences 
are, they are an important means of communication for many people. On 
Tuesday, when our nation was attacked by horrific terrorists, I was able to 
access only text until I got home from school and could see tv ... which 
was when I realized that my sister who lives in Pittsburgh had been 
vulnerable, and got offline to call her .... Another sister heard the news 
on the radio at school and groaned so deeply her students asked her what 
was wrong, and she said that Christy was in Pittsburgh ... We got a 
directive from our new superintendent to limit any "human" need to know 
what is happening on our part, and limit the exposure of our students to 
graphical images of the horror .... to limit the trauma that are happening 
to the children who saw their parents killed from the windows of their 
classrooms ..... images are what brought Americans together this week .... 
with words and text, but mostly images ..... think about it! Text didn't 
happen online until long after all events had transpired!

                                                 Anne
