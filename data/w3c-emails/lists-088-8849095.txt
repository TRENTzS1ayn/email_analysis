Dear Sirs,

Please allow me to take this opportunity to introduce our trade fair-
Furniture World China & Woodworking Machinery China 2002, which is to be
held in Beijing, from 20-23 Nov. 2002.

The Furniture World China & Woodworking Machinery China is nationally
acclaimed as the finest and largest exhibition of its kind in the Northern
China. Now in its fifth year, the show has grown by leaps and bounds.
Furniture World China 2001 attracted 426 furniture manufactures from home
and abroad with an exhibiting space of nearly 20000 sq. m. During a four day
exhibition, the total value of on-site orders amounted 56 million US
Dollars; 40,000 trade visitors came from 28 provinces and municipalities
across China as well as 18 countries such as Australia, Britain, Burma,
Canada, Fuji, Germany, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Mongolia, New Zealand,
Poland, Russia, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Thailand, Ukraine and U.
S. A. Among all exhibitors of the last edition, 60% were loyal customers
with participating more than 2 times; 85% were satisfied with the quality
and quantity of visitors; 80% obtained orders on site; 80% of them will
return to the 2002 event. A net space of 6000 sq. m. of coming event was
reserved on the spot.

All those records have proved the continuous efforts we had made to provide
the exhibitors and visitors the most professional services. And naturally
Furniture World China has been recognized as a platform for suppliers and
end-users to establish contacts and to conduct business in China.
