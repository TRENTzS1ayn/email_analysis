Sighted readers infer semantics from visual presentation.
a,b,c and d infer a choice class of information.
Breaks in text (para class of presentation)infer some level of change
in subject matter.
That's historically true, but still relevant.

That worries me. the link, rel="stylesheet" is reputedly something James
Clark threw together to fill a gap. 

I still like the structural association

<mediaObject>
  <media1form linkToIt="url"/>
  <media2form linkToIt="url"/>
  <media3form>
         <inLineContent>....</
  </media3Form>
</mediaObject>

Nice one. xpointer for smil?
Are you looking for common syntax here Sean?

This smacks of changing the problem domain.
If an application goes digging around a website, it might come up
with one or many words to replace the contents of the class attribute
with other words. The problem then is interpreting those words.
surely the real problem is semantic interpretation of the contents of
the class attribute.
