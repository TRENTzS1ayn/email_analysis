DEAR SIR, 

REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP 

FIRST, I MUST SOLICIT YOUR CONFIDENCE IN THIS 
TRANSACTION. I AM A HIGH PLACED OFFICIAL WORKING WITH 
THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE, HERE IN BANJUL, GAMBIA, WEST AFRICA. MY
DEPARTMENT(THE
TREASURY DEPARTMENT) RUNS INTO SEVERAL THOUSAND MILLIONS OF
DOLLARSMONTHLY.


MYSELF AND THREE OTHER COLLEAGUES IN THIS DEPARTMENT 
ARE CURRENTLY IN NEEED OF A SILENT FOREIGN PARTNER 
WHOSE BANK ACCOUNT WE CAN USE TO TRANSFER THE SUM OF 
TWELVE MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND U.S. DOLLARS 
(US$12,500,000.00). THIS FUND ACCRUED LEGITIMATELY 
(BUT DISCRETELY) TO US AS COMMISSION FROM FOREIGN CONTRACTS,
THROUGHOUR
PRIVATE CONNECTIONS. 

THE FUND IS PRESENTLY WAITING TO BE REMITTED BY OUR 
OFFSHORE FUNDS MANAGERS TO ANY FOREIGN BENEFICIARY 
SUBMITTED BY US TO THEM AS THE RECEIVER OF THE FUND. 
HOWEVER, BY VIRTUE OF OUR POSITIONS AS CIVIL SERVANTS 
IN OUR COUNTRY, WE CANNOT ACQUIRE THIS MONEY IN OUR 
NAMES. BECAUSE AS HIGH PLACED CIVIL SERVANTS, WE ARE 
NOT ALLOWED BY THE CIVIL SERVICE CODE OF CONDUCT TO 
OWN OR OPERATE BANK ACCOUNTS OUTSIDE OF OUR SHORES. 
ON THE OTHER HAND, IT IS NOT SAFE FOR US TO KEEP THE 
MONEY HERE DUE TO OUR UNSTABLE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT. 

I HAVE BEEN DELEGATED AS A MATTER OF TRUST BY MY 
COLLEAGUES, TO LOOK FOR AN OVERSEAS SILENT PARTNER IN 
WHOSE ACCOUNT WE WOULD TRANSFER THE US$12,500,000.00 
FOR MUTUAL BENEFIT, HENCE THE REASON FOR THIS EMAIL.
 
WHAT I AM REQUESTING FROM YOU IS: (1) TO BE OUR 
SILENT PARTNER AND RECEIVE THE FUNDS IN YOUR ACCOUNT 
IN TRUST. (2) PROVIDE A BANK ACCOUNT UNDER YOUR 
CONTROL TO WHICH THE FUNDS WILL BE REMITTED. (3) 
RECEIVE THE FUNDS IN YOUR ACCOUNT, TAKE OUT YOUR 
COMMISSION AND KEEP THE REST OF THE MONEY UNTIL I 
ARRIVE THERE TO MEET YOU AFTER THE TRANSFER IS 
COMPLETED. 

OUR PROPOSAL IS THAT AFTER YOU RECEIVE THE FUNDS, IT 
WOULD BE SHARED AS FOLLOWS: (1) 20% TO YOU AS 
COMMISSION, WHILE THE REMAINING 80% BELONGS TO 
MYSELF AND THE TWO COLLEAGUES HERE. YOU WILL BE 
FREE TO TAKE OUT YOUR COMMISSION IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE 
FUNDS HIT YOUR ACCOUNT. SINCE OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO INVEST THE MONEY INA
FOREIGN COUNTRY, IT WOULD BE APPRECIATED IF YOU CAN ALSO HELP US
TOINVEST
OUR OWN MONEY INTO PROFITABLE VENTURES IN YOUR COUNTRY. 

HOWEVER, THIS IS OPTIONAL, AND SHOULD IT NOT BE CONVENIENT FOR YOU
TOFURTHER
ASSIST US WITH INVESTING THE MONEY, WE CAN END OUR COOPERATIONAFTER
YOU
HAND OVER TO US OUR PERCENTAGE OF THE MONEY. 

THE TRANSACTION, ALTHOUGH DISCRETE, IS LGITIMATE AND
THE MONEY WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO YOUR ACCOUNT WITH ALL 
NECESSARY BACK-UP DOCUMENTS SHOWING LEGITIMATE SOURCE/ORIGIN OF
FUND.THE
TRANSFER WILL BE 
EFFECTED TO YOUR ACCOUNT WITHIN SEVEN (7) WORKING DAYS 
AS SOON AS WE REACH AN AGREEMENT AND YOU FURNISH ME 
WITH A SUITABLE BANK ACCOUNT FOR RECEIVING THE MONEY. 


I PLEAD WITH YOU ON ONE ISSUE, WHETHER YOU ARE 
INTERESTED OR NOT, KINDLY DO NOT EXPOSE THIS 
INFORMATION TO ANY ONE ELSE. I CONFIRM THAT THE 
TRANSACTION IS LEGITIMATE AND WITHOUT ANY RISKS EITHER 
TO OURSELVES OR YOURSELF. 

PLEASE, GIVE ME YOUR RESPONSE IMMEDIATELY BY RETURN 
MAIL, WHILE KEEPING EVERYTHING CONFIDENTIAL. 

YOURS FAITHFULLY 

 JOHNSON ULOROH
