Could this be an author responsibility?
Thinking of DAISY, which uses smil, the master source is taken as 
something outside the XML. this master file links out to
a)the text using a url+fragid,
b)the audio, using a time offset.
I guess a video could be the same?

With xlink principles, the link database would be the place to hold links,
from some master out into all media, from a common place.
That would provide the 'synchronisation' that DAISY has.

It does rely on the provision of a master file (DAISY name for the link
database)
from which all xrefs are found. Also on the realisation that this document
will
be delivered in n media.
