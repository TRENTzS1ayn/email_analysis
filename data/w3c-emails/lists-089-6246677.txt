Shen   Wei  Brief  Introduction 

    Our factory is specialized in making the seal products and the mechanical accessory??including the static sealing gaskets(used in every kind of the tube flange??vessel??towel??heat exchanger etc)and sealing packing used in every kind of the pumps and valves.They used in petrochemical,electrical plat,metallurgy,nuclear power,mechanic,ship and automobile industry etc.where.corrosion acid and alkali,higher or lower temperature,high pressure is exist.  

   Gashets:graphite high pressure gaskets,spiral wound gasket,metal eyelet gasket,expanded Tefllon joint sealing gasket.This kind of gaskets can bend to any shape.As flexible and compressed rate is big,they are necessary products used in the food,beverage,pharmacy,biology engineeying industry.They were made with the international standard. 

 Sheet:Expanded caraphite sheet.Reimforced Graphite sheet  

   Packing:They are used in the pump and valve??s sealing packing in any condition,including flexible graphite packing,PTFE packing,carbonized fiber packing,Kevlar packing,glass fiber packing,mixed packing by the above material,graphite shaped ring,packing compressed shaped ring.The packing can be any shape after used in valve and pump. 

  Machining:It is mainly used as high pressure oil tube in the diesel engine,automobile industry etc cam shaft,rocker shaft,also can process according to the sample and drawing

 

 

  engine,automobile industry etc.Our sealing products and oil tubes are widely used in every kind of petrochemical,oil,electric plant,heat power company,natural gas company,diesel engine industry and the automobile industry etc.

   

HIGH-ENERGY LAMINATED SHEET

 

REINFORCED EXPANDEDGRAPHITE LAMINATED SHEET

 A??PH 0??14 

Has Excellent Corrosion-resistance PH 0??14 

B?? 200kgf/cm2 

   High Pressure

C?? -200????+600?? 

   High-and-low temperature resistance 

D??  Good compression resilient and high intensity 

 

 

The reinforced sheet is made by metallic sheet in core and pressed with expanded granule,which is divided into two types of punched gear style and adh esion style.punched for various gaskets.such.as cylinder head,air-exhausting,water column,flange,and thermal exchanger gasket.It is an ideal sealing material with vast range application and seading performance.

D??Self-lubrication 

E??.Impermeability 

F??   High compressibitity and resilient 

     

     The expanded graphite packing by the expanded graphite yarn the carbon comtent is more than go per cent.It has various properties of expand graphite and high general-purpose performance fine flexibility.intensity.bent-breaking resistance??So far it is the sealing product that gathers the most merits.It is widety used in the steam valves of power plant.or as static seading in places where high.temperature and pressure or chemical corrosion prevails(except comcentrated sulphuric acid of strong oxidizing agents)
