Are you interested in Office 2000? I am selling perfectly working 
copies 
of Microsoft Office 2000 SR-1 Premium Edition for a flat price of 
$50 USD.
The suite contains 4 discs and includes: 

Word 
Excel 
Outlook 
PowerPoint 
Access 
FrontPage 
Publisher 
Small Business Tools 
PhotoDraw 

Office Developer 2000 is available as well for $65 and is the 
Premium 
version with Developer Tools. 

As well, why not try out some of the greatest operating systems 
below? 

Microsoft Windows 98 SE $20 
Microsoft Windows Millenium $20 
Microsoft Windows 2000 Pro $20 
Microsoft Windows 2000 Server $50 
Microsoft Windows 2000 Advanced Server (25CAL) $65 

If you would like to order, please email me. I accept checks, 
money 
orders, and PayPal(Allows use of credit cards with 3% surcharge.) 
The 
software are virus checked and copied correctly with the best 
software 
and hardware available. In other words, they work flawlessly. 
CDR's as you 
know cost very little and there is little reason for me to rip 
you off. 
The highest cost is the time and effort I spent in defeating the 
copy 
protection system properly. I will definitely send the software 
upon 
receipt of payment.
