Dear Web Merchant,

My company has taken notice of your on-line presence and
wanted to bring a few things to your attention.

Over the past several years, we have spoken with hundreds of
online merchants like you, who unfortunately are not happy.
The reason for their unhappiness varies but all seem to have
common issues.

Here are a few examples of some problem issues:

-  I can?t get my Web site updated with new material.

-  My Web site was supposed to be completed within 2 wks,
it's been over 2 mnths.

-  changes made to my Web site, are not what I requested and
take another month to get them right.

-  I can?t get any technical support for my growing Internet
needs.

-  Nobody returns my calls, regarding Web site issues and
they can?t answer the questions I have.

-  My monthly maintenance seems a little expensive for the
services I receive.

-  I want my own domain name but it is too expensive.

-  My Web site take a long time to download compared to
other sites.
