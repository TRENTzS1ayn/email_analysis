Juvio gives you LIVE computer tech support from our California headquarters 24 hours/day, 7 days/week, 365 days/year...for the price of ONE support call to ?you-know-who?.  Just $34.95/month covers every problem and every question that comes up.

You are probably aware of how companies are starting to charge more and more for support services they continue to cut back on.  When was the last time you weren't satisfied with a support call you made, especially when you really needed help?and fast? 

Imagine a company that is dedicated to giving you the support you need...as much of it as you need and with no time limitations or incentives to end the phone call.  You've just described friendly, innovative Juvio support at your service...anytime!

Not sure you have enough need to warrant $34.95/month?  You will find that once you begin to use and rely on Juvio for every computer-related issue ? from "How do I plug this in?" to "Can you locate the drivers I need for this networking component?" ? your calls become more frequent knowing there is someone to answer every conceivable question.

The time you save alone is worth having the service!  When you try it, you will quickly see that the value is there; from answering your questions, solving problems and keeping your equipment running.
