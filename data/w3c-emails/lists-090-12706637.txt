Well, maybe so -- but not a bug in the browser in my opinion; rather, a bug
in the thought processes or methods of the page author. And it does limit
accessibility (to quote a phrase from your page, "one or more groups will
find it impossible to access information in the document" -- in this case,
users of graphical browsers). Accessibility isn't an issue only for those
with visual impediments etc.; pages should be accessible also for "normal"
people (this is an odd case where people using screen readers, text-only
browsers etc. actually have *easier* access to the information than people
using a graphical browser -- and reminds me of the odd page that was
"optimised for Lynx" by having white text on white background and text in
image ALT attributes; a Lynx user would see all the text, while a user of a
graphical browser wouldn't see anything). That's why I consider this
"specifying foreground *and* background colours, or neither" an
accessibility issue, and a fairly important one, too.

Cheers,
Philip
