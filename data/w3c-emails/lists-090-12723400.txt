Dear WCAG Editors,

I know it's been up less than a week, but the page:

   http://www.w3.org/WAI/Resources/WAI-UA-Support

which is supposed to list user agents supporting
various accessibility features, seems incomplete.

For MS-Windows, there is at least one user agent 
available that satisfies checkpoints 7.3, 7.4, 
and 10.1 (and probably others).  It also has
excellent CSS support.  It's available at:

         http://www.operasoftware.com

Please accept my sincere praise on a job very well
done!

regards,

- Terry Sullivan
