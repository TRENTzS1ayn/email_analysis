Dear Editors,

I am reading the WAI-WEBCONTENT document with great interest, and hope
that all the my new pages will conform, at least at the Double-A level. 

The Guidelines themselves claim to conform at the Triple-A level, but to
me, this seems not to be correct, as there seems to be a non-conformance
with checkpoint 10.5.

Take the code used repeatedly on the page:

<DIV class="glnav"> <a href="#gl-complex-elements"><img alt="Next
guideline: 12" src="images/next.jpg"></a> <a
href="#gl-interim-accessibility"><img alt="Previous guideline: 10"
src="images/previous.jpg"></a> <a href="#toc-gl-use-w3c"><img alt="Go to
contents" src="images/contents.jpg"></a></DIV>

I interprete the guidelines in such a way that some character should be
placed between one A-element and the next, e.g.:
[...]</a> | <a [...]

I hope I have not completely misunderstood the guidelines (in which case
I hope you will correct me), but I feel there is a need for separating
characters in places like that (though I am myself hiding them using
stylesheets).

Best Regards,

Kjetil
