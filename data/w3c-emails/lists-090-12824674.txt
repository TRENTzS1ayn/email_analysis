Hello,

The main concern this interim technique addresses is for text links.
Certain combinations of older graphical browsers and screen readers treat a
list of text links that are not separated  by characters as one phrase (and
thus one link).  This does not happen for links that are images, since the
graphical browsers will display a place-holding image that breaks up the
text of the links (included in the alt-text).  The links in the Guidelines
document are images and thus do not have the problem of plain text links.

This is not made clear in the Guidelines document.  We will clarify it in
the Techniques document.

I hope this helps answer your question and clarify the checkpoint.  Let me
know if you have further questions.
