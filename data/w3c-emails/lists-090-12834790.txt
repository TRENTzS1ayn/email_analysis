Two points:

It should be explicitly noted in the guidelines that the order in
which they appear is not relevant of any global priority.

Second, even though this is true, people still present them starting
with number 1, then number 2, and the order subjectively matters.

So I suggest we change it to be:

         1. Provide equivalent alternatives to auditory and visual content. 
         9. Design for device-independence. 
         3. Use markup and style sheets and do so properly. 
         6. Ensure that pages featuring new technologies transform gracefully. 
         5. Create tables that transform gracefully. 
         11. Use W3C technologies and guidelines. 
         2. Don't rely on color alone. 
         4. Clarify natural language usage 
         7. Ensure user control of time-sensitive content changes. 
         8. Ensure direct accessibility of embedded user interfaces. 
         12. Provide context and orientation information. 
         13. Provide clear navigation mechanisms. 
         10. Use interim solutions. 
         14. Ensure that documents are clear and simple.
