Well, I think the i18n group might like to discuss to see if my question has
any merit:
that is why I limited my earlier posting.

You have some Chinese text, all birds nests and no spaces. You have two
consecutive words each in seperate <a href=""> elements. In order to conform
to the WAI requirements, a space should be inserted.  This is against
Chinese
typographic practise.

So I raise the question: is underlining links against good i18n practise
(for languages
written without spacing), if the underlines for consecutive words meet with
no
or only-a-tiny gap?  If so, what are possible non-intrusive solutions to
this that
would not upset people's pages? The approach I raised, as an example not
a suggestion, is to put a serif  (a butt-end) on the end of each underline
(or only
adjoining ones), to clearly indicate its range.
