Hello Bruce, 

the editors of WCAG1.0  received this message (Wendy, Gregg, and Ian).

Yes, I can see how this might be confusing.  There seem to be a number of
issues here:
1.  The use of style sheets deprecates the use of spacer images (for
placement of text - as in the poem example).
2. The use of style sheets also deprecates the use of tables (for placement
of text and images - as in the 2nd deprecated example).
3.  However, since style sheet positioning is not supported consistently
across a variety of browsers these practices will probably continue for
some time.

I will add this as an issue to be discussed at the next GL meeting.  Now
that the Guidelines document has become a Recommendation, the group is
focusing on cleaning up the Techniques document.

thank you for your comments,
--wendy
