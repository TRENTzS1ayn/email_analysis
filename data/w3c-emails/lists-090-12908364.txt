Donna,

Thank you for your support!  

In dealing with text-only pages, the working group felt that a text-only
page should only be used as a "last resort" because of the issues that you
are facing.  Instead, we suggest that you make your graphical pages as
accessible as possible.   This does not mean replacing all graphics with
text.  Rather, provide text equivalents for graphics (as discussed in
Guideline 1).

Are you unable to make the graphical/primary pages accessible?  If so, then
this is the only reason for providing a whole text-only site.

Browsers do not yet deal with media types (that I am aware of).  In the
future, this will be an interesting solution.  

let me know if you have further questions,
--wendy
