In section six, Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, under the heading
'Provide content that, when presented to the user, conveys essentially the
same function or purpose as auditory or visual content' it states in para 2
"Synthesized speech is critical for individuals who are blind and for many
people with the reading difficulties that often accompany cognitive
disabilities,
learning disabilities, and deafness." 

I assume this is either a mistake or I'm missing something vital in my
comprehension of how people overcome deafness.
