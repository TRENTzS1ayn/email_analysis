Hi Mark,

Since many people who are deaf learn sign language as their first natural
language, written text is a "second language" and often very different from
the structure of sign language.  For example, American sign language
expressions are formed very differently than American  English.  Therefore,
some of these people find it hard to read written text - as it is a second
language.  For more information, see the references at the end of this
article: http://www.gallaudet.edu/~pcnmpper/sep-oct98/bailes.html
