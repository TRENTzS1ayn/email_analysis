ahhh!  I see your point!  Yes, this makes no sense at all.  

This should say something along the lines of:
Synthesized speech is critical for individuals who are blind and for many
people with the reading difficulties that often accompany cognitive
disabilities, and learning disabilities.  Non-text equivalents are helpful
for individuals who have reading difficulties associated with deafness.

Thanks.  We will smooth out the wording and add it to the errata page.
