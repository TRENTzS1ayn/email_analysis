Dear Wendy and Ian,

I noticed another typo in the WCAG Techniques document at URL:
http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT-TECHS/#tech-latest-w3c-specs

Item 11.2 has a "refer to" that, I guess, is there as a place holder.  It
is currently blank.

Am I correct in assuming that you appreciate these picayune comments?
