Hugo,

I think the document you are looking for is at
http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT-TECHS/

This was published as a technical Note at the same time as the Guidelines
were published as a Recommendation. The documents were required to be
independent, so the linkings changed, but they should have all been
checked. I am forwarding this to wai-wcag-editor@w3.org so they can do any
link-checking that is needed.

Regards,

Judy
