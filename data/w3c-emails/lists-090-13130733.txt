Editor,

quick info re link error...

the page <A
HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT-TECHS/">Techniques</A> seems to
have a pdf link that actually points to the .ps postscript file. The .pdf
exists and opens fine.

Thanks for the accessibility guidelines. I believe they will prove very
relevant.
