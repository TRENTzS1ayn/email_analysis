Just a comment on Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0.

While generally a very valuable document I found it strange that in
discussing 6. Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 
          1. Provide equivalent alternatives to auditory and visual
content.

That in the document you start with graphical navigation aids and don't
follow your own advice to "Thus, a text equivalent for an image of an
upward arrow that links to a table of contents could be "Go to
table of contents"."
