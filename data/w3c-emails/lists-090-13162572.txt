Hello Tim

Apparently Acrobat 3 has problems printing the PDF version of the document.
This is not an error with the PDF format., but a tool problem. One user has
said that she was able to print starting on page 2, then printing page 1
separately.  We will investigate if the same bug exists in Acrobat 4.

thanks,
--wendy
