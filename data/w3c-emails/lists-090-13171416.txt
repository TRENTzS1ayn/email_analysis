I have seen this in webmaster@w3.org several times now.
What should we do about it. The existence of a link to the real .ps
version rules out most of the server-side tricks I know, and I think
fixing the link in the document is the only way.
Let me know.

What's wrong:                    The document "Techniques for Web Content Accesibility Guidelines 1.0" contains a link to the .pdf version of the file.  This link actually leads to the .ps version
What it should be:                    .pdf version
Comments:                    If this is the center of Web Development, God help us all.  Even Microsoft could do a better job (look at what I'm reduced to).
