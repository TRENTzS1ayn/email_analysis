It's a broken link. People will survive. When we publish the
next version, it will be fixed. Note that it's not the
Recommendation, it's the Note (Techniques Document). 

We could publish a new version just to correct this, but
I don't think it's worth it since we're supposed to be
putting out a new Techniques document relatively soon anyway.

The bug has been fixed in the source document so it won't happen
again.
