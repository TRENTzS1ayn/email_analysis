Dear WCAG-editor

This is a heads up that questions and suggestions about null and blank ALT
text have arisen in the ER-IG group and, as promised, I'm summarizing the
discussion for you.  I've got a draft summary at 

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/1999Jun/0050.html

I'm making this a "heads up" pointer rather than the "final summary"
because I have to leave for RESNA before the other ER-IG folks get a chance
to respond to my summary.  I didn't want wait till I got back to encourage
folks to move on.  I'll make revisions if needed when I get back.  If
you're insatiably curious of course, you can follow the thread of the above
email to see how people reacted.  But I'll fold in the comments when I
return.  I don't expect any dramatic changes.

Len
