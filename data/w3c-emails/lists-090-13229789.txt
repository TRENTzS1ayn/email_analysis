I see the noted pdf printing problem, attributed to use of Acrobat 3. I
fail with Acrobat Reader 4.0 as well.

Seeing the note re: one user reporting they could print from 2 to end --
I tried this and it works. But I still failed when attempting to print
page 1.

OK -- I just tried one more time so I could report the specific error to
you. This time I took a shot at deselecting the "Annotations" check box
in the "Pring Range" block. NOW, it has printed.
