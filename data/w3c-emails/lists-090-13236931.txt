children's camping products? Camp Stamp is a stamp for 
identifying children's clothing, for camp and school so 
parents don't have to iron or sew on labels. Campshop is
a ONE STOP CAMP SHOP for all summer camp needs.
Camp Stamp is also used by nursing homes and military.
 Made by people with cerebal palsy, Camp Stamp comes 
with black and white permanent ink. 
To see how people with altered abilities make the fabulous
