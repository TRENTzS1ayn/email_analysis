Adam,

I've forwarded your follow-up comment to the WCAG editors.
(Taken off of w3c-wai-gl since you didn't copy them on your
follow-up).

Perhaps. Checkpoint 11.1 reads:

Checkpoint 11.1 may address your concern, but perhaps we need some
clarification that forward-looking examples such as Q are covered by
11.1.

I don't think we need to publish a new version of the document. A
clarification
(on the errata sheet) should suffice.

We used the language "For example" intentionally so that people would
not be bound to a particular document language (such as HTML) and also
so that people could find other solutions. In section 3, these
notes are explained as follows:

  > Optional informative notes, clarifying examples,

The goal of clarification has obviously not been met in this case (and
perhaps
others). 

Thanks again for your comments,

 - Ian
