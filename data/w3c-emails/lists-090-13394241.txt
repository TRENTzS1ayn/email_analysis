There is a book causing quite a stir in African
American congregations across the country, especially
among its preachers. N. Moore's, "Pulpit Confessions:
Exposing The Black Church," questions the moral character
of the African American Church in the wake of recent
highly publicized scandals.

"The tables have been turned," writes Moore. "The
spotlight is not on the unrighteous sinners outside
the church, but the self-righteous transgressors inside it."

Moore, a former preacher and pastor, speaks candidly
about his and other ministers' odysseys from sincere
well-intentioned prodigies to cynical, sinful, showmen.
He describes in detail the often-profane process whereby
one obtains credentials to minister in the black church.

Moore offers insight into what he considers rampant
emotionalism during the African American worship experience.
"Simply because the preacher sounds good and can make
you feel good does not always mean that he is operating
under an anointing from the Holy Ghost." The author also
challenges many preachers' sermonic integrity by detailing
what he considers blatant showmanship and plagiarism.

Moore also reveals the thoughts and motivations of both
ministers and congregations whose power struggles often
turn violent. "Older members who have been there since
the first brick was laid will not surrender power without
a fight, " he writes. "And fight they will . . . sometimes
to the death."

The African American church has recently been rocked by
scandal at its highest levels. Moore describes how ministers
struggle with their public and private selves, which often
leads to career ending embarrassment. According to Moore,
though, the preachers should not always bear all of the blame.
"Many women in the church make it extremely difficult for
ministers to live righteous lives," he writes.

The author contends that the black church is not Y2K
compliant. He challenges it to get its house in order.
"Reverend, what kind of church are you going to present
to Jesus," he asks. "Will he even want it? Would you?"
