This comprehensive biography unfolds Louis Farrakhan's
odyssey from the streets of Roxbury to becoming America's
most outspoken black leader. It traces his controversial
relationship with Malcolm X and examines how Farrakhan
rebuilt the Nation of Islam and established himself as
the spokesperson for millions of disgruntled African-
Americans.

This book details Malcolm X's daughter's alleged plot
to have Farrakhan assassinated and the unique way it
united opposing factions in the black community. This
biography describes Farrakhan's often volatile
relationship with black leaders, including Jesse Jackson,
Khallid Muhammad, and Ben Chavis.

This book culminates with the historic Million Man March
and Farrakhan's subsequent World Friendship Tour. This
biography will interest anyone wanting to understand
the circumstances that have made Louis Farrakhan who
he is today.
