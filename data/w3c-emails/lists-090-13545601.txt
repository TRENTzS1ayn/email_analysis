Dan,

Your website (http://www.gooddocuments.com/) seems to be full of the

... interesting thing at
<a href="http://www.foo.com/dir/f">www.foo.com/dir/f</a>

idiom. For example:

(Chris also teaches journalism at Boston University --
he has a web site at www.bu.edu/cdaly.)

-- http://www.gooddocuments.com/philosophy/trellixdev.htm

I hope the trellix product doesn't encourage this idiom.

why not just

(Chris also teaches journalism at Boston University --
he has a _web site_.)

or better:


(Chris also teaches journalism at Boston University --
see _Chris Daly's Home Page_).

Tim, I suggest you add a paragraph about the url-in-your-face
idiom.

If you use the original World Wide Web program,
you never see a URL or have to deal with HTML.

I think this affects accessability; it's discussed in general
at

but not specifically. WCAG folks, please add something.
