OK. I like a lot of things about the website, and I especially
like the idea that folks should be able to use simple tools
like trellix appears to be (I'm gonna have to try it out) to
create their own web sites.

So I hope a lot of people read it, but I don't want them to
pick up this particular idiom.

Sorry I neglected to mention any of the things I liked about
the site. VERY bad habit of mine.

That makes me feel better. I'm seeing product blurbs for
tools that recognize www.foo.com when you type and add a link,
encouraging you to do that.

Sigh... would that the tools that print web pages would do this
for you. The idea has been around for a while:

Yes... but I suspect the .com fad will fade in a few years.
I prefer to see
the _Acme Company Home Page_

I would agree, except that from a casual browse of your web
site(s), you *do* seem encourage the practice, even if you
don't mean to.

Aha! I think the burden of keeping the titles up to date is
one thing that motivates people to use the url-in-your-face-idiom.
So this feature of trellix wins a gold star.

> Hope you like the rest of the site.

My measure of a web site is how long I stay interested. After
I found your web site, it was a good hour or two before I stopped
digging around. Most sites rate less than a minute. So yes, I like it.

I was *almost* interested enough to spend the half hour or so
it would take to download a copy of trellix. But I think I'll
buy the CD instead, eventually.
