I attempted to download Techniques for Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines 1.0 http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WAI-WEBCONTENT-TECHS-19990505
in PDF format, but was informed by my browser (Netscape Communicator
4.0) that I was downloading a Postscript file.  Sure enough, the
filenames for both the postscript and PDF file links end in .ps.

Just thought I'd let you know....
(I downloaded it as a zip html file)

Thanks!
