Why are the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
published in the very non-accessible PDF format?

Isn't that defeating the purpose?  Please take the 
opportunity to reduce the cognitive dissonance by 
pointing out the inaccessibility for PDF format.

Please see http://access.adobe.com for more info 
about what one must go through for PDF accessibility.  
I tried to get them to send their Solaris 
executable-only converter program, and they made me 
sign (and FAX!) a long contract and it took them 
several weeks to send it.
