The point is that the information is available in
an accessible format (HTML). That it is available
also in PDF (generated from the HTML) is a convenience
for those who can make use of the printed copy. It does
not harm accessibility to provide several formats - 
as long as at least one is accessible and provides
the same information.

(Indeed, in our case, the HTML format is primary,
the PDF is secondary).
