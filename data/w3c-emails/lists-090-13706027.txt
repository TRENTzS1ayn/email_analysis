Hi just wanted to inform you of unclear text on conformance.html,
under the heading "scope of the claim" it states
"If the claims is meant to apply to include than one page, the conformance
icon must be accompanied by explicit scope information explaining which
pages are covered by the claim. "
I imagine this means "if the claim is meant to apply to more than one page
the conformance icon must br accompanied by explicit scope information"
must have been a late niter  please explain also where this explicit
information shoud be placed. I am currently developing a site (not available
yet) and would like to support the WAI but I cant see putting the logo on
each page. Is there perhaps a way that say "this section conformes to A" and
"this section conforms to AA" ect with maybe a logo at the head of each
section?
