Yes. At first I thought you were quoting the Guidelines, but
you're quoting [1] (which is much easier for us to correct). I'll
fix it promptly.

[1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG1-Conformance.html

Several, actually. <weak grin>

That's up to you, actually. We put ours at the bottom generally,
as we did in the Guidelines themselves.

I think it would be fine to have a link (e.g, "Accessibility
Information"
or something similar) on the home page that designates a page 
where you describe conformance of certain pages. You could
also put information there that would help users with disabilities
navigate
your site (e.g., if you have d-links you could explain that they're
present). 

I haven't tried this yet, but it would be interesting to experiment
with such a page. My only concern would be separating information
for some users from information for all users. So, for instance,
I wouldn't put a site map on a page about accessibility information
since the site map (while useful to people with disabilities)
helps everyone.

That kind of detail could go on a separate page, yes.

Thank you for your efforts. If you find any good design ideas for
addressing
these questions, please let us know. We are very interested in how the
guidelines are used and where they are weak in explanation.

Thanks again,

 - Ian
