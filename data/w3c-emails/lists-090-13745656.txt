aloha, wendy, gregg, and ian -- i presume!

been trying to get to http://www.browsercaps.com/ all day with a variety of
browsers from a variety of dailups, but consistently receive a "Unable to
contact remote host" error...

will continue to attempt to get to browsercaps.com, but thought that you'd
want to know that (at least right now) there is a problem with the server
on which it is hosted...

probably a temporary glitch, but worth checking out if you have a contact
eddress for someone at browsercaps.com
