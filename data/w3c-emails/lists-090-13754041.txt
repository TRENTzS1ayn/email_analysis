Hello Gregory,

It appears that browsercaps went defunct sometime this summer.  It has been 
out of service for a while now, and I'm assuming it probably won't be 
back.  In the meantime, we've been using data from the htmlcompendium (i 
believe the URL is htmlcompendium.org).  It is not complete.  The 
difference between the two is that browsercaps had a wider selection of 
browsers, but the compendium has a more complete listing of elements that 
are supported (both HTML and CSS).

We'll update the links where we are able and put it in errata where we can't.

Ian - should we keep a place holder for browser caps in hopes that it will 
come back or comment it out until/if it does return?
