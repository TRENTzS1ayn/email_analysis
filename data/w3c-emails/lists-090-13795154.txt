Hi,

I've found a small error in the WCAG. In _Appendix A. -- Validation_,
the first paragraph is:

<P><strong>Validate accessibility with automatic tools and human
review. Automated methods are generally rapid and convenient but cannot
identify all accessibility issues. Human review can help ensure
clarity of language and ease of navigation.</strong>

Since you have used the STRONG element, wouldn't a user using a voice
browser feel like being shouted to?
