Hello Nyree,

First of all, to which set of Guidelines are you referring? We
have three:

1) Web Content (a W3C Recommendation, meaning this is a stable document)
2) Authoring Tool (currently a W3C Proposed Recommendation)
3) User Agent (currently a Working Draft in Last Call)

There are different levels of conformance possible for each Guidelines,
but there are only three levels available for each one. For instance,
you are "Level A" conformant if you satisfy all of the Priority 1
checkpoints.

I am happy to hear about your commitment to accessibility. Although
we do not have a way to conform to less than all the Priority 1
checkpoints,
I will be happy to assist you in achieving that level if I can.

 - Ian
