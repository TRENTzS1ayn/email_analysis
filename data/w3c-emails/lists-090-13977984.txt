To whom it may concern.

I'm a WebTV User, & have encounted the following condition with some of your web pages many times recently.

Please see the JPG below to see what I'm talking about.



This is a screen capture of just how "some" of your pages look to us on WebTV.

This was taken from the WebTV Viewer on my computer while viewing the following page of yours.

http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/

The WebTV Viewer can be downloaded from their web site at the folowing URL in their Developer section.

http://developer.webtv.net/design/tools/viewer/Default.htm

It allows webmasters to view their pages as they will look to WebTV Users.

If the W3c org doesn't have it, I would "strongly" recommend they get one, so that they may see how their pages will look, etc ?

As you can plainly see, the text is unreadable to us with that particular background.

It seems to be a random selection as to which pages have this background when I've gone throgh your web site looking for information.

On my computer "everything" looks fine, no problems with the background at all, with any page.

I do not think that this would be a good example of the W3c web site to set for WebTV Users looking for information as to "how things are done" in the world of the Internet & computers, etc ?

With the additional "Set-Top" boxes due to arrive next year, will they have the same problem viewing your pages as we now do ?

I hope I was able to help in informing you of an "unknown" problem to you ?

Please advise me as to the cause of this condition ?

Thank you.
