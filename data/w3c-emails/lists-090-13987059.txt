Eddie, thanks for your mail.

At W3C, we take compliance to our own specifications seriously. Of
course, when we received your complaint, directed at us, we wanted to
make sure our documents and style sheets were valid.

In using both the HTML and CSS validation services, at:

http://validator.w3.org/
http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/

we found that both the html and the linked style sheet are valid. The
question remains as to how the WebTV software handles style sheets. Do
you know what the level of CSS compliance is for the WebTV user agent?
Or the HTML compliance?

Judging from the webtv developer site at:

http://developer.webtv.net/authoring/faq/Default.htm

and 

http://developer.webtv.net/authoring/css/

the support is somewhat limited.

You can learn about style sheets from the W3C from

http://www.w3.org/Style/Activity.html

Style sheets are critical to the development of the Web, because it
makes it possible for content and presentation to be cleanly separated,
thus making it easier for a variety of devices (computers, TVs, wireless
devices) to access information from the Web. Also, now that CSS2 is 1.5
years old, and test suites have been available for nearly a year, it
would be great to see more style sheet capabilities on WebTV. Perhaps
this is the perfect time to get WebTV CSS2 work really going! 

Given your concerns and commitment to creating Accessible Web content,
and what I can only guess is a clear commitment to making WebTV a full
participant in the Web, I've copied the Webmaster at the
developer.webtv.net with the hope that s/he will be able to forward the
exchange along to developers at WebTV.

Thank you very much for drawing our attention to this.

Regards,

Janet
