Peter,

Thank you for noting this.

This error is documented on the "known errata" page, item #3 at
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WAI-WEBCONTENT-ERRATA>, and will be changed in an
updated version. 

I also noted however that this list of errata is not available from the
Techniques document itself, only from the Guidelines document, and so we
need to change that as well, the next time we update the Techniques document.

Regards,

- Judy
