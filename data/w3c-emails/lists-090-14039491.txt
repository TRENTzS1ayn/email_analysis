Found your name and email address while searching the web. I figured that programmers would know what to do with this product. we have other products available but this represents inventory that we need to move. Pricing is well below distribution. Here is the list of titles that we are trying to sell before Xmas. Pricing is somewhat negotiable depending on the quantity.. We come across a lot of software like this but this is what we have in stock. Call me if you have any question 912-826-1311
