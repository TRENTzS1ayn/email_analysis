From section 18.2.3 of HTML 4.01 [1]:

  "The onfocus event occurs when an element receives focus either by the 
   pointing device or by tabbing navigation."

I don't believe that "tabbing navigation" is required to be accomplished
by
any particular device such as the keyboard. Thus, the quote from WCAG
1.0 
seems correct to me. Have I missed something?
