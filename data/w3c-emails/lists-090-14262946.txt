David,

Thank you for taking the time to let us know this. We have
already logged this problem (in fact, it's the one we get
the most comments about, but we can't edit the document
in place ... ouch)  [1]. So we have to fix it in the next
version, which the WG has begun to work on.

Thanks again,

 - Ian
