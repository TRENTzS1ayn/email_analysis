Hello -
I am looking for specific information on the use of drop-down menus 
from a navigation bar.  The home page has a horizontal navigation 
bar with links to other pages.  I have been asked about the 
accessibility of drop-down menus from those links on the navigation 
bar.  I did not see specific information on this in the W3C info (I 
could have missed it, though). What would you advise for low-vision / 
physically challenged users?  
Thank you for your help.

Sincerely,
Pam Holliday
