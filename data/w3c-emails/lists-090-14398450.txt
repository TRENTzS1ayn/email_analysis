The W3C Process Document does not explain to that level of
detail how W3C works. It does say in the 9 June draft [4]
(and earlier versions): 

      W3C will make every effort to make archival documents 
      indefinitely available at their original address in 
      their original form.

W3C *never* (to the best of our ability) changes content
of a published technical report. Therefore, it's impossible
to incorporate errata; you have to publish a new document
(which we've done, e.g., for HTML 4 on two occasions).

There is an issue that has not been dealt with at W3C
as
a whole: what is the normative status of errata pages?
In particular, the AC does not review errata decisions
as they review the original document, so can the WG
just say "this is the fix to that problem" or should
significant fixes be reviewed by the AC?

This topic should be discussed on the chairs list, in
my opinion.

Also, there is a bit on managing errata in the
Guidebook [5], but it's not "normative"; just suggested
practice.
