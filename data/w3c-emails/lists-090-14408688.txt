O.K., that's what I had read, and it makes sense for URI
http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WAI-WEBCONTENT-19990505/
but why also have the "Latest Version" link?
http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/

O.K., at IBM we call them "1.0.1", or something to signify a minor
non-content, fixes only, typographical types changes. Are not Errata pages
mostly these?  HTML 4.01 seemed more than incorporation of errata pages as
explained in the "Status of this document" section in the front matter.
But there was a "revised edition" of HTML 40 published on 24 April
http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-html40-19980424/

So couldn't we at some point before WCAG 2.0, published a revised edition
WCAG 1.0?  It's been a year since 5 May 1999.

Issues and new content would be incorporated into new versions like "2.0".
Seems like [5] covers most of this.

"problems" that are minor non-content, fixes only, typographical types
changes as determined by the editors and review by the working group should
NOT require an AC review.  Significant "fixes" which included
re-arrangement. new content, and resolution of content issues should be
reviewed by the AC and the document given a new version number, at least
X.X+1
