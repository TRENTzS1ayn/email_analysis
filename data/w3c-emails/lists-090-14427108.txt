Hello,
Under the working groups priority 1 checkpoints, it states that you must
provide a text equivalent page for pages with frames (checkpoint 1.1).
Checkpoint 12.1 states that you must title each frame.  I was wondering
if this means that you must do both, checkpoint 1.1 and 12.1.  It seems
redundant to title frames and then also create a text equivalent page.
Thanks
