Dear Potential Partner

I would like to take this opportunity to inform you about your possibility of 
having a partnership with one of the UK largest recruitment websites, with the 
ability to add
extra content plus earning a very nice revenue stream.  

We are currently identifying potential partners that we believe portray the same 
levels quality and service as we ourselves do through an online medium.

I would like to take this opportunity to inform you of the latest revenue share 
offered by Rexonline Plc within our Career Channel Partner Program.

The benefits to becoming a Career Channel Partner with Rexonline Plc are:

* Longer visitor times
* Increased visitor numbers through word of mouth referral
* Added service for your visitors
* Rapid implementation of technology
* Only one branded link to be added to the front page to implement
* A Content that is supported and maintained at no cost to yourselves

Does not effect your company's existing technology or bandwidth
Is constantly updated with new vacancies and content

Along with the above benefits here are the revenue steams that your company
can earn from:


Channel Partner Revenue Share

25% of Revenue from any successful leads passed from your site through to
Rexonline Plc. This typically works out to approximately ?200 - ?500 per
client.

This method of Revenue Share requires no resources by the partner.

Reseller Partner Revenue Share

50% of Revenue from any new clients signed by the partner.

By becoming a reseller partner within the Career Channel your own in-house resources 
can sell and support the service to your clients while enjoying the audience 
of an entire Career Channel network.

I shall call in the near future to discuss how we can progress with this project 
with your company. If in the interim period there is anything I can assist with 
please contact me on the numbers below.

Kind Regards
