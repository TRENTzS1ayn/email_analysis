Hello, my name is Greg McNeil and  I am the founder and President of the ASP-Directory.  I would like to take this opportunity to introduce you to our new directory service dedicated to the Application Service Provider community.  Our goal is to provide a comprehensive resource to connect Application Service Providers with the markets they serve. 
 
If you haven't already done so, we would like to invite you to list your site in our directory at http://applicationserviceproviders.com/cgi-bin/search/add_url.cgi 
 
We have also developed a special charter member program for the first 25 companies who become ASP-Directory advertisers. The charter member program features:
 
  A 25% discount on all ASP-Directory ad campaigns for 1 year 
  Password protected, real time charter member reporting   
  Custom targeted ad campaigns 
  The option to include your articles in the monthly ASP-Directory newsletter for free.  

For more information on advertising with ASP-Directory.com, please visit http://applicationserviceproviders.com/search/advertise.shtml
 
We hope that you will find ASP-Directory to be a valuable resource.
 
Sincerely,
 
Greg McNeil
President
ASP-Directory
