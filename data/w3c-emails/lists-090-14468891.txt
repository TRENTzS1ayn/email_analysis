The Free Streaming Quote Solution!

You know that surfers either enjoy your website or they enjoy your competitors.  And you have over 100 million websites competing for the eyes of your customer. Some of that 'traffic leak'(i.e. people leaving your site to search) you can't avoid, however, some traffic is salvagable, LET ME EXPLAIN.  Most quote systems available now take your surfer from your site to theirs(or at least a window so they can generate ad revenue at your expense).  With Alphatrade.com you become the quote (content) provider.  We also have Java applets(charts,portfolio,ticker,most actives etc.) that float above your website so your surfers can watch the markets while feasting on your content.  We also fully customize all of our applications so your customers are constantly aware of your name.
 
What if you don't have or want Quotes on your site?
With over 20 million online investors, how can you NOT provide quotes?  Online business is about traffic and with Alphatrade.com you become a very useful service for those 20 million+ people.

What are the benefits to you?

  a.. Provide streaming stock quotes to your users(no refresh or 'go') 
  b.. Users will visit more often and stay for longer(about 8 hours- as long as the market is open)
