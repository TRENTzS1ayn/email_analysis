RE: http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG1-Conformance

Hello,

  I'm developing a site that I am trying to develop using W3C's Guidelines.
I plan on using the appropriate logo when the site goes live (A,AA, or AAA).
I am grateful for the W3C's wonderful work in this area. Your site states
that you expect that use of these logos on conformant sites will help raise
awareness of accessibility issues. I hope it does!

  I like the logos, they are unobtrusive and attractive. I worry that they
do not mean much to the average Web user who does not know the W3C or is
familiar with the terms WCAG 1.0, WAI-A, etc. I do really like the logo at
the top of the above referenced web page. It is striking and sharp. Are
there any plans to make logos that state a particular site supports the W3C
Web Accessibility Initiative? There is an example markup for using the logo
given on the site, but it does not offer any suggestions for descriptive
text for the sighted!!

  I don't think the logos given, when placed alone on a web page, would
motivate any but the most curious of viewers to click on them.

  I don't mean to sound negative! Thanks for all the good work!

 Brian Richwine
