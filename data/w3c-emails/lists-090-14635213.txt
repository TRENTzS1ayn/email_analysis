Dear Mr. Editor,


Please let me know how do use DHTML and CSS in Netscape browser.
(What is DOM model that Netscape supports)
and to what extent does it support.
Any site or example will do.
There seems to be a lot of inconsistency between IE and Netscape in implementing DHTML and CSS.


Thanks,

Regards


manoj
