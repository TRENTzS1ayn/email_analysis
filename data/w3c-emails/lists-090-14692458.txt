In my opinion,
http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/checkpoint-list.html
violates 
13.1 Clearly identify the target of each link. [Priority 2] Link text should be meaningful enough to make sense when read out of context -- either on its own or as part of a sequence of links. Link text should also be terse. For example, in HTML, write "Information about version 4.3" instead of "click here". In addition to clear link text, content developers may further clarify the target of a link with an informative link title (e.g., in HTML, the "title" attribute).

     Specifically, when I tab from link to link, all I hear is the checkpoint number, clearly meaningless if you don't happen to already know what topic that checkpoint addresses.
Further, I would like to see this moved to a priority 1, since what good is information if you cannot determine its meaning because the information is out of context?
thank you for your attention to this critical point.
Steve
