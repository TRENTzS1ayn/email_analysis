Link text should also be terse. For example, in HTML, write "Information about version 4.3" instead of "click here". In addition to clear link text, content developers may further clarify the target of a link with an informative link title (e.g., in HTML, the "title" attribute).

I disagree. It was a conscious choice to not repeat the word
"Checkpoint" in every link text.
That's because once you hit the checkpoints, the links are *all*
checkpoints. Thus, it
suffices to hear the number to distinguish one link from another.
Repeating the word
"checkpoint" 70 times seemed like overkill.

The reason this is not priority 1 is that access to the information is
not impossible
if the link target is not clearly identified - you can still follow the
link to 
figure out whether the target is of interest. This is a burden, thus
easily meriting
priority 2 level, but the resource is still available even in the face
of bad link text.
