I almost agree. The same reasoning applies to using color for meaning:
great, as long as you also convey the meaning through other means.

However, for the case you site, no specification ensures that users
can override the font. Browsers may do this, but the HTML spec does
not require or guarantee this. CSS describes an override mechanism,
hence the promotion of CSS.

Note that I have no objection to the above HTML in addition to CSS,
since CSS suggestions (though sadly does not require) that CSS-enabled
user agents make CSS style higher precedence in the cascade than
markup language style.

There are other reasons (not related to accessibilty) to avoid FONT and
to use STYLE or external style sheets instead, such as page/site
management.
