The guidelines state

               1.2 Provide redundant text links for each active region of a 
server-side image map. [Priority 1]

An image can simultaneously be a server side and client side map.  This 
used to be done for compatibility with browsers that didn't support client 
side maps.  When there is an client side image map, and area tags are 
appropriately ALT text-ed, there's no need for text links... or to be more 
precise, no more than what's needed when there's a client side map, which 
is a priority 3.

(Actually, there's the further question of whether redundant links for 
client side maps should be priority 2 or 3... depending on how much we 
accommodate older browser screenreader combinations... but I'm omitting 
that here.)
