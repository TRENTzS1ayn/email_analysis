Hello,

As you observed, there is inconsistency between the implementations of
CSS and the DOM between the two browsers you mention. For information
about what they support, I recommend that you contact the browser
manufacturers. You might also look into:

Webreview.com

The HTML Compendium

Some information about DOM support:

I hope this helps,

 - Ian
