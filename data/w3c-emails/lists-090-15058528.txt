First let me introduce myself, My name is Lisa Seeman and I have been 
working on a comprehensive neurological model of the different subgroups of 
dyslexia, and the implications for early intervention. I have been running 
the IID internet program for early intervention of dyslexia and web tools.

From this I have looked into your wonderful web accessible initiative. As I 
was asked to write an article for The WDVL, and I am writing it on making 
web sites accessible, based on your guidelines.I was wondering if someone 
would like to review it before it is published.

I am also, independently, started a new site called special-needs.net, where 
I am compiling a directory of disability accessible sites.
I noticed that there is not currently a validation tool for all the 
guidelines mentioned. Would you like me to build one. I have an engineering 
degree and have made many different web tools for learning disabilities. I 
have also been Head of R&D,  Project Manager,  Head of Engineering, and all 
these good jobs before I saw the light and started working on special needs 
projects.

Thanks for your time,
Lisa Seeman
