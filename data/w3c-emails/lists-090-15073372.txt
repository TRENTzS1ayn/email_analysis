Consider joining our online course on "Information Design".  Information design is the study of how information can be organized and presented so that it can be easily accessed and understood. Information design is becoming an increasingly important discipline because information is so central to modern business and society. Effective information design is essential for managing and communicating information effectively. Information design merges the fields of graphic design, interface design, media studies, linguistics, cartography, psychology, perception, and other fields. 

This course examines the fundamentals of information design, as well as different theories relating to information communication. Topics will include: types of information (verbal, visual, metaphoric, narrative, etc.); information design strategies; information classification; graphic design; scientific visualization; the design of instructions; information design in media and advertising; and information design in the entertainment industry.
