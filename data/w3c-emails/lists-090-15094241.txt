Hi,

I am writing you because I think there is great synergy between our companies
and I would like to see if we can form a strategic partnership that would
be mutually beneficial to both companies.

We offer professionally hosted services for webmasters to fortune 1000
companies.  Our services include web based email, chat, discussion boards,
search and ad sales solutions.  Our hosted portal services are free, and
we give the partner 50% of all banner ad inventory.  We currently have
over 2 million users, and we have several ways that we can help your site,
plus we get about 70-80 million page views per month.

To start I propose that we exchange links/buttons and more integration
if possible.  
Please let me know if you are interested in a strategic partnership. 
How many visitors are you getting a month?  How many are new unique visitors?

Take a look at www.everyone.net to see what we are all about.  I think
your clients might like to find out what we do, and I know our site partners
would find your site useful.

Have a great day!
