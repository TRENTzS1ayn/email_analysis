ScreamingMedia launches UK digital content

ScreamingMedia, the leading global technology platform for the 
aggregation and distribution of digital content over the 
Internet, is now operating in the United Kingdom.  We deliver 
fresh, exciting content to your site, integrated with your 
design.  Give your visitors a reason to return for more by 
creating custom filters against our content network. Your site 
gets only what is most relevant, and always in real time

ScreamingMedia aggregates millions of news articles, features 
and photos and video feeds each month.  Propriety "harvesting" 
and filtering technology sifts through the content in real time 
to find articles, photos and video, relevant to your audience.  
By using our "Editor?s Desk," you can choose and select the 
exact stories to be published on the site.
