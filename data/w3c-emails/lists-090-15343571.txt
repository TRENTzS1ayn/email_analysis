What is the W3Cs recommendation if a user comes across a W3C conformance
logo on a page that is false?
What involvement does the W3C have in assuring that its logos are used
properly?

Thank you for your time. I would appreciate knowing what users can do to
limit false statements of accessibility.
Sincerely,
Tara Williams
