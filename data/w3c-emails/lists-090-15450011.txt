I am trying to write up some guidelines for others in my company to follow in
order to meet priority 1 guidelines for accesibility, but I do not understand
one of them.

It is 4.1, "clearly identify changes in the natural language of a document's
text and any text equivalents."

Can you shed any light on what is meant here?

Thanks.
