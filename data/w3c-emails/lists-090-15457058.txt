Hi Mary,

Suppose you include some text in another language in your HTML
document. You should indicate this with "lang":

<P>This paragraph is in English <span lang="fr">sauf pour
ce texte qui est en fran?ais</span>. And the rest is in English...</P>

You should also indicate whether any captions, or text transcripts,
or alt text is in a language other than the primary language of the
document.

I hope this helps,

 - Ian
