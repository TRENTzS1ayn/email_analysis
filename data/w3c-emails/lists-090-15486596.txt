Hello Phil,

I don't believe that NN 4.* supports the 'position' property. I think
that
NN 6 will (but I'm not sure about that). 

I think MSIE 5 does support 'position'. Your code was:

  OBJECT { position:fixed; left: 0; bottom: 0; width: 25%; height: 75% } 

You are right that with 'position: fixed', the references should be
the viewport edges. So it would seem that IE 5 doesn't support 'fixed',
and treats it like absolute instead.

In short, I think it's a little too soon to start using CSS to replace
frames. You may also find other solutions to your design needs than
frames
(i.e., do you really need frames?).
