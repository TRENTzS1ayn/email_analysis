Dear Sir/Madam,

I have a question about the W3C WCAG conformance logo. I consider
accessibility issues to be very important, and want my webpage to be
readable by text-readers and so on. I think that the best way to do this is
to create a text-only version of the site, without the use of images,
tables, CSS or any presentational markup.

However - if I create a text-only mirror of my website, am I entitled to
display a WCAG conformance logo on the front page of my graphical website?
That is, the logo would indicate that a fully-conforming version of the
webpage is available, and I would state explicitly that it is the text-only
version of the page that conforms to the guidelines. Do you think that this
would be acceptable?

Many thanks,

Yours,

Chris Gibson.
