Chris,

Checkpoint 11.4 of the 5 May 1999 Guidelines reads:


     11.4 If, after best efforts, you cannot create an accessible
     page, provide a link to an alternative page that uses W3C 
     technologies, is accessible, has equivalent information (or
     functionality), and is updated as often as the inaccessible 
     (original) page. [Priority 1] 

This means at least two things related to your question:

1) Where possible, you should try to create one accessible
   page rather than two pages that in tandem are accessible.
   In particular, a text-only page does not accomplish
   some of the goals of accessibility (since accessibility
   is not just about content reaching peoples ears, eyes,
   or fingers, but also orientation, navigation, clarity,
   etc.)

2) You may use a conformance logo on one page if that page
   in tandem with other pages produces an accessible result.
   And, you should say near the logo how to find the
   complement that ensures accessibility.

Thanks for asking!

 _ Ian
