[...]
| 8 Text formatting and position
|
|    Checkpoints in this section: 3.3 Use style sheets to control layout
|    and presentation. [Priority 2] .
|
|    The following CSS2 properties can be used to control the formatting
|    and position of text:
[...]
|      * The :first-letter and :first-line pseudo-elements allow authors to
|        refer to the first letter or line of a paragraph of text.
|
|    The following example shows how to use style sheets to create a
|    drop-cap effect.
|
|    Example.
|
| <HEAD>
| <TITLE>Drop caps</TITLE>
| <STYLE type="text/css">
|       .dropcap { font-size : 120%; font-family : Helvetica }
| </STYLE>
| </HEAD>
| <BODY>
| <P><SPAN class="dropcap">O</SPAN>nce upon a time...
| </BODY>

This is not an example how to use style sheets to create a drop-cap effect.
This should be marked as a deprecated example (and therefore omitted
completly). One could have used <font> to create the same effect.

Is this another erratum or does it make any sense I can't see? Especially,
with this note:

|    Note. As of the writing of this document, the CSS pseudo-element
|    ':first-letter', which allows content developers to refer to the first
|    letter of a chunk of text, is not widely supported.

Only an example like

<head>
<title>Drop caps</title>
<style type="text/css"><!--
  p:first-letter {
    font-size: 120%;
    font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;
  }
--></style>
</head>
<body>
<p>Once upon a time...</p>
</body>

makes sense to me.

Btw, the original example violates technique 1 in chapter 5, it does not
specify a generic font-family.
