It would help my project if the subject 
http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG1-Conformance.html site were to include a brief 
restatement of the criteria for each of the conformance levels without 
going back to  the mother document. At the very least there should be a 
link to an anchor within an appropriate document where the criteria are 
discussed.
