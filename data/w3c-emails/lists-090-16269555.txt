Have been reading philosophy, economics, leadership theory and many other things for years and finally someone hits the bullseye.  Modern thinking is narrowminded 
and can not see the forrest because all the threes are in the way.  Perhaps even their own egoes block the view? 
This was like balm for the spirit. 
Thank you!
