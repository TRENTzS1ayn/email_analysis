ATTENTION HOMEOWNERS!

HERE'S WHAT THE BANK FORGOT TO TELL
YOU ABOUT YOUR 30 YEAR MORTGAGE:

*     That you will pay as much as 2-1/2 times the 
       amount you originally borrowed just in interest alone!

*      That it will take nearly 24years to reduce your mortgage
        to 1/2 the amount you originally borrowed.

*      Why? because an average of only 10% or less of your 
        mortgage payments are being appied to principal the
        first 15 years!

         THE SOLUTION:
THE MORTGAGE SAVINGS PROGRAM WILL....

*       SAVE  you tens of thousands of dollars!

*       REDUCE the term of your mortgage by 9-12 years!

*       BUILD equity in your home 300% faster!

*       INCREASE your net worth!

*       SMPLIFY paying your mortgage each month!

*       ALL WITHOUT INCREASING YOUR MONTHLY PAYMENT!

    THIS IS NOT A SECOND MORTGAGE OR REFINANCING PROGRAM!!>
