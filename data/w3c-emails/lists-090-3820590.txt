Catherine,

I had a similar problem whilst implementing a group of radio buttons. After looking at the page mentioned in the posting by Al (http://www.tracecenter.org/search/ ) I noticed that Jaws seems to read the text from within the closest preceding <p> tag. I have tried this in conjunction with the label tags on the radio group that had caused me problems and it seemed to fix it.
