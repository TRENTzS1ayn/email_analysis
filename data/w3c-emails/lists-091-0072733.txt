 Identity thieves collect billions of dollars each year by illegally assuming their victims' identities. 
 More than 300,000 people are defrauded each year. 


According to information compiled by the American Bankers Association (ABA):  Instances of fraud for MasterCard and Visa increased 11% in 1995, 19% in 1994 and 4% in 1993. 
 Banks nationwide lost $400,000 million on 600,000 accounts during the first half of 1996 due to fraud.
 

The ABA's 1996 Bank Card Industry Survey Report indicated:
 In 1995, gross fraud charge-offs for MasterCard and Visa credit and debit cards reached a high of $790 million, with total outstanding balances of $321 billion.
