Hi,

I don't know you can handle these questions or not, if you think I send
to wrong person please accept my apology.

Can you help to point out which page has the information about finding
the consultants we can hire to verify our web site has the requirements.

I need to have the information about:

1.What is the cost ?
2.How can I contact them?
3.How many choices I have?
4.Where is the information ?

Thanks!
Sue
