Dear Sir or Madam:

My name is Satomi Iizuka, a fourth-year student majoring 
agricultural economics at Chiba University in Japan. 

I appreciate it very, very much if you kindly read the following
question and send back your answer to me.  The purpose of this
survey is to collect information for my thesis (Bachelor of 
Agriculture). You may give me your answer by just returning 
this mail.

Needless to say, any answer/information that you give me will
never be used in other purposes except for my thesis, and even 
in my thesis it will be used only in some aggregate forms, such 
as summations, means, etc., and never in the form of individual   
data. I should also mention that I obtained your e-mail address 
through using a software MailRipperLE that collects address from 
open-access homepage.

Deep appreciation for your kind cooperation.

voting question. 


NATURE AND DEVELOPMENT: HOW DO YOU THINK?

[A World Heritage Site: YAKUSHIMA]
Yakusihima-island, the total area of about 500km2, is situated in 
the southern part of Japan. 
Having various climatic zones from subtropical to temperate, this 
island is endowed with a numbers of flora and fauna species, 
including some Yakushima -island-specific speicies, in its forests
ranging from mangrove to cedar.  The world famous Jomon-sugi, the 
cedar tree of 3000 years old, is in its cedar forest.  The Jomon-
sugi and the surrounding area were designated as a world heritage 
in 1993. 

Every year, many people visit this island attracted by the Jomon-
sugi and other nature's gifts in the world heritage site.  However,
it is difficult for children and elder people to get access to the
Jomon-sugi, because it is situated in a deep forest.

 <SCENARIO>
Let us suppose that we construct a road to get easy access to the
Jomon-sugi. 
Further suppose that the at most care to preserve the environment 
will be taken in the road construction project.  There is however 
some possibility that this road construction project may destroy 
the ecosystem in the heritage site as well as the island as a whole,
resulting in the total extinction of a certain island-specific 
species of flora or fauna.  More visitors may end up with more 
garbage, more water pollution, and the general degradation of the 
rich natural environment, which may eventually endanger the world
heritage site itself. 

On the other hand, however, the road construction may open more
opportunities for children and elders to expose themselves to the
precious natural resources.  More visitors would also mean more 
revenues to the local economy of Yakushima-island, which has been
suffering from de-population and declining economy.
