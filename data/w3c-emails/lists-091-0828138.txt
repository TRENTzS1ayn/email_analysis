Greetings Wendy and Ian.

I caught a minor WCAG 1.0 errata.

Checkpoint 8.1 is missing a period, and period may be misplaced.

8.1  Make programmatic elements such as scripts and applets directly
accessible or compatible with assistive technologies [Priority 1 if
functionality is important and not presented elsewhere, otherwise Priority
2.] 
should be:

8.1  Make programmatic elements such as scripts and applets directly
accessible or compatible with assistive technologies.  [Priority 1 if
functionality is important and not presented elsewhere, otherwise Priority
2].
The only other "conditional priority" checkpoint I noticed was 2.2 and this
is the syntax it used.  Personally, I think the last period should be INSIDE
the closing bracket (for both checkpoints), but I am no grammatician.

So, when is WCAG 1.01 coming out?

Cheers,
Bruce
