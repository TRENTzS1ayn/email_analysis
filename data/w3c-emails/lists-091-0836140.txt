(A mind Blowing Opportunity) ( Please Read On, Don't Delete This )
I felt compelled to share this with anyone interested in
spending more time with their families, instead of at work.
It's an interesting story - Read it all & see what I mean.
================================================================
"Parents of 15-year old find $71,000 cash hidden in his closet."
================================================================
Does this headline look familiar?
Of course it does. You most likely have seen this story recently
featured on a major nightly news program (USA).
This 15 year old's mother was cleaning and putting laundry away
when she came across a large brown paper bag that was
suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the
back of her 15-year-old son's closet. Nothing could have prepared
her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it
was full of cash. Five dollar bills, twenties, fifties and
hundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in labeled piles.
"My first thought was that he had robbed a bank", says the
41-year-old woman, "There was over $71,000 dollars in that
bag- that's more than my husband earns in a year".
The woman immediately called her husband at the car dealership
where he worked to tell him what she'd discovered. He came
home right away and they drove together to the boy's school
and picked him up. Little did they suspect that where the money
came from was more shocking than actually finding it in the
closet.
As it turns out, the boy had been sending out via E-mail on the
Internet a type of 'chain-letter' to E-mail addresses that he
got off of the Internet. Everyday after school for the past 2
months, he had been doing this right on his computer in his
bedroom.
"I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the heck, I
Sent five dollars to four people for the Reports, put my name on
it like the instructions said and I started sending it out", says
the clever 15-year-old. The Reports I received for my 20 dollars
were fantastic.
The E-mail letter listed 4 addresses and contained instructions
to send one $5 dollar bill to each of the 4 individuals. These
individuals would in turn e-mail me the 4 Reports. Put your name
and mailing info in the number one position, move the number
two person to position #3 Move the third person to the 4th
position. The letter goes on to state that you would receive
several thousand dollars in five dollar bills within 2 weeks if
you sent out the letter with your name in the number one position.
"I get junk E-mail all the time, and I really didn't think it was
gonna work", the boy continues.
Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail, the Post
Office Box that his parents had gotten him for his video-game
magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines,
but envelopes containing $5 dollar bills.
"About a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post office
and my box had 1 magazine and about 300 envelopes stuffed
in it. There was also a yellow slip that said I had to go up to
the [post office] counter- I thought I was in trouble or some-
thing (laughs)". He goes on, "I went up to the counter and
they had a whole box of more mail for me.
Over the next few weeks, the boy continued sending out the
E-mail. "The money just kept coming in and I just kept sorting
it and stashing it in the closet, I barely had time for my
homework". He had also been riding his bike to several of the
area's banks and exchanging the $5 bills for twenties, fifties
and hundreds. "I didn't want the banks to get suspicious so I
kept riding to different banks with like five thousand at a time
in my backpack. I would usually tell the lady at the bank counter
that my dad had sent me in [to exchange the money] and he was
outside waiting for me.
Surprisingly, the boy didn't have any reason to be afraid. The
reporting news team examined and investigated the so-called
'chain-letter' the boy was sending out and found that it wasn't a
chain-letter at all. In fact, it was completely legal according
to US Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18, Section 1302 and 1341,
or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code, also in the code of
federal regulations, Volume 16, Sections 255 and 436, which
state a product or service must be exchanged for money received.
Every five dollar bill that he received, he immediately sent out
the report requested. This Report made the letter legal because
he was exchanging a service (Sending a Report requested) for a
five dollar fee.
The Reports that you will receive and eventually send out, are
the power behind the program. They include insider tips and
techniques for cost effective promotion. These Reports are
very comprehensive and will allow you to build and promote
any business product or service on the internet.
You have just read the letter that the 15-year-old was sending
out by E-mail, you can do the exact same thing he was doing,
simply by following the instructions in this letter.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
There are two primary methods of building your downline:
METHOD # 1: SENDING BULK E-MAIL
Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it
goes, and we'll assume you and all those involved send out only
2,000 programs each. Let's also assume that the mailing receives
a 0.5% response. Using a good list the response could be much
better. Also, many people will send out hundreds of thousands
of programs instead of 2,000. But continuing with this example,
you send out only 2,000 programs. With a 0.5% response, that is
only 10 orders for REPORT # 1. Those 10 people respond by sending
out 2,000 programs each for a total of 20,000. Out of those 0.5%,
100 people respond and order REPORT # 2. Those 100 mail out 2,000
programs each for a total of 200,000. The 0.5% response to that
are 1,000 orders for REPORT # 3. Those 1,000 send out 2,000
programs each for a 2,000,000 total.
The 0.5% response to that are 10,000 orders for REPORT # 4.
That's 10,000 $5 bills for you. CASH!!! Your total income in this
example is $50 + $500 + $5,000 + $50,000 for a total of $55,550!
!! REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING 1,990 OUT OF THE 2,000 PEOPLE
YOU MAIL TO WILL DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AND TRASH THIS PROGRAM!
DARE TO THINK FOR A MOMENT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF EVERYONE, OR HALF
SENT OUT 100, 000 PROGRAMS INSTEAD OF 2,000. Believe me, many
people will do just that, and more! By the way, your cost to
participate in this is practically nothing. You obviously already
have an Internet connection and e-mail is FREE!!!
METHOD # 2 - PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
Advertising on the Internet is very, very inexpensive, and there
are HUNDREDS of FREE places to advertise. Let's say you decide to
start small just to see how well it works. Assume your goal is
to get ONLY 10 people to participate on your first level.
(Placing a lot of FREE ads on the Internet will EASILY get a
larger response.) Also assume that everyone else in YOUR
ORGANIZATION gets ONLY 10 downline members. Follow this example
to achieve the STAGGERING results below:
1st level--your 10 members with
$5.......................................$50
2nd level--10 members from those 10
($5 x 100)..................$500
3rd level--10 members from those 100
($5 x 1,000)...........$5,000
4th level--10 members from those 1,000
($5 x 10,000).....$50,000
THIS TOTALS ----------$55,550
REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING 1,990 OUT OF THE 2,000
PEOPLE YOU MAIL TO WILL DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AND TRASH
THIS PROGRAM! DARE TO THINK FOR A MOMENT WHAT WOULD
HAPPEN IF EVERYONE, OR HALF SENT OUT 100,000 PROGRAMS
INSTEAD OF 2,000. Believe me, many people will do just that, and more! By the
way, your cost to
participate in this is practically nothing. You obviously already have an
internet connection and e-mail is
FREE !!!
REPORT #2 will show you the best methods for bulk e-mailing, tell you where
to obtain free bulk e-mail
software and where to obtain e-mail lists.
THINK ABOUT IT! For every $5.00 you receive, all you must do is
e-mail them the report they ordered. THAT'S IT! ALWAYS PROVIDE
SAME-DAY SERVICE ON ALL ORDERS! This will guarantee that the
e-mail THEY send out with YOUR name and address on it will be
prompt because they can't advertise until they receive the report!
-------------
INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------
This method of raising capital REALLY WORKS 100% EVERY TIME. I am sure
that you could use up to $50,000 or more in the next 90 days.
Before you say "BULL... ", please read this program carefully. This is not a
chain letter, but a perfectly legal
money making opportunity. Basically, this is what you do: As with all
multi-level businesses, we build our
business by recruiting new partners and selling our products. Every state in
the USA allows you to recruit
new multi-level business partners, and we offer a product for EVERY dollar
sent.
YOUR ORDERS COME BY MAIL AND ARE FILLED BY E-MAIL, so you are
not involved in personal selling. You do it privately in your own home, store
or office.
This is the GREATEST Multi-Level Mail Order Marketing anywhere: This is what
you MUST do:
1. Order all 4 reports shown on the list below (you can't sell them if you
don't order them).
* For each report, send $5.00 CASH, the NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE
ORDERING, YOUR E-
MAIL AND ADDRESS, YOUR NAME & RETURN ADDRESS (in case of a problem) and to
the person whose
name appears on the list next to the report.
MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE IN CASE OF ANY MAIL
PROBLEMS!
* When you place your order, make sure you order each of the four reports.
You will need all four reports
so that you can save them on your computer and resell them.
* Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the four reports.
Save them on your computer so
they will be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will
order them from you.
2. IMPORTANT-- DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to
each report, or their
sequence on the list, in any way other than is instructed below in steps "a"
through "f" or you will lose out
on the majority of your profits. Once you understand the way this works,
you'll also see how it doesn't
work if you change it. Remember, this method has been tested, and if you
alter it, it will not work.
a. Look below for the listing of available reports.
b. After you've ordered the four reports, take this Advertisement and remove
the name and address under
REPORT #4. This person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting
their $50,000!
c. Move the name and address under REPORT #3 down to REPORT #4.
d. Move the name and address under REPORT #2 down to REPORT #3.
e. Move the name and address under REPORT #1 down to REPORT #2.
f. Insert your name/address in the REPORT #1 position.
Please make sure you copy every name and address ACCURATELY!
3. Take this entire letter, including the modified list of names, and save it
to your computer. Make NO
changes to the Instruction portion of this letter.
Your cost to participate in this is practically nothing (surely you can
afford $20). You obviously already
have an Internet Connection and e-mail is FREE!

How many thousands could you receive?
******* T E S T I M O N I A L S *******
This program does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY! Especially the rule
of not trying to place your
name in a different
position, it won't work and you'll lose a lot of potential income. I'm living
proof that it works. It really is a great
opportunity to make relatively easy money, with little cost to you. If you do
choose to participate, follow the
program exactly, and you'll be on your way to financial security.

My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody, and I live in Chicago, IL. I am a cost
accountant with a major U.S.
Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I received the program I
grumbled to Jody about receiving
"junk mail." I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the
population and percentages
involved. I "knew" it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed
intelligence and jumped in with both
feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old "I told you
so" on her when the thing didn't
work... well, the laugh was on me! Within two weeks she had received over 50
responses. Within 45 days
she had
received over $147,200 in $5 bills! I was shocked! I was sure that I had it
all figured and that it wouldn't
work. I AM a believer now. I have joined Jody in her "hobby." I did have
seven more years until retirement,
but I think of the "rat race" and it's not for me. We owe it all to MLM.

The main reason for this letter is to convince you that this system is
honest, lawful, extremely profitable,
and is a way to get a large amount of money in a short time. I was approached
several times before I
checked this out. I joined just to see what one could
expect in return for the minimal effort and money required. To my
astonishment, I received $36,470.00 in the
first 14 weeks, with money still coming in.
Charles Morris, Esq.
************************************************************
Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind to
participate in this plan. But
conservative that I am, I decided that the initial investment was so little
that there was just no way that I
wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back. Boy, was I
surprised when I found my medium-
size post office box crammed with orders! For awhile, it got so overloaded
that I had to start picking up my
mail at the window. I'll make more money this year than any 10 years of my
life before. The nice thing about
this deal is that it doesn't matter where people live. There simply isn't a
better investment with a faster
return.
Paige Willis, Des Moines, IA
************************************************************
I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I
shouldn't have given it a try. Of
course, I had no idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait
until I was e-mailed another
program, ....11 months passed then it came...I didn't delete this one!...I
made more than $41,000 on the first
try!!
Violet Wilson, Johnstown, PA
***********************************************************
This is my third time to participate in this plan. We have quit our jobs, and
will soon buy a home on the
beach and live off the interest on our money. The only way on earth that this
plan will work for you is if
you do it. For your sake, and for your family's sake don't pass up this
golden opportunity. Good luck and
happy spending!
