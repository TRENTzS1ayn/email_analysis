aloha - the following is a preliminary list of accesskeys for the mail
archive:

individual list archive level:
  1. skip front-matter/go directly to archive (accesskey: j, for 'jump')
where: appended to skip link
  2. search archive (accesskey: f, for 'find')
where: append to 'text' input field
  3. archives help (accesskey: h, for 'help')
where: appended to 'help' link - such a link should be on ALL pages/levels

"period" view (append to appropriate hyperlinks)
  1. messages sorted by date (accesskey: d, for 'date')
  2. messages sorted by thread (accesskey: t, for 'thread')
  3. messages sorted by subject (accesskey: s, for 'subject')
  4. messages sorted by author (accesskey: a, for 'author')
  5. mail action: mail a new topic (accesskey: n, for 'new')

individual message view (append to appropriate hyperlinks)
  1. messages sorted by date (accesskey: d, for 'date')
  2. messages sorted by thread (accesskey: t, for 'thread')
  3. messages sorted by subject (accesskey: s, for 'subject')
  4. messages sorted by author (accesskey: a, for 'author')
  5. mail action: mail a new topic (accesskey: n, for 'new')
  6. mail action: respond to this message (accesskey: r, for 'respond')

Notes:
1. consistency/persistence of accesskeys is critical to their being of any
utility to anyone - i tried to make the accesskeys as mnemonic (for english
speakers, anyway) as possible, without repeating/reusing a previously
defined accesskey for a different function; that explains why the accesskey
defined for the search form is f (for "find") while the accesskey for the
"skip front-matter/go directly to archives" hyperlink is defined as j (for
"jump")

2. all accesskeys should be documented in the "Archives Help" document,
which should not only contain instructions on how to use the mail archives,
but which should also be a repository where the accessibility features of
the archives are documented and explained
