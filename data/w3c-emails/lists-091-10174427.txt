There is a design constraint that wrappings added by the distribution service
be clearly recognizable as such.  

But I have a clear policy line in mind from participating in the list-managers
listserv and working on the infrastructure to serve the lynx
developer-and-user
community that says things like list-added footers can be done in a way which
is an appropriate part of the deal of the group use of the list
distribution as
group infrastructure.

It's not a random email message, it is a submission to a group discussion.  If
it comes back with pro-forma value added from the infrastructure, there is no
reason that shouldn't be part of the deal, the bylaws governing group
participation.

There is a strict rule about not corrupting or hiding the originator's
Message-ID: header, which Lyris fell afoul of.  But there are plenty of
legitimate ways to make value-added wrappings or annotations part of the
distributed package.
