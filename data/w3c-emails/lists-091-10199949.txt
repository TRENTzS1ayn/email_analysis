Charles and I played with this some time ago, with a particularly nasty
piece of text in SVG.

I tried using relative positions, to sort out the ordering of text
elementw within the page, i.e. using the xy positions to determine
the order of presentation. It didn't work particularly well for that
example. I was using xslt to obtain text elements, titles etc.

Charles, you did something different IIRC, which produced an improvement?
