[I have changed the subject line as I believe this is a somewhat different
question from what Charles was asking.]

** summary

If I recall correctly, what I took away from that exercise was that it is
preferrable to put the text in the XML in a reasonable reading order, and to
textref it into the layout from there.

While it is mathematically possible to re-assemble the reading order by
threading created in the markup, it is an inferior solution in that authoring
processes are unlikely to get it right.  The experience we have had with
TABINDEX in HTML is relevant and cautionary.  [Not a rule-out, but genuinely a
warning.]

** discussion

A linear discourse is not obvious from a graphical design.  Unless the author
thinks about how to couch their message as a narrative, you don't get a
narrative flow by assembling the pieces that appear in a graphical exposition
of an idea.  Fluent narrative has glue in it that the layout does without, for
one thing.

The XML format forces you to linearize the content somehow.  Best practice is
that text appear in this flow already in the right order, such that if you
filter the content for the text, the order of what passes the filter is the
correct reading order, without needing any rearrangement.
