Let me present a hypothetical example, to see if that makes my question 
clearer.

Suppose I use SVG for a bar chart. The bar chart will contain some text 
labeling values on the axes, at least. But the text alone will by no means 
communicate the information in the bar chart.

Would I attach a description to the entire bar chart? to the individual bars 
in the chart? if I describe the bars in the chart, should the top-level 
description duplicate the information about the values of the individual bars? 
or just indicate that this is a bar chart plotting X against Y?

It seems that I need to know something about the way this information will be 
presented to know how to author it properly.
