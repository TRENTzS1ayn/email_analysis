I think the linearized version includes all, but when the user is 
navigating through it he/she should be able to ask just the main components 
of the image and/or navigate down selected components one at a time.

With a good navigation capabilities of UA and an image with a good 
conceptual hierarchy it should be easy. Otherwise we probably need some 
metadata to tell which are the main component.

You mean, not linearize the rest? I think not. The user should be able to 
control how much information he/she wants. Sometimes the description of the 
whole might be enough e.g. when first seeing the image and later the user 
may want to go to the details after reading some more of the document text. 
Other times the user may want to look at the details of the image first to 
understand the whole.

I think it is the same problem as with the tables or layout: the authors 
should think how the information should be linearized and try to put the 
components in that order. If it is not possible because the image needs to 
be drawn in certain order, then I think we need some metadata.
