Part of what I wrestle with, in the bar graph example, is what to do
with the text that is part of the rendered visual representation. Should
that be included in the linearization? Unfortuneately, I think I get
different answers if the text is the labels on the bars (Australia,
New Zealand, etc.) or if the text is the caption for the table. I suspect
we don't want the former, by default, but we do want the latter.

And, of course, this all gets more complicated if the bar chart is just
one object in a larger SVG file.

The impression I'm getting, from this discussion, is that a user agent needs
to provide interactive navigation for such structures, that an author
should be prepared to have the user presented with only the top level
description, as well as having the user navigate the structure
dynamically, and that a full non-interactive linearization is likely to
be confusing.

Is this a fair summary?
