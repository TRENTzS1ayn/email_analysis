Sorry for the somewhat late reaction, I was pretty much off-line the past week.

My fundamental reaction might be a bit controversial: I do not really 
believe in a fully automatic linearization of and SVG content. The reason I 
picked up the earlier work of Daniel in http://www.w3.org/2001/svgRdf/ is 
exactly that: I think only an attached extra information in terms of 
metadata can give any tool the proper clues as for what to display and 
where and when. Do not take me wrong: what I wrote down in that note may 
very well be a load of rubbish as far as the explicit rdf statements are 
concerned, but I deeply believe in the direction itself.

To be more specific with an example: the rdf statements give you which 
<desc> item to use and in which content. It also tells you to extract pure 
textual information directly from the SVG content at the right place (if I 
have a labelled figure, it seems unnecessary to repeat the label itself as 
part of the metadata, ie, one can describe the figure itself and refer to 
the fact that a specific element is a label and a tool can then extract 
that portion of the SVG file).

It would be interesting to include these ideas in your examples...

Just my two pence's worth on a Sunday afternoon...
