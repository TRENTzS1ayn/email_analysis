Taking just the xml text extraction aspect of Al's discussion,
does the idea of a text stream make sense?

The n columns of text example that I played with could have n 'streams'
for the n columns.

this then provides a managable process whereby a stream could be 
presented to the user (it may be bullet points, an essay or anything
in between), with options to step on to the next one etc.

Stream sequencing is then managed by the document order if the idea
of 'reading order = document order' is followed.

That would leave the issue of when to introduce the title elements
or other non-text alts into the streams.
It does give a starting point though.
