One big issue here is that like CAD drawings,
the drawing order often reflects the order in which
things were added. I'm thinking of a graphical editor
such as the SVG editor from Jasc.

I can draw in visually all sorts of things, in any order
I want. Thats the order in which the SVG is 'seen' when
looked at in document order.
