AG::? Yes, yes, yes.

This is to my knowledge a very real problem and a non-trivial one.

What William just said of the UAAG [inadequate vendor representation] may not
be true of that document, but it is true of this venue.? This venue is not
qualified to take this issue to that level, where it must go to make
progress.?
This topic is as we speak the subject of some vendor interest in organizing a
work item, which is the subject of Member confidential conversations.? 

If you look to real CAD tools they have ways to let the user draw dumb
graphics
to start and evolve it into ontology matched to a world model.? Some of
them, I
think.

It's much simpler to pick and place and personalize.? Simpler in the sense of
winding up with a clean ontology in the end.? But that is less friendly to the
user, who wants to freehand their idea and then class substructures by
snarfing
reagions of the graphic canvas and have the tool pattern-match them agains the
grammar and library of the ontology.

This kind of interactive, semantic upgrading of drawings is not trivially
easy,
nor excusably hard.? It is a quote definite maybe unquote definitely worth
talking about.? But so far as I know it is not the stuff of public watercooler
discussions, if I understand the state or technical frontier of openness of
the
industry.
