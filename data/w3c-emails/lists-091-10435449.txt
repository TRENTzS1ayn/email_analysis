level: individual message view (append to appropriate hyperlinks)
what: actual message header (or, if not possible, archive-generated
pseudo-header)
accesskey: i, for "information"

yes, it is a mnemonic stretch, but if i can "jump" directly to the actual
message - after the actual message header - i might want/need to "jump" back
to what i skipped - important bits, such as "other recipients", if one is
using an email client that respects only the reply-to or sender field, and
which neither automatically includes all recipients nor asks whether it
should

2 things:

1. the "chunked" navigation described above is, only theoretical, as i don't
know of an implementation of accesskey appended to DIV - to test your
favorite browser, point it towards cynthia shelly's "demo of chunk
navigation":
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/tests/divs.html

2. while "h" for "header" is (to english-speakers and those forced to think
in english on a regular basis) more intuitive, it is already the proposed
"universal" accesskey 'h', which, no matter what level you are at in the
archives, points to the ersatz W3C mailing list help document, which should
live at:
