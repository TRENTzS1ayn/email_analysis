Fellow Americans:
 
Though most of us have been preoccupied with the events of the past week, USNetLoan.com would like to remind all homeowners (and prospective homeowners) that despite the unsettled markets, mortgage interest rates are still incredibly low right now.  In the recent past, in fact, there has not been a better time to purchase or refinance a home.  In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has again cut short-term rates and this may improve the already excellent rates we have seen.  If you've been thinking about: 

* Buying your dream home,
* Tapping the equity in your home,
* Financing home improvement projects, 
* Lowering your monthly mortgage payment, 
* Consolidating high-interest rate debt (credit cards, etc.), 
* Switching from an adjustable-rate to a low fixed-rate mortgage,

NOW IS THE TIME!  Contact us at 888-696-9600 to speak with a loan specialist, and to get the loan process underway with NO COST OR OBLIGATION.  We work with all credit grades, for both refinances and purchases, so call now or visit us at: http://www.usnetloan.com .  Also, don't forget to ask us about our reduced closing costs and easy pre-qualification.
