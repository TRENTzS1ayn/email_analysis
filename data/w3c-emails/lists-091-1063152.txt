IMPORTANT NOTICE:

Everything still on our shelves must go immediately. We are clearing out ALL gifts currently from our inventory to make room for our new online ceramic art supply e-business.

Now is an extraordinary time to buy gifts and collectibles from elfoutlet.com. We MUST clear our shelves. We soon will hire a team to list what is leftover on ebay for liquidation but not at these prices. Due to additional overhead we will have to sell higher on ebay so now is the time.

This is an extremely limited time offer!
