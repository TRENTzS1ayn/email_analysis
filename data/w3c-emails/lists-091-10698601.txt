For speech the optimum thing would be to have all these links present in the page but after the main content and in ascending order of breadth of scope, from inner to outer.  *But,* on one key condition:

On the one hand, all I remember is that TABINDEX is not something one can trust for anything that one has to count on.  This would suggest the answer is 'no.'

The problem with that answer is that I don't have a professional backup for the position.

The problems that I can recall were on the order of
- Netscape support for this feature -- is that now solid?
- People would assign TABINDEX values to a few things that they care about and not realize what would follow after, which turned out to be a mess.

BUT, in this case where what we want _is_ to resume in the textual order of the elements, it could work.

IF we are to use this it should be carefully user-tested.
