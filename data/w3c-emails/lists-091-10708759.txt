> 1. I would like to see David's hierarchical-theme navbar concept.  That probably stands between us and the next step.  Which I think of as having a whole list or at least a whole period working with multiple index pages and multiple messages cross-linked.

I've implemented a first navigation bar in the current proposal:

http://www.w3.org/2002/03/archives-improvements/ml-period
http://www.w3.org/2002/03/archives-improvements/ml-index

using tabindex to make the skip link the first one on the tabbing
navigation (mozilla unfortunately doesn't handle this well, since it
keeps using the complete tab order even after an anchor). David, Al,
what do you think?
 
> 2. I believe we still need to be able to make adjustments once we get the whole month or whole list preview of the design in place, and do some user testing in that state.  Things I am unsure of without some more user testing, and I think it would take a working model of the scale mentioned above to test:

I've spoken with Jose about this: he won't be able to patch the software
until next month. We have two solutions:
- wait and make the mock up as good as possible in the meantime, with
possibly first users feedback
- someone comes up with a way to quickly transform a current archive in
the new format with a perl script or an xslt, ...
