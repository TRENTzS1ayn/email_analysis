Dom,

This will be an excellent improvement.  A few further refinements:

1. In http://www.w3.org/2002/03/archives-improvements/ml-period
the line "Broader listings: [ more about this list ] [ more W3C mailing 
lists ] "
seems unnecessary now, unless I am misunderstanding it.  Actually, at the 
moment, the links for "[ more about this list ]" and "[ more W3C mailing 
lists ] " don't seem to go to sensible places.  In any case, my suggestion 
would be to omit this line and save a little vertical space.

2. In the spelling of the navigation bar,
"[ W3C Home ] [ Mailing list Archives ] [ Public Mailing lists ] [ 
wai-xtech@w3.org Index ]"
the word "lists" should be "Lists" and the second occurrence of the word 
"Mailing" can be omitted without any loss in clarity:
"[ W3C Home ] [ Mailing List Archives ] [ Public Lists ] [ wai-xtech@w3.org 
Index ]"

3. I notice that one of these has the W3C logo at the front of the 
navigation bar, and the others have "[ W3C Home ]" text instead.  They 
should be consistent.  I don't have strong feelings either way, but might 
suggest using a smaller version of the W3C logo.

Again, thanks for your efforts on this.
