I think we need to get real users with disabilities and screen readers and other users to try it.  But this fits with the next item.

Things I am unsure of without some more user testing, and I think it would take a working model of the scale mentioned above to test:

My main concern is that we reserve margin (some effort reserve) for fixing some things after we implement a larger scale prototype and expose it to more testers.

In the mean time I do think that this is now good enough we can take focused questions to selected second-round testers.  If you agree.  

One known problem to mention.  The phrase "Periods list" is not good enough.  It is too hard to recognize what this means when reading it the first time, for example by tabbing through the page.  The following are synonyms, but I have yet to coin the phrase that solidly wins on combined compactness and clarity

there are two things we want to convey, a noun and an adjective

  noun ~:: index | sub-archive | message collection
  adjective ~:: by month | by quarter | periodic | for different calendar periods 

I guess my favorite as of the moment would be

  indices by [ month | quarter ]

This is of course short for "message indices grouped by [ month | quarter ]" but that much elision we can probably get away with.
