This has a couple of very small errors that haven't yet been
raised:-

* There are quite a few links that are not surrounded by non-link
printable characters (mandated by WCAG 1.0 [1]). Since most of
these links are of the form "[link]", you can just change it so
that the hypertext does not include the square brackets.
* The natural language of the page is not given. In fact, if the
message is sent in other than English, an xml:lang attribute on
the preformatted section should reflect this.

As another feature request, it would be nice if the archives
would resolve Message IDs correctly so that we don't end up with
identifiers like "wp9f9e[...]@localhost".

Cheers,
