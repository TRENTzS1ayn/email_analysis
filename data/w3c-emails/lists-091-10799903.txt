This is very quick-and-dirty. Many thanks to Max Froumentin for help with
this, but it may not yet be accurate (which would be my fault). I will reply
to this thread and try to expand on my comments and correct any errors.

Chaals

1.1 Provide a mechanism to explicitly associate alternatives for content or
content fragments

  Yes, there is an annotate element. Checking if that can be applied to any
piece of MathML, and how rich it is.

1.2 Define flexible associations, where a given kind of relationship can link
to or from objects of varying types without constraint.

  Yes, annotateXML, annotate

1.3 to 2.6 yes

2.7 unsure...

2.8, 2.9 Yes

2.10 can be done with annotate or annotateXML element

3.1 No (be could be done for Voice defining Aster's presentation, and there
are specifications for how to render mathematics in braille)

3.2 nothing specific. But there is structured stuff that can be navigated.

3.3 can probably be done using linking actions to elements.

3.4 doesn't seem to be

3.5 n/a

4.1 not tested

4.2 points to a namespace, DTD, there will be a schema. namespace pointer not
machine readable

4.3 Yep

4.4 No (but coming)

4.5 No official one, but work is being done on it. There are tools that can
do this.

4.6 Document Accessibility Features of the Specification

  No

4.7 Include accessibility requirements in conformance requirements

  No. Conformance requirements at http://www.w3.org/Math/iandi/compliance
talk about processing requirements (and how much processing or not is
required) but nothing about accessibility.

4.8 Document techniques for WCAG, ATAG, UAAG

  No

4.9 Do not assume that element or attribute names provide any information
about element semantics

  Yes. The specification documents explicitly each element

4.10

  No
