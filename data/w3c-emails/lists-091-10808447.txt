Perhaps for 1.2 revert to the example of 
 <mediaExample>
   <imgObj>...
   <textObj> ...
   <audioObj> ...
 </mediaExample>

To demonstrate the 'flexibility' mentioned.

For 2.1 I tend to agree with Ian.

Plain text within <desc> element does it for me, and now I know its
useful / usable. Perhaps include two or more sentances?

Was 

In SVG, the desc element can be used to fully described a graphic, using
structured text from a different XML dialect for instance, and in the
graphics itself, the description text can be reused. 

Suggest:
In SVG, the desc element can be used to described a graphic object,
 using a plain text description. If structure is required, alternate
namespaces may be used.

Good question, not addressed by XAG.
Is it that scripting is out of scope or that we are deliberately ignoring it
or have not thought of it?
