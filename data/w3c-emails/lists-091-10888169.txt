Yep; I was thinking about applying the RDF solution more broadly, i.e. by
extending it to annotate other bits of style (why I chose this background
color: what it means, where I derived the style from, what date I updated
this particular rule, why this bit doesn't work in a particular browser,
etc.). In doing so, and because I'm a metahead and forgot to KIS (S!), I
forgot about just talking about a particular image being used as a
background. I guess that the "background-longdesc" property could easily
point off to some XML/RDF as much as it could point to some further HTML.

You'd have to run the majority of pages through Tidy before you could do
anything with XSLT, of course. I'm still not quite sure what Lisa (or you)
mean, to be quite honest. Most of the problems in NN4's display of HTML+CSS
is in the CSS engine's inability to do anything correctly. Changing the
HTML structure is not going to fix it, unless you take out all of the class
hooks or something.

I was thinking that she means "using the browser's built in h2 style for
all td.header selected elements", which would go beyond simple
pre-processing, in fact, requiring knowledge of the browser's built in
style sheet.
