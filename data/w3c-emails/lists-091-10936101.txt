Sent to xtech because it is a public list and talking about ideas based on a
public spec (the last call spec http://www.w3.org/TR/xptr-framework/ on which
comments are formally overdue - sorry)

A possible issue, more related to EARL, with the Xpointer spec...

It is mor reliable (given smart editors) to point to an ID than another kind
of reference. Perhaps we should suggest that an Xpointer SHOULD point to an
ID rather than another kind of pointer where possible. This could be checked
automatically by testing whether the element in question, so could be a
syntactically testable constraint.

What do people think?
