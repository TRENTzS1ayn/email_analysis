Charles, have you been looking at my new EARL[1] stuff, or are we just
thinking in parallel?

It is indeed possible for a tool to generate its own IDs for every
node in a DOM, and use these internally to reference them.  An EARL
tool can also export them, provided it makes available the IDs themselves
(as in my latest tool[1]) and/or machine-readable instructions for
reconsructing them as previously discussed ([2], etc).  The former
simplifies a document snapshot, whereas the latter is still
necessary if we want rubustness across document changes.
