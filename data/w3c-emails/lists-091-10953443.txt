Nothing parallel about it. I'm shamelessly following on from your ideas.

I'm looking at the simple case where an Xpointer constructed by counting
elements or something points to a thing with an ID already. (if the tool
constructs an ID it is not certain that other tools will have this available
to refer to without having an agreed way of assigning ID, and that gets
circular...)

IDs are normally the most robust things over changes. So an Xpointer tool
could check for an ID and ask if there was any reason not to use it...
