Hmm. The reason for having numbers is that some techniques are relevant for
more than one checkpoint. The idea is that if there is a list of techniques,
then maintaining a table which says that technique Txyz is relevant to
checkpoints {list} is the most helpful medium-term approach, and means that
the table allows the numbering of techniques (which can then have their own
URIs and grow from one line to being a whole page with examples and tests
without getting lost in a sea of broken links) to reamin the same -
references to T324 are always to the same technique regardless of changes to
the guidelines and checkpoints...
