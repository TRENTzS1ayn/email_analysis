Hi folks,

I recently spent some time thinking about automatically testing against XAG,
and how much it could be done. All these comments are based on the June 17
2002 editor's draft - http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/XML/xag-20020617

I propose to add all of these comments as techniques to the next draft,
unless people object to specific techniques.

I will send a series of mails so there are threads for each item.

Cheers

Chaals
