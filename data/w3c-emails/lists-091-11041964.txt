Shouldn't the ideal case be that individual media are recognisable?
<mediaObject>
  <text> Textual version </text>
  <image url=''/>
  <audio url=''/>
</mediaObject>

That sort of structure stops the scrabbling around trying to guess
which media is prime, alternate etc.

Which I think is similar, i.e. each media is recognisable?
