Hi folks,

I have updated the XAG issues
page - http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/XML/issues

There are 7 issues (the way I have listed them) and a category called
editorial (where I keep proposed changes that are more than spelling and
grammar corrections but do not (in my opinion) effect the requirements to
conform to the specification:

0. Editorial Issues
1. Definition of accessibility
2. Scope of applicability
3. Merge checkpoints 1.1 and 1.2 (June 2002 draft
4. What are "existing accessible modules"
5. Merge checkpoints 2.9 and 1.3
6. Merge checkpoints 1.3 and 4.2 (June 2002 draft)
7. Merge checkpoints 4.10 and 3.2

cheers

Chaals
