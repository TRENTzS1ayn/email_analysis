Hi Folks,

Emmanuelle Guti?rrez y Restrepo has published a translation of the Public
Working Draft (29 August 2001 - http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-xmlgl-20010829
version) in Spanish at http://www.sidar.org/traduc/w3c-xag-20010829/xages.htm

A comment that has already come from her translation is a small editorial
issue about checkpoint 4.9 Do not assume that element or attribute names
provide any information about element semantics.

it says in part

  An element named may have a fully contextualized meaning for the schema
  author, but is unlikely to mean much to a non-English speaker

We should be clear that this only makes sense if the element name is in
english - that if the element was called <ni?o> then it wouldn't make sense
in english even though it makes sense. I propose to fix that in the next
draft (and I hope that Emmanuelle will be able to provide a new translation
when we publish a new draft.

Cheers

Chaals
