Hi, Alan.

I see by the EASI archives that you are working with the formatting of
equations for accessibility.

Did you consider using the OBJECT element to insert the image and text into the
host document, and not an IMG element with its ALT attribute?

This should work enough the same in the browser at the moment but will
configure the content development infrastructure in a mode of operation where
format options that function at a higher level can be integrated as available.

There are consumers who are tooled up to process TeX or Nemeth, for example,
and there are authors who are tooled up to produce same.  By using OBJECT
instead of IMG we allow those folks to connect and do not reduce the best of
the web to the least common denominator.
