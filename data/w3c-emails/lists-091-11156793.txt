I agree with Ian.  Specs need to have information related to behavior,
especially for behavior that benefits accessibility.

I think for now it is important to encourage developers to implement
accesskey based on their interpretation of the HTML 4.01 spec.  Right now
there are two different interpretations of the HTML 4.01 spec in IE and
NS.  Hopefully these differences in behavior can be harmonized in a future
spec, hopefully through configuration.  I like the idea of the user having
control over final behavior.
