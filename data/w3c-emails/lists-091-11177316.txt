I went to "XML Accessibility Guidelines" at
http://www.w3.org/TR/xag.html
to learn about accessibility issues with graphics,
but I had "accessibility" issues with the document
as follows.

1.  Using Netscape 4.79, I clicked on the ToC entry for
      1. Ensure that authors can associate multiple media
         objects as alternatives
    and ended up at the top of the document.

    This is apparently because the document doesn't follow
    the XHTML compatibility guidelines for "maximum forward and
    backward compatibility" at http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#C_8
    and uses IDs only and not <a> tag's name attribute to
    indicate anchors, effectively making the links in the
    document unusable for Netscape 4.x browsers.

2.  When wanting to send a comment about this, I read the
    Status section to find out where to send comments.  In
    the paragraph where feedback is requested, there is no
    mailing address for feedback.  The following paragraph
    includes the non-sentence, parentheses-unbalanced fragment:

  Intermediate updates (publicly archived mailing list: wai-xtech@w3.org.

    I'm hoping that "wai-xtech@w3.org" is the correct address for comments.


By the way, I'm wondering if WAI has any suggestions on how an
XML application should allow for multiple alternative images
(e.g., a large and small version, versions with different
resolutions, b&w versus color versions).  Pointers to such
information, if such exists, would be appreciated.
