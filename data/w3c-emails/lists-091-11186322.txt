Yes, you decoded the typographically buggy comment address.
Thanks for the metacomments and the question.

On the question concerning multiple semi-equivalent resources:

[caveat 1] There is no precise WAI position.

On the other hand, one idea within the feasible range is that there should
be something that is a lot like html:object or smil:switch, except that the
fixed "take the first that works" behavior is relaxed a bit to assert

a) the author believes any of these will do the job

b) the User Agent should display at least one if there is one that
meets delivery context constraints.

c) in the absence of preferences from the user, the User Agent
should follow author preferences (formats may define ways to capture these,
as html:object and smil:switch have).  [Refinement of representation for
author preferences is in the domain of Device Independence research and
development, the only WAI concern is that it be interoperable with a
competent representation of delivery context constraints and preferences that
has a vocabulary rich enough to capture access-critical aspects.]

d) the User Agent may display more than one, or one other than the first 
feasible
choice, should this be appropriate from what the User Agent knows of the
delivery context opportunities and preferences.

In other words, there is a declarative assertion of a bag of
roughly-equivalent resources, an author's expected ordering of
preference for selection of one, and an understanding that some
other optimization to select one or more than one may be appropriate
in some circumstances.

So a select-first-match-from-list default structure with a permissive
escape to processing as the superclass select-multiple-from-bag is a rough
summary of the format structure.

[caveat 2]  I could have missed important points.  There is also active debate
but no consensus yet as to the property space to be used in negotiating the
binding of Web interactions to display and input final-form phenomena.
