One other point Paul.
The fairly common practice of showing the thumbnail inline,
with a larger image as effectively a pop up at the end of the link?
That's often found to be confusing for a blind reader, since there is
commonly no information what will happen, or that to continue reading
the pop up window should be closed.
Either don't use that technique, or indicate that a pop up window will
be created, and in that window, that it should be killed/closed to 
continue reading.
