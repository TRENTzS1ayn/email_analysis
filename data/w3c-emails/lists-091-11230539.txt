I like the sense of these comments Al;
Could we extract some of it for XAG?
My suggestions built on that are below.



In order to offer the user multiple images  where
 a) the author believes any of these will do the job
 
 b) the User Agent can display at least one if there is one that
 meets delivery context constraints.
 
 c) in the absence of preferences from the user, the User Agent
 should follow author preferences

 d) the User Agent may display more than one, or one other 
 than the first  feasible choice, should this be appropriate from what the
User Agent 
 knows of the  delivery context opportunities and preferences.
 

Each image should be provided with an appropriate textual alternative.
