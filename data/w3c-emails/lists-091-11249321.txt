I'll only echo Pauls comments; I found nothing relating to n images?
At least for him, we needed more. Perhaps a one liner at least, if
n images repeat n times? I still think that misses the point I made
re (admittedly UA related) sequencing and confusion instigatted by
authoring techniques.

Perhaps there is a 'not applicable' answer to him? At least when
relating cleanly to XML.

Paul would still need to extrapolate from that though?
