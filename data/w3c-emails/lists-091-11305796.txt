The Web Services Description Requirements document is in a Last Call review.

  Web Services Description Requirements
  http://www.w3.org/TR/ws-desc-reqs

An important companion document is the associated usage scenarios:

  Web Service Description Usage Scenarios
  http://www.w3.org/TR/ws-desc-usecases

It would be helpful if people can float their initial reactions here by 
2002-12-17
in order for some discussion before the Last Call closes on 2002-12-31.

Things to think about in this review:

Server side techniques and the ways that middleware can make or break the 
assistive
adaptation process for user interactions that are supported by multi-tier 
service
delivery chains.  How do these strategies depend upon the published 
descriptions of the services?  Are the associated requirements covered here?
