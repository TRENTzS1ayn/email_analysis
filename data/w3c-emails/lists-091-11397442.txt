Hi Oliver
   I'm a lurker on this list, but I do have an interest in definitions
of Web terms.
   My particular interest is in rigourous definition of terms associated
with usage statistics for Web sites.  For example what is a "page", what
is a "user", what is a "unique user", what is a "hit", what is a
"session", etc.  This is needed in particular by the advertising
community (which gets money based on hits, visitors, etc.) and the Web
auditing community (dot com companies saying that they get xxx visitors
per day are likely to be audited to ensure that these statements are
correct).
    Both of the sectors have their own definitions which have been
agreed by neutral consortia - however the definitions may not be
consistent (whioch won't be surpising - for example, one defines a
session as hits from the same "user" within 30 minutes but another
states that a session finishes when the "user" leaves the Web site).
Both of these communities will probably have a fairly pragnmatic
approach, and may not have considered the implications of emerging
standards (Xlink, ...).
    Would the QA group wish to address the rigourous standardisation of
such terms (I know the Web Characterisation acrtivity did some work in
this acrtivity but that was several years ago)? Or would it wish to take
a ligher weight approach, perhaps by referring to the definitions used
by these other groups?
    I think it would be useful if W3C did provide some information in
this area as many Web site owners have an interest in this area.
   Note that I have started to do some work in this area - work on usage
statistics for e-journals (some links available at
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/usage-processing/links) and would be
wiling to contribute some effort, if it was felt to be in scope.
