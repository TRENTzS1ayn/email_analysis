Good topic...

There are several uses of content in play.

One is "element content" in the strict XML sense - the stuff between an
opening tag and its closing tag, which may include elements (e.g. for the
content of an HTML head element it is required for validity to include a
title element)

Another is the information contained in an element, which will include
attribute values. I suggest we use the longer form "information contained in
an element"

Then there is the content of a document.

This includes information contained in elements, and may also include a more
abstract notion of "the information a document is conveying".

This is an important difference. It is not required at the moment that all
the information contained in all the elements of a document be in an
accessible form, although UAAG requires that a user can get any of the
information contained in any element of the document (by some means).

WCAG does require that "the information a document is conveying" is all
available in an accessible form.

For example, the following code fragment

  <object data="image" type="image/png">
    There is a very close correspondence between the average maximum daily
    temparature in Melbourne and how close the date is to mid-February.
  <object>

probably includes information in a purely graphical format, and information
in a purely textual format. Neither of these pieces of information is by
itself accessible, at least in terms of triple-A conformance to WCAG 1.0.
However the information being conveyed, by being available in two forms,
probably is.

I suggest we use four different terms:

"information provided by an element": The element content, and any additional
information referred to by attributes of an element. In HTML, this includes
such things as objects referred to by an object or img element, alternative
text included in an alt attribute, the information provided by title
attributes, and the text or information inside an element such as a p, a, or
code element.

"element content": The text or other elements contained between the opening
tag and the closing tag of an element in an XML or XML-like language.

"document content": All the text, elements and data contained in a document,
or referred to by elements contained in a document.

"information conveyed by a document": The essential content which the author
considers the document is conveying. This may duplicated in a document, for
example by having textual versions and references to graphic representations
in teh same document content.

  content:

  The code characters that occur between the start-tag and end-tag in a
  document instance are the element's content.
  They can be interpreted as data, proper subelements, included
  subelements, other markup, or a mixture of them. This character content
  can include text as well as images, text in raster images, image map
  regions, animations (e.g., animated GIFs), applets and programmatic
  objects, ascii art, scripts, images used as list bullets, spacers,
  graphical buttons, sounds (played with or without user interaction),
  stand-alone audio files, audio tracks of video, and video.

  NOTE: If an element has an explicit content reference, or its declared
  content is "EMPTY", the content is empty. In such cases, the application
  itself may generate data and process it as though it were content data.

  Content [ATAG10]
  In this specification, the term "content" is used in two ways:

  Content refers to the document object as a whole or in parts. Phrases
  such as "content type", "text content", and "language of content" refer
  to this usage. When used in this sense, the term content encompasses
  equivalent alternatives. Refer also to the definition of rendered
  content. and other accessibility information.
  Content refers to the content of an HTML or XML element, in the sense
  employed by the XML 1.0 specification ( XML, section 3.1): "The text
  between the start-tag and end-tag is called the element's content."
  Context should indicate that the term content is being used in this
  sense.

  Content-Wire.com Glossary:

  Aggregation (of online content)
  Online aggregation is the process of gathering and storing content from
  various sources, that it gets sorted and distributed according to rules,
  preferences or levels of service. Aggregation is based on a 'pull'
  dynamic, and it is generally the first process of a syndication routine,
  which is a 'push' dynamic.

  Content
  Raw information becomes content when it is given a useable form intended
  for one or more purposes. Increasingly, the value of content is based
  upon the combination of its primary useable form, along with its
  application, accessibility, usage, usefulness, brand recognition, and
  uniqueness. Information passed casually around in the world is not
  content. It becomes content when we grab it and try to make some use of
  it. (Content Watch) Also the emerging industry driven by monetization
  business models, that leverages the value of content and it is online
  exchange dynamics. (Content-wire)

  Content Delivery
  On the Internet, content delivery (aka content distribution or caching)
  is the process of copying the pages of a Web site to geographically
  dispersed servers and, when a page is requested, dynamically identifying
  and serving the page from the closest server to the user, enabling
  faster delivery. High-traffic Web site owners and Internet service
  providers (ISPs) hire the services of the company that provides content
  delivery. A common content delivery approach involves the placement of
  cache servers at major Internet access points around the world and the
  use of a special routing code that redirects a Web page request
  (technically, a Hypertext Transfer Protocol - HTTP - request) to the
  closest server. When the Web user clicks on a URL that is
  content-delivery enabled, the content delivery network re-routes that
  user's request away from the site's originating server to a cache server
  closer to the user. The cache server determines what content in the
  request exists in the cache, serves that content, and retrieves any
  non-cached content from the originating server. New content is also
  cached locally. Other than faster loading times, the process is
  generally transparent to the user, except that the URL served may be
  different than the one requested. Content delivery can also be used for
  specific high-traffic events such as live Web broadcasts by continually
  dispersing content from the originating server to other servers via
  satellite links. Content delivery is similar to but more selective and
  dynamic than the simple copying or mirroring of a Web site to one or
  several geographically dispersed servers. (Definition by Cdd/101,
  masters of content delivery knowledge)

  Content Management
  The concept of Content Management has evolved very rapidly towards the
  end of the last millennium. The very first definitions were not making a
  clear distinction between Document, Knowledge and Content Management,
  while evolutionary thinking establishes that the three disciplines above
  are connected but distinct. Content-wire glossary is temporarily
  adopting the definition proposed by Content-Bridge Alliance, until
  further elaboration is available: In its purest form, Content Management
  is simply a set of rules and processes for contributing, collaborating
  on and controlling content. It may include document management through
  common workflows, media management based on a centralized contentbase
  and common tools for content creation and publishing. In its broadest
  sense, Content Management is a combination of software tools and
  business processes that allow corporations to effectively manage and
  deliver large amounts of diverse information to different media in the
  most effective means.

  Original Content
  Unique work of the Mind. It is manifest in works of art, and in most
  expressions of the intellectual and creative human activities (when
  functioning properly). The manipulation and contextualization of known
  news and facts, once expressed in a unique form or manner, are also
  original content. Years of controversy surround the definition or
  'unique' and 'original', and require highly specialized legal technical
  skills to assess merit in matters of copyright and intellectual property
  law. Original Content is key to new economy business models.

  Mail References for "content":
  From:  Sean P.

  "Really, "Web Content" should be used to indicate any network
  retrievable "Web Resource" [2], but I think that WCAG uses it in the
  sense of "content suitable for use in a hypermedia environment", i.e.
  anything that can be handled by HTTP."

  From: Ian Jacobs

  UAAG 1.0 uses "content = document object".
