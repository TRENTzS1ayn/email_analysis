Here are the assumptions of UAAG 1.0:


In UAAG 1.0, we do talk about content "whose recognized role is 
to create a purely stylistic effect." The expectation is that
the user agent can recognize this role from the content. For 
example, from style sheets.

Our assumption is that style sheets should only be used to create 
stylistic effects. So a background image set by style sheets 
would not require a text equivalent (no more than it would be 
necessary to have a text equivalent "red" for a red background 
color). Style is, of course, "important". But if the author has 
used style sheets to set a background image that conveys 
important "information", it would seem to be a misuse of style 
sheets. Setting a background image through a style attribute of 
HTML is the same thing.

Authors may misuse markup. For UAAG 1.0, we must assume that they 
also use markup correctly in some cases.
