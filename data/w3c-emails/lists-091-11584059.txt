Here is a post 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2001JulSep/0900.html 
where I suggested a distinction which I felt would be
useful in terms of defining content.

Of all the definitions of content provided in your
original post, the following is the one that I
understand the most. 

Telecom Glossary
http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/projects/t1glossary2000/_content.html
content: In Web terminology, the text, media, and links
or information displayed by a browser at a particular
Web site. [Bahorsky]
