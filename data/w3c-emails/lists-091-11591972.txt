Hi
I noticed whilst looking at the WAI glossary that what
I call 'Interactive Content' is called 'Active Element'
in that glossary.
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/Glossary/Overview.html#A

I don't know if the glossary has a name and definition
for the content that is not 'Active Elements'. 
That is what I call 'Passive Content'.

Cheers
Graham
