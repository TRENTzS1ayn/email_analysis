In UAAG 1.0, we have "enabled", "disabled", and
"interactive" elements:

  - interactive: an element which may (by specification)
    be enabled in some user session. All other elements
    are called non-interactive.

  - enabled: an element in a given session that has
    behaviors that the user can interact with.

  - disabled: an element in a given session that was
    enabled but isn't at this moment.
