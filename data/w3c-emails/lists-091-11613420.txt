So here is a further twist. Are these necessarily elements in the XML sense,

  In UAAG 1.0, we have "enabled", "disabled", and
  "interactive" elements:

    - interactive: an element which may (by specification)
      be enabled in some user session. All other elements
      are called non-interactive.

    - enabled: an element in a given session that has
      behaviors that the user can interact with.

    - disabled: an element in a given session that was
      enabled but isn't at this moment.
