"An enabled element is a piece of content with associated behaviors 
that may be activated through the user interface or through an API. 
The set of elements that a user agent enables is generally derived 
from, but is not limited to, the set of interactive elements defined 
by implemented markup languages."

Then

"An interactive element is piece of content that, by specification, 
may have associated behaviors to be executed or carried out as a 
result of user or programmatic interaction."

We don't limit it to xml element definitions. It's whatever
the format and user agent agree to (as far as I can tell after
this cursory glance through the glossary).
