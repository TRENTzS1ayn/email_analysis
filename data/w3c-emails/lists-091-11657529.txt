I don't think Graham means text - there are various kinds of "inactive"
content.

Lots of text is inactive - no explicit associated behaviour. (well,
spell-checking it, running it against a dictionary, etc, but that depends on
a browser).

Images are often inactive. (Well, getting a longdesc, enlarging, but that
depnds on a browser...)

Audio? Does an explicit play request count as active? Even if it is only
provided as a control feature to conform with UAAG?

The major problem I have with the use of content is that there are two
completely different senses of the content of a document. In the inclusive
sense, there is "everything", or as a minimum some concept of the "default
rendered content". And there is a more restricted sense of "the information
being conveyed" - which means that if the default rendered content presents
the information to be conveyed in two or more ways, for redundancy, WCAG
should only require things of the information being conveyed, not each
rendered instance of it...

  Graham,

  I think if you mean "text" then we ought to say "text" or "text content" instead of "passive content."  As you said in your follow-up post, we already use "active elements" and "text."  Both of these are "content" in the UAAG 1.0 definition [1]:
  In this specification, the noun "content" is used in three ways:
  It is used to mean the document object as a whole or in parts.
  It is used to mean the content of an HTML or XML element, in the sense employed by the XML 1.0 specification ([XML], section 3.1): "The text between the start-tag and end-tag is called the element's content." Context should indicate that the term content is being used in this sense.
  It is used in the context of the phrases non-text content and text content.
  [1] http://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG10/glossary.html#def-content

  The UAAG definition of "Text content, non-text content, text element, non-text element, text equivalent non-text equivalent" is at:
  http://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG10/glossary.html#def-non-text-content

  a definition of rendered content is available at:
  http://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG10/glossary.html#def-rendered-content

  In general, I think we can use these definitions.  I mistakenly said these were from the ATAG document in my previous email. These are from UAAG.
