Does this mean that a group of Finnish users could not agree on using tags 
written in Finnish words with a-umlaut and o-umlaut?

What if some of them had cognitive problems in learning other languages? My 
understanding is that Finns with visual problems already often have tools 
that can pronounce Finnish so the main problem is for English speaking 
people wanting to read these Finnish tags?

Not that I'm totally against this but I don't think it is so 
straightforward from accessibility viewpoint unless your native tongue is 
English.
