No, no-one is proposing anything like that.  Where did you get that idea from?

In fact, I think the reverse is being suggested, that the naming rules 
for XML should encompass all characters that people write words with 
in any language.  

The issue is whether to let into XML 1.1 characters which no-one can
use in a word, and which at the current and medium term state of the art 
would not be renderable by accessibility tools. 

It is whether characters such as the white thumbs up should be allowed
into names using inside XML markup (and which would therefore
also appear in links, URLs, scripts, CSS, etc).  Currently these things
are not allowed in XML 1.0.
