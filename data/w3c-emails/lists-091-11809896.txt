CMN But not universally the case - there is some sentiment that certain "odd"
characters etc will be helpful.

CMN But that isn't a position the group has agreed on. A thumbs-up character
or a smiley face is readable to a lot more people than using a non-zero
integer or the keyword "true", although it does present problems that require
resolution. But the argument is that absolute restrictions on names in XML
1.1 will not be the best outcome for accessibility.
