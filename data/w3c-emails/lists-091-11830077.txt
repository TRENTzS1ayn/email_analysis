The way that I read this requires a little more context than what you quoted.

I don't read this as changing what Charles said earlier

I am fine with this.

But rather saying that _endorsing the Unicode restrictions on identifiers in
particular_ is not a position on which the group had agreed.

Then he gets a little over-broad in saying "the argument is" where he might
more precisely have said "an argument has been made ..." which
demonstrates that one cannot presume consensus support for the narrowing of
the comment to endorse the Unicode rules.

He is not trying to say there was a consensus position against any restriction,
if I understand what he means to say.
