In terms of the XML Accessibility Guidelines, we don't credit a DTD with
"specifying the USI speech interface behavior" as it is beyond the
expressive capability of the XML DTD language.  We would probably 
have stated this "we have an XML representation for a reference form
which implies the speech interface behavior.  The specification of the
behavior implications is keyed to a DTD for the XML representation."  See
for example (WORK IN PROGRESS):

http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/XML/

In other words the behavior specification depends on the natural language
stuff keyed to the things declared in the DTD.  A random totally-conforming
processor of XML DTDs would not know boo about speech or reproduce your
behavior without knowing your out-of-DTD-band connotations concering speech
behaviors.

Your thumbnail is already very helpful.  You don't mention how the
inter-DTD transform is coded, but that is a detail.

Our threshold is how much structure plus how much manual testing is necessary
to assure the automatically generated alternative morph is usable.
The auto-derivative doesn't have to be optimal; it has to be workable.

1. The problem is well known

 http://trace.wisc.edu/handouts/sc2000/middleware_and_eSCaped_web

.. or just Google for "escaped Web"

2. Your experience raises some hope that _if_ the *Voice* binding of a 
"controlled-appliance interaction logic specification" has been person-in-the-loop
tested for adequacy of labeling, that other morphs can be automatically extracted
and will be usable without requiring pre-qualification by user testing.

The optimization of the other morphs is at the discretion and budget of the developer.  They
can add options into the label resources as required, without breaking the capability to
generate something usable.  Just you can't kill off an option required to cover some
gap in the [across-delivery-context] usability of the remaining options as to labeling.

But up to this point we have been stuck with content which is captured into pre-optimized
visual structures which elide some of the voice-required micro-orientation (labeling). 

Lacking the right glue to insert when the persistent display scale shrinks leads 
one to provide inadequate orientation in peephole views.

If we start with a running-code review of the interface design in a delivery context
(voice) which is very demanding on continual re-orientation to context, we may be able 
to prune from there; where we couldn't just interpolate to fill the gaps in the under-
explained visual baseline.
