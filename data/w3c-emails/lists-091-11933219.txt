I've pointed the group in the direction of XAG.

As I said, to my knowledge this is the first time that XML authoring
has come up, made more complex by the voice side.
Since the target user group for the tool includes many disability groups,
it would be a nice test case.
One concern for visually impaired users is the mix of speech from
AT and speech from VoiceXML applications, i.e. How well will the two
applications play with each other.
