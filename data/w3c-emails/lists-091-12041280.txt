Hi, I would like to propose that we modify the problem statement in the
introduction. Broadly, I am adopting Ian's proposal of
http://www.w3.org/2002/04/25-xag to replace everything after the example code
although I have slightly adapted his proposed text. In particular I removed
the reference to ICADD - it is intersting but seems unnecessary here, and
lessened the explanation of device independence and machine semantics - again
I don't think they are necessary in describing the problem.

Proposed replacement text:

In this example, the problem is not that the author of this document didn't
put an alt attribute or textual equivalent attached to the photo element,
it's that the designer of the language didn't put the attribute or the proper
support in the language itself (that is, in the schema or the DTD). This
means that there is no reliable way for a user to find how an author tried to
explain a particular image in text form.

This document specifies requirements for XML languages to ensure that people
can create documents in a given XML language which are as accessible as
possible to people with disabilities, who use a variety of different
techniques and tools to access the Web.
