Hi,

I am trying to find out if it is possible for us to use the WAI logo on one
of our web pages.

We are developing a list of accessibility guidelines that include the WAI
guidelines, but also guidelines specifically from other organisations (such
as cast.org and various Dyslexia groups, etc.) We believe that web sites
should be usable by everone, and so we are then offering a service to our
customers to have their sites evaluated against this 'superset' of
guidelines. If all level 1 points are passed, then we are going to allow
those customers to place a 'Designed for Accessibility' logo on their site.
This logo will link back to a page on our site, explaining why accessibility
is so important, and explaining where the guidelines have come from.

Our concern is that designers may feel we have just made up our own
guidelines, and so we would like to explain that these guidelines have been
developed by groups such as WAI. Being able to add your logo and have it
link back to the WAI pages on the W3.org site would help to cement that
view.

Could you please let me know if you think this will be possible, and what
process we will need to go through to achieve this.

Thanks in advance for your help,

Gary
