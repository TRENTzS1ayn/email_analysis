  With the implication that applicability replace scope?

  Which implies that if an instance or class of document doesn't have
  a visual representation XAG is inapplicable?
CMN
No - there are checkpoints that don't apply and checkpoints that do - whether
something is oriented towards representation for a user or not isn't a
criteria for whether it should meet XAG as a whole, only for what it does
with regard to individual checkpoints.

  Issue: Anything not in the XSLT namespace is taken as literal content,
  so this is one occasion when namespaces don't work.
CMN I don't understand the issue. Can you please explain it a bit more?
