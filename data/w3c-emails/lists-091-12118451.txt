Yes, but not a wholehearted yes.

I was halfway happy with the data vs document classification,
then we moved on to 'not final form' documents.

For the examples given, my gut feel is:
SVG yes.
fo no (I view that in the same class as .obj files, i.e. temporary
files to be thrown away).
XHTML yes.
Mathml ... ambivalent.

Agreed for some classes of document.

I'll await the proposal.
