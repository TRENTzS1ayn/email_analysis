I am happy either way.

I put it in because we can't really guarantee accessibility, we can only make
it easier, and I would like that fact to be more obvious.

(the rest of my message can be safely ignored, e.g. by people who don't have
time to waste on idle thoughts).

In my opinion we have suffered a bit from people thinking that WCAG
guarantees accessibility, and then extrapolating the idea that level-A is a
good place to stop worrying too much. If we were stronger on the idea that
access is a continuum like usability or style, rather than a binary test we
might do better in convincing people to go as far as they can. (In my view
accessibility is part of the same continuum as usability, but some people
concentrate on usability for folks with disabilities who do things
differently as users)

I liked Joe Clark's quote of Dave Winer, as recorded in

  Delete 'as possible'.
