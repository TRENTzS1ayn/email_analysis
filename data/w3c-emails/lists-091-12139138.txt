Text from section 3 of UAAG 1.0 [1]:

"Note: Conformance to the requirements of this document is expected 
to be a strong indicator of accessibility, but it is neither a 
necessary nor sufficient condition for ensuring the accessibility of 
software. Some software may not conform to this document but still 
be accessible to some users with disabilities. Conversely, some 
software may conform to this document but still be inaccessible to 
some users with disabilities. Some requirements of this document may 
not benefit some users for some content, but the requirements are 
expected to benefit many users with disabilities, for general 
purpose content. For more information, please see the sections on 
known limitations of this document and restricted functionality and 
conformance."
