I'm in the process of starting a retail vending machine business. After 
much research I have decided to start with 5' Spiral Gumball Vending 
Machines and expand from there.  I have over 30 yrs marketing, sales and 
international trade experience. I have put together a very unique and one 
of a kind marketing plan to distribute them in the US and internationally. 
Also, I have put together a giant, aggressive domestic and international 
marketing and advertising budget and set the National Launch for this July.

I will sell between 100 and 150 a month. I'm looking for someone who can 
supply me that amount of machines and gumballs on a regular bases. 

If this is something you can do and would like to see my 44 page brochure, 
I would like you to contact me by mail or fax at: Larry Burdgick, Jolly 
Vending 7040 West Palmetto Park Road Suite 460, Boca Raton, Florida 33433 
Phone/Fax, (561) 395-5389

Thanks Larry

If you have anything you can offer for this type of business I would like 
to hear from you.
