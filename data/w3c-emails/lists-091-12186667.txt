Hi Katie,

We discussed these definitions a long time ago in the UAWG
and I think the WAI CG preferred that we not use them in
the WAI Guidelines. This was discussed by the WAI CG
in December 1999, and I believe that it was preferred
that we keep the WAI definitions.

You might want to get the WAI CG to re-issue their
opinion.
