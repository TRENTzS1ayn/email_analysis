I like the permissive approach. There are a couple of things I didn't want to
allow - control characters, and combining accent characters where they could
be normalised. In other words, it should be OK to have a "c-cedilla"
as a single character, but I wouldn't like to have c followed by a character
that adds a cedilla to the previous character, nor would I like to have a
line-feed character allowed.

I would also like to ensure that the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines
explicitly ensure that there is a way of presenting the required information
so the user can deal with it - I think that this is explicitly covered by
checkpoint 7.3 [1], with implicit support from 7.1 [2] and 7.2 [3]

  My reaction to this is that:

    a) Allow anything
    b) Suggest restraint and provide the authoring, I18N, and
       accessibility reasons.
    c) Don't require a schema for every XML usage.

  I would like few rules and lots of persuasive rationale.
