This question comes from Astrid Callista, and I am forwarding it with
permission:


  I'm under the impression that both points (1.1 and 1.2) have the same
  meaning. I may have misunderstood it, but I think that the main idea behind
  these 2 points is basically: to provide alternative equivalents of the
  content or a description of the content. If so, can't I just merge these 2
  points in one?
