This question is forwarded with permission from Astrid Callista:

  What does (checkpoint 2.9 [1]) mean? Reusing modules as originally
  specified or intended. Are there other ways to use it? Looking at the
  example, I understand it as using the two audio files in their original
  bitrate (namely 56000 and 28800). But this is SMIL, of which I
  unfortunately don't have enough knowledge. How does this point affect XML?

modules from schema as originally specified / intended."
