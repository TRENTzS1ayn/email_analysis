This question is forwarded with permission from Astrid Callista

  Yet another question about possible redundancy in this document. I
  understand both point 4.10 [1] and point 3.2 [2] as being the same. But
  they are separately defined so there must be a difference. Could you
  explain it to me?

navigable structures. Describe how discrete, sequential, structured, and
search navigation mechanisms should work"


[2] http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/XML/xag-20020617#cp3_2 - "3.2 Define navigable
structures that allow discrete, sequential, structured, and search navigation
functionalities."
