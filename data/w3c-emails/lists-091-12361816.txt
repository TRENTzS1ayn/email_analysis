Hi Ian,

In fact, the definitions of the WHO seek not to be based on medical
terms but covering the social and personal aspects of the disability.

It is important to use the terms proposed by WHO to avoid confusion and
the possibility of hurting the sensibility of some people.

Regards,
Emmanuelle

We don't define impairment, disability, or handicap. Instead, we talk
about "accessible: can be used by a person with a disability" and we
talk about different disabilities.

There was resistance to adopting definitions that were
based in medical terms, I believe.
