This post
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2002JanMar/0479.html
gives some context for the discussion of the terms 'disability' and 'impairment'.
FWIW the author of the post (who is based in New Zealand) calls 'handicap' the 'h word'.
I don't believe that its ('handicap') use is widely accepted amongst New Zealand's disability community.

Cheers
Graham

As discussed back in Nov 2001 by Emmanuelle Gutierrez y Restrepo, and
Lisa Seeman.........I also feel that we should be using the World Health
Organization's definitions for these terms.
I will be including them in the WAI Glossary as such, unless further
discussion warrants a change.

As defined by the World Health Organization (WHO)

1.  impairment 
refers to an abnormality of body structure, appearance, organ and system
functioning.

(Impairments are problems in body function or structure such as a
significant deviation or loss)

2. disability 
is the consequence of an impairment in functional performance and
activity


3. handicap 
is the consequence which is reflected in interaction with, and
adaptation to, the surroundings
