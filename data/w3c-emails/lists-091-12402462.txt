I think that merging 2.9 and 1.3 might be a smart way to go.

What we mean is that rather than inventing another way of doing something,
use a piece of an existing XML language. Alternative content isn't the only
issue - the ability to provide navigation points, or containers, is another
example.

For incorporating graphics, SVG would be something that can be used.  (I have
seen other languages incorporate graphics directly in the markup, and they
use a horribly inaccessible method - include the data that makes a jpeg).

I would like to propose that as a technique.

This need not occur only when people have decided to build from existing
modules - it is a good practise anyway (and it can be done whether using an
approach like modularisation or building an entire DTD from scratch).

Cheers

Chaals

  I also suggested mergin 2.9 with 1.3 into:

     "Reuse modules, and reuse them appropriately."

  Can one define an "XML Module"?
