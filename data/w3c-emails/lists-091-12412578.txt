Hi,

I think these are fairly different things. Checkpoint 1.3 means that rather
than making up a new kind of markup for doing something, schema authors
should use things that are accessible methods. This topic  is being followed
up already in another thread on this list [1]

Checkpoint 4.2 is requiring that from a given document there is a way of
finding the schema. The rationale for this is to allow for validation of a
document, and also because we expect the schema to have documentation that
would allow an author or user to get more information about what kind of
element something is - what does it mean, what is it for, what kind of
content can it have, etc.

    Isn't (checkpoint 4.2 [1]) the same as checkpoint 1.3 [2] mentioned above?
    If not, where lies the difference?

  [1] http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/XML/xag-20020617#cp4_2 - "4.2 Provide a
  machine-understandable means/mechanism to get from a document instance to the
  schema."

  accessibility modules to indicate alternative-equivalent associations."
