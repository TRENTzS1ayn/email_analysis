Rationale to support option B.
An eyes free user working with an XML document using audio output
needs to be able to comprehend the element or attribute name.

If using a soft braille output method, it is highly unlikely
that symbols (the chess piece example) would be accessible to the user.

I strongly object to the end user having to do a pre-translation
prior to having any access to the XML document.

Hence my support for the 'characters in a single language' option.
