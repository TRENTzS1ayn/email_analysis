I think pragmatically we should recognise that a lot of XML is probably
created automatically from instance data, used internally to a small
orgainsation, and that's it.

But then, when I started working on accessibility only a minority of
documents in HTML used the alt attribute for images - so I think there is
progress we can make. Although it isn't necessarily going to be reliable,
getting a link to a schema as a priority would be helpful.

And as with alternatives for images, it is possible for a third party to
create a schema and link it externally. So it may be that this becomes a
relatively reliable technique in a couple of years.

  Agreed.

  Pragmatically, only a minority of todays XML documents do reference
  the schema/DTD from which they were derived.
  I don't believe this to be a reliable method of obtaining
  element descriptions.
