In a sense these two checkpoints are emphasising different aspects of the
same requirement. because the part identified in 1.2 is so important I would
suggest we leave them seperate for now, although if we get more comments like
this we should reconsider it.

    I'm under the impression that both points (1.1 and 1.2) have the same
    meaning. I may have misunderstood it, but I think that the main idea behind
    these 2 points is basically: to provide alternative equivalents of the
    content or a description of the content. If so, can't I just merge these 2
    points in one?
