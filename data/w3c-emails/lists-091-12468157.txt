Yep, I agree that we should have different modalities covered. I think we
should generalise the first bit, then use audio descriptions and captions as
examples.

  Media equivalents
  present essential audio information visually (captions) and essential
  video information auditorily (audio descriptions).

  captions are text equivalents of auditory information from speech, sound
  effects, and ambient sounds that are synchronized with the multimedia
  presentation.
  audio descriptions are equivalents of visual information from actions,
  body language, graphics, and scene changes that are voiced (either by a
  human or a speech synthesizer) and synchronized with the multimedia
  presentation.
