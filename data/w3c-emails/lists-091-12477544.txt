Yep, I think Katie has captured an important distinction.

  Currently in the latest WCAG 2.0 Draft "time-dependent presentation" is

  <qoute>

  Definitions (informative)
  time-dependent presentation

  (1)A time-dependent presentation is a presentation which
  is composed of synchronized audio and visual tracks (e.g., a movie),

  OR

  (2)a presentation which requires the user to respond interactively at
  specific times in the presentation.

  </quote>

  .......I think that the (2) is a definition of "response time dependent
  presentation", rather than "time-dependent presentation".  The response
  time issue is very important, but different.

  Also, I think it would be a good idea to provide language that includes
  other sense modalities (tracks).  I realize that it is a bit premature
  to include "synchronized smell" and "synchronized vibration" tracks,
  but, I think we should have language that covers this eventuality.
