Sorry

I lost the track.   Are these definitions or recommendations.     The
imperative sentence form doesn't look like a definition.

Smell and vibration are not equivalents of very much I don't think.
If you mean a vibratory equivalent of a ring....  yep -- but only if
device will always be in contact with the person when the alert is to
take place.  

Smell??     I guess you could smell a call coming in.   need good air
circulation or a very strong smell 

But as equivalents for most information......?

I think you can (and should) make it general in the definition.  

But I think we need to be careful on the examples of equivalents to not
confuse verbal and non-verbal modalities.


Oh - and where we say "text"  shouldn't we say if it is 'data-text' or
'visual-text'.. (I'm not suggesting these terms -- but you get what I
mean

Regards, 

Gregg
