GV:  Response time is not what is being discussed here.   Response time
IS a different issue.

 

But this is talking about the case where a person must respond at a
certain place in a presentation.    When this occurs, a transcript is
not sufficient.     A transcript that says " and for xxxx hit your enter
key now"  doesn't work if the enter key has to be hit at a certain place
in the audio program.    

 

  (an alternate HTML doc with a link located at that point might be  IF
it gets you the same result.)

 

So the issue IS essentially the same I think.   Basically, it means that
any audio transcript has to be synchronized with the normal audio track
in order to be effective.  

 

 

Or were you trying to get at something different?
