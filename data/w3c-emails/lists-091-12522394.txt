Yes, the distinction is very important.  (Thanks Katie!)

Also, the definition is incorrect. The first meaning is not still guessed
right and the text that presents the examples demonstrates it. The
definition that there is now includes the term " audio " and in the examples
it is included "a silent animation." Indeed, so that the presentation is
time based, not necessarily has to go accompanied by sounds.

I propose the following definition:

A time-dependent presentation is that whose necessary elements to transmit
the information are presented in orderly succession in a certain period of
time.

Regards,
Emmanuelle

| Yep, I think Katie has captured an important distinction.

|   (1)A time-dependent presentation is a presentation which

|
|   (2)a presentation which requires the user to respond interactively at
