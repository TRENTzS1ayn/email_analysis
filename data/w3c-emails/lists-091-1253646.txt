Hi Bruce,

I've updated the source as follows: No period after the closing
bracket (like the other [Priority N]). So I've added a period
in 8.1 at the end of the sentence and before the brackets start.

As for WCAG 1.01, ask the WCAG WG...

        8.1  Make programmatic elements such as scripts and applets
directly
accessible or compatible with assistive technologies [Priority 1 if
functionality is important and not presented elsewhere, otherwise
Priority
2.] 
should be:

The only other "conditional priority" checkpoint I noticed was 2.2 and
this
is the syntax it used.  Personally, I think the last period should be
INSIDE
the closing bracket (for both checkpoints), but I am no grammatician.

So, when is WCAG 1.01 coming out?

Cheers,
Bruce
