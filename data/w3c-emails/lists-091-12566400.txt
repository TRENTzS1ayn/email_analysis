Misunderstood, but only a little.

In 3.2 it does not assume that the navigation functions have been documented.
That is why we come back and say that in 4.10.

In 3.2, all it says is that the markup should create the structures that the 
navigation functions (explained under the 4.10 "export semantics" documentation)
operate on.

A named anchor is an example of satisfying 3.2, hyperlink navigation using a 
#fragment URI-reference is a navigation method (direct navigation) that operates
on this structural feature within the document instance.

A MAP wrapping a navigation bar is an example of satisfying 3.2; an 'escape' 
operation that is defined for any MAP element is an example of a navigation 
function that operates on this structure.

See the 'escape' provisions in the standard talking book
