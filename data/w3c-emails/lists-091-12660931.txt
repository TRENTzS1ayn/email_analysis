I'm puzzling over a methodology to approach
designing SVG in an accessible manner.

My principles to date are:

1. document order to match 'described' order,
i.e. logical progression from overview down to detail.

2. Each document entity to be wrapped in a g element,
   with min of desc and otionally both title and desc children.

3. Navigation order.
   this is where I'm stuck. 
   I am looking for a way of assisting document navigation using
   (probably) keyboard events.
   Principle of using say tab key to tab between elements of the diagram
   (g groups) and then using ecmascript to present a tooltip using the
   title or desc contents.

Issues:
How to present the navigation method to the listner?
I'm insufficiently familiar with ecmascript to make it easy.
Charles suggested that onfocus and onactivate are likely candidates.
   Question: Are these available in the SVG ecmascript combination
         provided by ie6 and svgdom+ecmascript combination in Adobe plug-in?

Any advice / examples appreciated.

Regards DaveP
