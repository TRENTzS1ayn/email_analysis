Issue: the object element can poiint to a plugin application instead of
allowing the user to choose the most useful one.

Details:

According to most guides for using the object element with Internet Explorer,
the way to specify multimedia content is to refer to a particular ActiveX
control, which specifies the player to be used for the object data.

For example, there is a classid for the Adobe SVG plugin, and this is what
gets specified. If a user has an accessibility need for a different plugin
(for example a talking plugin), as I understand it they are unable to use
that instead without major poking about in the systems innards.

This contradicts the requirements statement for plugin interfaces
http://www.w3.org/TR/CX developed by the hypertext coordination group.

It should also, I think, lead to
1. A requirement on XHTML 2 to change the way these things are specified
2. A requirement / technique in user agent guidelines that a user can specify
      the player to be used for a given content type
3. Techniques for WCAG specifying how to mark up content so this  is still
      possible.


thoughts?
