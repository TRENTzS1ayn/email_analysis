The accessibility requirement is that there are accessibility needs to be
able to set up a different plugin that go beyond "I would prefer to use
software X".

I agree that this is a general user problem as well. I can also see why
people would imagine specifying a particular plugin program is what they want
to do, and something stronger than just "be nice to users" is always helpful.

  A similar requirement we considered (but rejected) was "The UA must
  hand off focus to ATs." This is certainly true, but not strictly
  an accessibility requirement; it affects anyone who wants to use
  a plugin. This seems more appropriate for /TR/CX or Common User
  Agent Problems, and as you say, format specifications or XAG.
