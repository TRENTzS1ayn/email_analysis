OK, taking my defs as being 'data' or hash defines, substitute
use instead of actuals.

I think it is practical. I hope you can't prove me wrong.
The drawing order is only relevant in terms of what overlays
what, and (I think) that can be sorted.

Agreed, re-use will limit that. Simplistically any 'object'
will be within a group, though its children maybe uses of 
def'd content.

Since I never 'describe' a figure in this way, I'd rather approach
it by providing a 'summary' / precis initially (This diagram shows... )
then go into the diagram. The missing elements will be the reader
commentary which says something like 'which is adjacent to the xxx'.

I want to avoid a 'special' nav table if possible, since it fits
unnaturally into a visual diagram.

You got it. It takes practice to audio describe a diagram.

(or the diagram author ;-)

I know what to say, its how to say it / present it to 
someone opening the diagram. Its the equivalent of having instructions
to open a parcel inside the parcel !
