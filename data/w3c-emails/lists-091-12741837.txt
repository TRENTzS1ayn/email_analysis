If I said hierarchical order I was being too casual.
If I have simple shapes to draw (no matter how complex internally)
I can present sequentially, describing each 'thing' at an appropriate level.

Sounds doable.

Surely a normal preference for lots of users?
The 'where am I ' question is again fairly common, and must be
answered. A (too) simplistic response is to provide a means of
getting to a home position, say the document root?

That answers the local 'where am I' question.
  In a straight sequential presentation, it would be local navigation.
