  Would it be possible to include "sorted" in the line that indicates the

It would also be nice (in my opinion) to include the number of messages with
the setction of the mailing list:

March 2202 - 1 mesage | sorted by date | by author | by thread

(I don't think there are many screen reader users left who need the vertical
bar seperator. But as a visual user I find that it helps me a lot.)

  The page <http://www.w3.org/2002/03/archives-improvements/ml-inde> seems to
  have a search feature at the beginning.  But I find no Go/Search button to
  submit my search.

No, I think there isn't one there in the mockup. Actually I would find it
helpful if the search stuff were moved to the end of the page, so I didn't
have to jump through it at the start - but then I tend to rely on memory of
what happened when (more or less) more than I do on searching.
