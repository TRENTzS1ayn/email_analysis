  Err, could you clarify? Where would like to see that: in the index page,
  in the period page or in the message page? The index page already has
  the number of messages in the table, so does the period page.

In the index page. What I mean is to have the number of messages included in
the first link, rather than listed at the end of the table. (Or as text after
the first link but before the second one).

  <a href="x">mar 1815 - 1 message</a> | <a href="x.a">sorted by author</a> | ...

Or something similar. I would also like to explicitly ask for those little
visual bars as seperators.

cheers
