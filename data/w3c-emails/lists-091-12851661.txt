Do you think we should wait one more week to allow people attending the
CSun conference to send their feedback?

Done: I've tried to make titles be as similar as possible in the 3 kind
of views.

Same as above.

I moved the link after the date and author fields (for some reason, I
thought these info were on the title).

It is just too many lines of frontmatter in the visual display as well, at which point is simply has to go.  It only make sense to put this at the top of the page if it makes sense in the visual view.  The speech-optimized order leaves it for last in any case.

But for the present linear organization with 'dl' display of the navbar it just makes sense to put the meat of the page after a very brief header and put the links to related pages at the foot.  The old way.

As a regular user of the archives, I really don't think removing the
whole navbar from the top would be a good idea. I switched from a <dl>
list to a <ul> one, each field being marked up with <dfn>. It's as
compact as the current version but more cleanly marked up.

I removed accesskeys from links which can appear several times.

Even 'though it is pro-forma stuff that has to tell the standard story.  If there is going to be a systematic explanation of this it is in a list footer on the emails distributed.  The people who need to be instructed about this don't have mail readers that show them funny headers, nor do they parse mailto: syntax.

Let's try to not mix things up. This project is only about the HTML
format of the mailing list archives, not the way the emails are
distributed and what could or should be added to those emails.

My remark comes from the fact that we currently have another project
which will add automatically on the top-level index page the policy for
subscribing and posting to the given mailing list. My question was to
know if this kind of information had to have a special markup for
accessible reasons and if you had strong opinions on where it should
appear - that is, 'where in the top level index page' [it's important
for many reasons that this information appears there, it doesn't mean
that it cannot appear in an hypothetical homepage of the mailing list]. 

    
> AG::  I don't see any mention of fundamental changes, fixing the way that threading breaks across time epochs, or supporting threaded reading or searching across lists.  A mail-me-this-message link in the archive, or a find-me-in-archives link in the distributed mail.  Is any of this under consideration?

It is, but it's not in the scope of this project.

Any list maintainer can create a separate page if he wishes so, but the
top level index page must have some context information so that someone
arriving on this page knows what it's about.

right my question was dumb :) I fixed it.

OK, I integrated the accesskeys as suggested by Greg. Thanks a lot for
the link!

Well, my question was more to know if there was a political reason for
not having a logo: maybe was it decided so that it doesn't look like W3C
endorses the content of any email sent to the archives.

Resolved above.

Probably best to simply leave this at a simple keyword search in the current list and push all more complicated options a link away.  The text of the "Help!" link should be extpanded to "more on searching" and both the next layer of explanation of the search tool and the advanced search form should be on the linked page or one more link from there.

Well, I think the current form is OK.

Well, to be honest, I didn't integrate this proposal since I didn't see
a good reason to do so. Charles, could you clarify why you'd want to
move that at the bottom of the page?
 
Al, what do you think of the new result? Should we wait for more
feedback? My next step will be to send the proposal to the W3C Team,
since they/we are among the biggest users of these archives and I'm sure
they'll have a lot of opinions about it :)

Thanks again!
