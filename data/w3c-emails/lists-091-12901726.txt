I''m pleased to see work being done here, adn the improvements
sound good.

Two things I have heard often from WG members --
(1) can we makeURLs shorter (e.g. lose the /Archives from the URL?)
(2) can we have a way to see an entire thread, even if it spans
    a month/quarter/year boundary?

I'm guessing those are both harder.  For (2), an indication that a
message is not the first in a thread and/or not the last, would
at least help.  Sometimes, especially in public comments lists,
a thread goes very slowly, with one or two postings a month, but
chairs and editors must respond to every message.

I also second David Booth's comments about navigaion.
