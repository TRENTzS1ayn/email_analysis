I'm pretty sure we can, but honestly I don't think it fits in the scope
of this project (remember, this is about markup and layout).

Once again, I don't think that belongs to this project. The good news is
that we do have a project to implement it and if everything goes well,
it should be set up that way when we update the archives to reflect the
current proposal.
