Comments (part 2) on:

The page I experimented with is at
http://www.cwi.nl/~steven/w3c/lists/ml-period.html
(It still needs work)
====
The page doesn't validate! (Quite badly)
====
Remove the <br/> from the <h1> as on other levels.
====
I don't get the idea of putting the navbar in a <map> (client side image
map). What's the point? What do you gain?
====
Good idea putting the shortcut to the messages in the text.
====
The date format was corrected on other pages, but not this one (still
mixed-endian).
====
I don't see the advantage of the bullets in the navbar.
====
The 'title's in the navbar are inconsistent (see previous comments)
====
Merge the actions 'mail' 'help' and 'search' into one line. You could put a
search box inline here.
====
Merge the start and end dates onto one line.
====
Not sure of the value of the "Last message date" at the bottom.
====
The <hr/> at the bottom can go
====
