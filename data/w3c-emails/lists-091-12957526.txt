I don't know if an empty <a> would work... Al?

Ian has made a suggestion to have a navigation bar in the index page
too, and instead of the "shortcut" title, it would be something like
"Latest message" which would propably make more sense? Otherwise, we
could still hide it with a CSS rule.

Well, an icon inside a <h1> is defined as follow according to our house
style guide (http://www.w3.org/Project/HouseStyle.html team only): 
[[
For the home page of an area or subarea, Inside and at the start of the
H1, put a large image connected wit the icon or else the icon itself.
This is the defining occurence of the icon.
]]

I would rather add a CSS rule to make the icon float on the left.

Anyway, very good suggestion regarding minimizing the wasted space.

Indeed, I'll remove it.

Do you mean there should be more space on the left?

The re-sorted title has been suggested as being clearer for accessible
reasons.

Same as above.

Good point.

The current titles have been suggested by Al. Al, what do you think? I
think having the word "messages" is clearer for those that have it read
by their browser.

I hadn't noticed the empty row, and I like your suggestion of 2 tbody.
Regarding visual appearance, I hope this can be handled through CSS.

Good point, will fix.

Regarding the help link at the bottom, it's not the same as the one at
the top (one is for the mail search engine, the other is for the
archives). It might be moved on the top if we follow Ian's suggestions
(sorry, these are not yet on wai-xtech, I hope they'll be soon).

Thanks a lot for your very careful reading and your very good comments!

[I'll follow up on the other parts on the corresponding messages]
