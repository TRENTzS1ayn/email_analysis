Good point, but not really in the scope of this project.

David, wai-xtech is a public mailing list. Could you forward your
examples to a public archive (www-archive@w3.org for instance)

Regarding your navigation bar, here are my comments:
- there is no a real hierarchical relation between http://lists.w3.org/
, http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ and a given mailing list. Let me
explain:
- we don't really have a hierarchical tree in our web site, it's more a
graph approach 
- if we wanted to make a tree navigation for the mailing lists, the real
upper level would be more the homepage of the group owning this mailing
list (if any). And this information should be given by the mailing list 
maintainer themselves (note that each list maintainer can create and
update a text appearing at the very top of the mailing list).

The order of some of the links has been determined to be the most useful
for aural browsers (for accessibility reason). I like your idea of
moving the starting and ending dates and I'll try to implement it.
Besides, you're right that we are not very consistent in separating
vertical navigation from actions and horizontal navigation. I'll try to
make it clearer.

See above.

Not really in the scope of the project, but I think you're right and try
to fix it at some point.

Same as above.

 
Thanks a lot for your very thoughtful comments!
