Oops, I switched from a <dl> list to <ul> but I forgot to actually
switch the enclosing tags! Fixed.

Good point, I'll fix it.

This is for accessibility reason. See:

Oops, thanks, fixed.

They can be removed by a CSS rule. I don't see an advantage in them per
se, but I wanted to use a list format element instead of a <p> with <br>
for each entry (cleaner, easier to parse). Do you think it shouldn't be
so?

> ====

Is that the "Discussion threads" vs "messages by thread" point?

Good idea, I'll try to see how that looks. I don't think I'll add a
search box to keep the page short.

> ====

David Booth did the same suggestion, I'll implement it.

> ====

Not sure either. I'll add in the list of open issues.

> ====
> The <hr/> at the bottom can go

Good point.
