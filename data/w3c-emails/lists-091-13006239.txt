I'll try to see how it looks. I like the consistency it would add.

Might certainly be useful. I don't know if it's doable though. I'll add
it as an open issue.

Olivier has worked on having the general policy automatically added to
the index page. What I mean by general policy is "who can post, who can
subscribe, who can read, ...". Plus, each mailing list maintainer can
add any text he wants at the top and the bottom of the page. So I think
that would fit your suggestion.

It's supposed to link to the top of the table with links to the period
pages. I guess I could make it fit more nicely in the page, especially
by using your proposed navigation bar (probably in the "about this list"
line).

Good idea, I'll see how it looks.

Good idea to separate the options between the top and the bottom. I'll
see what I can do.

it goes to the mailing list index page.

Well, see above :)

Do you think the title should be changed?
