The "more time" bit suggests, for example, that you would get
the next month of messages (or whatever the period is). I think
a clearer link to the index page is helpful in any case. This
could be called "about this list" or "list home page" or something
like that; the term "index" is a bit geeky and might lose some
people.

It may also be helpful to have "next month"/"previous month" (or
whatever the period is) links. So the period page could include
something like this:

     * 58 messages: starting Wed 01 Aug 2001, ending Thu 30 Aug 2001
     * Sort by: [ author ] [ thread ] [ subject ]
     * More messages: [next month] [previous month] [this list home]
     * Mail actions: [ mail a new topic ]
     * Help: [More W3C lists] [Archive HowTo] [Search archives]

s/month/quarter depending on the list.
