Ian, David, Steven,

I've tried to implement most of the suggestions I said I would. Would
you care having a look at it and tell me what do you think? I'm
especially interested on comments about the new message page which is
much shorter now:
http://www.w3.org/2002/03/archives-improvements/ml-message

Al,

The pages have changed noticeably and some of the changes we made
together were affected: you might want to have a close look at it.

Dom
