Hi Dom,

I definitely like the shorter front matter. I think there
are too many "respond to this messages" at the bottom.
I suggest getting rid of the one in "This message". Also,
perhaps Mail actions should go before "broader listings"
since mail actions are still local to this message (to
a certain extent). That line should also be before
the sort line (which is list-level, not message level).
