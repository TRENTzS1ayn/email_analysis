AG:: I concur (strongly) with David on this one.

If we are going to have links to these places, and we construct the URLs in the similacrum of a hierarchical container structure, then by all means use the mnemonic value of this tree topology.

There is no other choice.  URLs are user-visible strings.

I REST my case.

To continue...

The labels using the word 'other' that we have been using for these links are wrong, give false information, to begin with.  Where those lists take you are to listings of super-containers which _include_ the current context that you are moving up from which 'other lists' _does not_.  The notion of Up, Up, Up, as where you are going for ever-widening circles of inclusion is a very good fit, here.

Sorry for shouting.  But David's assertion as to what is the incumbent hierarchy in this case is what greater than 85% of all users would instinctively assume; and not to play to this interpretation is just poor design.
