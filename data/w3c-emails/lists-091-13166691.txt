Hi Dom,

"contemporary messages" is not very clear - but I am not sure how to explain
it otherwise.

Also, the title of the page isn't very helpful - it would be good to have the
subject somewhere at the front -

  <title>$listname $subject $author $date</title>

or something would be nicer in my history...

  Ian, David, Steven,

  I've tried to implement most of the suggestions I said I would. Would
  you care having a look at it and tell me what do you think? I'm
  especially interested on comments about the new message page which is
  much shorter now:
  http://www.w3.org/2002/03/archives-improvements/ml-message

  Al,

  The pages have changed noticeably and some of the changes we made
  together were affected: you might want to have a close look at it.

  Dom
