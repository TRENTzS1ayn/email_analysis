Newsletter of the Anti-imperialist Camp 2001


Rebellion is necessary!
Assisi, Italy, July 28 ? August 5


The women of Afghan resistance will participate in the Anti-imperialist Camp 2001!


About 40 anti-imperialist, revolutionary and peoples? organisations have already joined the Call for a big Anti-imperialist meeting against the capitalists globalisation. 

With this newsletter we would like to present RAWA; Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan, who have recently announced their support of the Anti-imperialist Camp and the participation of a delegate.

RAWA is a democratic peoples? organisation founded in 1977 that under changing political conditions in their home country has been struggling for women?s rights, sovereignty of the Afghan people and social justice. The reactionary Taliban-regime, which has been backed and finance by the pro-imperialist Pakistan regime (please also see: http://www.antiimperialista.com/en/view.shtml?category=9&id=980755991&keyword=+), is oppressing the Afghan people and especially the women in a terrifying, almost medieval way. Comrade Noorin Refahi, RAWA delegate at the Anti-imperialist Camp, will explain the situation of the Afghan people, the tragedy of the refugees but also the determined and resolute resistance by RAWA?s women and the people?s opposition against the Taliban-regime. She will also expose the complicity and the responsibility of the West.
