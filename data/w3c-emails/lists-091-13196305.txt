Good question. Maybe Al will be able to give more input on that.
Interestingly, it looks like this usage of <map> is not considered good
anymore:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wai-gl-tech-issues.html#group-bypass
"A further conclusion is that we do not want to recommend the MAP element 
as a way to group links since it is a non-standard use of the element."

Al, should I switch to the techniques recommended at
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wai-gl-tech-issues.html#group-bypass (namely,
using class="nav" and an appropriate tabindex)?
