I removed the bullets through CSS (I hadn't done so until now for the
message view - I guess I forgot). What markup you would have used if not
an <ul>? I tried at first with a <dl> which seemed to be the most
appropriate, but the CSS rule that would have make it look acceptable
isn't deployed widely enough. So I thought <ul> was a good compromise.
What do you suggest?

I hope Al can clarify his choices regarding titles.
