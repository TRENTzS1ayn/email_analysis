Oh, I'm very sure of this one. The only reason that mail messages need to be
in monospace is that some people do layout with whitespace. Monospace is a
relatively difficult-to-read font; proportional spaced fonts are always
easier to read. However, there is nothing in the headers that require you to
display them in monospace. Therefore, to make a more readable page, you
should minimise the amount in monospace by displaying the headers in
proportional.

See my example at http://www.cwi.nl/~steven/w3c/lists/ml-message.html (I
also reduced the size of the Message-id line, because it contains no
readable information, but you might want to refer to it on rare occasions.)

(In an ideal world I would like to choose per email if it is in a <pre> or
not. Look at
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-html-wg/2002JanMar/0380.html and
weep).

I don't think I ever saw more than one [next]; I have seen more [reply]s
though. What's hard about
    [next] [previous] [in reply to] [next in thread] [reply] [reply] [reply]

Are you sure? Because of the word 'more', I assumed it meant a different
version of level 3. (I couldn't try it because the link didn't work).

But I thought David's suggestions were really good. I think there is a
strong relationship between all the levels, and I use them all (and would
use the missing ones if I could, and often get annoyed that I can't navigate
easily to level 2).

Best wishes,
