Yes.

I would like to have *that* explained to me! At the point we are at in the
hierarchy, we aren't looking at anything sorted. If we were in a sorted
list, then re-sorted would be fine, but we aren't yet.

I can believe that one a bit more, though I doubt accessibility is really
improved at this micro-level.

I don't care, as long as they are consistent. Currently they are:

title="August 2001 messages listed by author"
title="August 2001 threads of discussion"
title="August 2001 messages listed by subject"

I had hoped that too. But I couldn't get it to work. That was what I meant
with my comment:

work.
