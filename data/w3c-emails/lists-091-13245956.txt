OK, good point. I'll implement that too.

A suggestion then: we could add an alternate stylesheet removing the
pre-formating of the <pre> element. What do you think?

Right, I realized that I was wrong and that only "reply" could have
several instances. In my new proposal
(http://www.w3.org/2002/03/archives-improvements/ml-message), I have
added a link [ replies ] to the list of replies at the bottom of the
page.

Yes, I'm sure. The link has been changed to say "more about this list".
I think that's clearer.

Are you really using http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ ? I find it
unusable. I have added more background to my comments if you're
interested:
