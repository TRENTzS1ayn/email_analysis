That's unfortunate that the WCAG WG concluded that after:

  1) That proposal being integrated into HTML 4.01, and
  2) A fair amount of time spent in the UAWG trying to meet the need
    of recognizing MAP as navigation markup.

I have not been party to the discussion in the WCAG WG, but I'm
a little disappointed to hear that now they're unrecommending what
is not *yet* standard practice but might have been.
