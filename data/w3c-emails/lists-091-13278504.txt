The idea was that large groups of links are hard to navigate
through for someone accessing a page serially (e.g., who is
using a keyboard to navigate serially through a set
of links). Rather than ask the author each time to provide an 
"unsightly"

   [jump over bunch of links]

link, we thought it would be useful for user agents to provide
this service. But, we needed markup that user agents can rely
on as being "markup that identifies a group of links".

The idea was that MAP is already used to identify a group
of links, that happen to have a graphical representation. The
WAI groups that proposed the change to HTML 4.01 said "Let's
use MAP for groups of links even when the representation is
non-graphical, as in a group of text links."
