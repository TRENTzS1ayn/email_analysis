Pulpit Confessions: Exposing The Black Church 

by Neal Moore
ISBN: 0-9658299-2-8
$16.00

There is a book causing quite a stir in African American 
congregations across America, especially among its 
preachers. N. Moore's, "Pulpit Confessions: Exposing The 
Black Church," questions the moral character of the African 
American Church in the wake of recent highly publicized 
scandals.

The author contends that the black church is not Y2K 
compliant. He challenges it to get its house in order. 
"Reverend, what kind of church are you going to present to 
Jesus," he asks. "Will he even want it? Would you?"

Brothers Beware: Games Black Women Play

by A. Marshall
ISBN: 0-9658299-3-6
$12.00

"Brothers Beware: Games Black Women Play" is a book that
pulls no punches when it details the many tricks and
manipulative games for which black women are notorious.

This book is an honest, no holds barred, uncensored
discussion about dating in the African American community.

"Brothers, the so-called professional, liberated black
woman wants to have her cake and eat it too. Some of
them have gone to college and earned degrees. She has
entered the work force and is attempting to make an
impact in corporate America and other areas of
employment. She wants liberation on her job. She wants
equality in the classroom. She wants to do what she
wants to do, when she wants to do it, with whom she
wants to do it. She wants liberation. I have no problem
with that. More power to her. But I ask one simple
question: WHY ARE WE STILL FOOTING THE BILL?" -
