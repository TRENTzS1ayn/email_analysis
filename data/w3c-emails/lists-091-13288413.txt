I am very disappointed, particularly as the HTML group, on the recommendation
of WAI PF, after discussion of this issue, changed the content model of HTML
4.01 specifically to make this valid (as well as the fact that it worked in
browsers).

I will take an action to raise this again as an issue in WCAG.

  That's unfortunate that the WCAG WG concluded that after:

    1) That proposal being integrated into HTML 4.01, and
    2) A fair amount of time spent in the UAWG trying to meet the need
      of recognizing MAP as navigation markup.

  I have not been party to the discussion in the WCAG WG, but I'm
  a little disappointed to hear that now they're unrecommending what
  is not *yet* standard practice but might have been.
