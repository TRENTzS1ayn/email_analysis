Specifically because it is the only element whose semantics are "this is a
collection o links" - rather than just "this is a collection of stuff, and at
the same time has a content model that allows it to be a collection of more
or less any kind of links - either those pointed to by an img or object
element as a map for the links associated with the rendered object, or on
their own.

  Ooh I hadn't spotted this before. This is weird tag abuse. Can anyone
  explain to me what the accessibility advantages are of using a client-side
  image map not as a client-side image map, but as a container for links?

  Why is it better than using a <p> or a <div>?
