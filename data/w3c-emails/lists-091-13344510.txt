I note that the skip-MAP technique is still part of
the UAAG 1.0 techniques [1]:
(see technique 11):

    1. In HTML, the MAP element may be used to mark up a navigation 
bar (even when there is no associated image). Thus, users might ask 
that MAP elements not be rendered in order to hide links inside the 
MAP element. User agents might allow users to hide MAP elements 
selectively. For example, hide any MAP element with a "title" 
attribute specified. Note: Starting in HTML 4, the MAP element 
allows block content, not just AREA elements.

This is not a requirement of UAAG 1.0, but suggested as a
functionality as part of providing structured navigation.

I don't have any data about whether this is implemented.
I suspect that it is not.
