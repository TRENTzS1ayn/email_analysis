Dom,

As I told Charles, I am checking with the WCAG leadership.

On the other hand let me give this interim report.  If I recall correctly, the language in the reference that says we abjure the use of MAP is actually older than the decision to recommend MAP in the WCAG 1.0 techniques, despite the lastChange date on the file.  If we started diffing that document with older versions I believe that paragraph hasn't changed in a dog's age.  

Is there any actual harm from using MAP, here?  Not theory, scenarios leading to actual dysfunction?

Al
