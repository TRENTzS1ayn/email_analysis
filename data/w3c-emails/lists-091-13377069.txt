Hmm... Implemented it in
http://www.w3.org/2002/03/archives-improvements/ml-message , but the
result is not as cool as I would have hoped since we lose all the
formating by moving from white-space:pre to white-space:normal, and
especially we lose the separation in paragraph.
 
So, unless there is a way that some <br/> be added where there is line
returns on the original mail [well, I guess there is a way, but an
easily implementable way], I'm not sure it would really be useful.
Steven, any other idea?

Well, I usually go to mailing lists through my bookmarks, and, the first
time, through a link in the relevant page [working group, announcement].
For public mailing list, I usually prefer http://www.w3.org/Mail/Lists
even though it's not complete. But http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/
is really the worse for me. But I understand that you and others find it
useful. I hope we can find a good way too integrate it in an
hypothetical navigation bar.
