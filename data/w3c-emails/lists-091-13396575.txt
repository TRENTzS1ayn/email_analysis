[I am resending this at Dom's request, with references corrected inline, 
since I had incorrectly linked to W3C Team-only archives instead of public 
archives.  --D. Booth]

>         In [2]: Added the hierarchical navigation line to the top.

>         In [3]: Changed the heading and title to "Mailing List Archives: 
> Public".   (The "Member" and "Team" versions should be changed 
> correspondingly.)  Added W3C logo and the hierarchical navigation line to 
> the top.

>         In [4]: Changed the heading and title to be more user
