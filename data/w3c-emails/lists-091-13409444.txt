You don't, but that's okay.

I don't think so.  The idea of the hierarchical navigation bar is not to 
FORCE the user to navigate that way -- indeed I think it is very helpful to 
provide other navigational directions also -- but to provide a DEFAULT 
structure that the user can easily understand.  As Al pointed out, this is 
critical in making a site understandable to users.

I don't entirely agree.  It gives an alphabetized list, which is very easy 
to scan if you know the name of the list you want.  (Alphabetization is one 
of the two most powerful organizational schemes, in general.  The second is 
chronological.)

I think that http://lists.w3.org/ is not the ideal hierarchy parent, from a 
user's perspective, as the top of the navigational hierarchy.  The only 
thing worse would be having none at all!

However, I do entirely agree with the main thrust of your point (if I'm 
understanding it properly): that it may be more helpful to users if the 
hierarchy were broken down by more meaningful categories.

But I think the best way to go at this point is to use a navigation bar 
that reflects the hierarchy implicit in the URL:

At least that represents one sensible structure, even if it isn't 
necessarily the best possible.  And later, if someone figures out a better 
hierarchical organization then maybe the format should be revamped at that 
point.  But I think it's much more important to have an imperfect 
hierarchical navigational scheme than to have none at all.

Thanks.
