David has sent a new mail with public references. Let us know what you
think.

Hmm... I'm not sure how easy that would be. I'll need to check with
Jose, but I agree that it would be a good way to proceed.

The different staring point for navigation is important to understand because in speech it won't be obvious that it is the same page as arriving at the top of the page.  These links are not synonymous with the links emanating from other places, all of which start one at the top of the page.

I see your point but don't have a good solution either.
