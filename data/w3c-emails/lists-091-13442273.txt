MAP is the only way in HTML to easily identify and group a set of related 
links.  You can use TITLE in the MAP element to give the set of links a label.

Why is MAP useful?

Because in the future user agents can have functions to navigate past or to 
navigate directly to links enclosed in a MAP.  This is extremely useful for 
speech and magnified view rendering of HTML where users must actively 
explore the page content.  If there are more than one set of related links 
they can also be enclosed in a MAP and the user can be presented with a 
list of the different groupings of links on a page.  This is an important 
means to improve the structured navigation of a web document for improved 
web accessibility.

I am going to check with the WCAG group on this issue.

I think there needs to be a separation of the typical usage of an HTML 
element and the specification.  MAP is specified to include text elements 
and that should be supported in browsers and authoring tools.
