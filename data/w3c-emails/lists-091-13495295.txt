Actually Amaya allows skipping the map, but it isn't always easy to use. (It
implements the requirement in UAAG to navigate the document by structure...)

  Al,
  User agents right now don't skip maps (or allow navigation or summary
  either), but we are
  including the question in our evaluations.  We are trying to get these
  features implemented:

  1. Skip collection of related links
  2. Orient user to the set of MAP elements on a page (there could be more
  than one set of navigation bars or related links)
  3. Navigate directly to a particular MAP link set

  Jon
