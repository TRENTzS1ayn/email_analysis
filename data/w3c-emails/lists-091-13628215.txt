I disagree it is often useful for some one to move the focus to a 
navigation bar and then select something else from the navigation bar.  But 
getting the focus near a target is useful.  Remember access keys for form 
controls move focus to those controls, so for links there would be 
consistency with form controls.  For people with visual impairments it is 
often difficult for them to understand the difference between a button and 
a link, since they do no see the graphical styling.
