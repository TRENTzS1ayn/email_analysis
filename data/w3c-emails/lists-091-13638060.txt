I have to admit that I giggled when I read (in the article quoted below)
that ZoomText had magnetized a computer screen.  First we have biohazards
from the electromagnetic radiation of cell phones,  and now computer
programs are magnetizing the display device.  Once the hackers discover
this, will you ever feel safe turning on your computer again?

The article is excellent, by the way.

But it shows how even the best-edited of our current media -- and the WSJ
is about the best -- needs help as the low cost of internet distribution
puts pressure on the labor-cost content of published prose.

The point here is that the kind of checker that would have flagged
"magnetized" as inappropriate here where "magnified" was intended is the
sort of thing that could leave a word-net-node binding for the terms in a
text as a byproduct, That binding could then be served offline from the
default web page but machinably linked with it, as contemplated in the
translation-readiness proposals of the Interoperable Language System.

Who knows?  Maybe WSJ are already running a "domain-appropriate filter" and
missed this one because they booked the domain as "IT and health" and the
magnetic behavior of cathode ray tubes is a well-known factor in concerns
about biohazards from their use in video display terminals.  So even an
intelligent filter might have missed this one.  But the market is there.
Spell-checking leaves wrong-word errors that could be found by checkers that
address a wider contextual horizon.  And at the current rate of advance
under Moore's law, it is never a question of "Is this doable with affordable
computational effort?" but *when* will it be doable.
