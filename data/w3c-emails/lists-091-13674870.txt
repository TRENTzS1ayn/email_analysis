Hello WAI XTech,

Well it seems we haven't been able to reach consensus yet on accesskey:
whether it should focus+activate or just focus.

The idea of using a media query to distinguish was rejected by some.

The current proposal is now:

    A user agent SHOULD just focus when an accesskey is used.
    A user agent MUST supply a user option to choose between focus and
focus+activate.

So this still allows the phone people to do focus and activate, while making
it clear that the usual behaviour is to just focus.

Is there anybody who *cannot* live with this?

Best wishes,

Steven Pemberton
Chair, HTML WG
