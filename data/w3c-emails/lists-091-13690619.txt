I can live with that, and this is actually in the direction I think 
accesskey should go, but you are not saying what you are saying you are 
saying.

This "user option" wording obliges user agents to support both mechanisms 
(focus, activate) as well as a mechanism for the user to select between 
those two. This would be too hard for many devices. Something like "A user 
agent MUST give the element focus when an accesskey is used. It  MAY 
activate the element after giving it focus." may be closer.
