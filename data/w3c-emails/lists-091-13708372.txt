*I* can live with it, since I believe accesskey to be several mechanisms 
and that the action should be configurable somehow (e.g. with XML Handlers) 
. But you are asking *every* accesskey implementation, even the one that 
currently do focus, to support two different modes and a switching 
mechanism between them. I would suggest saving that for XHTML 2.0. Before 
that, all three implementations, focus, focus+activate, or user 
configurable should be conformant behaviour in my opinion.
