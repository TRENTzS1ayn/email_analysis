I can also live with that.

I mentioned in previous emails that I think additional work is
required on accesskeys. I think the above is inadequate for XHTML2,
and that, for instance, it would be helpful to distinguish 
navigation stops from activation short cuts.

I also disagree with that assertion, though I understand what you 
are saying. My experience with the UAAG 1.0 is that too many specs 
don't say enough about user interface requirements. I would much
rather UAAG 1.0 requirements appear in format specs (where 
developers may actually read them!) than in a different spec. User 
interface requirements are hard to make, but they need to be real 
close to the other requirements of the format spec.
