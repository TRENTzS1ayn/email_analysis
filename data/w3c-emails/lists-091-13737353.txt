I agree with Jonny that the formulation here adds more than we mean to. I
think it MUST allow only giving focus, and SHOULD allow the user to select
direct activation (and therefore have a configuration option).

(Personally I would like to have the extended reauirement implied in the
proposal, but can live with less).

Cheers
