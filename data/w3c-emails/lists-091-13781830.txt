Hi folks,

a new draft of XML Accessibility Guidelines [1] has been published. This is
essentially for review by the Protocols and Formats working group to approve
it for publication as a W3C Technical Report (Working Draft), which will
hopefully happen during this week.

If there is a public draft this week a call for review will be sent referring
to that draft. If not, we'll keep you informed.

Changes [2] since the last draft should all be editorial, and are based on
the message at http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/wai-xtech/2002Sep/0037
Any public draft will include a consolidated list of changes since the last
public draft [3].

cheers

Chaals
