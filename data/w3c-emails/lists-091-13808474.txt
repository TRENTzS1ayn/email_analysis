What kind of users are we talking about here?

It seems there is a consensus that there are some users for whom the focus
then activate sequence is an important safety feature - people using
primarily voice interaction, who may not remember all the access keys, people
who are likely to bounce on keys by accident.

My own case is different - I have a problem with overuse of my hands, but I
can (normally) see a lot of information presented visually and it is rare
that I hit the wrong key, or am surprised by what happened if I did. I
believe there are a number of people in related situations (I know a handful
personally) who appreciate the efficiency of the direct activation method
above all.

I presume there are people who are somewhere between the two - in some
circumstances they appreciate the efficiency, but in other cases they want to
use the safety feature. (This is also relevant to Jonny's comment about
triggering focus events)

Can anyone help provide more data about the user scenarios they are
outlining?

Cheers
