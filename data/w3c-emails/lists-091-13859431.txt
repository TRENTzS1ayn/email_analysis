I would like to present the view of the mobile browser community and
say that we very much require the "activate immediately" behavior of
access keys as they relate to hyperlinks. With the usability of current
interfaces somewhat strained, every keystroke by the end user matters.
Movement of focus with the first keystroke followed by activation of
the link by the second is just not acceptable.

The notion of allowing duplicate access key bindings is an interesting
one, though not at all compelling for the mobile browser space. I
don't think it motivates the "focus immediately approach", though I
appreciate Tantek's other 4 reasons.

I feel strongly that "focus immediately" behavior of access key applied
to hyperlinks in mobile browsers in unacceptable and would not be
implemented, so I would like to see a solution that would avoid divergence.

Thanks for your consideration.

Regards,
