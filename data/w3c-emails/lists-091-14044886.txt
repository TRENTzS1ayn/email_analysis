3.2 Define navigable structures that allow discrete, sequential, structured,
and search navigation functionalities.

HTML uses accesskey to provide direct navigation, and tabindex (with a
default defined) to provide sequential navigation. It doesn't formally define
structured navigation, and I think that search-based navigation is something
that is outside the scope of designing an XML application - search
functionality is provided by user agents.
