3.2 Define navigable structures that allow discrete, sequential, structured,
and search navigation functionalities.

I think search -based navigation is a function that properly belongs to the
user agent, not the XML application, and so we should drop the search bit
from this checkpoint.

(I also propose to use direct instead of discrete - it seems clearer to
me...)

Proposed new text:

  Define navigable structures that allow direct, sequential, and
  structured, navigation functionalities.

cheers
