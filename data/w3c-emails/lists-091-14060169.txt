My reading of enabling "search navigation" was ensuring that the data was
marked up in such a way as could be simply searched, consider an XML
format which seperates out each character in a word into a different
elements, this isn't particularly easily searchable.

<word>
 <letter>J</letter>
 <letter>i</letter>
 <letter>m</letter>
</word>

That's probably a rather silly example, but I'm sure you could have data
models which make searching harder, but it's unlikely people are going to
use them anyway I guess.

Jim.
