Your point is valid, but I think that we should expect search tools to work
across markup boundaries where it makes sense as well as to be capable of
selecting only on certain criteria such as "content of a single element" or
"content of certain types of element".

We effectively need this for consistency with what we already do - consider
searching for the phrase "learn HTML" and wether you would expect it to
return a positive result for

  <p>This page can help you learn <acronym title="hypertext markup
  language">HTML</acronym>.</p>

and for consistency with the checkpoints that ask for elements that mark up
important types of text content, under guideline 2.

Cheers
