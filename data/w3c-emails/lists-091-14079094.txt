 I sort of had in mind searching for things other than text types too,
but couldn't really think of an example, and they're probably covered,
searchable like "find me all the rectangles that are under a square" type
thing, not sure how you could begin to write techniques for that anyway,
and it's probably covered elsewhere in the structural parts (I can't even
see w3.org so can't check exactly which checkpoint I'm thinking off...)
