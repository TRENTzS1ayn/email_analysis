Ian proposed text for the section which currently discusses the
scope of XAG, which I have reproduced at the end of this mail. However, I
propose that in fact we make the scope of XAG "XML applications" - rather
than solely those which meet some criteria of being directly presentable.
(RDF is directly presentable with CSS, using simple inheritance rules,
although it isn't pretty).

In the meantime I propose that we adopt Ian's edit for as long as we continue
to limit the scope in this way.

This is an existing issue: http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/XML/issues#Scope

cheers

<new section>
1.2 Target XML Applications
</new section>

Put reduced form of former section "XML Grammars, and The Scope Of
XAG" here:

  - XAG 1.0 is expected to improve the accessibility of XML
  applications designed to be rendered by a user agent rather than
  those designed exclusively for "machine processing."  Some
  examples of the former include XHTML, DocBook, MenuML, OEB, SVG,
  MusicML, and SMIL.  Some examples of the latter include XSL,
  RDF, and XML Schemas.

  - XAG 1.0 focuses on the following aspects of XML applications:

    * Adequate structure
    * Support for Cascading Style Sheets (which support user
      control over style).
    * Support for alternative content
    * Support for navigation indicators
    * Support for orientation indicators

  - HTML 4.0 is an example of a markup language that includes
  a number of accessibility features (refer to "Accessibility
  Features of HTML" [HTML-access]). XHTML 1.0 carries forth
  these accessibility features, using XML syntax. Some XAG 1.0
  features as they are implemented in XHTML 1.0 include:

    * Adequate structure (improved form structure with fieldset
      and optgroup, elements and attributes to convey more
      structure for tables)
    * Support for style sheets (inline and linked)
    * Support for alternative content (alt, summary, longdesc
      attributes, caption element for tables, object element
      semantics)
    * Support for navigation indicators (tabindex attribute, link
      element)

  - XAG 1.0 addresses the concern that new applications will not
    include accessibility features such as those found in XHTML
    1.0, SVG, and SMIL.
