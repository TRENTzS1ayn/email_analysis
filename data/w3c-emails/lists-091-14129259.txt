Dear WAI XTech,

Here is the proposed HTML 4.01 errata text for handling of access key.
Please feel free to review now, or later when we publish the next proposed
errata document, or both.

Best wishes,

Steven Pemberton
Chair HTML WG

<blockquote>
<p>
When rendering to the "handheld" medium, pressing an accesskey for a
hyperlink or button SHOULD activate.  When rendering to all other mediums,
pressing an accesskey SHOULD transfer the focus, even for hyperlinks and
buttons.
</p>
<p>
User agents MAY (and are encouraged to) provide a user preference to
override the default behavior, and allow accesskeys to always activate
hyperlinks and buttons, or always focus hyperlinks and buttons.
