Hmm. I think that this will work. I think it would be better to say that
accesskey must allow transfer of the focus, and should allow direct
activation, and should allow configuration. (I think that direct activation
should be the default, and that therefore the requirement for configuration
becomes effectively a must.

I use accesskey on a medium other than handheld, as a way to relieve overuse.
For some disabilities this is the primary requirement, and every extra
keystroke significantly reduces the value. (This includes modifiers as well
as the need to confirm activation if there is only a focus transfer).

cheers
