We are trying to clarify and pin down the scope and goals of the glossary.

CMN2 Agree that we should not make up a different term. That was the idea of
tracking divergent meanings, as suggested below. I'll add something to the
bit below - the purpose is so that groups see the problem and fix it in early
draft stage.

CMN2 I think we should note that it is used differently in the SVG spec to
the usage which would get into the WAI glossary. Hopefully this could be used
to prod the relevant groups into harmonising their definitions at draft
stage.

CMN2 Hopefully they won't have any work to do. I guess they are the place for
escalation if two groups cannot agree on a definition, but that should be
unlikely...

I like the idea of a process section. I would add a bit about what to do wher
a group wants to edit an existing definition - they should at least make a
proposal to xtech, and advise any group that already uses the term, so there
is some way of checking that an updated definition is compatible with
existing usage.
