Hi folks,

In the back of my mind live all sorts of thoughts about multimedia
accessibility that I never seem to collect in the front of my mind. (A shame
- I was supposed to be doing an MA on this).

Anyway, I thought I would try to collect a few thoughts:

http://www.tate.org.uk/imap/ is from the Tate museum, and is about making
Tactile maps of images. This is similar to the Work of Patrick Roth at the
University of Geneva (no URI available as far as I know). It is also related
to the work of Lori Petrucci on the websound browser http://websound.unige.ch

In the UAWG list Lisa Yayla recently started a thread about accessible
graphics for tactile printing -
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2002JulSep/0052 and continued
at http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2002JulSep/0080 referring
to her work which is described at http://www.ks-huseby.no/sensiblegraphics

There are a couple of threads in the archive of this list:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/wai-xtech/2001Jul/0000
continued at http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/wai-xtech/2001Aug/0032  and
related to http://www.w3.org/2001/08/rdfweb/svg-foaf (among other things)

There is also a thread on events and navigation order based on the work by
Dave Pawson: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/wai-xtech/2002Mar/0000

There is the ever-waiting-to-be-updated Note on Accessibility Features in SVG
- http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG-access/ - which has an editors draft that is
publicly available but also needs working on at
http://www.w3.org/1999/09/SVG-access/ and the stuff on techniques for WCAG,
some of which is more up to date than the note, at
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/wcag2-svg-techs-020318

Some of this was also copied from the SVG specification's section on
accessibility: http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/access.html

There is lots more about, but that's a start for a link trail...

Chaals
