Hi folks,

there are now some pages about XAG so that you don't have to read the
specification to find out what is going on.

The most important I think is http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/XML/about - about the
XML Accessibility Guidelines. I have tried to make this a useful public page
for tracking the guidelines and finding links to related stuff without making
it require too much maintenance. I would like to add a news section to it
which would enable automated tracking of the kind we want to do and some
other groups do already.

That page links to the latest draft, the latest public draft, has a
placeholder for links to a complete history of drafts (but no changelog so
far - which is a problem) that only has the last 3 listed at the moment, the
issues list - http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/XML/issues - the reviews page -
http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/XML/reviews - and the PF public page and wai-xtech
archives.

cheers

Chaals
