Hi,

2.3 in XAG says:
"2.3 Use the standard XML linking and pointing mechanisms (XLink and
XPointer).
Xlink and XPointer have been reviewed for accessibility and their
linking/pointing semantics may be recognized with certainty. "

Can someone point me to this review, as I find it very constraining.  To
easy attach media equivalents to an element by uri, I'd want to attach
multiple xlink's to that element (like in html's img where we have src
and longdesc) the alternative is unwieldy, and is unlikely to promote
accessibility.

Jim.
