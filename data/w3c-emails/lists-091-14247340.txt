Hi, that review was member-confidential so I need to get permission from the
authors and contributors before we could release it. (This is why I prefer to
have discussion in public wherever possible.) I will try to do so.

In the meantime, the alternative is to provide a more element-based system
for providing alternatives - see checkpoint 1.2

  Define flexible associations, where a given kind of relationship can link
  to or from objects of varying types without constraint

Which means that relying on attributes to allow for two or three alternatives
is not generally sufficient for meeting the checkpoint. However, Xlink does
allow for "extended" type links, which can have multiple hrefs and arcs.

http://www.w3.org/TR/xlink/#linking-elements

Perhaps if you outline a scenario it would be helpful to use it as a case
study and see what we learn.

Cheers
