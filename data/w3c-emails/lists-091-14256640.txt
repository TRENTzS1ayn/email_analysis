We don't need an existence proof from Jim to know there is a problem.
The HTML WG has taken the position that they have considered XLink and
found it wanting.

For the purposes of the current XAG draft, where it says

"2.3 Use the standard XML linking and pointing mechanisms (XLink and
XPointer).

it might as well say "Use standard W3C methods for associating information
in the current document with information elsewhere, and semantics bound
to the current markup vocabulary with related semantics used more widely
or more narrowly."

Can someone construct a shapshot of where the TAG is on the XLink:HLink
issue?  It is clear that the Web Community is not as much of one mind on an
appropriate-use profile for binding methods as we appear to assume by the
current XAG language.

Jim, if you would be willing to propose more inclusive language to replace 
the specific prescription of XLink and XPointer, please offer a specific 
text edit
against the latest Editor's draft, to wit:

http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/XML/xag-20020617

..and we might get into a TR page update soon.
