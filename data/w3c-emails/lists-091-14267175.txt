Sorry,

forgot the thing that had set this spinning in my brain again - Ivan Herman
and Daniel Dardailler wrote a paper on using RDF and SVG to do some neat
linearisation into HTML via a tool - all the stuff is available:
http://www.svgopen.org/papers/2002/herman_dardailler__svg_linearization_and_accessibility/

And Jim Ley's tools are mostly about doing things: http://jibbering.com/svg -
the thing I like most is the whiteboard, becuase I can imagine making a
proper shared whiteboard that does accessibility and this is the closest I
have seen to an implementation.

There is also the idea of using SVG for sprite-based animation - not really
much to do with accessibility except that it is the only way I can think of
to get photo-realism and transparency and animation in a reasonable
file-size, and that allows concrete things like pictures of individuals to be
used. This is apparently helpful for people with very severe intellectual
disabilities. I owe Jonathan Chetwynd email on that topic...

Cheers

Chaals
