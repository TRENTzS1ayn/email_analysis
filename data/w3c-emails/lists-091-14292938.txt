To my reading there was no resolution. It appeared to be
clarification from both sides as to why its not in HTML.
 Agreed XLINK has not got the broad support for wider adoption
so I'm all for a move to broaden XAG. My only addition might be
a statement that AT should be able to derive the information that
this is an off page link, either from content or syntax.
