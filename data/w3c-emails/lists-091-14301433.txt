I don't see that your conclusion follows from your premise. It is clear that
the HTML group doesn't want to use Xlink, and equally clear that the SVG
group is happy to use it. SMIL 2 takes an intermediate position.

It doesn't seem obvious to me that extended xlinks have been considered by
anyone, and I am not sure why not. I don't yet see the evidence that we
should either be trying to follow the community in an apparent condemnation
of Xlink per se.

As far as I can tell, the two HTML objections are that it is not possible to
have multiple links in a single element, and that Xlink requires a namespace
other than the html namespace.

I think the second objection is bogus - xml:lang effectively requires a
different namespace too.

It is true that a simple xlink can only have one link in it. But an extended
Xlink can contain many links, with the sole proviso that each one is an
element (and can be annotated, have a role as defined in the Xlink namespace,
etc) rather than an attribute.

Which, as far as I can tell, comes down to an argument about whether things
should be elements or attributes, and another argument about support for
legacy formats. And from that perspective it seems to me a fairly esoteric
architectural argument, so I would like to try and understand it in practical
terms - what can't be done with Xlink, or is much harder with Xlink?
