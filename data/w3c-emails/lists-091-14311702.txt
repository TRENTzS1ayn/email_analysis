Consider this:

<image xlink:href="shepherds.jpg">
 <alternative xlink:href="shepherds.html" type="text/html">
 <alternative xlink:href="shepherds.rdf" type="application/rdf+xml">
 <alternative xlink:href="shepherds.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
</image>

Seems a reasonably flexible way to define alternatives to our image
element.  However I think it's a hard sell, and is only really for the
situation where there are multiple types, where there's only one
alternative url (either with that uri content negotiated, or is a
fragment to the same/different document.) then an attribute is more than
enough.

Another problem is what happens when someone uses xpointer to annotate or
link to one of the "alternative" elements, what does the annotation/link
point to?  Okay, that's a problem with people mis-using links, but it's
one we wouldn't have if it wasn't for the elements.

In general I'd prefer something more like:

<image xlink:href="shepherd.jpg" alternative="someuri" />

this means that where there's only one alternative, it's very simple, and
it's an easy "sell".

If you have more types then we can construct something similar to the
first:

<image xlink:href="shepherd.jpg" alternative="#alts" />

<alternatives id="alts">
 <alternative ... />
</>

etc.  Which also means that the alternatives are nicely reusable if you
use the image more than once. (and you could even define them in a
seperate document so as to be re-usable across documents.)

I don't think xlink actually makes it impossible to create accessible
formats, it just makes it harder, and breaks the paradigm developers
currently have, so I agree legacy support of formats isn't that
important, legacy support of developers is.

Jim.
