For the record, I'm in agreement with Charles on this, but then, I have
been wanting more XLink support (for accessibility's sake) for a long
time now.

Legacy markup writing formats can be converted to XLink pretty
easily via simple rewriting.  I think XLink is a superior linking
mechanism to simple XHTML2 style links, and if someone really
wants to write in old-style links they could always author in that
limited language and convert it to "real" markup via XSLT or
some other mechanism.

I have never bought the "this is too hard to write because there
are too many elements!" argument.  If it's that hard, just don't
write raw XHTML2 -- write in some other language and convert.  (In
fact, that is generally sensible for nearly any XML-based language.)

The backwards compatibility argument from the HTML Working Group
is absurd, of course, given that XHTML2 is, by design, not backwards
compatible.

I am okay with a broader phrasing for XAG 2.3, although I would be
unhappy with any checkpoint in which the conclusion is "don't use
XLink."  That's just silly, in my opinion.
