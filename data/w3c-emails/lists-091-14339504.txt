Semantic nit. Its no longer an image? Hence wrapper tag is wrong.
Docbook calls this sort of thing a mediaObject, then has
known media in it. One an image, another text (your html?) a third
and image (svg+xml whatever), just slightly improved semantics.
Makes even more sense when there is an audio rendition inside the wrapper.
