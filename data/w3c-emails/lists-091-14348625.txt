The problem with this is approach is that <mediaObject ... > in SVG say
would just be a misleading name, the Mark-up language I was imagining
creating above called for an image, however I want the ability to say
that this information is also available in alternative forms.

Yes if you were creating a language where you could include content of
any type, then a different wrapper would be fine, anyway I don't like the
above for the reasons I gave.

[Sort of OT note]
Incidently the svg representation of the shepherds SVG is
http://jibbering.com/2002/8/img-desc.svg - if you imagine the text being
spoken and the navigation provided by the N/E etc. how close to getting
self voicing are we?

Jim.
