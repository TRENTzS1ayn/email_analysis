One of the arguments for xlink in the first place is that there are lots of
people who want to be able to make links (the bit that makes the Web
different to a collection of documents). If people cannot understand every
XML language and all its implications, then being able to understand links in
detail might be helpful - you don't really know the meaning of the things in
the page, but you know this one points to another page, and there are some
words around it that sort of make sense. Navigating blind is a step forward
from not being able to navigate at all - eventually you can build up a map
that helps to interpret things in it.
