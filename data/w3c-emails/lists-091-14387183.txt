Both. I'm not aware of xml authoring tools having come up on au?
Equally, I've never heard of any xml tools offering any sort of
WYSIWYG namespace support. 
Taking your XSL example:

<xsl:template match ....  perhaps black 'ink'
   <html:h1           .... red ink?
etc. 
  Would be visually supportive, but appears 'hard to do'.
Making that accessible? even harder. When I start typing a line
of text, the editor needs to be aware of which ns might be coming
up and 'read my mind', or allow me to choose a pen for each line
I write! the former is likely to annoy, the latter to ... annoy me.

If XSLt is to go GUI ish, then its more likely to be  a different
kind of tool, drag from source to output (rubber band ish) then
tweak selections, that kind of approach.

Text editing and multi ns just don't appear to be good bedfellows IMO,
at least for the tool vendors.
 Which brings it back to a plain text editing issue, which is no
different for a sighted user or a blind one.

Unless you know different :-)
