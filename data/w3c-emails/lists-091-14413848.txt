Hi folks,

there is a new draft of XAG in preparation. Although I haven't finished with
editing it (still spell-checking, link-checking, updating support pages, etc)
the changes to come should not be significant for review. If anyone wants an
early look it is at http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/XML/xag-20020915

Note that until I finish the editing the latest editors' draft URI will still
point to the 17 June version. The real announcement will include changes,
etc.

Cheers

Charles
