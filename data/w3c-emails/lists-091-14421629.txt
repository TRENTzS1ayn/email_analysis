In hlinks examples

<hlink namespace="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
       element="img"
       locator="@longdesc"
       effect="new"
       actuate="onRequestSecondary"/>

does this open a secondary window? If so this seems to be a recurring
problem. Could onRequestSecondary be removed from the speck?

Another issue or at least something that I did not understand - would this
enhance the course of alternative representation?
The examples given did not redefine  alt, title and the like. Understanding
that it is just an example, it still seemed to exemplify the risk.


All the best,

All we wanted to say was

HLink, just released, allows you to define this.
