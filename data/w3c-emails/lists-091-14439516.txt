Hi, the PFWG resolved some existing issues (which will be reflected in the
new draft) and introduced a new issue.

New Issue:

Should checkpoint 2.9 really be a checkpoint, or is it only a technique?

Issues resolved:

Merge checkpoint 1.3 into checkpoint 2.9. See
http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/XML/issues#Merge1

Do not merge checkpoints 1.1 and 1.2. See
http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/XML/issues#Merge1

Editorial changes resolved. See
http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/XML/issues#Editorial

Definitions will now be taken from the WAI Glossary by default. See
http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/XML/issues#Definition

These chagnes will be reflected in the new XAG draft which will be published
shortly - http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/XML/xag-20020915

cheers

Chaals
