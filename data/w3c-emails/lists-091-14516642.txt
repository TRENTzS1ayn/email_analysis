I think that although Ian raises some significant potential modifications, 
we must no lose sight of the possibility that XAG's "A" can be deemed to 
refer to accessibility in its more general sense. Although we are part of 
WAI and the genesis of the document was directed towards that group's view 
of the "A-word", we (IMO) fairly rapidly found that we could more 
effectively achieve that goal by attending to the more general implications 
of our guidelines' i.e., they apply to 
usability/re-usability/effectiveness/universality and all that good stuff.

On the whole I think they are a superset of the WAI documents and elevate 
such things as ATAG to a superior level than *just* being about letting 
blind guys be able to use XML creation tools or that the outputs of new 
markup languages generate "accessible" documents.

This is bigger than both of us, darlings.
