Jason's post to which I am replying is such a good summary of some key
meta-principles dealing with how we target documents that I think we should
give it a permanent home in the meta-XAG page
<http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/XML/about>.

The only one of these comments I would like to amend swiftly is the last
one

In this case I must apologize to Ian and all on this list who have not been
stroked with the micro-steps of PF group process.

This draft is in the process that has been being followed, with consensus
support in PF, is for final polishing to move to TR, not requiring that
all major issues be resolved.  I believe that we can both migrate a more
current draft to the TR page AND consider top-level issues such as you
lay out so well here as part of the re-chartering process.  We do need to
consider better the questions Jason has laid out here before a new charter
goes into effect with the XAG on a Recommendation track.  But this should
not keep us from bringing the TR page up in synch with the state of the
last year's progress in the group.

At this point I would like to proceed with the process to get an update
to TR and defer major issues past that transaction so we can have a current
draft up in TR space prior to our Face to Face meeting next month.  And
continue to consider the more sweeping issues on a slightly more relaxed
timeline not holding the TR page update hostage to them.
