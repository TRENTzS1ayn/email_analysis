Hi folks,

I have trimmed out everything except what I think are editorial improvements
from Ian's original proposals.

(for example, anything that touched on an existing issue has been removed
here)

I propose to incorporate any of these that people don't object to into the
next (Public) draft, but do not feel that we have time to resolve things that
are not agreed to. So if you think there is something in here that is not an
editorial improvement please say so, and that change will be held over for
later discussion.

(And as a general note, please don't send monolithic proposals if you can
break them into pieces - they take a lot more time for me to work with as an
editor, and as the person trying to track issues).

Cheers

Chaals
