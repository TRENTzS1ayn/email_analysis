I guess there's no formal category called "specification"? The decision to 
go for "recommendation" status was already deliberated in the PFWG and when 
"voted on", carried.

Clearly the current document may "specify" things such as "export 
semantics" which aren't all that easy to elucidate (I know what it means 
but can't convincingly explain how to either do it or check that it's been 
done) but which need to be called for.

The formal/testable "recommendation" will be in the works forever and will 
likely never be finaliz(s)ed - so be it.

What we CAN do is to provide guidance even though they are unlikely to 
become "guidelines/checkpoints" and maybe if we just changed the 
designations thereto it would be helpful to the X community?
