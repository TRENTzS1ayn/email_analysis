Yes, the current policy is to try and make it a Recomendation. That isn't
cast in stone though.

If we are going to produce a Recommmendation we need to clarify how to do
just that. But I don't believe it is impossible, and personally think it is
worthwhile.

I disagree about the likelihood, and think the value of a W3C Recommendation
is much higher than "some useful notes", both because it has higher status,
and because to get that it has to go through a rigorous process of review
that should ensure the document is implementable, testable, and useful.

I think that any draft of XAG can be taken in that vein already. I think the
tougher process of preparing a Recommendation is an important way to focus us
on really getting it right.
