A thread of discussion has started on the WCAG mailing list in
connection with the definition of the ACCESSKEY attribute in both the
HTML 4.01 and XHTML 2.0 specifications. Due to the cross-group
interest in this issue, it would be preferable to examine the topic
further via the xtech list, hence this message. Note that the issue is
relevant to the PF, UA and WCAG working groups, at a minimum, but that
the primary responsibility for conveying suggestions to the W3C's HTML
working group lies with PF.

The definition of the ACCESSKEY attribute in the HTML 4.01
specification is at
http://www.w3.org/TR/HTML401/interact/forms.html#h-17.11.2

and the corresponding treatment in the public working draft of XHTML 2.0
can be found at
http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml2/mod-attribute-collections.html#col_Hypertext
