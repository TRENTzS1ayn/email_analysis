We have a more imminent and deeper need than that, I believe.

If I catch your drift

- it takes more than OWL, it takes the functions of the Logic group applied to
the declaratives of the OWL to do what one needs, and...

- we need this NOW for lexicons, in particular a Glossary entry is already
something of the pattern-class that you are discussing, and that RDF does not
support natively.  It binds some further information to a set of instances;
where what we have by way of definition for the set is an 
instance-recognition pattern, not an enumeration of identities of the 
affected instances.
