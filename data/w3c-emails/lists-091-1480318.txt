Carol,

Thank you very the very clear presentation regarding the excerptation and 
annotation of the W3C document. It's fine as is, but should the explanatory 
text on each page prove to be unwieldy, I think you could also provide the 
annotation and copyright notices on a slide of it's own, up front, and then 
the note (*) could be a one-liner link to the more completet slide:

"Excerpted from the Checklist of Checkpoints for Web Content Accessibility 
Guidelines 1.0. Copyright (c) 1999 W3C (MIT, Inria, Keio). Annotations are 
by Carol Foster and have not received the review or approval of the W3C and 
WAI."
