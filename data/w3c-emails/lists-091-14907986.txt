Not my department, so I can't really comment on how the group is run. 
But this seems strange - the group is required, like all w3c working 
groups, to respond to public comments, and the address they provide for 
making them is the authoring tools list.

More or less. Actually there needs to be more than a handful of forms, 
but a system where that is the interaction model can and should 
conform. There are people out there doing this already.

Notepad is  inherently not an editing program that provides any 
guidance for the user. Emacs is, but doesn't have particular stuff for 
accessible web content as far as I know. In each case the interfaces 
would need to be extended ot cover the requirements of being helpful 
for users doing a specific task, but the basic nature of the 
interaction doesn't need to be changed.

No, as far as I know the developers of Authoring Tools haven't managed 
to produce a triple-A ATAG conformant tool in the nearly 4 years since 
this became a recommendation. I am saying that there are not inherent 
barriers (beyond that fact that a fair bit of work is required) to 
making conformant tools.

A wiki (authoring/editing) interface with no back end (or vice versa) 
isn't any kind of tool, it's a mockup. So although knowing what the two 
pieces are is important, but the system works because it has both 
parts. You could make a set of webforms that generate content based on 
javascript, but they would fail because they don't meet applicable 
accessibility guidelines for the interface. (Shame - foaf-a-matic, a 
nice authoring tool for RDF, fails on these grounds).
