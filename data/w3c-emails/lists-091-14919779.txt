This is rather muddled and ill defined.  Web Accessibility Guidelines 
applies to web applications, whereas Software Accessibility Guidelines 
apply to applications software.  You can't bundle the two together 
because they each are governed by different functional environments.

You bet this isn't clear.  Here you have a term that links "element and 
object properties" in the one sentence.  So that to me means all the 
standard markup elements, and those that are not, which are classified 
as objects, as in "Objects, Images & Applets", yet all the links in this 
document seem to be referring to element attributes.

HTML Top-level Elements

     * Head
     * Body
           o Text
           o Lists
           o Tables
           o Links
           o Objects, Images & Applets
           o Style Sheets
           o Frames
           o Forms
           o Scripts

Whatever the case, there needs to be very clear distinction made here, 
because the assumption is that the AT, whatever it is, Application 
software, web form or text editor should be able to edit the object 
properties, and the Rationale and the Success Criteria point to 
graphical type editors that can edit Objects, Images and Applets.

If that is the case there are very few who can meet the Success Criteria 
as stated.  I'd like to see any examples of web based authoring 
environments that meet this criteria.

Amaya is a user agent and software application, as such it has far more 
power to manipulate content, web forms don't have this range of capacity.

Please show me an example.

But try and do this within a web form.  Please show me an example.

Also, what do you do in the case of web forms that need to comply with 
WCAG1 6.3.  Take for instance phpBB, like many web based authoring 
interfaces, used at http://www.accessifyforum.com/.  If Javascript is 
turned off you loose all power of the toolbar and the user interface to 
markup the content for the backend to process.

***
I leave out the other guidelines for the present, also because it is the 
1.x guidelines applied to ATs across the board that concerns me.

Also, I take to understand everything above referring to the capacity of 
web forms as AT can apply within any user agent, including Lynx, so as a 
  web developer, is ATAG2 saying that I should be able to build a fully 
compliant AT using web based forms usable within any user agent?
