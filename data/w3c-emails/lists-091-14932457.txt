Not a major concern? I'm composing this message on a flight home from 
the XML 2003 conference where I presented to vendors of content 
management systems on making their tools more accessible using ATAG. 
Geoff, I really don't know how much more serious I can be about this.

When we exchanged emails, I told you specifically that I take this need 
seriously, and that we are working on ways to make ATAG more usable to 
CMS developers. There is no change since we talked because there has 
been no new draft since we talked. We are aiming for a new draft in 
January.

The paper I submitted:

This is because the draft is incomplete. It is an omission which is 
being remedied in the process of moving things forward. We _will not_ 
be allowed to proceed to Recommendation if we do not have this 
functionality.

This is already in ATAG 1, in the form of conformance icons. It will be 
done in a clearer and more logical fashion for each tool type in ATAG 
2. I said this to you then, and I'm saying it to you again, in public, 
now. It's not done yet. When we advance the document, it will be. Your 
comments are noted, and reflect the consensus of the working group.

False. I specifically pointed you to the document for how to join the 
Authoring Tools Working Group. Here it is again:

You may join the list by sending the necessary information. I never 
disallowed you access to anything. For that matter, the 
w3c-wai-au@w3.org list is open for public comment, and is noted in the 
document as the place to send comments on the draft:

"Please send comments about this document to the public mailing list: 
w3c-wai-au@w3.org (public archives). Please note that this document may 
contain typographical errors. It was published as soon as possible 
since review of the content itself is important, although noting 
typographical errors is also helpful."
