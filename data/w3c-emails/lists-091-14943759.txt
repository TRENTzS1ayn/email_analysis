If I have misinterpreted your support for these concerns I apologize.  
But it still appears to me we are not talking about quite the same 
issues, mine being that the main document should be completely 
unambiguous in this area.  To me, it is not.

Good, but this does not really go deep into the real areas that concern me.

I'm afraid I don't see it as incomplete, I see it as fundamentally 
flawed in its sweeping generalisations.  For it to have got to this 
stage and in this form indicates to me that the people working on this 
document just do not understand this concern.  Maybe I am mad and just 
an isolated case, and maybe there is evidence for that:-), but when I 
have raise this issue with other developers I feel they also share this 
despair at the quality of technical competence in addressing these issues.

Well, this is saying something different than Charles seems to indicate 
in his outline of all the checkpoints in his recent reply to me on this 
thread, where he "seems" to feel quite confident that the guidelines can 
be applied to all forms of ATs.

Note our correspondence about the ATAG list ***


Hi Geoff,

I noticed your xtech request, but didn't see one for AU.

Do you wish to join the AUWG as a participant? If so, the procedure and 
requirements for doing so are at:

http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/joining

Thanks,
m

So I agreed to it

wai-xtech would be the appropriate list for this discussion. I can 
subscribe you to xtech if you like.
