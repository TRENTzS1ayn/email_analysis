[moved to ATAG list, bcc to xtech so they know where it went]

Well, there are three perspectives here. Geoff sees the document as 
"fundamentally flawed in its generalisation". Matt seems to think it is 
not sufficiently complete to cover what Geoff needs. And I maintain 
that in fact the guidelines document pretty much gets it right.

What is important, in my opinion, are the techniques which demonstrate 
how to do this in different types of system. Lookng briefly over the 
techniques work it is clear that there has been some substantial work 
done since the group started, but there is a need for more.

Perhaps a few detailed suggestions about what is missing would help 
determine whether they are the sort of thing that should be a new 
checkpoint, or whether they are in fact techniques for existing 
checkpoints.

cheers
