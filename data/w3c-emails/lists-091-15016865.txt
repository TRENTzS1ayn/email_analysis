Hi folks,

there is work being done on tools to support a glossary by W3C ERCIM. This is
happening as part of W3C's QA activity, and discussion will take place on the
mailing list public-qa-dev@w3.org. According to the lists archive page [1] it
has archives available to the public, but subscription is only open to QA
developers - I believe that means you cannot post to the list unless you are
approved for subscription by the maintainer.

There are a couple of other related pieces of work.

Wordnet is a project to produce a dictionary in RDF [2], which allows words
to be classified in terms of relations to other words - for example an eagle
is a type of raptor, a type of bird, etc, and cat has two senses - in one it
is a type of mammal and in the other it is a type of whip.

The SWAD-Europe project also has some work one thesaurus development [3]
which builds on (and points to) work already done in the area.
