Hi Dean,

thanks for the comments in general - I will try to build them into 
listed issues one by one.

Actually conforming to WCAG double A includes meeting checkpoint 14.1 - 
Use language that is clear and simple - which is a priority one 
requirement. I don't think XAG meets the requirement very well (which 
is also a problem in meeting W3C's publication rules, but the testing 
of this applied for W3C publications is generally very weak).

There are some things that people need to understand for the document 
to make sense, such as the differences between an XML DTD and and XML 
Schema. Ideally we would reference clear explanations of those. But any 
comments on how to make the document clearer are always welcome.

cheers

Chaals
