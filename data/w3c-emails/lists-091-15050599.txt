My personal opinion, which I think matches PF's consensus, is that some 
events in DOM2 such as onmouse* are indeed device specific. There are 
ways of working around this - the current situation that included some 
non-specific events alongside some specific ones doesn't strike me as a 
great outcome :(

There is discussion of this more and more frequently, and I believe 
that the Batik SVG viewer has implemented a fairly device-independent 
set of event triggers tied to particular user agent inputs. I hope to 
find time to follow this up further, but it seems never to exist.

cheers
