Personally I don't consider that SVG needs to be final form - it 
provides plenty of capacity through the metadata, title, desc 
attributes for storing original data as well.

The source can be identified (in the example of an SVG that has been 
turned into a stripped-down final form version for bandwidth reduction) 
through the metadata element - I wonder if we should propose a 
particular way of doing this. There is Dublin Core that can identify 
versions of the same resource...

cheers
