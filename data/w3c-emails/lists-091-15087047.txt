It means providing some way for a user to find the original - the 
assumption is that the final-form version is generated from something 
richer and more flexible. This requirement is probably related to the 
use of something like CC/PP, where it should be possible to negotiate 
for one form or another. Currently we don't allow for that as a 
solution (perhaps based on the assumption that there are no people who 
can provide an exhaustive set of final-form presentations for all sets 
of user needs).
