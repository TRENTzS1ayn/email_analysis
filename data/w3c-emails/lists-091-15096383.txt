This issue  is related to the "final form" checkpoint - 2.11 in the 
October 2002 draft. Part of the answer might be that structure and 
presentation are not as clearly distinguished in graphics, or audio, as 
they are in documents that are primarily textual - considering some 
examples for SVG or SSML would be a good idea.

The ability to override styling for things we consider final form 
languages probably belongs in the discussion of the final-form 
checkpoint. It is provided by CSS2 already, which specifies that 
presentation attributes are to be treated as if they were style sheet 
rules, and gives them a place in the hierarchy. Maybe we should make 
that an explicit technique note.
