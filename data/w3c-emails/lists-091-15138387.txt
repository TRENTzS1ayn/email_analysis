There is at least one example I know of for automatic language 
switching - the Technical University of Tampere http://www.tut.fi 
produced a voice-based email system that auto-detects languages and 
switches synthesiser accordingly. Having one that could read XML to the 
simplistic level of being able to spot the xml:lang attribute in an 
element would be good.

cheers
