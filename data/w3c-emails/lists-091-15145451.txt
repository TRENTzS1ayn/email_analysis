Hello all,

Olivier created a "W3C Glossary and Dictionary Project" page at: 
http://www.w3.org/QA/2003/01/Glossary

Please note that we'll have a WAI meeting on Friday of the technical 
plenary (7 March) to discuss the WAI glossary.  For two hours of that day 
we will join other groups interested in discussing a W3C-wide glossary.

Refer to the technical plenary page for more information about logistics of 
the meeting and please register.  The discounted hotel rate expires 1 
February.  http://www.w3.org/2002/10/allgroupoverview.html

I will post a more detailed agenda of the WAI glossary meeting asap.

Thank you,
--wendy
