Lisa Seeman prepared this for WAI/PF as a background piece to fill a need
arising out of some of our work with format groups.

In order to foster discussion with multiple communities who share no agreed
private space, we are sharing this in public.

It is intended to be thought-provoking, not prescriptive of a particular
course of action or set of constraints on action.  But it does appear to
shed light on what is an action opportunity that would benefit all of us,
and particularly some people with some disabilities will find the web rather
inaccessible unless some progress is made in this area.
