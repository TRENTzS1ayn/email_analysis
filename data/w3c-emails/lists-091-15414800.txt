One more suggestion.  (I think someone else may have mentioned this problem 
also, but I'm not sure.)

Some messages show up in the archives with very long lines, which are hard 
to read.  Example: 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-ws-arch/2003May/0215.html
For message display, it would be helpful to have an easy way to display the 
message with long lines wrapped.  This can be done crudely with 
http://cgi.w3.org/cgi-bin/html2txt .  For example, if the previous URL is 
fed into html2txt, it produces: 
http://cgi.w3.org/cgi-bin/html2txt?url=http%3A%2F%2Flists.w3.org%2FArchives%2FPublic%2Fwww-ws-arch%2F2003May%2F0215.html

I would suggest an option, perhaps in the upper right of the message page:

         Long lines: [ Wrap ] [ Don't wrap ]

Furthermore, it would be easiest if "Wrap" were the default, since that is 
probably the more common need.

However, if you don't want to wrap by default, then it would be nice to at 
least provide a "Wrap long lines" link on the message page to easily 
display a wrapped version.

Thanks!
