we had better fix this.

We should also discuss the relative merits of schema languages which do 
enable mixing, or can be easily extended.

I thought that you could do this if you included a DTD fragment as well 
that allowed it? Otherwise you need to leave out the doctype, and use a 
schema-based version such as 1.2, no?

Cheers
