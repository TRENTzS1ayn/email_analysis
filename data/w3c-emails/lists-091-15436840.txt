Actually, after I made this comment I looked closer at the
SVG specification (a typical "act first, think later" strategy).

I think I was wrong, you can be valid SVG if you include
other namespaces (as long as the XML is valid of course).
The spec says something like: chuck out everything that
isn't SVG, and if what's left is valid, then you are ok.

I leave the schema issue to someone else, although we are currently
discussing schema languages in a few working groups.
