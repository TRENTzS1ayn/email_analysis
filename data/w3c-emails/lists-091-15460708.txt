I love vapo(u)rware announcements, it's so much like reading science 
fiction. At my first F2F WAI meeting in Austin the folks with the latest 
"kiss your keyboard goodbye" iteration of voice recognition systems took 
umbrage when I proclaimed that this kind of stuff had been "six months 
away" for thirty years - until they tried to convince themselves of it 
working even while they didn't use it.

At least there's not much chance that we'll discontinue our efforts to 
provide "traditional accessibility" because a "cure for blindness" is just 
around the corner.
