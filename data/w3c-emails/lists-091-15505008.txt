I just reviewed http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-turingtest-20031105/ and would
like to comment a couple of the proposed solutions. The Federated Identity
Systems provide the ability for people to identify themselves to a Web site,
and implicitly to identify that they are human, not a robot. A concern with
this is that it requires the user to identify themselves uniquely, not
simply prove they are human, which is the goal. This raises a privacy
concern, that you must identify yourself to the maintainer of a free
resource that otherwise allows anonymous access to humans. While some
resources, by their nature, require specific identifying information, others
can (even should) permit anonymous access and the Turing test should support
that. 

I propose that this consideration be included in the commentary in a future
draft.
