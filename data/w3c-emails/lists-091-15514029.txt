Good point.

Proving which human you are can be a_fortiori used to prove that you are a
human, but the information so released could be abused on the receiving end.

Ways to fix this include:

-- attribute certificates

The site that knows you doesn't really pass your identity to its federation
partner, just pass to them or back through you a certificate that you are a
known quantity meeting the terms of service of the partner.

These can be one-time tickets, and they can require a login-like authentication
per issue (like repeating your adminstrator password to do installs in Apple
OS X) and they can be limited to one per minute and ten per day or something
like that so that they can't be extracted in bulk by an abuser.

-- machine-to-machine communication

Human user receiving a challenge by mail forwards, by mail, the challenge
to their agent than negotiates credentials with the agent of the other party
by Web Services or SMIME.

So there are two forks to following up on this observation:

a) Find out from those needing the defenses just how tight they feel they
need to be with "humans only" or "one to a customer" constraints.  How much
could we relax those and they can still get on with life?

b) Examine the proposals dealing with identity federation to see if they
actually pass sensitive data or perform a "need to know" test and only
release [as certified] what the recipient needs to know.  Patients have to
sign medical release forms.

To get on somebody's "known email senders" list you are probably quite happy
to be identified, at least in human terms, to that party.  You shouldn't
have to jump through a hoop for a website, there should be some other way to
qualify, not to go directly to their "known email senders" list but to their
inbox for screening.  Get you admitted for the person employing the spam
defense to read your .sig / bio / vcard and say 'yes.'

My favorite pipe dream on the spam front is to apply economic pressure.
Make the unrecognized person requesting access to your inbox pony up a
deposit.  If the recipient considers the message a spam, they keep the
deposit.  If they say the message is OK, the sender keeps the deposit.
It's that simple.  Would separate advertisers that people welcome from
spammers who live off the unrealistically free cost of IP.
