This is related to the problem that IMS approached in profiling - 
people don't want to give away more information than is required for a 
particular purpose. P3P also had to address this issue. In principle a 
federated identity system should allow for this flexibility.

But there is nothing to prevent people from generating a million 
federated identities automatically. I have created federated identities 
for non-existent people without much difficulty - unless you have a 
reliable certification authority this will continue to allow spammers 
to do so.

There are also potential serious security concerns raised by federated 
identity systems in current deployment...

But Al's pipe dream is my paranoid nightmare. When someone in a small 
business in Columbia writes to me in the fervent hope that I will look 
at Blindux, the idea that they should put up a deposit that I can just 
decide to keep is going to be a large disincentive. But not to have 
discovered that the system exists would have cost me a great deal.
