Dear Sirs,
Having read the above paper I would like to point out a couple  of failings about the page.
1. there is poor page navigation, due to the lack of links back to the top of the page and back to the Table of Contents.
2. Some of the links over run a single line when viewed in either 'medium' or 'largest' print size. such over runs an make a page difficult for those using voice readers etc.
best regards

David Croft
