Something that has come up at least in the contexts of HTML forms 
(where Jaws implemented a special trick), Xforms, and XML events, is a 
need to explain what a control does, from a link, which is usually 
obvious, to a button that activates interesting events.

I am wondering if we should be proposing a specific requirement for 
interactions that they explain what they do. (In a way this is 
extending the "make sure it's clear where a link goes" and "make sure 
form controls are labelled" for HTML).

This strikes me as related to checkpoint 3.4 "Use a device-independent 
interaction and events model / module" in the current draft, but not 
part of that draft.

One technique is to re-use Xforms and XML events that have these. 
Another that I think is less relevant to XAG and more relevant to 
legacy formats is to use an annotation mechanism to add them to 
existing controls - I will write more on this.

cheers
