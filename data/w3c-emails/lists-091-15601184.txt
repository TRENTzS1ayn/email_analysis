-1.

reasons: We haven't got any agreement on what final form 'means'
in words that don't leave someone uncomfortable.
Similarly I'm not happy with "a specific device or delivery context, "
I'd generally assumed that [information] is delivered to people,
rather than machines. The 'delivery context' is something I agree
with, but I can see others have various definitions of it.

My rough definition of delivery context is a person, having
specified their own media preferences, for a specific instance.

Surely the device is only a part of that context? 
E.g. a pc with tts, a DAISY player, an embosser, plain text in
an editor or whatever. The device is hence a tool which is used
by the recipient in this specific case?

How to put that back into Charles proposal I'm less sure :-)
