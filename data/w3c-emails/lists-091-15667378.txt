The Unicode Technical Committee has sent the I18N WG the
following review request. I think the Braille issue is of
interest to WAI. Please send comments back to the I18N IG
or directly use the report form on the Unicode Web site.
Also, please feel free to forward as appropriate.
(the review is public)

Regards,    Martin.
