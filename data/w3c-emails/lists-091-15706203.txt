http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/metadata.html#Example  wasn't that helpful 
to me.

Do people have examples of how to include (html type) meta descriptions 
or keywords in SVG? is one allowed to?
RDF seems quite a large if useful, step to have to make. A few simple 
RDF example graphics might also be helpful.

What is the situation where a single graphic is being used in 2 or 3 
different contexts, and the meta tagging needs to reflect this.

an example of the type of thing I have in mind is the single graphic of 
a newscaster in 3 places:

http://www.peepo.co.uk  as a placeholder for our news

http://www.peepo.com/alfi-x/reading.html  for news to read

http://www.peepo.com/alfi-x/tv.html  for video news

evidently it would be helpful if some metadata could be stored within 
the <use> graphic, however probably additional material could be stored 
on each page.

To keep the coding short this example is intended to reflect the use of 
a single graphic [triangle] to represent "play sound" or "play video" 
dependent on context.

<g >
<title>play</title>
<meta name="description" content="video"
<use xlink:href="../res/030831.svg#next" />
</g>

<g >
<title>play</title>
<meta name="description" content="sound"
<use xlink:href="../res/030831.svg#next" />
</g>

<g id="next">
<meta name="description" content="play">
<polygon fill="#cca" stroke="black" stroke-width="5"
             points="55,10  55,140 115,75" />
</g>

evidently in this example a better title could suffice, however in the 
real world it is necessary to provide extended search terms whilst 
limiting titles, and for a given graphic it is likely that many search 
terms will be common, but some will be context dependent.


My apologies if this is not as clear as it needs to be

thanks
