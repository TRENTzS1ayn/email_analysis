Interesting questions...

Some thoughts: You can't just add attributes to the metadata element in 
SVG. You could write a DTD for a derivative that does allow this, and 
write an XSLT or Xform that generates valid SVG using RDF inside the 
metadata element (and for that matter we could make it DTD-valid as 
well as schema-valid if we know in advance what kinds of metadata you 
are going to use).

A few samples would indeed be helpful, and I wish I had some spare 
time. You could always hire me - I'm more expensive than a student 
intern though. Or search the Web for stuff...

With your examples you have  simple label (play) and a complex label 
(play video). You might use the desc element to provide a longer 
description of the functionality - it seems that the interaction model 
is only partially built into SVG, and there isn't the sort of "label", 
"help" stuff separated from information about the graphic components of 
the interface that you would get by integrating Xforms into SVG to 
build the interface...

Alternatively, I don't think your particular example models very well 
what you are trying to do. It strongly suggests just using the desc 
element, but you might instead consider extending the use element 
(which is effectively an Xlink) with more stuff from Xlink, such as the 
role attribute...
