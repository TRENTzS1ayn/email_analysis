I liked this bit.

Mark Birbeck: It's impossible for any browser vendor to keep up. There's no
point in having an ever-increasing list of mime media types, we need to go
the opposite way. Build in support on the client end for the different
namespaces, a has-feature attribute or something.

This is providing locally the older Als ingenious idea, which we had
remotely?

The issued picked up by TimBL is interesting. Does the user/his software,
have to 
differentiate between SVG in a root ns of HTML and SVG in a root ns of SMIL?
Should
an applications action on meeting ns X always be the same or can it vary
dependent on
context?

This idea of required features, is it an application that responds to a
metadata
statement that an app must have required feature A,B and C? Fallbacks?
quote. timbl in IRC: I don't think that the mixed namespace can be done in
general, but can be done within an application area. unquote.

In other words, I'm OK if I know what to expect, but don't throw me a
googly? That makes
sense.

sean in IRC: The problem as I see it is we are applying tools like schema
which work at the syntax level to semantic issues. (then later) ....But
combining unknown semantics is undefined.


Good point. Its no good an application saying 'I can hack SVG', it needs to
say I can do
this with that 'class' of SVG or subset of SVG or to say that it can digest
this semantic.
The point about soap carrying a purchase order is a good example. How might
this semantic
be captured? Our area of interest is identical. A webpage with animated SVG
is not 
dissimilar. The metadata needs to say that to grok this page, you must be
able to process
(whatever that means to you) an animated SVG image. 

How on earth do you capture that in metadata!

Good read. Thanks Al.
