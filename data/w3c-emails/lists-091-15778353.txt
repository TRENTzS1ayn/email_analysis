Would they be interested in a session exploring  the relationship
between that an accessibility?

All the best

> The President's Management Agenda (PMA) requires all federal

> citizen-centered government.  The PMA emphasizes bringing 
> value and productivity results to citizens, businesses, and 
> public managers.
> 
> How can vast government holdings, together with the stewards 
> of these holdings, become better knowledge assets for both 
> researchers and citizens? How can the evolution toward open 
> standards-based, interoperable "discovery" tools multiply the 
> value of these "intangible assets" to researchers, 
> businesses, and interested citizens?  How can we organize 
> around "multiple meanings" to accommodate a diversity of  
> perspectives, over time, and across languages, while 
> navigating "oceans of data and information"?  How can the 
> emerging technologies of the Semantic Web, Web Services, and 
> Grid Computing improve how we organize, learn and share 
> public "Knowledge Assets" throughout society?  How can the 
> collective understanding that emerges from this process 
> contribute to the maturation of the Federal Enterprise 
> Architecture and other Knowledge Management Strategies?
