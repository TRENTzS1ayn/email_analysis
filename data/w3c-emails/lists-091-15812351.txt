What about CC/PP?

> User examples:
>
> Jon has the following user preferences:
>
> *All   contact us  links are  designated  the access key "c"
> *The site map links are  designated  the access key of "s"
> *Any main menu items get numeric access keys so he can easily
> jump to them -in this case the products page is designated   an access
> key of "3"
> *Alt M always takes Jon to the start of the main content
>
>
>
> Anna also has user preference for access keys
>
> For her  the site map links are  designated  the access key of "k"
> -which is the first letter of site map in Russian (karta saita) That is
> because her first language  is not English but Russian
>

> Tom scenario is very different.

> *Tom prefers symbols to text when possible. He does not use
> access keys
> *All contact us links are represented by the same picture of an
> email/letter
> *All site map links are rendered as a picture of a map
> *All main menu items are buttons on the top of the page, and side menu
