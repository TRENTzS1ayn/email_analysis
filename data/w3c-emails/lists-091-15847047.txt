Hi Lisa,

Access keys is only a piece of the story.

This is something I have wanted to do for some time. One of the stumbling
blocks was implementation in desktop browsers. We may be able to get this
into Mozilla if we put a good design together. ... Also, we need to start
considering preferences on the server.

What we do here should also be reproduceable through a web service.

We should put a roadmap together to address this. For example, we need to
determine what is the standard for preferences stored on the server. The
IMS Global Learning Consortium has been looking at stored preferences. We
should put a work effort together to compare the total.

We need to put a roadmap together for this.

Ahh, Ok I am with you now.
Yes I am bugging them about it.

The DI group have allocated someone the task of looking at this stuff :)

It may be a way of getting great adoption and scope for accessibility

All the best
