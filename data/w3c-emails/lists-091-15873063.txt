Yes,
The IMS folks are reviewing this too, and making sure this meets their
needs.

Hi Lisa,

Access keys is only a piece of the story. 

This is something I have wanted to do for some time. One of the
stumbling blocks was implementation in desktop browsers. We may be able
to get this into Mozilla if we put a good design together. ... Also, we
need to start considering preferences on the server. 

What we do here should also be reproduceable through a web service.

We should put a roadmap together to address this. For example, we need
to determine what is the standard for preferences stored on the server.
The IMS Global Learning Consortium has been looking at stored
preferences. We should put a work effort together to compare the total. 

We need to put a roadmap together for this.

Ahh, Ok I am with you now.
Yes I am bugging them about it.

The DI group have allocated someone the task of looking at this stuff :)

It may be a way of getting great adoption and scope for accessibility

All the best
