Afghan revolutionaries to participate in the Anti-Imperialist Camp!


The Afghanistan Liberation Organisation (ALO) has announced its support and participation of this year?s anti-imperialist camp in Assisi, Italy, scheduled to take place from July 28 to August 5. 

ALO has been struggling for the socialist transformation of this war-ravaged country for more than 25 years. Afghanistan is one of the poorest counties in the world due to two decades of a devastating civil war combined with several severe droughts. Today it faces a hunger crisis and already millions have flown war and starvation filling the refugee camps of the neighbouring countries. 

Unfortunately the revolutionary process that involved both the intellectuals as well as the popular masses gaining momentum in the 70ies was led to an impasse and eventually was damaged by the Soviet Russian military intervention. As a result the Islamic reactionary forces backed by Pakistan and the US finally could seize power and establish its fundamentalist terrorist regime destroying any independent political move of the popular masses transforming the country into a Pakistani puppet regime for the US strategic aims in the region.

Though hit hard by those awkward circumstances ALO is still carrying on its struggle both in Afghanistan as well as in the camps. We are proud to have these communist revolutionaries with us giving an eyewitness report from Afghanistan and explaining there struggle.
