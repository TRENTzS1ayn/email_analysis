I can't change old references in archived email. Especially ones that 
aren't written by me. I think this is the architectural point behind 
http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI

It is fundamental to the web actually working for some useful amount of 
time. Which should explain why selling domain names competitively has 
fairly interesting (detrimental) implications for the Web.
