Sorry Charles

Wasn?t asking you (or anyone) to change past mail.   Just wanted anyone who
had that address to know that it was no longer good and to change their
records -- not the W3C listserv records

I can't change old references in archived email. Especially ones that 
aren't written by me. I think this is the architectural point behind 
http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI

It is fundamental to the web actually working for some useful amount of 
time. Which should explain why selling domain names competitively has 
fairly interesting (detrimental) implications for the Web.
