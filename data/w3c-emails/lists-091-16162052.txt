The presentation at

http://www.adlnet.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=rcdetails&libid=432

Discusses an approach to 'experience adaptation' using the environment
information per the IMS ACLIP schema.

www.imsproject.org/accessibility/index.cfm

It is the latter schema which should be considered a serious proposal
in terms of a schema covering both the device environment (on a PC
with assistive capabilities installed) and user preferences.  This comes
from the education domain.

In other words, experimental use of this vocabulary in CC/PP to inform server-based adaptation would be a good thing to do, and if there are
proposals for a 'universal' schema characterizing the delivery context,
it should be defended by an analysis of how it handles these factors.
