For the record:

I was unable to find a changelog for the WAI Glossary:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/Glossary/printable.html

Here are changelog notes that we recorded from the EOWG f2f meetings at
the Technical Plenary last week
(http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/2004/03f2f.html):

- for simple glossary, list only one definition, instead of multiple
definitions from different documents (e.g., one definition of
accessibility)
- yet, don't lose the old mega version that has lots of different
definitions from different documents in one place

If you know of a changelog for the WAI Glossary, feel free to add these
items, or tell me where it is and I will add them.
