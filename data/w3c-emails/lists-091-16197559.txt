I thought this link might be of interest here...

http://www.intersmash.com/300images/ is doing the rounds in the weblog
world. It lists a lot of icons (300) that are used in 1800 sites for 
navigation. I'm reminded of discussions with Jonathan Chetwyn 
and Lisa Seeman about site navigation conventions, metadata, and
icons...

http://www.intersmash.com/300images/ is interesting as a hint at what a 
more comprehensive survey of site navigation conventions (textual and
visual) might achieve. Doubtless there's more out there, but I don't
know of a good overview of such work yet.
