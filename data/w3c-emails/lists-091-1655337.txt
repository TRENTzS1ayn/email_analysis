ABOUT CAIRNS AND PALM COVE:
Centrally located between Cairns City and Port Douglas, and bordered by 
sprawling white beaches and luscious mountain ranges, Palm Cove is only 20 
minutes from Cairns, but could almost be a world away. 

The 1984 opening of The Cairns International Airport sparked the 
development of Palm Cove, from a 'locals' beach to the resort beach it is 
today. Since the first internationally managed resort property opened in 
Palm Cove in 1986, over 15 resorts have been developed accommodating over 
650 000 visitors each year. 

The village is the ideal location for serious relaxation but, for the 
adventurous, diving, sailing, bungy jumping, hot air ballooning, white 
water rafting, sky diving and safari tours are also easily accessible. 

But when you stay at Novotel Palm Cove Resort, you need not leave the 
property to enjoy golf, tennis, gym, aerobics, cycling or squash and you 
can do it all while the kids are having fun at the resort's exclusive Dolfi 
Kids Club.

If you'd like to combine a little more fitness with your fun, a visit to 
the Dive Shop means you can enjoy a variety of watersports including 
windsurfing, catamaran sailing, scuba diving and paddleboarding. 

After a day of activity, or decadent relaxation, the resort offers three 
fabulous dining options, including the award winning Paperbark Restaurant 
or there is always the option of experiencing the nightlife of Palm Cove 
Village, where the dining and entertainment options are endless.
