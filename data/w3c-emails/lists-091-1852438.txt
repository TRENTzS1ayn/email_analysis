Hi

My name is Patrick Foley. I have been testing software that runs over the
internet for almost one year now.

As part of my job I have been asked to research this document
http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/wai-pageauth.html. I can safely say
that this is the most unusible and non-accessible web site that I have ever
seen. The site is a labyrinth.

To make my job easier, could you please tell me how to read all Prioity 1
chechpoints and corresponding guidelines/techniques, without geting lost or
reading the same material over and over again.

Thank You

     Patrick
