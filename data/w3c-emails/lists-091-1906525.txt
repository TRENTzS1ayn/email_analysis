Dear Business Owner,

eStoreKeeper is aimed at Retail business owners that want to manage their
stores from the Internet.  The software is a complete Retail Management
package that allows you to track employees, inventory, sales, etc. from
anywhere in the world.  Would you like to see what your sales are at any
momement in time?  Would you like to see your inventory at any momement in
time?  If you have multiple stores, all sales, inventory, timesheets, etc
are rolled up in to one simple reporting tool for you to see a snapshot of
each store's activity.  All of your data is real time.  eStoreKeeper is
totally web-based and customizable to meet your company's needs.  Since it
is Internet driven, you don't need to wait for a CD or diskette in the
mail for any customizations or software updates.  In addition, reduce
inventory shrinkage by checking on employees with a web camera installed
in your stores.

We invite you to take a test drive of the software at
www.eCampaignStrategies.com and click on our Products tab.

Please feel free to contact us if you would like more information.  We can
also share with you our success with small business owners who are using
our product.  Our sales department can be reached at
sales@ecampaignstrategies.com or 504-473-6501.

Sincerely,

Mark Delhom
