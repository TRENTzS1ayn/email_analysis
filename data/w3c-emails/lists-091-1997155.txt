Rebellion is necessary!
Assisi, Italy, July 28 ? August 5

****************

The Struggle for national liberation is still alive in Europe!

Forum on the struggle against internal colonialism and for national liberation in Europe during the Anti-imperialist Camp!

Various European organisations for national liberation are going participate in this Forum: from Sardinia to Euskal Herria, from Ireland to Catalonia, from Corsica to Galicia. They will discuss the meaning of national liberation in Europe in the period of capitalist globalisation, as well as the relation between national and social liberation and the role of independentist organisations in the framework of an Anti-imperialist Front against globalisation. 

With this Forum the Anti-imperialist Camp wants to draw the attention on the oppressed people in Europe, who must not be forgotten by the anti-globalisation movements. The struggles of the oppressed people are still among the best examples of popular resistance against:
-the annihilation of peoples? sovereignty, 
-the neo-liberalist monopoly of thought
-NATO militarism and humanitarian bombs
-?colonial internationalism? through globalisation
for:
-free sovereign and socialist nations
-autonomous and free peoples? identity and culture 
-a world where nations have the right of self-determination and where free people can foster relations of solidarity and equality
