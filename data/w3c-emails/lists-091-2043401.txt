Check out this GREAT site called http://www.blackretail.com.

We have music, movies, electronics, books, flowers, sporting goods and much
more.  Our site is one of the largest Black owned shopping sites and was
launched on April 15, 2001.  The best part about our site is that 5% of its
profits are donated to charitable causes that support African American
communities.  Please help us make this site a success by visiting often and
forwarding our url to everyone you know.  Also, by just telling three
friends about this site you could win a Digital Camera. 

We plan to make our first donation in July 2001.  Your support is greatly
appreciated in making a meaningful first donation. 

Thanks a million for helping us make this site a success.
