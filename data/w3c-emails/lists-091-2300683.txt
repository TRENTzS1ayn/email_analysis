I work on a converged television/Internet programmed called "Tech."  Next
week we will be having a show about speech technology and disability and
wanted to talk a bit about your organization and website.  Could you please
give me authorization to use the content on your website on both our digital
television and internet programmes?  Specifically, the pages we would like
to use are http://www.w3.org/ and http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/.

If you would like to know more about the programme before giving approval,
please see our website at http://www.now.com/tech.

Thank you,

Steve Drake
