First, I must solicit your confidence in this transaction, this is by virtue of its nature as being utterly CONFIDENTIAL and TOP SECRET.

We have decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction, as we have been reliably informed   of your disecretness and ability in transactions of this nature.

Let me start by first introducing myself  properly to you.  I am DR. ABBAS BABA, a director with the Union Bank of Nigeria Plc, Lagos.   I came to know of you in my private search for a reliable and reputable person to handle this confidential transaction which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account requiring maximum confidence.

THE PROPOSITION:
A foreigner, Engineer Johnson Creek, an Oil Merchant/Contractor with the Federal Government of Nigeria, until his death three years ago in a ghastly air crash, banked with us here at Union Bank Plc, Lagos and had a balance of USD$12.5m (Twelve Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) which the bank now unquestionably expects it to be claimed by any available foreign next-of-kin of the late beneficiary or alternatively be donated to a discredited trust fund for arms and ammunition at a military war college here in Nigeria.  Fervent valuable efforts are being made by the Union Bank to get in touch with any  of the Creeks family or relatives but proved to no avail.

It is because of the perceived possibility of not being able to locate any of late Engr. Johnson Creeks next-of-kin (he had no wife and children) that the management under the influence of our Chairman and member of the board of directors, retired Major General Kalu Uke Kalu, that an arrangement be made for the funds to be declared UNCLAIMABLE and subsequently be donated to the Trust Fund for Arms and Ammunition to further enhance the course of war in Africa and the world in general in order to avert this negative development, some of my trusted colleagues and I now seek your permission to have you stand as a next of-kin to late Engr. Johnson Creek so that the funds USD$12.5m would be released and paid into your bank account as the beneficiarys next-of-kin.  All documents and proofs to enable you get this fund will be carefully worked out and more so we are assuring you of a 100% risk free involvement.  Your share stays while the rest would be for myself and my colleagues
 for investment purposes in your country.

We have agreed that, the funds will be shared thus, after it has been transferred into your account.

1. 30% of the money will go to you for acting as the beneficiary of the funds.
2. 10% will be set aside for  reimbursement to both parties for any incidental expenses that may be incurred in the course of the transfer.
3. 60% to us the originators of the transaction.
If this proposal is OK by you and you do not  wish to take undue advantage of the trust we hope to bestow on you and your company, then kindly get me immediately via my Direct Fax#234-9-2720239 furnishing me with your most confidential telephone, fax number and exclusive bank particulars so that I can use these information to apply for the release and subsequent transfer of the funds in your favour.

Yours faithfully,
