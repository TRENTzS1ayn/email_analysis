Hello, if receiving bulk emails upsets you, I apologize. You won't receive another one from me. However if your vaguely interested in an ethical way of generating huge money then read on....

THIS REALLY WORKS!!! 
IT'S TRUE!! PLEASE READ THIS AND SEE, YOU WON'T BE SORRY!! 
YOU SHOULD PRINT THIS, READ IT AND MAKE SOME BIG BUCKS. IT 
HAS WORKED SO WELL, I SPEND ABOUT ONE TO TWO HOURS A DAY 
PROCESSING ORDERS, INCLUDING MY DRIVE TO THE BANK! 
SO GO FOR IT, YOU WILL BE GLAD YOU DID! EARN $100,000 OR MORE PER YEAR 
SENDING E-MAIL!!! 
(A mind Blowing Opportunity) ( Please Read On, Don't Delete This ) 
I felt compelled to share this with anyone interested in 
spending more time with their families, instead of at work. 
It's an interesting story - Read it all & see what I mean. 
================================================================ 
"Parents of 15-year old find $71,000 cash hidden in his closet." 
================================================================ 
Does this headline look familiar? 
Of course it does. You most likely have seen this story recently 
featured on a major nightly news program (USA). 
This 15 year old's mother was cleaning and putting laundry away 
when she came across a large brown paper bag that was 
suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the 
back of her 15-year-old son's closet. Nothing could have prepared 
her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it 
was full of cash. Five dollar bills, twenties, fifties and 
hundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in labeled piles. 
"My first thought was that he had robbed a bank", says the 
41-year-old woman, "There was over $71,000 dollars in that 
bag- that's more than my husband earns in a year". 
The woman immediately called her husband at the car dealership 
where he worked to tell him what she'd discovered. He came 
home right away and they drove together to the boy's school 
and picked him up. Little did they suspect that where the money 
came from was more shocking than actually finding it in the 
closet. 
As it turns out, the boy had been sending out via E-mail on the 
Internet a type of 'chain-letter' to E-mail addresses that he 
got off of the Internet. Everyday after school for the past 2 
months, he had been doing this right on his computer in his 
bedroom. 
"I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the heck, I 
Sent five dollars to four people for the Reports, put my name on 
it like the instructions said and I started sending it out", says 
the clever 15-year-old. The Reports I received for my 20 dollars 
were fantastic. 
The E-mail letter listed 4 addresses and contained instructions 
to send one $5 dollar bill to each of the 4 individuals. These 
individuals would in turn e-mail me the 4 Reports. Put your name 
and mailing info in the number one position, move the number 
two person to position #3 Move the third person to the 4th 
position. The letter goes on to state that you would receive 
several thousand dollars in five dollar bills within 2 weeks if 
you sent out the letter with your name in the number one position. 
"I get junk E-mail all the time, and I really didn't think it was 
gonna work", the boy continues. 
Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail, the Post 
Office Box that his parents had gotten him for his video-game 
magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines, 
but envelopes containing $5 dollar bills. 
"About a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post office 
and my box had 1 magazine and about 300 envelopes stuffed 
in it. There was also a yellow slip that said I had to go up to 
the [post office] counter- I thought I was in trouble or some- 
thing (laughs)". He goes on, "I went up to the counter and 
they had a whole box of more mail for me. 
Over the next few weeks, the boy continued sending out the 
E-mail. "The money just kept coming in and I just kept sorting 
it and stashing it in the closet, I barely had time for my 
homework". He had also been riding his bike to several of the 
area's banks and exchanging the $5 bills for twenties, fifties 
and hundreds. "I didn't want the banks to get suspicious so I 
kept riding to different banks with like five thousand at a time 
in my backpack. I would usually tell the lady at the bank counter 
that my dad had sent me in [to exchange the money] and he was 
outside waiting for me. 
Surprisingly, the boy didn't have any reason to be afraid. The 
reporting news team examined and investigated the so-called 
'chain-letter' the boy was sending out and found that it wasn't a 
chain-letter at all. In fact, it was completely legal according 
to US Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18, Section 1302 and 1341, 
or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code, also in the code of 
federal regulations, Volume 16, Sections 255 and 436, which 
state a product or service must be exchanged for money received. 
Every five dollar bill that he received, he immediately sent out 
the report requested. This Report made the letter legal because 
he was exchanging a service (Sending a Report requested) for a 
five dollar fee. 
The Reports that you will receive and eventually send out, are 
the power behind the program. They include insider tips and 
techniques for cost effective promotion. These Reports are 
very comprehensive and will allow you to build and promote 
any business product or service on the internet. 
You have just read the letter that the 15-year-old was sending 
out by E-mail, you can do the exact same thing he was doing, 
simply by following the instructions in this letter.

----------------------------------------------------------------- 
There are two primary methods of building your downline: 
METHOD # 1: SENDING BULK E-MAIL 
Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it 
goes, and we'll assume you and all those involved send out only 
2,000 programs each. Let's also assume that the mailing receives 
a 0.5% response. Using a good list the response could be much 
better. Also, many people will send out hundreds of thousands 
of programs instead of 2,000. But continuing with this example, 
you send out only 2,000 programs. With a 0.5% response, that is 
only 10 orders for REPORT # 1. Those 10 people respond by sending 
out 2,000 programs each for a total of 20,000. Out of those 0.5%, 
100 people respond and order REPORT # 2. Those 100 mail out 2,000 
programs each for a total of 200,000. The 0.5% response to that 
are 1,000 orders for REPORT # 3. Those 1,000 send out 2,000 
programs each for a 2,000,000 total. 
The 0.5% response to that are 10,000 orders for REPORT # 4. 
That's 10,000 $5 bills for you. CASH!!! Your total income in this 
example is $50 + $500 + $5,000 + $50,000 for a total of $55,550! 
!! REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING 1,990 OUT OF THE 2,000 PEOPLE 
YOU MAIL TO WILL DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AND TRASH THIS PROGRAM! 
DARE TO THINK FOR A MOMENT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF EVERYONE, OR HALF 
SENT OUT 100, 000 PROGRAMS INSTEAD OF 2,000. Believe me, many 
people will do just that, and more! By the way, your cost to 
participate in this is practically nothing. You obviously already 
have an Internet connection and e-mail is FREE!!! 
METHOD # 2 - PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET 
Advertising on the Internet is very, very inexpensive, and there 
are HUNDREDS of FREE places to advertise. Let's say you decide to 
start small just to see how well it works. Assume your goal is 
to get ONLY 10 people to participate on your first level. 
(Placing a lot of FREE ads on the Internet will EASILY get a 
larger response.) Also assume that everyone else in YOUR 
ORGANIZATION gets ONLY 10 downline members. Follow this example 
to achieve the STAGGERING results below: 
1st level--your 10 members with 
$5.......................................$50 
2nd level--10 members from those 10 
($5 x 100)..................$500 
3rd level--10 members from those 100 
($5 x 1,000)...........$5,000 
4th level--10 members from those 1,000 
($5 x 10,000).....$50,000 
THIS TOTALS ----------$55,550 
REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING 1,990 OUT OF THE 2,000 
PEOPLE YOU MAIL TO WILL DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AND TRASH 
THIS PROGRAM! DARE TO THINK FOR A MOMENT WHAT WOULD 
HAPPEN IF EVERYONE, OR HALF SENT OUT 100,000 PROGRAMS 
INSTEAD OF 2,000. Believe me, many people will do just that, and more! By the 
way, your cost to 
participate in this is practically nothing. You obviously already have an 
internet connection and e-mail is 
FREE !!! 
REPORT #2 will show you the best methods for bulk e-mailing, tell you where 
to obtain free bulk e-mail 
software and where to obtain e-mail lists. 
THINK ABOUT IT! For every $5.00 you receive, all you must do is 
e-mail them the report they ordered. THAT'S IT! ALWAYS PROVIDE 
SAME-DAY SERVICE ON ALL ORDERS! This will guarantee that the 
e-mail THEY send out with YOUR name and address on it will be 
prompt because they can't advertise until they receive the report! 
------------- 
INSTRUCTIONS: 
------------- 
This method of raising capital REALLY WORKS 100% EVERY TIME. I am sure 
that you could use up to $50,000 or more in the next 90 days. 
Before you say "BULL... ", please read this program carefully. This is not a 
chain letter, but a perfectly legal 
money making opportunity. Basically, this is what you do: As with all 
multi-level businesses, we build our 
business by recruiting new partners and selling our products. Every state in 
the USA allows you to recruit 
new multi-level business partners, and we offer a product for EVERY dollar 
sent. 
YOUR ORDERS COME BY MAIL AND ARE FILLED BY E-MAIL, so you are 
not involved in personal selling. You do it privately in your own home, store 
or office. 
This is the GREATEST Multi-Level Mail Order Marketing anywhere: This is what 
you MUST do: 
1. Order all 4 reports shown on the list below (you can't sell them if you 
don't order them). 
* For each report, send $5.00 CASH, the NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE 
ORDERING, YOUR E- 
MAIL AND ADDRESS, YOUR NAME & RETURN ADDRESS (in case of a problem) and to 
the person whose 
name appears on the list next to the report. 
MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE IN CASE OF ANY MAIL 
PROBLEMS! 
* When you place your order, make sure you order each of the four reports. 
You will need all four reports 
so that you can save them on your computer and resell them. 
* Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the four reports. 
Save them on your computer so 
they will be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will 
order them from you. 
2. IMPORTANT-- DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to 
each report, or their 
sequence on the list, in any way other than is instructed below in steps "a" 
through "f" or you will lose out 
on the majority of your profits. Once you understand the way this works, 
you'll also see how it doesn't 
work if you change it. Remember, this method has been tested, and if you 
alter it, it will not work. 
a. Look below for the listing of available reports. 
b. After you've ordered the four reports, take this Advertisement and remove 
the name and address under 
REPORT #4. This person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting 
their $50,000! 
c. Move the name and address under REPORT #3 down to REPORT #4. 
d. Move the name and address under REPORT #2 down to REPORT #3. 
e. Move the name and address under REPORT #1 down to REPORT #2. 
f. Insert your name/address in the REPORT #1 position. 
Please make sure you copy every name and address ACCURATELY! 
3. Take this entire letter, including the modified list of names, and save it 
to your computer. Make NO 
changes to the Instruction portion of this letter. 
Your cost to participate in this is practically nothing (surely you can 
afford $20). You obviously already 
have an Internet Connection and e-mail is FREE!

******* T E S T I M O N I A L S ******* 
This program does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY! Especially the rule 
of not trying to place your 
name in a different 
position, it won't work and you'll lose a lot of potential income. I'm living 
proof that it works. It really is a great 
opportunity to make relatively easy money, with little cost to you. If you do 
choose to participate, follow the 
program exactly, and you'll be on your way to financial security.

My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody, and I live in Chicago, IL. I am a cost 
accountant with a major U.S. 
Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I received the program I 
grumbled to Jody about receiving 
"junk mail." I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the 
population and percentages 
involved. I "knew" it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed 
intelligence and jumped in with both 
feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old "I told you 
so" on her when the thing didn't 
work... well, the laugh was on me! Within two weeks she had received over 50 
responses. Within 45 days 
she had 
received over $147,200 in $5 bills! I was shocked! I was sure that I had it 
all figured and that it wouldn't 
work. I AM a believer now. I have joined Jody in her "hobby." I did have 
seven more years until retirement, 
but I think of the "rat race" and it's not for me. We owe it all to MLM.

The main reason for this letter is to convince you that this system is 
honest, lawful, extremely profitable, 
and is a way to get a large amount of money in a short time. I was approached 
several times before I 
checked this out. I joined just to see what one could 
expect in return for the minimal effort and money required. To my 
astonishment, I received $36,470.00 in the 
first 14 weeks, with money still coming in.

************************************************************ 
Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind to 
participate in this plan. But 
conservative that I am, I decided that the initial investment was so little 
that there was just no way that I 
wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back. Boy, was I 
surprised when I found my medium- 
size post office box crammed with orders! For awhile, it got so overloaded 
that I had to start picking up my 
mail at the window. I'll make more money this year than any 10 years of my 
life before. The nice thing about 
this deal is that it doesn't matter where people live. There simply isn't a 
better investment with a faster 
return.

************************************************************ 
I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I 
shouldn't have given it a try. Of 
course, I had no idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait 
until I was e-mailed another 
program, ....11 months passed then it came...I didn't delete this one!...I 
made more than $41,000 on the first 
try!! 
Violet Wilson, Johnstown, PA

This is my third time to participate in this plan. We have quit our jobs, and 
will soon buy a home on the 
beach and live off the interest on our money. The only way on earth that this 
plan will work for you is if 
you do it. For your sake, and for your family's sake don't pass up this 
golden opportunity. Good luck and 
happy spending!
