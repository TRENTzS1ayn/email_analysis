Production Mini-plants in mobile containers

By Kimberly Adams, World Trade News, Editor

Science Network has developed an revolutionary production method that is self-contained, immediate, portable, competitive, accessible because it is so cost-
effective, and transportable by any means whatsoever: by land, sea, railroad or air. Science Network will supply to countries and developing regions the technology and the necessary support for the production in series of Mini-plants in mobile containers (40-foot). The Mini-plant system is designed in such a way that all the production machinery is fixed on the platform of the container, with all wiring, piping, and installation parts; that is to say, they are fully equipped... and the mini-plant is ready for production.

More than 700 portable production systems: Bakeries, Steel Nails, Welding Electrodes, Tire Retreading, Reinforcement Bar Bending for Construction Framework, Sheeting for Roofing, Ceilings and Fa?ades, Plated Drums, Aluminum Buckets, Injected Polypropylene Housewares, Pressed Melamine Items (Glasses, Cups, Plates, Mugs, etc.), Mufflers, Construction Electrically Welded Mesh, Plastic Bags and Packaging, Mobile units of medical assistance, Sanitary Material, Hypodermic Syringes, Hemostatic Clamps, etc. 
From a technological standpoint, it is an incontrovertible fact that this system is unique in the global area, aimed at solving very serious problems, starting with that which is most basic: the survival of millions of human beings.

From the social, or rather, human standpoint, it is a technological development targeted from its conceptual beginnings to solve a worldwide immoral disgrace that "statistically" takes on the form of 45,000 dead children a day as a result of hunger, poverty and non-fatal diseases.

It is a tragedy that affects 200 countries and more than 4.5 billion human beings...
