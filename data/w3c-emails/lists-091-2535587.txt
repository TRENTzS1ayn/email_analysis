Support the general strike of the garment workers in Bangladesh

On July 1 the National Garments Workers Federation (NGWF) has called the 1.6 million mainly female workers to a general strike whose success will rock the country. The textile industry has become by far the most important sector of the crisis ridden economy of this extremely poor country and accounts for 76% of the total exports.

The living conditions of the wage slaves keep deteriorating: the minimum wage is USD 14 per month (!) but often paid with delay or even not paid at all, average working time by week is between 80 and 100 hours, no union rights, no basic social rights and services like holidays, maternity leave and on top the usual sexual harassments.

The struggle of the Bengal garments workers centres around the most basic demands like a minimum wage of USD 30, one week holiday per year, health care, education for their children and union rights.

The increasing super-exploitation of the Bangladeshi proletariat is an impact of capitalist globalisation. We call upon all forces who claim to oppose globalisation to support the struggle of those most affected by it ? the workers and poor of the oppressed countries. To fight globalisation means to fight imperialism and capitalism.

Vice versa the NGWF is supporting the anti-imperialist protest meeting against the G8 summit in Italy, scheduled for July 20, 2001 from 2:00 p.m. until the evening, in Piazza della Vittoria, Genoa. See call:

Representatives of anti-imperialist liberation struggles, of workers parties from both the South and the North of the world, of countries subjugated to embargos are going to deliver their speeches reporting about their conditions of life under imperialist and neo-liberalist siege, as well as about their resistance and liberation struggle. This independent anti-imperialist demonstration is of crucial importance for the demonstration of the Genoa Social Forum (GSF) does not want to touch imperialism. They are just calling for a capitalism tamed by the ?civil society?.

Please direct solidarity messages and urgently needed financial donations for the general strike in Bangladesh to the contact address indicated below.
