FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW AND YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL 
COMETRUE; 
GUARANTEED!
INSTRUCTIONS:

======================Order all 5 reports shown on the list 
below=================

For each report, send $5 CASH, the NAME & NUMBER of the report you 
areordering, and YOUR E-MAIL 
ADDRESS to the person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report.
MAKE SURE THAT 
YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON THE ENVELOPE'S TOP LEFT CORNER in case thereare
any mail 
problems.

When you place the order, make sure you order each of the 5 reports.You 
will need all 5 reports so that you 
can save them on your computer and resell them.  YOUR TOTAL COST - $5x5 
reports = $25.

Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the 5 reportsfrom
the 5 individuals on the list.  Save 
them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to 
the1,000's of people who will order them 
from you.  Also, make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your deskin
case something happens.

IMPORTANT:  Do NOT alter the names of the people who are listed nexttoeach 
report, or their sequence 
on the list, in any way, other than what is instructed below in steps1
through 6.  You will lose out on a 
majority of your profits.  Once you understand the way it works, youwill
also see how it does NOT work if you 
alter it.  It ain't broke, don't fix it.  Remember, this method has 
beentested, and if you change it, it won't work, 
as it should.  People have tried to put their friends and relatives nameson
all five thinking they could get all 
the money.  It doesn't work this way.  Believe us . . . we have triedtobe 
greedy and then nothing happened.  
So don't change anything other than what is instructed.  If you do, youwill
minimize your earnings.  Honesty 
reaps the biggest reward in the end.

#1:  After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement 
andREMOVE the name and address of the 
person in Report #5.  This person has made it through the cycle and isno
doubt counting their fortune.

#2:  Move the name and address in Report #4's space down to Report 
#5'sspace.

#3:  Move the name and address in Report #3's space down to Report 
#4'sspace.

#4:  Move the name and address in Report #2's space down to Report 
#3'sspace.

#5:  Move the name and address in Report #1's space down to Report 
#2'sspace.

#6:  Insert YOUR name & address in the Report # 1 position.  Please 
MAKESURE you copy every name & 
address ACCURATELY!

===================================================================

**Take this entire letter, with modified list of names, and save it onyour
computer.  Do NOT make any other 
changes.

Also save this on a disk, as well, just in case the data gets misplaced.To 
assist you with your efforts, the 5 
reports you purchased will provide you with invaluable marketing 
information,which includes how to send 
bulk e-mails legally.  They will also provide you info on where to 
findthousands of free classified ads and 
much more.  There are two primary methods to get this venture going foryou:

METHOD #1:  BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY
===================================================================
Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes.  Wewill
presume that you and those involved, 
send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also presume that the 
e-mailingreceives only a 0.2% response. (The 
response could be much greater, but let's say it is only 0.2%.  Manypeople
will also send out hundreds of 
thousands of e-mails instead of only 5,000 each.  This will 
significantlyenhance their and your returns). 
Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails.

With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report #1.

Those 10 people respond by sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a totalof
50,000 e-mails.  Out of those 
50,000, only 0.2% responds with orders.  That's 100 people ordering 
Report#2.

Those 100 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 
e-mails. Out of those 500,000, only 
0.2% responds with orders.  That's 1000 people ordering Report #3.

Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 
5,000,000e-mails.  Out of those 5,000,000, 
only 0.2% responds with orders.  That's 10,000 people ordering Report#4.

Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 
50,000,000e-mails.  Out of those 
50,000,000, only 0.2% responds with orders.  That's 100,000 people 
orderingReport #5.  That's 100,000 
orders at 5 bucks each . . . 1/2 Million Dollars!

Your total income in this example is: Report #1 fetches $50.  Report#2
fetches $500.  Report #3 fetches 
$5,000.  Report #4 fetches $50,000. And lastly, Report #5 brings in 
awhopping $500,000.  Grand Total: 
$555,550!

The numbers don't lie.  GET A PENCIL AND PAPER AND FIGURE THE WORST 
POSSIBLESCENARIOS.  
No matter how you calculate it, YOU WILL STILL MAKE AN OBSCENE AMOUNTOF
MONEY!

REMEMBER, THIS IS PRESUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF THE 5,000YOU
E-MAILED 
TO!  Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone, or half,or
even one-fourth of those people 
mailed out 100,000 e-mails or more?  There are over 150 million peopleon
the Internet worldwide and 
counting.  Believe me, many people will do just that and more!

METHOD #2:  BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
======================================================================
Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and there are hundredsof
FREE places to advertise.  Placing 
a lot of free ads on the Internet will easily get a larger response.We 
strongly suggest you start with Method 
#1 and add Method #2 as you go along.  For every $5 you receive, allyou
must do is e-mail them the Report 
they ordered.  That's IT!  Always provide same day service on all orders.
This will guarantee that the e-mail 
they send out, with your name and address on it, will be prompt. 
Becausethey cannot advertise until they 
receive the report.

======================AVAILABLE REPORTS==========================

ORDER EACH REPORT BY NUMBER AND NAME ONLY.  Note:  Always send $5 cash(U.S.
Currency) for 
each Report.  Checks NOT accepted.  Make sure the cash is concealed 
bywrapping it in at least two 
sheets of paper.  On one of those sheets of paper, write the NUMBER andthe
NAME of the Report you are 
ordering.  Write your E-MAIL ADDRESS and your NAME and your POSTAL ADDRESS.

"My name is Mitchell.  My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago.  I am 
anaccountant with a major U.S. Corporation 
and I make pretty good money.  When I received this program I grumbledto
Jody about receiving "junk mail."  
I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the populationand
percentages involved.  I "knew" 
it wouldn't work.  Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence andafew 
days later, she jumped in with both 
feet.  I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay down the old"I
told you so" on her when the thing 
didn't work.  Well. . . the laugh was on me!  Within 3 weeks she 
hadreceived 50 responses.  Within the next 
45 days, she had received a total of $147,200.00 . . . all cash!  I 
wasshocked.  I have since joined Jody in 
her "hobby."

"Not being a gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mindto
participate in this plan.  The 
conservative that I am, I decided the initial investment was so 
little,there was no way that I wouldn't get 
enough orders to at least get my money back." "I was surprised when Ifound
my medium size post office box 
crammed with orders.  I made $319,210 in the first 12 weeks. The nicething
about this deal is that it does not 
matter where people live.  There simply isn't a better investment witha
faster return and so big!"

"I had received this program before.  I deleted it.  Later, I wonderedifI 
should have given it a try.  Of course, 
I had no idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait untilI
was e-mailed again by someone 
else. . . 11 months passed then it luckily came again. . . I didn't 
deletethis one!  I made more than $490,000 
on my first try and all the money came within 22 weeks."
