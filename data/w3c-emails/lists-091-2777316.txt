The following two blocks of HTML code taken from
http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/full-checklist.html render differently
in Netscape 4.08 even through they are primarily the same (two lines are
swapped).  By printing this document the difference is even more apparent.
Obviously there are many factors that could be affecting this, but I
thought I should share this with you.
