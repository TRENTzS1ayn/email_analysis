Nancy Gores of the Trace Center said I should contact you about the
following question I originally sent to her:

I printed the W3C guidelines at
http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT that we are to follow to
be compliant with accessibility issues.  However, none of
the blue heads (e.g., H2, H3) nor the boxed guidelines
printed.  That's a first for me, and I print webpages from
hundreds of sites.  I am using Netscape 4.7.  I'm curious,
can you explain why the heads and guidelines do not print?

Thank you,
Chris Olgren
