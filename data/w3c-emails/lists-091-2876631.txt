Dear sirs:

We want to communicate you that we have translated into spanish the following documents:

Techniques for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 (W3C Note 5May 1999)
List of Checkpoints for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0.
Fact Sheet for "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0"
Quicktips to make accessible Web sites.

These documents are going to be published in a book called "Dise?o accesible de p?ginas Web" ( "Accessible design of Web pages"). The responsibles of this translation are Carlos Egea  and Alicia Sarabia. This book publication will be funded by the Regional Administration of Region of Murcia (Spain) and the Real Patronato de Prevenci?n y Atenci?n a Personas con Minusval?as (Spain). This book will be distributed among interested people and Public Institutions with the purpose of making all these people , and specially the Webmasters of these Institutions, aware of the necessity of accessible design of Web pages. In this publication we have carried out the requeriments that appear in the 5.6 and 5.9 items of the W3C Intellectual Property FAQ (http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/IPR-FAQ-20000620.html).

Best regards.
