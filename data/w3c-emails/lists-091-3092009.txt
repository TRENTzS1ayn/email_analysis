I understand that providers are soley responsible for determining adherence to
these Guidelines.  However, I wonder if your organization provides any sort of
review to assist providers in determining conformance, or if you know of another
organization that does provide review?  Additionally, can you send me a list of
providers that display the W3c Accessibility Logo on their site?

Thank you.
