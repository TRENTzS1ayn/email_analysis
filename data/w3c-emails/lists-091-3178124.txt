Following we publish a press release by BAYAN-Network on the occasion of the ouster of the corrupt
Filipino president Estrada. We congratulate the comrades of BAYAN as well as the Filipino popular
movement for their tenacity and courage and express our deepest solidarity with their political and
social struggle, which is far from being terminated with this victory. In fact, we still remember the
experience of the people's power of 1986, which actually was abused by the later president Corazon
Aquino who betrayed and bloodily repressed the popular movement deeply disappointing the people's
hopes in democracy and social justice. We call upon the Filipino people to bear in mind this bitter
experience in order not to trust the new president and the new government who are trying to abort the
popular movement with cheap promises and compromises. The struggle of the Filipino people for
democracy and social justice must continue also under the new government!
