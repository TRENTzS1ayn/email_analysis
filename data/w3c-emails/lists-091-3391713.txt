Dear Black Arts Enthusiast

www.blackartsyourcity.com is a new website that is poised to 
become the world's site for arts events and arts production 
information for major cities throughout the U.S.  
www.blackartsyourcity.com brings attention to writers, book 
clubs, readings, theatrical productions, exhibitions, dance 
performances, concerts and the like in these major cities.  As 
well, www.blackartsyourcity.com will soon provide you with 
contacts that will facilitate all aspects of your travel and stay in 
these arts centers, such as car rental, local hotels, restaurants, 
travel agents, retail stores, events ticket purchasing, beauty and 
barber shops, and the like.  In the near future this 
comprehensive site will also provide visitors the opportunities to 
"chat" with artists of various art forms, write reviews for other 
users and chat among themselves about arts events and arts 
related topics. The best part about this site is that all of these 
opportunities are free.

As you can see, blackartsyourcity.com has the potential to 
become the primary black arts site on the world wide web.  You 
can help us reach this goal in two of ways, which are by:  

1)            visiting us often and telling your friends about us.
2)             regularly providing calendar information on African       
               American  artistic and cultural events scheduled in any 
               of the cities.
3)            visiting our links and sponsors regularly so that we may 
               continue to bring you this service 100% free.

We invite you to visit us now and let us know what you think.  In 
advance, blackartsyourcity.com thanks you for your interest and 
support.


Sincerely,


The staff of blackartsyourcity.com
