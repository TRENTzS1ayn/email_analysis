 I need to e-mail Jane Hanely OR Ginny,{ from the Kingston office} about an up-coming event and I can not access the e-mail address on that directory. It comes up as an error # 403 on my site.???? I am new at this but it is very frustrating ....could you please help or pass the message on ,that I am trying to get a hold of them, for me, Ginny in particular. I wonder if it is because "service" is being spelt as "servoce"???
 Anyway, sorry for the trouble, but I would appreciate direction on this unfortunate mishap.
 Kindest Regards, Brenda Cowan
