Dear Sir or Madam;


>My name is Chen Wei. I am from Singapore. But I am working in Indonesia now.
>
First of all, let me appologize for directly contacting you regarding to
this matter.

I am interested in becoming a webmaster, and so I check several webmaster
online
>courses which are offered at many websites.
>
>The one webmaster course in which I am interested in is offered by WEBYODA.
>Their address is WWW.WEBMASTERCERTIFICATION.COM
>
>One of their appealing ad says that their webmaster certification program is 
>'RECOGNIZED' by your organization. And I know, you are a popular
organization. I admire your concern very much to design a standard which
allocates serious attention to people with disablities.
>
>So, please help me check this. Do you really recognize their program?
>
>If not, please inform me via this mail. So that I would not be trapped by 
>their marketing scam.
>
>I would thank you very much for your time reading this. Please reply.
>
>With kindest regards,
>
>Chen Wei.
