Paul,

Check out entry 2 on the 'errata' page [1]. Depending
on which version of Acrobat you are using to print (and
I'm going to assume you are using Acrobat in Windows), Acrobat
has some problems with this document, even though the document
is valid PDF. You can try to print the Postscript version as well.
