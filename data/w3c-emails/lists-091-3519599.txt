Hi

I am a web developer currently developing a site for an Australian
organisation in the telecommunications industry. Their site contains
numerous downloadable .pdf documents. The text size at 100% looks quite
small - possibly about 10 points - some of the type is in 3 columns and at
this resolution, looks quite fuzzy. Obviously the document was never
designed for the web and is somewhat easier to read in a printed version.
Does the W3c have any guidelines for the visually impaired regarding the use
of .pdf as an adjunct of a web site.?

Regards,

Sue Wooster
