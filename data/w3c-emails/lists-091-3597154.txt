Dear w3c,

We are currently looking in to enhancing our Internet site to conform with
the WAI guidelines.  I understand that we can either place a logo on each
conforming page of the site, or a link from the homepage of our site to
yours, as detailed on your site.  

Would you please let me know if it is vital that one of the above is
included or if this is simply a recommendation to help promote awareness of
this initiative.

I look forward to receiving your reply at your very earliest convenience.

Kind regards,
Claire.

Claire Walmsley-Moss
