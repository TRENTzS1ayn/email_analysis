To Whom It May Concern:
I am a free lance writer who writes for the New York Times and a host of
magazines. I am going to write a story on the Internet and the disabled
and was wondering if there are any examples of web sites that use WAI
guidelines for making the web more accessible?
Thank You,
Eve Tahmincioglu
