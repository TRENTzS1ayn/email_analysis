Hello,

I downloaded text-only versions of the WAI checklist and guideline in hopes 
of putting them on my Palm Pilot. However, the text is formatted in a way 
that doesn't work well on the small Palm screen. For example, paragraph 
text is indented with spaces and there are hard returns at the end of each 
line, preventing text from wrapping in a readable way.

Am I doing something wrong? Are Palm-friendly versions available, or would 
you consider making them available in the future?

Thanks,

Lisa
