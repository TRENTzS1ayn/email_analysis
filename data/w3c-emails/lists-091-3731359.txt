I've searched the site, but have not been able to find information specific
to chat and message board. My company will soon be adopting chat and
messageboard technology from third party vendors and I wanted to find out
how we can determine which chats and messageboards are the most accessible.
If you could provide and information about this, or direct me to an area of
your site that does, I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks, Suzanne
