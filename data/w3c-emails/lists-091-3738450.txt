Hi

I've just copy and pasted the code for your AA compliance logo and came
acros a couple of problems:

1. People aiming for this level of compliance are often creating web pages
in XHTML - it might therefore be worth making this code conform to that
standard (i.e lower case <a>, </a> and <img> and adding  /> at the end of
the image link.

2. The code provokes a priority 3 error in Bobby as it contains two adjacent
links - perhaps it would be better to recommend that people download the gif
to their hard drive?
