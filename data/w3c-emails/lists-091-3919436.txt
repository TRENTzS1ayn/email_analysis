This e-release is dedicated to WSES Multiconference: Rethymna Beach. Island of Crete (Greece), in July 8-15, 2001.


A MESSAGE FROM THE GENERAL CHAIRMAN OF THE CONFERENCES CSCC 2001, MCP
2001, MCME 2001 TO THE FACULTY MEMBERS AND SENIOR RESEARCHERS OF THIS NEWSLETTER.

Dear Faculty Members and Senior Researchers of this News-Letter,

Thank you very much for your mass participation in our last year's conference.
(More than 600 Participants). After one year's hard research, I have the honor again of inviting you to deliver an Invited Lecture in one of the following Conferences that will jointly take place in the exquisit, fascinating and historic island of Crete (Greece), in July 8-15, 2001.
{The conferences have a great tradition between mathematicians,
physicists and engineers. 
Many very Important Personalities of Mathematics every year attend
them!}

*    5th WSES/IEEE World Multiconference CSCC (Circuits, Systems,
Communications and Computers 2001)

*    3rd MCP (MCP 2001), Mathematics and Computers in Physics

*    3rd MCME (MCME 2001), Mathematics and Computers in
     Mechanical Engineering

About Crete:
CRETE is a Unique Place in the World: In this magic island, so richly
endowed by Nature and History, everything is in abundance: blond beaches
with
palm-trees, cool gorges, serene coves, palm-forests, mysterious caves,
minoan palaces, paleochristian churches, byzantine churches, islamic
mosques, and of course modern cosmopolitan life.
Crete lies in the crossroads of the three ancient continents:
Europe-Asia-Africa and the Cretan Civilization borrowed elements from
european, asian and african world. Also, Crete, in the minoan era, gave
birth to the first civilization in the west-european sense.
Here, Zeus, the father and king of ancient greek Gods was born.
Many famous Artists and Politicians like El-Greco, Venizelos,
Kazantzakis and Kornaros were born in Crete.


Thank You!
Best Regards!
