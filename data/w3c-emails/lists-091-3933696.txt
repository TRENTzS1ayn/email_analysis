Hi,

We have been working on making our sites more accessible and on
understanding what that means, and I am pleased to say we are ready to
put the Level "A" conformance icon on one of our sites.  I am concerned,
though, because in testing it out, several people thought that there was
a broken link to the icon since it took a while to load from the WAI
server, even on our relatively fast pc's.  Would it be possible for us
to get permission to put a copy of the image on our server to speed this
up?

While I'm writing, I'll add my thanks to WAI for doing such a wonderful
job -- I'm glad you all are there!

Best wishes,
Carol
