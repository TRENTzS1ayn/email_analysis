Hi,

I'm planning a talk about Web Accessibility where I will focus mainly on
the WAI Priority 1 recommendations.  I would like to include slides/Web
pages that contain the Priority 1 items from the Checklist
(http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/full-checklist.html), including the
appropriate copyright info.

The reason I am writing is that I am also thinking of adding a few of my
own comments and examples on each slide/Web page as well, and I would
guess that this counts as an annotation.  If I clearly label my
annotation as such, and inform you of my plans and when this is on the
Web, is that all I need to do?  (I do agree to the items mentioned about
redistribution and possibly rescinding my publication rights.)

The talk is called "Increasing Web Site Accessibility" and is planned
for presentation at the Massachusetts Education Computing Conference,
June 13-15, 2001 at UMass Boston.  I would also like to put the
slides/Web pages on the Web some time before that and leave them there
after that.  Probably they would be linked off the training page of my
group's site, http://www.umassp.edu/uis/ipg/training.html

Thanks so much,
Carol
