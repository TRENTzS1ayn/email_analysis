I like your validation service.  Currently I'm displaying the HTML 4.01 W3C
complaisance.  I want to bump up the compliance.  W3C's validation logo is
an INVALUABLE tool.  Is there a way to have W3C help me step by step in the
upgrade.  WC3's  site is chock full of info, but lacks a clear path... or a
way to know your on the best or most efficient path.  A true web, and I feel
like a fly going near it.
Any guide spiders there?

writing lighthawkmusic.com to comply
and then allot of tiding up to do on my old sites

p.s. CSS is still all to mystic.  What's the best editor for writing CSS,
call me old fashioned but I like web editing that makes sure I do not have
to re-write the world everyday.
