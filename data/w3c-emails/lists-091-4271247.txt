Hello,

First, thanks for making your site more accessible!

It is my opinion that strictly speaking, you have satisfied 1.1 because
you have provided a text equivalent for the image links at the bottom
of the page. However, users won't necessarily know this. They will come
across the images at the top of the page and wonder what their role
is. If you don't provide alt text, they may think they are missing out
on something. So, I recommend putting alt text for the role of the
image links anyway.
