I have been on your site now for 2 and a half hours. I am trying feverishlly 
to contain my utter frustration with your site.
I am trying to look up information on CSS and all I find are perpetual 
links, some leading to the page I just came from. Link after link after link 
after link. They lead to places that don't even help me any, just more 
references to more documents with more links!
You people are supposed to be the experts in deciding how CSS (For example) 
should be written. Well tell me PLEASE where I find how it should be 
written? Where are the rules? Where are the lists of elements etc? Where are 
the guidelines on what can and could and should be done?
Link after link after link after link to more and more documents with 
nothing in them but references.
Accessibility? I know accessibility because I am determined to offer the 
information on my site in an easy and straightforward fashion, not bemuse 
and confuse the people who come to me looking for help.
I remain bemused and confused. I need what I thought I would find on your 
pages, information on CSS.
So, if YOU know where it is, please send me the url, just one, of just the 
page that holds the information relating to writing CSS. I am not interested 
at this stage who wrote it, and who contributed, and what draft it's at, and 
all the rest of the eronneous and superfluous information that cutters the 
site, just the information I came for.
Can you give me that?
Regards
Bemused (Gary Finnigan)
