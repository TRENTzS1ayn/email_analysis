Hi Gary,

From the home page: http://www.w3.org/ you can either
go to the "Style" Activity (http://www.w3.org/Style) or 
the list of technical reports (http://www.w3.org/TR/) and
you will find the link to the CSS2 specification:

 http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2 

I suggest looking at the style Activity home page for additional
info.

Sorry for the confusion.
