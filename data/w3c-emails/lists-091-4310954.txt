Dear Editor,

The purpose of my email is to thank you for all of your great 
information on the WAI website and to make a recommendation for 
the presentation of text for your sighted readers. 

My recommendation is that you shorten the line length. 
Appropriate line length for online reading is between 58-70 
characters (including spaces). Your line length is at about 92 
characters, which makes it a bit fatiguing to read online.  
I also recommend you add spaces between bullet 
points that have large blocks of text. 

There are many great resources that speak to this subject. 
One excellent website may be found at:
