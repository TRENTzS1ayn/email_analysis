Hi Laurie,

We don't specify any line lengths (to my knowledge). Line
length is a function of the user's environment and depends
on the width of fonts, the width of the browser, etc.

I'm not sure that this is something we can control
in markup (in HTML) except maybe in the <pre> element,
which I don't believe we use.

Can you explain how we might ensure control over line
length in the user's environment? In the article you
cite, indeed it says:

  "Unfortunately, basic HTML text tags don't allow you 
   to control the width of your lines."

This is not a limitation of HTML but intentional: the
user is supposed to be able to control line width.
