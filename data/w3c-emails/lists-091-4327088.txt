Hi

In the Web content accessibility guidelines, under priority 3 checkpoints, 
9.5 Provide keyboard shortcuts to important links (including those in
client-side image maps), form controls, and groups of form controls.

I was wondering if there are universal shortcuts defined that we should work
with, or is it okay to define our own shortcuts and be consistent throughout
a site with those ?
e.g. Home link shortcut could be <ctrl H> 

Regards,
Fionnuala
