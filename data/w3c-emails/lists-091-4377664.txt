Hello,

I think I have found a _very important_ error in http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/NOTE-WCAG10-HTML-TECHS-20000915/.


In section 3.2, the following example is shown for acronyms and abbreviation:

<P>Welcome to the <ACRONYM title="World Wide Web">WWW</ACRONYM>!


This is a fatal error! (yes)

An acronym can be pronounced, not just spelled, while an abbreviation can only be spelled.

Examples for acronyms:
Laser
GNU
Linux
UNIX
UNO
NATO

Examples for abbreviations that aren't acronyms:
WWW
TCP/IP
P3P

It is important to use correct markup. In <abbr title="GNU is not UNIX">GNU</abbr> GNU will be spelled like "G. N. U." in speech browsers, while <acronym title="GNU is not UNIX">GNU</acronym> will be 
pronounced like "gnu".

So I request to change the example, and add a clearification about the terms acronym and abbreviation.

I suggest this new text for section 3.2:

3.2 Acronyms and abbreviations

Checkpoints in this section:
4.2 Specify the expansion of each abbreviation or acronym in a document where it first occurs. [Priority?3]

Mark up abbreviations and acronyms with <abbr/> and <acronym/> and use their title-attribute to
indicate the expansion. Note the difference between abbreviations and acronyms: while abbreviations are just spelled, acronyms can be and usually are pronounced like words, so WWW, P3P, TCP/IP, FSF, XML 
are abbreviations, NATO, UNO, Laser, GNU, UNIX, Linux are acronyms.
Example.
   <p>Welcome to the <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr> site about <acronym title="Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation">Laser</acronym>!</p>

This also applies to shortened phrases used as headings for table row or
columns. If a heading is already abbreviated provide the expansion in <abbr/>. If
a heading is long, you may wish to provide an abbreviation, as described in Data Tables.
Example.
  ...
  <th>First name</th>
  <th><abbr title="Social Security Number">SS#</abbr></th>
  ...


Greetings
