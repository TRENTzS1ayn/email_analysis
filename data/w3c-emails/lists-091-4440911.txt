In general I agree, but I don't think it's that clear cut - I'm concerned
as to who the users are who require text to be scaled, but aren't
interested in having images scaled. Current UA's provide mechanisms for
scaling both together, and this works best today where the text has been
scaled to the image, which only the author can do, so for these users a
fixed font size is advantageous. *

And pt or cm are entirely appropriate for CSS in a medium where the output
characteristics are known, such as print, or for your own personal
interests, we should remember CSS is not just for creating webpages.
