Dear Editor

Firstly, many thanks for the site, which has given me the information I
needed to make our site accessible. It has taken time, but I think every
page on the main site now satisfies all the Priority 1 and Priority 2
guidelines.

If it doesn't, on any point, I hope someone will tell me.

Our shop site isn't, but as it is generated using off-the-shelf software,
I can't really do much about that.

One minor point - the HTML validation tool I use objected to the given
code for the icons, in that the IMG tag was not closed. I am using the
inbuilt validator in Macromedia HomeSite 5, validating to HTML 4.0 and
XHTML 1.0 with the strictest settings.
