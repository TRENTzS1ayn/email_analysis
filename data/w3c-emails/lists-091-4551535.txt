I am unable to access the 5 May 1999 Techniques document.  My computer 
downloaded the PDF file when I clicked on the link in the errata document
but I am unable to open this document. Also, I do not understand what is
meant by substituting pdf for ps as an alternative to accessing the
document.  Could you please advise.

With thanks in advance.

Ian Ferguson.
