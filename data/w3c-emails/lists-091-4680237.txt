Amy,

Since several people have reported this error, I've added
an entry to the errata page [1]. Due to W3C publication
policy, we can't replace the current PDF version with
a repaired one (I'm not even certain ours is broken; it
has worked in previous versions of Acrobat Reader). I
recommend that for now, you save the HTML version as
PostScript
and try to read that with your viewer (or you can print
it directly, obviously).

I apologize for the inconvenience,

  - Ian
