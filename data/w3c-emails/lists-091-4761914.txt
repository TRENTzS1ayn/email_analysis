Tezra,

W3C's WAI doesn't produce ADA guidelines. WAI materials
should be useful to you anyway, but for information about
US government regulations, you'll need to check out
their sites.

For information about the latest work of W3C's
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group:
   http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/

For information about accessibility policies of
various countries:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/References/Policy


Hope this helps,

  _ Ian

would like to inquire about any recent versions of the guidelines.  Any tips, suggestions, or web references that we can do more research on would be greatly appreciated.
