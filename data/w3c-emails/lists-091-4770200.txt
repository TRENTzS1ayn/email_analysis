The PDF file available at
 http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/full-checklist.html may have a
 problem with it. When I download it (I have tried several
 times) and then attempt to open in (Acrobat Reader 5 in
 Windows 2000) it has an error attempting to read page 1.
 The other pages show up, but not page 1. Any ideas?
