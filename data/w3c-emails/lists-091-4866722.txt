Hi Esther,

Thanks for your efforts to make your site more accessible.

Here's a resource for getting started [1], and
in particular "Evaluating Web Sites for Accessibility" [2].

There are some tools to help with the process of evaluation,
but some checks must be done by hand. Automatic validation
of accessibility is not currently possible.

I hope these links are enough to get you started.

Cheers,

- Ian
