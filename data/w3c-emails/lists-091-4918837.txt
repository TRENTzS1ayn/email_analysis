Hello,
I've been making some attempt to comply with the Priority One accessibility
requirements here:

http://www.w3c.org/TR/WCAG10/full-checklist.html
<http://www.w3c.org/TR/WCAG10/full-checklist.html> 

There is even a Dreamweaver extension (508) that allows us to check our web
pages.  Great.

But now someone tells me I must comply with ADA requirements.  I'm trying to
figure out where they are and how they differ from your guidelines.  Would
you mind helping me out or pointing me in the right direction?

Thanks and if you are ever in Pittsburgh, I'll treat you to the beverage of
your choice made from the rusty waters of the Allegheny.
