Ian is corrrect.

 

There are no ADA guidelines for web.   The specific ADA guidelines that
have currently been defined were done before the web existed.  

 

You are probably safest by looking at the 508 guidelines described
below.  There are two docs that compare them to W3C guidelines (from
which they were derived).   I've pasted a page from the workbook of the
course I am teaching immediately below.  It has links to the comparisons
and a chart showing relationship.   (EITAS is 508 standards)
