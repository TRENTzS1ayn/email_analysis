Hello

This is to inform you that I have created

http://www.tntluoma.com/sidebars/section508/

which is based in large part upon the document I found at 
http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/full-checklist.html

I created the page in hopes that it would be an easy reference for folks 
who are trying to build accessible web sites.

I want to make sure that I am honoring your copyright, etc.  If there is 
anything that I need to change/add to the page, please let me know.

TjL
