On page    http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-HTML-TECHS/#tables

the following example is given with the comment under it that the 
browser will rewad it as (see below)

But when I pasted this code into Notepad and opened it IE the text was 
read linearly with out identifying the header for each cell (T Sexton 
10, Espresso ,no)

How do you get it to read the column headings in each cell? (Name T 
sexton, Cups, 10.....

I want to  create a chart for weather information with the days across 
the top as headers and the hi's and low's in a table beneath but such 
that it is read Mon, Hi87, Low 76

<TABLE border="1"
           summary="This table charts the number of
                    cups of coffee consumed by each senator,
                    the type of coffee (decaf or regular),
                    and whether taken with sugar.">
      <CAPTION>Cups of coffee consumed by each senator</CAPTION>
      <TR>
          <TH id="header1">Name</TH>
          <TH id="header2">Cups</TH>
          <TH id="header3" abbr="Type">Type of  Coffee</TH>
          <TH id="header4">Sugar?</TH>
      <TR>
          <TD headers="header1">T. Sexton</TD>
          <TD headers="header2">10</TD>
          <TD headers="header3">Espresso</TD>
          <TD headers="header4">No</TD>
      <TR>
          <TD headers="header1">J. Dinnen</TD>
          <TD headers="header2">5</TD>
          <TD headers="header3">Decaf</TD>
         <TD headers="header4">Yes</TD>
   </TABLE>

End example.

A speech synthesizer might render this tables as follows:

   Caption: Cups of coffee consumed by each senator
   Summary: This table charts the number of cups of coffee
            consumed by each senator, the type of coffee
           (decaf or regular), and whether taken with sugar.
   Name: T. Sexton, Cups: 10, Type: Espresso, Sugar: No
   Name: J. Dinnen, Cups: 5, Type: Decaf, Sugar: Yes
