hi
 
when opening a document (created in Scenicsoft PREPS 4.1) i get the error message:
 
"There was an error processing a page. Wrong number of arguments for a setcolor operator."
 
seems to me that error appears when using a spot color (by user custom defined color).
I usualy can solve the problem by copy/paste an object from another .pdf (with the same spot color), saving and closing it, reopen it, (deleting pasted object from second .pdf) and use it with no further problems.
 
if you have any idea how to fix this out, I`ll appreciate that
