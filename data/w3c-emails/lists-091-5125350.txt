It also needs to be mentioned closer to the event don't you think?   No
one reads the about pages.     If a link will open a new window, it
should say that near the link  (or on the page if the page has lots of
them)

Actually - it would be nice to have some way of marking those for
everyone --- but we don't make rules for everyone.

Yes?

Andi, I think this [1] means there is an issue with WCAG 2.0 latest
draft
because it [2] still requires the "author" to identify in context that
there will be extreme changes (i.e., open a new window) in response to
the
user's action.  I believe the problem with the checkpoint and success
criteria is in the lack of a definition for "in context" and what is the
author's responsibility.  I believe it is good usability practice to
include in the text in "about this site" that when clicking certain
links
that they will open in a new window, for example, clicking the "help"
link
will open a new window so that the "help information" is also available
without losing your place while filling out a form.  Helpful orientation
information is very subjective.

I also believe this is a candidate for the WCAG 1.0 errata [3] and/or
second edition.

No, I don't think you can be in double-A conformance without satisfying
each
Priority 2 checkpoint. The conformance section is pretty
straightforward.
If
you say that things are WCAG double-A when they are demonstrably not, it
may
not be a good idea in the medium term...

What the checkpoint says is that you must inform the user "until user
agents"
do it themselves. Remember than back in 1998 and 1999 when the
guidelines
were being finished this was looking forward to the day when user agents
did
this, and the requirement on authors would vanish.

The problem for users is that unless they know they are having a new
window
w
opened they get confused and disoriented. I know, because it happens to
me.
And I can see the screen and find out what is happening. So I use a user
agent (iCab) that does tell me when a New Window will be opened (unless
people do stupid things like link to a piece of javascript), and one
(Amaya)
that just won't follow instructions to make new windows except from the
user.

I think that a case could be made that user agents can inform the user,
and
therefore the checkpoint is not applicable. At the moment the market
penetration of such user agents (Amaya, snufkin-enhanced Explorer, iCab,
etc)
is pretty poor, so it is a very weak case that I would expect to fail
under
real-world testing...

But not for too much longer I hope. Browsers are improving. The work
being
done on the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines includes making sure
that
there are implementations of the requirements, and if you want a
particular
feature you should be able to find a browser that does it. (If you want
all
of them then it is like any other standard - complain to your browser
maker).

cheers
