Well, there is one W3C rec that does have "errata" and "translation" in the
top matter - see [1].  I also agree that "techniques" could be added.

Also, what we just discussed in the ATAG working group was a "related
document" link that would go back to the working group home page section
with a list of peer and related documents (mini doc map) that would put the
current doc in context with other documents. This section would of course
map back the WAI home page for the other related resources.  ATAG is in the
middle of ATAG 1.0, techniques, ATAG 1.x/wombat, it's associated
techniques, a version with and without icons, evaluation techniques, etc.
so a "related documents" link should prove useful.  WCAG is in a similar
situation with WCAG 1.0, techniques, and WCAG 2.0.

Problem now is that we can't add it without changing the doc.  (or
putting it in errata - grin)

Good idea for next time.

I would like it to be EVEN MORE obvious though than the other links

Also - a link to TECHNICAL SUPPORT DOCs for the guidelines (though that
is what the techniques are)

Gregg, following up on your point in today's Steering Council, I believe
the Errata link could be more prominently placed in the top matter of
the
recommendation.  Today there is already a "This Version" and a "Latest
Version", but not mention  of "Errata".  Adding a link to "Errata"
between
"Latest version" and "Previous version" is my suggestion.  "Errata" is
currently buried below the "Status of this document" section.
Also, "Latest version" could link to the actual "Second Edition" if or
when
it becomes a reality.  The "Latest version" is the link that other
policy
documents should be using.
