Section 1.1 of UAAG 1.0 has a link to the WAI Resources page:

   http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-UAAG10-20020821/intro.html#context

  - Ian

  PJ: problem with this is that when "related documents change" the spec
  document is out of date.  The disadvantage is that when printed, the
  related section is not included.  As an old timer and as the Web is more
  common & useful than printed docs, I would prefer NOT to include too much
  detail about related docs. but point to a section in the working group
  and WAI home pages. From a "current snap shot point of view - I really
  like what UAAG includes - just not where it is.
