Hello, Bon jour, Bon Giorno, Gutten Tag, Hola, Habari Gani

Here are the simple keys to making friends and influencing people both on a personal and International scale.
If you follow them, life will be much sweeter for you and those around you, and the world will be really a much kinder, gentler place for all of us.

Go placidly among the noise and haste, and remember what peace there may be
in silence. As far as possible without surrender be on good terms with all
persons. Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others even the
dull and ignorant; they too have their story.
Avoid loud and aggressive persons, they are vexations to the spirit.
 If you
compare yourself with others you may become vain and bitter; for always there
will be greater and lesser persons than yourself. Enjoy your achievements as
well as your plans.
Keep interested in your own career, however humble; it is a real possession
in the changing fortunes of time. Exercise caution in your business affairs;
for the world is full of trickery.
 But let this not blind you to what virtue
there is; many persons strive for high ideals; and everywhere life is full of
heroism.
Be yourself. Especially do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about
love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is perennial as
the grass.
Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of
youth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do
not distress yourself with imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and
loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself.
You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars; you
have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the
universe is unfolding as it should.
Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be, and
whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life keep
peace with your soul.
With all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful
world. Be careful. Strive to be happy.

Here is some more simple but effective advice for living a stress free, joyful, ethical life.

If you can keep your head when all about you,
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
And yet don't look too good or talk too wise:

If you can dream and not make dreams your master;
If you can think and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear the words you've spoken
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
Except the Will which says to them: "Hold on!"

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
Or walk with Kings--nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
If all people count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
With sixty seconds worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
And--which is more--you'll be a adult, my child!
Rudyard Kipling
