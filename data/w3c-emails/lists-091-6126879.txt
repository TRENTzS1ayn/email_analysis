Oh please no! Using classes to identify semantics when there is no
strict mechanism for doing so? Classes may well be there to group
elements of a certain type, but this is a very short first party
assertion in that it groups elements of a certain type without
providing any reason of why these elements are grouped. If the class
system is used otherwise, then you are extending the XHTML 1.0
specification; you should be using Modularization of XHTML [1]
instead. Pragmatically, given the limitations of XHTML 1.0 in
providing annotations (or even links to annotations), there's not
really much we can do for classes, except perhaps to use URIs as class
attribute values [2].
