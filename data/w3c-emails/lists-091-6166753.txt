We are in danger of falling into the same pit from which we try to rescue 
Web design - the avoidance of heeding our own counsel.

All of the documents, especially the myriad of such things on EO as "How 
People With Disabilities Use the Web" 
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/PWD-Use-Web/Overview.html
fall far short in both the "clear/simple" and "Use multimedia to illustrate 
concepts" departments - and it is one of our best efforts!

We use the same excuses about our failures in these areas that are 
forwarded by Web designers: time/resources/priorities - meanwhile we 
exemplify a tinge of hypocrisy that, although tempering our rage at 
inaccessibility, is unbecoming.

Sunday is a day for sermons, I guess - happy Easter Week and wish me well 
on Crusade 2001 [http://diap.net/crusade.htm]
