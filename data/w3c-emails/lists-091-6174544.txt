There's a slight possibility of there being prejudice about left/right 
brainedness herein.

Lots of wordsmiths/technoheads, no draftspersons. W3C should seek a 
graphics artist next rather than yet another acronymist.

Just as with dancers, artists are among the most underemployed people 
around. A call for one would produce almost unbelievable response of 
portfolios, etc. It's something that starts early and has no respect for 
gender, etc. In fact a contest (with prize) for illustrating some 
particular document might be worth a lot of effort?

Sounds are a little more of a technical problem at this time as even a few 
earcons lead to site-bloat.
