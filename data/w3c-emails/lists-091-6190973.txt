a cross posting from WAI/AU

Hi all,

Jutta has asked me to share my way of dealing with our working 
papers. It is just a snap shot of some work in progress.

I took <http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/ATAG10-EVAL> and put frames and a 
checklist around. The checklist is of cause only a fake form. It is 
not intended to select all checkboxes, press submit and receive the 
holy accessibility badge of honor from W3C. Instead of this I am 
editing this page at the Adobe intranet as a living document.

It helps me usually a lot to touch a topic literally. Shift things 
around and find my own path into it. I put this playing-around online 
at

    http://www.mprove.de/script/01/wai/ATAG10EVAL/

Maybe it is helpful to the group in some respect.

so long
Matthias
