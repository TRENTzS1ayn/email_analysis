I would suggest that people start by doibfg the drawing, and then worry later
about how to get it into SVG. If you want to do SVG from scratch, Amaya
(free), Adobe Illustrator (expensive), and a number of other packages support
it for editing. (My experience is that the ease-of-use is related to the
cost, but my experience is also very limited).

Reasonably simple line / shape drawings are easier to replicate than ones
which have complex curves or colour gradients...

But  best is to have something to look at <grin/>

cheers
