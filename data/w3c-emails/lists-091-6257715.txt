I have gotten some positive comments on what Ben was able to do with the
opening graphic of

<http://trace.wisc.edu/handouts/sc2000/middleware_and_eSCaped_web>http://tr
ace.wisc.edu/handouts/sc2000/middleware_and_eSCaped_web/

If anyone here can persuade the Device Independence group that they want to
use
this, I expect Trace would authorize its reuse (with credit).? I will go to
bat
for the permission if need be.

PS:? I think that this may be a thread where EO is the logical lead
activity in
doing anything about it.? On the other hand, in terms of stretching our minds
[PF and GL et al] as to what can be done with graphics, it is good to go
beyond
the work of Edward Tufte to the work of Julie Tolmie who uses imagery as the
working medium for mathematical exploration and proof.? (Google that name).
