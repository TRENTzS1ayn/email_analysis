Hey Jason. Katie here. I have not worked on it for a week or so, but please
go look at it, I would be interested on your ideas of making this glossary
doc a "model of accessibility", and given it a start but.....ideas please.
  The intent is to fill it up with or various definitions and terms, let
everyone look at it, and start whittling it down.  For logistics and
bandwidth reasons, I already started dividing up the alphabetical links into
separate pages. But there will also be one bohemoth of a printable version
as well.  Therefore the internal page links I will not complete until we
know what we are going to have where.  If you have any resources for me to
explore for definitions.....................please let me know.  Also, your
view again on Transform Gracefully, I have the notes from the
face2face..............but................just want to see if I can flush
out anything new.........the link to the glossary is:

Subject: Glossary status


What is the current status of work related to the preparation of the
glossary? Is it proceeding smoothly at this stage? When could the next
draft be expected to become available for review? Note that I am not
attempting to hurry the process at all, but merely to ascertain its
current status.
