From a quick perusal of the glossary, it seems very clear and
comprehensive--well done.

My definition of "transform gracefully" as:

Web content is said to transform gracefully if it remains usable and
functional when certain features or technologies with which it is
constructed are turned off or not supported by the user agent.

Regards,

Jason.
