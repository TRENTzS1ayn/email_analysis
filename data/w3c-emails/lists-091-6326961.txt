This is my exact arguement as to why we should not list ONE generic
definition.  I suggest listing the vernacular, and then the others as it
relates to each technology. Certainly many terms can be brought into line to
work for 3, 4 or more documents, buy  in some cases that may not be the
true..................................................Katie

Yes, I hope so.

I hope we can be context-aware as we work on terminology.? That is to say
aware
of how other people talk about our topics.? This clearly has to include the
common, vernacular vocabulary that nearly everyone understands, but it also
extends to things like this where there is a neighbor discipline which talks
about a concept that is key for our work with a jargon term like 'afford.'?
It
was clearly part of the shared culture at SIGCHI.? And thoroughly jargony to
me, although hearing it in context I could follow what it was intended to
mean.
