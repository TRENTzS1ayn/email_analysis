Both.

The second use is a special case of the first.  The first is the conventional
expansion that people in the industry will generally give you.

What API means is "The interface you use if you want to apply the code we
wrote
in some code your wrote."

The appearance of 'application' here is colloquial, not precise.  Although a
common use of APIs is for programs colloquially identified as
'applications' to
call services provided by programs colloquially identified as "the operating
system," this is only a typical use, not definitive.

The second one probably comes from POSIX or Java literature.  A portability
platform is often attempted by a profile of APIs.
