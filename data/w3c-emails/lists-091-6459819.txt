Yep.

So here is an attempt:

non-text (an adjective, as in "non-text element")

Something that doesn't rely on writing to communicate its content.
Normally, a picture, some sound, a movie, and so on. Note that this usualyl
referes to writing as characters output by the computer.

A picture of some writing, that is intended to be read, is both a non-text
element (in that it does not produce letters or words that the computer
renders) so it needs a text equivalent for many users, and a text element in
that it relies on written words rather than communicating graphically.

(in other words it is the worst of all solutions, but I don't think that
goes in a definition)

cheers
