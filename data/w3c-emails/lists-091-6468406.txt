Please don't allow something to be both "x" and "non-x" at the same
time.  The logical inconsistency is just too much to simply bury in
the glossary.

Here's a straw man definition:

"Text is any content encoded in Unicode-style letters and/or glyphs.
Non-text is anything else.

Someone who is more up on RFCs and the like can fill in a more
technically precise term for "letters".  If this were 1983 I'd be
saying "ASCII characters."
