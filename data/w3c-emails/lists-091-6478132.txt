Yep, much smarter. I will ask the i18n folks, but I think we are looking for
"letters" or "characters" not "glyphs". (This could be in the Character Model
for the WWW spec that they are working on - http://www.w3.org/TR/charmod I
believe, although it is another of my notorious hand-typed URI's coming from
memory).

I think the "pictures of words" bit should go back to the WCAG group.

Cheers

  Here's a straw man definition:

  "Text is any content encoded in Unicode-style letters and/or glyphs.
  Non-text is anything else.

  Someone who is more up on RFCs and the like can fill in a more
  technically precise term for "letters".  If this were 1983 I'd be
  saying "ASCII characters."
