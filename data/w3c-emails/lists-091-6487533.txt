Taking the example that I mentioned yesterday on the WCAG mailing list of
Charles' XML DTD for representing musical notation, this would not count
as "text content" for purposes of the proposed definition; yet one does
not want to require that a "text equivalent" be provided in such a case.

The only solution that comes to mind would be to express the definition in
the following terms (which, admittedly, would not be readily understood by
much of our audience, but sometimes that's the price paid for precision):

Non-text content: any content which is not expressed as a sequence of one
or more symbols drawn from a finite alphabet (character repertoire)?

Generative grammarians will doubtless be able to refine this definition
further.
