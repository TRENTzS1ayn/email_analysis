Actually, my own proposal is too broad: any XML document instance would
satisfy my definition.

There would need to be a further qualification along the following lines:
the symbols must be primarily intended to be perceived and understood by
human beings.

With this qualification, an SVG document, for instance, wouldn't be
regarded as text because, although it is expressed in terms of symbols
drawn from a finite alphabet (namely those defined in the DTD), and in
fact satisfies a grammar, the symbols aren't meant to be read and
understood directly, but rather their function is to control the rendering
process (and also to convey certain semantics). I am thinking here of the
shapes and paths rather than of the text content of an SVG document.

Perhaps the following set of definitions will work:

Text content (my proposal with suitable emendations).

Non-text content: information which does not satisfy the definition of
text content, but which is meant to be perceived and interpreted primarily
by a human being (sounds, graphics, etc.).

Content (simpliciter): the union of text content and non-text content
(that is, anything which is either text content or non-text content).
