The basic premise of non-text content was described well by Charles:

"Something that doesn't rely on writing to communicate its content.
Normally, a picture, some sound, a movie, and so on. "

Although, the UAAG defn is useful as well.
  "Text content" is content that is composed of one or more
   text elements.

Jason's suggestion is logical, but again not quite as simple as I am hoping 
for:
Non-text content: information which does not satisfy the definition of
text content, but which is meant to be perceived and interpreted primarily
by a human being (sounds, graphics, etc.).

Therefore all definitions rely on defining "text" Perhaps the thing to do 
is write the UAAG defn of text in less technical terms.  It is 
understandable that the UAAG defn needs to be more technical, and I would 
like to reference it for those in our audience who do want something 
specific and complete. For our audience we need something less technical.

How about these definitions:

Text: words presented in written language intended for people to read.

(is "word" internationalized? is that why UAAG had to use "characters"? if 
that's the case, what if we just drop "words presented in" and leave the 
defn as "written language intended for people to read.")

Non-text content: Information presented without written language intended 
to be understood by people.
