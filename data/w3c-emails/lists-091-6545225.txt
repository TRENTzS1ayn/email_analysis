Hi Ian and all,

I agree with Wendy in that:
The basic premise of non-text content was described well by Charles:
"Something that doesn't rely on writing to communicate its content.
Normally, a picture, some sound, a movie, and so on."

But I don't find very guessed right the suggestion of Ian for the meaning of
"Text content":
"Content that may be understood by people as human language when rendered
visually, as speech, or as Braille."

Neither the definition of  Non-text content:
Content that, when rendered, does not convey meaning through human language.

Because the image (a comic, a movie) also has a language that can be
understood by people. And because a sound file, a video or an animation can
transmit meaning through the human language.

Maybe the difference rests in that the text is alphanumeric.

But I don't dare to suggest a definition in English!!

So...

Regards,
Emmanuelle
