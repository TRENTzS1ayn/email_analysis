aloha, chaals!

CMN: I wonder if there are people who can give us more clues on this topic.

GJR: would it not make sense to ask the internationalization (a.k.a. i18n) 
folks?  they should have normative terms for all of the "things" we are
attempting to sort out...  since GL "owns" the unified WAI glossary,
should the "formal" sorting-out of terms request (as well as a simple,
what best expresses this concept from an internationalized point-of-view,
query) come from that WG's staff contact and/or chairs?  don't think it
necessary to pass a request of this type by the CG first, because
soliciting this type of feedback is precisely why the unified glossary
project/effort exists...
