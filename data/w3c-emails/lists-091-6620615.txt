Thank you for the splendid explanation, Gregory.

But an alphabet is also:
A system of characters or symbols representing sounds or things.

And a Chinese alphabet exists. And naturally a Chinese text in the Web will
be alphanumeric, it will use characters and numbers of the Chinese alphabet.
I think so!

kind regards,
Emmanuelle
