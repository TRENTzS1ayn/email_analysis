even when it extends well past the letter B, just as many western european
languages have numerically mis-named months...

on the best of all possible webs, chinese (and all alphabets) will be
symbolically represented by unicode!

hmmm -- could what we call "text" in WAI documents could be defined as
"ideas or concrete concepts, expressed in the glphyic system utilized by
the declared natural language", or something similar in english?  (i still
haven't been able to locate a gregorian-to-english translation service) 

on second thought, i really don't think that helps anyone, except,
perhaps, for george orwell, should he be in danger of losing momentum... 

gregory.
