Chinese and Japanese each have both alphabets and word-level ideographic
characters which characters have codes in UniCode but which should not be
considered letters in the sense of comprising an alphabet.

Just substitute 'writing' for 'glyphic' and you are getting somewhere.

'Text' is _not a buzzword_.  Is to be used in the WAI documents for any sense
associated with this term by common [international] usage in English.

Natural Text is [a Term of Art which, where used in this bookshelf, indicates]
content which can be understood by some not-too-rough approximation of reading
the current natural language [as determined by the context] as that
language is
commonly written.

[Cross-Disability] Accessible Text is [yet another Term of Art etc.] Natural
Text that is additionally a) comprehensible when presented in a stream, either
through Text-to-Speech automation or in a continuously streaming marquee
presentation and b) spelled out pedantically enough [cf. vowel suppression in
Middle Eastern languages] as to be compatible with the input requirements of
commonly available text-to-speech technology for the current language.

The first special rule rules out ASCII art and acrostics.  The second rules
out
vowel-free Hebrew, for example.

Note: What we want is stricter than anything one can define simply as 'text.' 
This is the bug in the circular proposal [text is what is trimodal accessible]
for a UAAG definition.  That is why I have introduced separate definitions for
text and accessible text.

Note:  don't say 'usually written' because that implies there is one way.
Some
languages have multiple 'commonly written' writing systems.

We can debate about algebra and chemical formulas.  But those communities have
taken the position that they aren't plain text, so we don't have to debate too
long.

Maybe we need further down to distinguish 'plain text' from algebra and data
structures where a schema of types or symbols is required although some
processing can be performed as if plain text.
