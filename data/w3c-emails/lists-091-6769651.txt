An idea I am trying to work on:

take a bitmap image and convert it into SVG (drop the URI into the following
template:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?>
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <image xlink:href="$source$">
  </image>
</svg>

Then lay some polygons on the image to identify parts of it.

Use a service like http://swordfish.rdfweb.org/rweb/imgmeta to add some
RDF linking the pieces of the image to something they depict.

  Al Gilman noted recently that some of the discussion between the SVG group
  and the User Agent Accessiblity Guidelines group is relevant to this topic.
  The UA group has documented where they have got to in identifying
  and resolving the issues: http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2001/06/svg-lc

  Some of that is specifically relevant to the document in question, and some
  is really about editorial artifacts of that document. But in my reading I
  found that the seperation was not as clear as the table of contents imply, at
  least in how they are relevant to the current topic area.
