I made an example at http://www.w3.org/2001/08/imagePictures/001.svg (I did
it in Amaya, and found a bug in the way amaya treats metadata. But until then
it only took a few minutes. I could also use Amaya to add metadata as an
annotation if it had an authoring interface, or maybe I could work out how to
make a tool that did it automatically based on Art Barstow's bookmarklets for
Annotea).

  An idea I am trying to work on:

  take a bitmap image and convert it into SVG (drop the URI into the following
  template:

  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?>
  <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
    <image xlink:href="$source$">
    </image>
  </svg>

  Then lay some polygons on the image to identify parts of it.

  Use a service like http://swordfish.rdfweb.org/rweb/imgmeta to add some
  RDF linking the pieces of the image to something they depict.
