This just in on WebWatch from T.V. Raman.  Since it echoes things Janina Sajka
has said as well at other times, it is worth mentioning.

Re: [webwatch] Web-Based E-mail and Message Check Boxes

Well said.
the accesskey and navindex in HTML4 are some of the most
underused features.

And basically, dealing with email --especially complex mail
threads using today's WWW browsers is sub-optimal for
everyone --especially the blind user--
the W3C's own list archives being no exception (remember me
asking them for NNTP access at the Boston townhall?)--

You may want to have some of the emacspeak users describe
the mail reading and news reading user experience in vm and
gnus under emacspeak--
(sorry for putting you on the spot Jason--)
I'll copy Jason and see if he has the time to summarize the
UI.

We're putting in accesskey and navindex prominently into
XForms --whether people will use it is another question.

One thing is clear however, --if blind users make the
compromise today of having "labels" put in a manner suited
for the screenreaders of the late 80's, you wont make much
progress --
