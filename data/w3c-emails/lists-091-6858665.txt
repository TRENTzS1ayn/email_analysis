We are going to do something about the archives, but I can't say how much.  

Gregory and I will be dealing with the Team on this.  I am attaching an
edited message page with long titles that make each link very clear if you
get the title.

Lynx and, I guess Jaws will do this in a list-of-links view.

Anyhow, give it a look and listen.  Those using other than Jaws especially
invited.

If you want to do a rewrite page yourself [soon] please use the top level
index page for this list, the July index pages (by date, thread etc.) and
the message page whose edit is enclosed below, 0026.html from that month.
This will simplify comparisons.
