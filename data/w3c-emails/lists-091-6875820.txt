The text from the elment titles for the links don't show up in the normal page
view in Lynx.  But if you hit the 'l' key for the list of links view, it shows
up with the title text from the anchor slash link elements as the link text in
the list-of-links page.

Except for the skip-navigation link where the element title never shows up
even
in the list of links, because of the way that Lynx handles internal links in
this context.  The page title and not the link title is used where links go
from one place to another in the current page.

What does the list of links view in Jaws show?

Can anyone tell us what the list of links view in Window-Eyes uses?

If one does not use the list-of-links view, how hard is it to read all the
text, including what comes in each list item before the link text, and follow
the link that you wish when you get to it?
