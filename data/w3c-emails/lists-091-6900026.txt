I have tried the existing W3C mailing list archives in both Lynx 2.8
and Emacs/W3 4.0, and I have not encountered any problems at all.

The existing format works particularly well in Emacs/W3: Emacspeak
reads the subject line of each message as one moves back and forth
from link to link. Reading the current line reads the full details of
the message (sender, date, subject etc.).

I would be interested to know what the supposed problems are because I
can't find them.
