YOUR web sites FOUND and SEEN

 A Shocking Fact!

Your web site designer and your host are NOT responsible for getting your web site known! Yes, they may passively submit your site to a few search engines periodically but to get to the front of the search engines is a aggressive business,

Getting onto the search engines and at the front of their listings doesn't just happen. 

You have to be put there! What the .Net, The Internet Magazine 8/2000 said:

"You have your web site designed and have sorted out the maintenance and waiting for the business to roll in but there's one small problem. No one knows!" 

You need a professional company to do it!

Web Site Facts

Remember "The Yellow Pages" Rule! A search engine is like an enormous "yellow pages" with thousands of companies advertising the same product, unless you are near the front of the listing your chances of a customer actually seeing you is remote, 

But unlike a literal yellow pages there is a way to move YOU to the front and also get you on all of the "Yellow pages" in the world.

What does it take to be seen on the Search Engines? 

Appreciate the Three Golden Rules

? Search engines do not pull up the web sites at random they use a specific method of search. Those that do not know them are buried at the bottom! 

? Your web site must be submitted to the search engines every month otherwise your site gets pushed off (It's a bit like a Ferris wheel, you get on and then after a while you are taken off unless you get another ticket and get back on).

? Understand the importance of Keywords, Metatags, and Titles employed when submitting your site to the search engines! Use the right ones and you go up.

Get it wrong and you go to the bottom.

Some feel that it is enough to be on the large search engines. Wrong! The problem is because of their sheer size most web sites get buried. Having your web site professionally submitted can boost you up the listings of these larger search engines so you can be found on them. Also many people use the smaller search engines and if your site is professionally submitted your chances of getting to the front are greatly increased. It is essential to be on them!

Having Regal Telecom expertly submit your web site every month to worlds search engines will give YOU the Advantage you need and can make the difference between new customers FINDING your web site or NOT!

Be on ALL of these
