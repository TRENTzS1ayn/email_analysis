If you own a life insurance policy that is more than 5 years old, you could be paying DOUBLE what
you need to be paying!

See the latest rates at www.termonly.com/FREE/rates.htm

Recent changes in the life insurance industry have caused life insurance rates to drop
significantly.  So much so, that we may be able to CUT YOUR LIFE INSURANCE BILLS IN HALF!

For example:

A healthy, tobacco-free man, age 35, can apply for $100,000 of life insurance for just $8/month! 
At 45, he can apply for $100,000 of life insurance for less than $12 per month. And, at age 60 for
only $32 per month!

Special rates are also available for people who are managing diabetes, asthma, hypertension and
more.  We want to earn your business! Click here for free quotes:  www.termonly.com/FREE
