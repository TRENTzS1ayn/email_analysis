Greetings All,
                  As requested by Wendy..................
      For the last few months I have been working, as a action item
for the WCAG 2.0 working group, on the WAI Unified Glossary that Harvey
Bingham first merged in the summer of 2000.  Charles MN is the editor for
this work. As I understand it this x-tech group is partially tasked with
reviewing and commenting on the terms, and perhaps coming up with the final
definitions for this glossary. (Xtech will be meeting at the Face2Face in
Boston on Tues afternoon, I think.)
The idea is to come up with one definition that will make sense technically
when linked from all WAI normative and non-normative documents.  What I have
done most recently is scoured the w3c site's various glossaries and dumped
each one into this page.  That way, all of the existing definitions can be
viewed concurrently to help us come up with the best one for this combined
effort.  
                 Today, I came upon the "Internationalization" area of the
w3c, and clearly the terms there will be very helpful.
So, I'll keep adding found items and the rest can get to work reviewing.
Please respond to this list. ( wai-xtech@w3.org )
Thanks............... http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2000/12/unified-glossary.html
