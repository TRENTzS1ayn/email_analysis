This is a reminder that we'll be discussing the WAI glossary next Tuesday 
afternoon (27 February) during the W3C plenary week. Katie Haritos-Shea has 
been adding to the compilation of terms that Harvey created [1].  Please 
refer to the message that she sent on 9 February 2001 [2]. This meeting 
will be attended by members of the WCAG WG, AU WG, UA WG, and ERT WG to 
further the work on the unified glossary.

Room details are not available yet, but set Tuesday afternoon aside to 
discuss the glossary.

Please let me know if you plan on attending.
