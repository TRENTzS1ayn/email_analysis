  This is a reminder that we'll be discussing the WAI glossary next Tuesday
  afternoon (27 February) during the W3C plenary week. Katie Haritos-Shea has
  been adding to the compilation of terms that Harvey created [1].  Please
  refer to the message that she sent on 9 February 2001 [2]. This meeting
  will be attended by members of the WCAG WG, AU WG, UA WG, and ERT WG to
  further the work on the unified glossary.

  Room details are not available yet, but set Tuesday afternoon aside to
  discuss the glossary.

  Please let me know if you plan on attending.
