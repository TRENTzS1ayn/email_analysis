Purpose:

to provide a space for members of PF, WCAG, AU, ERT, and UA
to share information and coordinate on issues such as the
cross-guidelines glossary (aka unified glossary).  It is not
mandatory or automatic to join this list once you have joined
any of these working groups, although everyone from these lists
are invited.
