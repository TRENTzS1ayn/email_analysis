I would send a note to bobby.
The links are different because of the #reference.
Their parser must just stop at the # and it should not.

Subject:character codes and repeated link phrase questions (fwd)

I think that using a D-link with consistent text leading to different things
is not an error. Which is relevant to things like Bobby (since that is
giving
the complaint) but is also I suspect a special case that should get a WCAG
errata note.

I would advise that anything that seems to fall in this category should be
checked to see if it matches the destination of a longdesc attribute - that
should be enough to know what  it is. (or maybe not)

Subject: character codes and repeated link phrase questions

Two unrelated questions...
[first one, which was to do with character sets, has been snipped]
I get a P2 error from Bobby telling me: 'Do not use the same link phrase
more than once when the links point to different URLs'.  The examples it
refers to all relate to my 'D' links which point to the same page but with
different anchors for each image, eg:
desc.htm#baxter
desc.htm#mason
Is this an error with Bobby, or something  that can/should be worked around?
Here is the page in question:
