No, they are clearly going past that, since the probelm is that they are
saying that the same text is used to refer to different links. The point is
that in general this is a bad practice (along the lines of saying "click
here"), but in the specific case of D links there is a reason for using it,
"until user agents" get it together. (although I will still ask the Bobby
folks  to look at it)

  The links are different because of the #reference.
  Their parser must just stop at the # and it should not.

  I think that using a D-link with consistent text leading to different things
  is not an error. Which is relevant to things like Bobby (since that is
  giving
  the complaint) but is also I suspect a special case that should get a WCAG
  errata note.

  I would advise that anything that seems to fall in this category should be
  checked to see if it matches the destination of a longdesc attribute - that
  should be enough to know what  it is. (or maybe not)

  Subject: character codes and repeated link phrase questions

  Two unrelated questions...
  [first one, which was to do with character sets, has been snipped]
  I get a P2 error from Bobby telling me: 'Do not use the same link phrase
  more than once when the links point to different URLs'.  The examples it
  refers to all relate to my 'D' links which point to the same page but with
  different anchors for each image, eg:
  desc.htm#baxter
  desc.htm#mason
  Is this an error with Bobby, or something  that can/should be worked around?
  Here is the page in question:
