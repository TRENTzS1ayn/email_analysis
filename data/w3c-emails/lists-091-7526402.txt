That is really interesting. It is a friend of mine (Dave Duke) who drew my 
attention on a book C. Strothotte and T. Strothotte, Seeing Between Pixels, 
SpringerVerlag, Heidelberg, (1997), which has a chapter on the issue, 
although they concentrate a bit more on 3D graphics rendered for braile. 
Have you seen the prototype?

My original posting is really a complement. They themselves say that they 
go through the SVG tree and get the <desc> and <title> elements as source 
of information; my problem was that there is a need for a 'structure' for 
that kind of information.

It might be a good idea to have a collection of all these tools and methods 
in one place for the WAI group...
