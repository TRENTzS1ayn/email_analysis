Please note the exchange below that occurred on the GL list.

What the UAAG consistently refers to as "auditory description" is closely
related or identical to what has in the past been called "audio
description" or
"video description" at different times and places.

a) we should capture into the glossary the fact that both of the above
Terms of
Art have some currency at large and b) we should have a good reason if we want
to try to establish a new Term of Art for what is essentially the same thing.

[symbolically taking chair hat off]

In terms of Joe's original post, in my limited knowledge he describes the
pre-existing Term of Art correctly.  "Video Description" is fairly widely
recognized but there are problems with treating it as a generic term.  "Audio
Description" is preferred in the trade as a generic term for this practice, so
far as I know.

On the other hand, Joe's claim that "audio description" is the language of
Everyman does not really stand up.  "Audio description" is the term most
widely
accepted among those who know about the topic.  But most people don't know
about the concept.  In plain English for those who are unfamiliar with the
concept, "audio description" is uncomfortably ambiguous.  The concept, roughly
speaking, is "description -- in audio -- of the video."  Just saying either
"audio description" [meaning description in audio] or "video description"
[meaning description of the video] on first reading is ambiguous in plain
English.  English grammar is loose enough so that either reading [in or of] is
plausible and lots of readers won't understand the term just from reading it. 
[Point to Charles.]

My best attempt so far to make a plain English rendering of the concept in two
words is "audible descriptions."  Here 'audible' literally means you can hear
it, and the inference that it is there for you to listen to is not that
much of
a stretch, Semantic Pragmatics aside.

I believe the motivation for using "auditory description," at least in the
User
Agent guidelines, is to fairly specifically move the plane of reference for
the
term to the immediate human interface with their environment.  This is trying
to make a clear separation from audio datatypes as describing the format in
which the User Agent receives content.  The intended sense of 'auditory' here
is "targeted to the sense of hearing as presented in the physical environment
of the human user."  There is some sense that "audio" will carry a data-format
connotation to readers of the User Agent guidelines, and in the context of
those guidelines it is of some value to put an arm's-length of distance
between
that kneejerk reading and the "targeted to the sense of..." concept.

On balance, however, it is not clear why we should try to overturn the current
use of "audio description," particularly when, as in 

<<http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/Glossary/printable.html#def-alternative-equiv1>h
ttp://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/Glossary/printable.html#def-alternative-equiv1>

it is used in the sense of _reference to existing practice_ to try to
exemplify
a general concept.  "Audio description" will be recognized by most people with
some accessibility familiarity, and as Joe makes clear anything else will be
considered "just wrong" by many of them.

Joe,

english is not a formalised language like french, spanish or icelandic. And
short of a brand name (as far as I know there isn't one, and if there was
then W3C would probably be obliged not to use it in order to comply with
various legal conditions), what is required is a term that describes what is
done. "Auditory description" is one such attempt, probably better than some
and worse than others.

As it happens, I think that working on the substance of the guidelines is a
higher priority than picking a particular terminology for ideas (once it is
clear in the working group that we are all talking about the same idea).
However, we recognise that before the document is finalised, terminology is
important. So there has been for some time an activity within WAI to produce
a single glossary that all our specifications will use, and the mailing list
for comments on the topic has been advertised several times.

That is the wai-xtech@w3.org mailing list, to which I would request you
direct future discussion of teminology.

cheers
