For now I am going to keep collecting stuff in the archive of this thread,
but I hope to use it to update the SVG access note (at least to include a
section on current and future work - we need something on implementation
anyway). For anyone who doesn't know how to find the archives, this thread
begins at http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/wai-xtech/2001Jul/0000 and can
then be followed. So I would request that future posts remove people from teh
cc: list, unless people say otherwise.

I am adding here a reference to work by Zdenek Mikovec who has done some
very similar work at Czech Technical University. I am hoping that the contact
details are still current - the page has not been updated for 18 months, but
the BIS project is what I am referring to.

(Thanks to Lori Stefano Petrucci and Patrick Roth from University of Geneva,
who have been doing related work - http://websound.unige.ch/ and some more
closely related stuff I can't find on the web yet - and pointed me
to this)

  That is really interesting. It is a friend of mine (Dave Duke) who drew my
  attention on a book C. Strothotte and T. Strothotte, Seeing Between Pixels,
  SpringerVerlag, Heidelberg, (1997), which has a chapter on the issue,
  although they concentrate a bit more on 3D graphics rendered for braile.
  Have you seen the prototype?

  My original posting is really a complement. They themselves say that they
  go through the SVG tree and get the <desc> and <title> elements as source
  of information; my problem was that there is a need for a 'structure' for
  that kind of information.

  It might be a good idea to have a collection of all these tools and methods
  in one place for the WAI group...
