Hi, Geoff --

In March you wrote to the WAI UA working group about the use of the 
term "auditory
description" instead of "audio description", as quoted here:

The term has been questioned on the WCAG working group list
as well, and I'd like to ask you for more information.  Specifically,
I wrote the following recently as a way of describing how I would
approach the discrepancy:

Can you share your own thoughts on this topic, Geoff?  I would like 
to hear what
you have to say regarding this.

(FWIW, to my ears -- unaccustomed to multimedia accessibility issues -- the
term "auditory description" seems more explicit than "audio description", but I
don't have your background and would like to benefit from your experience on
this topic. Thanks.)
