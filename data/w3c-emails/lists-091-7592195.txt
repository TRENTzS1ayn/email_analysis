Note: Based on Geoff's comment, the 22 June draft [1] of UAAG 1.0 
includes both:

   <BLOCKQUOTE>
   An auditory description (sometimes, "audio description") is 
   either a prerecorded human voice or a synthesized
   voice (recorded or generated dynamically) describing the key visual 
   elements of a movie or other animation. The  auditory description is
   synchronized with the audio track of the presentation, usually during 
   natural pauses in the audio track. Auditory descriptions include 
   information about actions, body language, graphics, and scene
changes.
