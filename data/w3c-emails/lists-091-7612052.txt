(most of the extra cc removed in the hope that people are reading the
archives if they want to follow this)

Al Gilman noted recently that some of the discussion between the SVG group
and the User Agent Accessiblity Guidelines group is relevant to this topic.
The UA group has documented where they have got to in identifying
and resolving the issues: http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/2001/06/svg-lc

Some of that is specifically relevant to the document in question, and some
is really about editorial artifacts of that document. But in my reading I
found that the seperation was not as clear as the table of contents imply, at
least in how they are relevant to the current topic area.
