Good points.  Are there any reasons not to make the change?  (I
"feel" subtle differences myself between the two, but I think those
are a result of my unfamiliarity with the 'audio description' term,
and a good glossary could undoubtedly clear things up.)

UAAG takes the approach of using BOTH terms.  Might that be a good
and useful approach, or is it stronger to simply choose one or the
other?  (I think it probably is better to stick with one term here.)

Dude, this is the W3C, we're -supposed- to sound pretentious and
clinical. ;)

I'm only half-joking here!  Any group which routinely says "user
agents" can't avoid opening itself up to charges of this type.
