I would prefer to maintain the terminology which has been used in
previous W3C/WAI documents, including the Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines 1.0 Recommendation, unless there are compelling reasons for
a change, which do not exist in this case.

What matters, above all, is that terms be well defined (in the
glossary and elsewhere), and that they be used consistently.
