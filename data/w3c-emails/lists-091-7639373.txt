Hi, Kynn and everyone else:

Well, I stick by my original post:  I prefer audio description to auditory
description.  If you say "auditory description" to someone in the AD
industry, you'll get a weird look and hear "You mean *audio* description,"
in reply.  Ian proposed using both terms in the UAAG guidelines ("An
auditory description (sometimes, "audio description")..."), something I am
not crazy about but can live with because the difference between the two is
rather fine and I don't think it's worth having a _huge_ discussion over it.
(Which is why I haven't kicked and screamed since Ian came up with that
compromise.)  But since you've asked... given my druthers, I would rather
see the WAI use audio description, for all the reasons I've stated before:
it's an accepted term in the industry (reason enough right there) and has
been in steady use for a number of years, and it's already part of Section
508 and the SMIL 2.0 soon-to-be recommendation.  If we use this term
consistently in all documents, the general public will, in fact, become
familiar with it and thus come to know what it means.

Subject: The term "auditory description"


Hi, Geoff --

In March you wrote to the WAI UA working group about the use of the
term "auditory
description" instead of "audio description", as quoted here:

The term has been questioned on the WCAG working group list
as well, and I'd like to ask you for more information.  Specifically,
I wrote the following recently as a way of describing how I would
approach the discrepancy:

Can you share your own thoughts on this topic, Geoff?  I would like
to hear what
you have to say regarding this.

(FWIW, to my ears -- unaccustomed to multimedia accessibility issues -- the
term "auditory description" seems more explicit than "audio description",
but I
don't have your background and would like to benefit from your experience on
this topic. Thanks.)
