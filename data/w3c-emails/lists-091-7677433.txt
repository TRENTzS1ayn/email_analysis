I (like Joe) like the term audio description, becuase it is shorter. People
can misunderstand nearly any term we use, and so I agree with Jason that it
is critical that we clearly define what we mean, and I think the approach of
having both in the glossary is a good one.

     An auditory description (sometimes, "audio description") is
     either a prerecorded human voice or a synthesized
     voice (recorded or generated dynamically) describing the key visual
     elements of a movie or other animation. The  auditory description is
     synchronized with the audio track of the presentation, usually during
     natural pauses in the audio track. Auditory descriptions include
     information about actions, body language, graphics, and scene
  changes.
