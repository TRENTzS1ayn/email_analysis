I agree, if it really is an industry standard, why then not use it and use 
it consistently. However, as we are making a transition from one term to 
another we have to be careful to link it to an explanation and have both in 
glossary. What Ian suggests above is a good start (but the other way). It 
not using two terms throughout the document but making a link between these 
two terms at the beginning and then using one. Now we could just make the 
audio description the main term and put auditory description in parenthesis.

I agree. When we there is not much difference and it is difficult for us to 
get others to change their terminology, why not change ourselves and be 
consistent. But it is also important to see that the other terms we use are 
different enough so that the whole set makes sense.
