Hi Gregory,

The graphic is a square about an inch or so high, with roughly the
dimensions of a tv screen or monitor.  It's got a black background, and
the other main colors are green and red.  The green is a "frame"
similar to a targetting scope; it's meant to represent a radar screen.
There are sorta crosshairs and stuff on it.  A yellow "glow" sweeps
out a circle in the middle a la radar tracking stuff -- although there
are no "blips" that I can see. :)  The animation takes a little less
than a second (at a guess) to cycle the "swoosh" through the circle.

The text is overlaid in red, and reads:

RADAR
