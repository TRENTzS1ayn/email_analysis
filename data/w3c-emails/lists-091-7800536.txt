You'd have to ask the author this -- third party viewer's intent is
less valuable than author's!

Red.

Serif, maybe something like Times New Roman.  Is that important?

Not necessarily, it depends on (a) what it's meant to do, and (b) how
it is used.  Let's not assume that looking at a graphic in a background
can tell us anything about how useful it is!!

If I was looking for RADAR at AAMR, then sure.

This is an effect of a broken spec for the <img> tag.  Currently
you can only do this:

      <img alt="RADAR @ AAMR" />

...or an expansion of the same.

But ideally you should be able to do:

     <img>
       <abbr>RADAR</abbr>
       <abbr>@</abbr>
       <abbr>AAMR</abbr>
     </img>

The problem is that <img> is an empty tag when really it should be like
<object>.
