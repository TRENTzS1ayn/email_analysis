This issue has gone around before, and also through the i18n group because
the user agent group wanted to know whether their impression that sans-serif
fonts were easier to read had paralells in other scripts.

As far as the results of the discussion there are different fonts that work
for different people, and no really universal answer. Lucky we can change
those as users.

Oh, and your sisters could turn there monitors over...

  Greg,

           Re: fonts. serif fonts provide better distinction of words rather
  than letters. Speed readers prefer serif fonts.
  Serif fonts make a sentence in a paragraph more distinct that with a sans
  serif font.

           Currently, I'm making a Cookbook section on our homepage, and I
  find the recipe pages are most appealling and would be most useful (to me
  at least), is to use the serif front for title, catchy line and servings,
  and the recipe directions. The ingredients are bulletted (to conserve
  screen space), and in a sans serif font. I have two sisters with a unique
  form of dyslexia where the bottom half of the letters is invisible. For
  them, a serif font gives them more letter to see. Both read best with a
  book upside down, which is not currently a user option on computers.

                                                   Anne
