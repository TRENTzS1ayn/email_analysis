aloha, again, kynn!

by the way, what i was attempting to underscore (evidentially,
unsuccessfully) was the irony implicit in the fact that, quite often pages
designated as "printer friendly" or "print version" are often -- at least
for someone reliant on text-to-speech conversion, such as myself -- the
most accessible way to access the content of a site or particular document
(especial technical documents and newspapers) 

ironic, because i thought that 2 of the euphemisms to which i was entitled
was "print handicapped" and his PC brother, "print impaired"...  oh well,
guess it just goes to show that you can't take _anything_ for granted... 

gregory.
