Greg,

         Great site!! Thanks. I checked a few of their categories, but 
focused on their advice for making web pages for children (since I make a 
lot of pages for the kids), and found their observations consistent with 
what I've seen of the kids using the web during the past two years. I found 
it interesting that I'd learned to use the 14 point ariel for the pages and 
that is what they say is a preferred font to fifth graders. Must work with 
younger kids just as well.

         Look forward to your reply. I just gave up on my fourth attempt in 
five years to use outlook, and went back to Eudora.

                                         Anne
