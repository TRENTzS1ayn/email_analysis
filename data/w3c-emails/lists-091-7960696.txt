Greg,

         The http://m-w.com site is an excellent educational resource. I 
was a bit amused at your "prosaic every day use"  at a kiosk, sending email 
without a spell checker. Bet there are very, very few hits to the site with 
that use, but suspect the site has many hits of kids looking up definitions 
for their homework. Kids with advanced computer skills will copy and past 
the definitions to a word processor document and turn that in, and the 
traditional student will handwrite a copy from screen to homework paper. 
Incidentally, the games provided on the site, tho geared to much older 
students than I work with, are interesting even to an adult who likes word 
games.  The Word of the Day activities are perfect for classrooms. The 
games are changed daily, so the site is encouraging frequent use by those 
who like such activities.

         So, I doubt seriously that "prosaic everyday use" is as a 
substitute for a spell checker. The site offers so very much more, all of 
it valuable to different 
folks. 


         But I see the problem you have with the site. The input fields for 
Dictionary and Thesaurus are in the middle of the page - perfect for visual 
users, but when you listen to it, you have to focus on the stuff that a 
visual user can ignore if they are coming only to use the input fields.  It 
may be nice if the site had a basic version designed for speech readers, 
but even then if they put the dictionary and thesaurus fields first, there 
will be some users who would prefer the first link to go to the word or 
game of the day.

         If I ever knew, I've forgotten what WAP stands for, but it sounds 
like it is solving the problem of providing the page in a version you find 
useful.

                                                 Anne

PS: Sometimes when folks put a page up to be printed, such as coloring 
pages, they forget to allow for the browser top and bottom, and you end up 
with a picture printed on two pieces of paper until you download the 
graphic and print it offline.
