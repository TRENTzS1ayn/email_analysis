My main worry about using <img> for "invisible" skip nav links is that
it's just more of misusing the markup; it's a hack, and not a real good
solution for the long term.  It involves mislabeling and misapplying
alt text, and using images pointlessly, and confuses presentation and
structure and content -- and ultimately that will not prove to be a
blessing for the cause.

Without sounding too much like an advertisement for Reef EveryWare
(I hope), I really do think the best general solution is to create web
sites which can automatically adapt themselves (or be adapted) to
provide those types of links on demand for anyone who would request
them.

This is one of the cases in which there is no good solution using a
single interface.  A "skip navigation" link is required by people who
can benefit from it, but it serves only to confuse and damage the
usability for those who don't.  This is a case where a single-interface
presentation will continue to prove to be limited, and where there is
a need for a system that can produce output tailored to the expressed
needs of the users, rather than simply relying on a "one size fits
all" approach.
