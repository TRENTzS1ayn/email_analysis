aloha, yet again!

ok, i vow to be even more vigilant in the future (i swear i re-read these
things at least 5 times before i post), but somehow the quote i copied into
my post got garbled...  the definition, in full, of 'speak' from Section 19
of Cascading Style Sheets, Level 2, follows:

<quote>
'speak'
     Value:         normal | none | spell-out | inherit
     Initial:       normal
     Applies to:    all elements
     Inherited:     yes
     Percentages:   N/A
     Media:         aural

This property specifies whether text will be rendered aurally and if so, in
what manner (somewhat analogous to the 'display' property). The possible
values are:

none
     Suppresses aural rendering so that the element requires no time to
     render. Note, however, that descendants may override this value and
     will be spoken. (To be sure to suppress rendering of an element and its
     descendants, use the 'display' property).
normal
     Uses language-dependent pronunciation rules for rendering an element
     and its children.
spell-out
     Spells the text one letter at a time (useful for acronyms and
     abbreviations).

Note the difference between an element whose 'volume' property has a value
of 'silent' and an element whose 'speak' property has the value 'none'. The
former takes up the same time as if it had been spoken, including any pause
before and after the element, but no sound is generated. The latter requires
no time and is not rendered (though its descendants may be).
