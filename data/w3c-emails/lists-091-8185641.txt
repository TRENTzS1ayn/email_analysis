Hi Katie et al:

At http://www.who.int/icidh/
You will find the international directive for the classification of
diseases.
It should be kept in mind that at the moment the applicable version is the
previous one (ICIDH1)
I believe that the documents of the WAI should be adjusted to this
classification and their definitions, this way, in the entire world we will
understand of what we are speaking exactly.
I hope this information is useful.

Regards,
Emmanuelle

Subject: Disability Categories. Need for Consistency Across WAI Documents.
Provide FEEDBACK please........


> The WAI needs to agree on what disabilities we are going to list, and
under
> which category.  I initially used the list from "How People With
> Disabilities Use the Web", so we could link to the examples.  There has
been
