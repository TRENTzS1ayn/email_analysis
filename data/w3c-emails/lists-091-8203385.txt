AG::

This is very useful, it seems to me.

To the extent that we go for taxonomic standards, we should first seek to find
those with world-wide recognition.

On the other hand, I think we have to be careful how we describe the
discipline
that we will adopt.  I think that "use these terms and categories" is too
rigid
a statement.  I would prefer "use this taxonomy as the basis for definition
and
comparison."  What I mean is that each document can, if there is a good
reason,
use other groupings that suit the story being told in that document; but any
category and the terms used for that category must be documented as to how
they
relate to the International Standard taxonomy.

Then if one document is talking apples and another is talking Pippins[1] we
can
go to the respective glossaries and find out the relationship from what is
there.

Are there demographic numbers published in terms of the ICIDH1 categories?  If
we use these categories, can we begin to be able to answer quantitative
questions?

Al

[1] Note: Yes, Pippin is a name used for some varieties of apples.
