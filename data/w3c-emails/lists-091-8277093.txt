Subject:CONTENT???? re: WAI

http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/#glossary
http://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG10/#definitions
The WAI work that you lead is impressive and very hopeful, however, there so
much mention of "content" through out all the WAI specs and documentation
that confusion is begining to be a barrier in communications at the
implementation levels in our community.
CONTENT needs a definition, deserves a definition and is becoming a
requirement.  The two documents found at the above URL's don't include a
CONTENT definition to help un-snag WAI discussions with IT people. IT people
here are arguing that CONTENT and DATA are not the same nor are they
related. Whether there's a global consensus about the distinction is
problematic and is getting in the way of advancing user and end user WAI
requirements.
I'd recommend and appreciate a CONTENT definition inclusion in the WAI
documents on terminology. At the very least, I would appreciate any help
from your team in providing ME a definition for CONTENT.
Thanks,
Bruce
