Here is a topic that is closely linked with the vocabulary we use in writing
our specifications.  It's highly technical in a sense but it makes most sense
to apply any practices we decide on across the board.  This is a topic for the
W3C QA activity if there is one, as well.

There have been a lot of examples of difference in interpreting the
specifications as far as understanding what is normative or definitive and
what
is descriptive or illustrative.

The definition of 'equivalent' in WCAG 1.0 being a celebrated case in point.

In the 'is SUMMARY _required_' debate we have a similar example where many
readers will unconsciously promote an example to rule status.

This is how regulations get to be written in stilted prose.  But writing in a
mechanical, very overt style, will reduce the incidence of people reading the
same words to mean different things.

What I am particularly thinking of is field labels for the sub-parts of a
paragraph which introduce and mark the sub-parts that are in different modes.

Possible parts are:

[paragraph index] [paragraph title]

[contextual setup]

[definitive statement of the clause or rule 'created' by this paragraph]

[examples of application of this rule]

[other notes.  Notes do not extend or restrict the rule as stated, but clarify
the rule or its interaction with other rules.]

Note:  The definitive statement of the rule may depend on things said of a
declarative or descriptive nature in the contextual setup section.  The
definition of what is required may not depend on the examples or other notes.

AG::

I have to object to your reading of the "plain meaning" of the English.? 

It does not say "for [any] HTML use the SUMMARY attribute on [all] TABLEs."

What it says is, 'For example, in HTML, use the "summary" attribute of the
TABLE element.'

This leaves plenty of room for "in HTML, use the CAPTION subelement within a
TABLE" to be yet another conforming example.

What it says, in plain English, is that it provides an illustrative example,
and not "a rule for all HTML TABLEs."

PS:? This illustrates a general pattern I am picking up.? People make lots of
quantifier errors in reading English.? Probably natural language in general.?
People don't reliably understand the difference between the restrictive effect
of i.e. and the non-restrictive effect of e.g.? Even when you spell them out,
for example as "for example."
