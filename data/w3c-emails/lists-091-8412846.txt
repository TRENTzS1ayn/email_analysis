The ATAG techniques transformation (I think - maybe it is the main
transofrmation) has a method for extracting entries from a glossary formatted
as a definition term. I will try to write up a page this week that lets you
extract a term directly from a form.

The ATAG sources and transformations are at http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/sources
- I am not sure i the relevant bit is up to date but if not I will work on it
in a couple of days.

cheers
