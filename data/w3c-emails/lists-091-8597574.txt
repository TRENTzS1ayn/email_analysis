Hi William and all,

All the acronyms are abbreviated forms, but they are not abbreviations,
there is difference among these two terms.
And the readers offer different functions for the use of the abbreviations
and of the acronyms. And the navigators react in a different way when a text
labeled as abbreviation appears and when it appears labeled as acronym.
If the creators of languages for the Web want to simplify, creating an
unique label as much for abbreviations as for acronyms, the ideal thing
would be that doesn't have the name of none of these two terms for not
confusing the user, because the user will always use, as it is the case,
abbreviations and acronyms.But at the moment the two labels exist and the
WAI should give example of good use.

Regards,
Emmanuelle

Much has been said about this but one fact remains: all acronyms are
abbreviations.

It doesn't matter much to the user because what's needed in any case is an
expansion of  these non-words.
