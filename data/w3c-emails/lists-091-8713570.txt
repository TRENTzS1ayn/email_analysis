The original idea behind Transform Gracefully was that the pages would be
designed so that if the default presentation was not possible (because key
technologies were either not available of turned off) the page could be
displayed successfully in other forms.  That is, if the page could not be
presented as the author would optimally prefer,  that it could transform
gracefully into forms that would be displayable within the constraints of
the user agent that the user had.
