It also raises the question of "which users" or "how many" and "what
must they be using"?  If you can find a case in which one person --
with multiple disabilities and unusual hardware/software -- is unable
to access something, does that make it a P1?  Or not?

E.g., if something is accessible to blind users, and deaf users,
and cognitively impaired users, and limited dexterity users -- but
not to a blind, deaf, limited dexterity, cognitively-impaired user
who isn't running a braille terminal and has no pointer device --
is that "inaccessible" according to P1 priorities?

If something takes one click for a non-disabled user, but requires
5 clicks for a blind user, is that "impossible"?  What about 10
clicks?  What about 25?  What about 100?

What if someone doesn't have a web browser?

What if someone doesn't have a web browser we -like-?
