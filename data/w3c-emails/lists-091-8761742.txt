Ooooooooo

This gets right to the core of our soft spot.

There will ALWAYs be someone who can't use something..    (so everything is
P1?)

And we can't define what is "harder enough"   to push a P3 to a P2.


SO I am afraid that we will have to admit that what we do is get a group of
talented and informed people together and do our best to define what is
reasonable to put into categories   1   2 and 3.     we can define these all
we want.  But we will not strictly follow those guidelines.  In the end we
will call them.   And our call will be questioned or ratified.   And that
will be the guidelines or 'recommendation".

Have to admit it........

It also raises the question of "which users" or "how many" and "what
must they be using"?  If you can find a case in which one person --
with multiple disabilities and unusual hardware/software -- is unable
to access something, does that make it a P1?  Or not?

E.g., if something is accessible to blind users, and deaf users,
and cognitively impaired users, and limited dexterity users -- but
not to a blind, deaf, limited dexterity, cognitively-impaired user
who isn't running a braille terminal and has no pointer device --
is that "inaccessible" according to P1 priorities?

If something takes one click for a non-disabled user, but requires
5 clicks for a blind user, is that "impossible"?  What about 10
clicks?  What about 25?  What about 100?

What if someone doesn't have a web browser?

What if someone doesn't have a web browser we -like-?
