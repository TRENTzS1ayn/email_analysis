This message is a topic-framing thread starter for a review and hopefully
reform of the Web interface to the W3C email archives.  Gregory Rosmaita has
noticed that the interface to the email archives has accessibility defects.?
Judy Brewer has indicated that we should prepare a reform that is for all W3C
archives, and not just for the WAI lists.  So Daniel Dardailler and I have
sketched out a two-cycle plan of attack.

Homework phase 1: review and design, leading to design proposal.

I will coordinate the formulation of a design proposal for a restructuring of
the web archive interface.? This will be based on review of the existing
interface.? It will include preparation of design options as hand-built
individual pages, but not generation of a whole list archive.? 

I would like to run this discussion on this list.  Please use the mark
[archives] to identify posts in this thread so we don't get too mixed up with
the glossary or other topics that run concurrently.

Let's take at least a week on datagathering.  This includes access or
usability
issues with the current web interface to the W3C email archives,
suggestions of
good sites that serve a similar function, drafting page mockups to show what
could be done, etc.  Then there will be a time interval I haven't estimated
yet.  Have to see what we get in the way of raw data.

This phase will draw to a close with a written review of the issues and draft
redesign offered for Jose to review and the next meeting to decide about.

Meeting 1: decide on a redesign for an evaluation version or draft change:

Daniel will chair a caucus where Jose and the proposers go over what the
design
proposal would mean in terms of modifications to Hypermess, and settle on a
design change to take into Homework phase 2:

Homework phase 2: implement and evaluate evaluation version: 

Meeting 2:  Review evaluation results for evaluation version.? Agenda: Decide
whether to implement the evaluation version or a close derivative thereof
site-wide across W3C archives.
