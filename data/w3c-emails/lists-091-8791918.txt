Is there a reference available to a document or e-mail message describing
what the supposed problems are? I have been using the W3C e-mail archives
for years without any difficulty whatsoever, and a quick perusal of the
HTML source doesn't reveal anything that would strike me as a significant
access issue. Which checkpoints (either in WCAG 1.0 or WCAG 2.0) have not
been met, or are there issues here which aren't reflected in the WCAG, but
ought to be?
