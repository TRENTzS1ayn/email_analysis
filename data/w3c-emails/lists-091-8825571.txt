I like YahooGroups, was eGroups
I find the current search mechanism really unfriendly.

If I go to this page
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/

I end up with this '+w3c-wai-ig ' defaulting in the
search box, that just confuses me.

I have just realised why it does this!

I have to put my search term after that to get it just
to search the wai-ig! This is so 'non standard' it has
taken me over 6 months from first using it to realise
this.

If i do a simple search I get back far too much
information _for each_ entry in the search results,
alot of it is not relevant.

Here is the first of 7258 hits if I do a search for

Aslo include an option to sort by reverse date
(possibly the default, as these things go out of date
so quickly)
