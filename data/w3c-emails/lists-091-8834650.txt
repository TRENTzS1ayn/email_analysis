The wai-xtech list is a breakout room.  It is used for ad-hoc caucuses on
an as
needed basis.  There is a long term thread on glossary coordination being
carried forward here, and other topics as need be.  The web interface to the
archives is one of those.

It does not have a continuing charter or focus except to provide a slightly
separate space for discussions which are both too detailed to be Coordination
Group business and too cross-cutting to be assigned to one or another of the
chartered Working Groups or Interest Groups.

Joining and leaving are explained in the message below, which also explains
how
you can get it.

******* About the W3C Mailing Lists *******

There are many mailing lists provided by the W3C for discussion
and development on the World Wide Web. A full list of them
is available at:

?? <http://www.w3.org/Mail/Lists.html>http://www.w3.org/Mail/Lists.html

NOTE that this list is not the place for any of the following:

?? How do I configure [insert-favorite-software-here]?
?? I'm new to the web -- what is it?
?? I tried to ask [insert-company-here] customer support, but
??????? [I didn't get any response / they told me to RTFM]
?? What does RTFM mean?

Answers to the above are often found in the WWW FAQ maintained
by Thomas Boutell.? The FAQ is available from several sites.
Use the mirror closest to you: 

?? Sunsite, eastern United States (North America):
??????

?? Internex Online, Montreal, eastern Canada (North America):

locom.ac.jp/mirror/www.boutell.com/faq/index.htm

The FAQ also lists the names of all the USENET newsgroups that are
available regarding the WWW (most under the
comp.infosystems.<http://www.*/>www.*
hierarchy).

******* Administrative Requests *******

The -request mail address should be used for all list administrative
requests.? It accepts the following commands (in the Subject of an
e-mail message):

??? subscribe???????? -- Subscribe to the list.? If you want to subscribe
???????????????????????? under a different address, use a Reply-To: address
???????????????????????? header in the message.

??? unsubscribe?????? -- Unsubscribe from the list.

??? help????????????? -- Get information about the mailing list.

??? archive help????? -- Get information about the list archive(s).

In the event of an address change, it would probably be wisest to first
send an unsubscribe for the old address (this can be done from the new
address), and then a new subscribe from the new address (the order is
important).

Most (un)subscription requests are processed automatically without human
intervention.? Do not send multiple (un)subscription or info requests in
one mail.? Only one will be processed per mail.

NOTE: The -request server usually does quite a good job in discriminating
????? between (un)subscribe requests and messages intended for the
????? maintainer.? If you'd like to make sure a human reads your message,
????? make it look like a reply (i.e. the first word in the Subject: field
????? should be "Re:", without the quotes of course); the -request server
????? does not react to replies.

******* Archive Server *******

Every submission sent to this list is archived.? Archives of public
lists are available at URL:

??? <http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/>http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/

If you want to access this archive by e-mail, you have to send mail
to the -request address with the word "archive" as the first word of
your Subject:.? To get you started, try sending a mail to the -request
address with the following:

??? Subject: archive help
