Yes. Tim showed me a very simple drawing on his whiteboard once.
An arrow closed into a circle (with arrow head touching arrow tail).
The system modeled by the circle was the "old Web", where the system
sits and waits for user interaction (e.g., following a link). After
that action, the system waits again, completing one loop.

In the Semantic Web, there's another agent: the machine. The machine
can do some things automatically, allowing a lot of loops to happen
before the system stops again to wait for user input.
