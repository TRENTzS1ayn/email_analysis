actually making the archives available in normal mail foormat is wsomething
that thre was solme interest in at the plenary - if that would help then it
would be helpful to know that there is more support for it.

But to me it is important to be able to find things in the archive on the
web, and have a URI for them. Hmmm...

  What if you just had them sent to your email.  Then one wouldn't need to
  worry about formatting.  They would all just show up.  Say with   ARCHIVE:
  at the front of the subject line to make them easy to sort out on arrival.

  Subject:[archives]suggestion: local download

  What at I'd like, personally, is a means for downloading a selected set of
  messages to my local computer, to import into my local email program. This
  would be at least an interim solution for accessibility problems, assuming
  of course that users have accessible email programs, and assuming that the
  download options includes their file format. It would also be a convenience
  for everyone since it's lots faster to scan email once it's local.

  Features:
  1. choice of format for eudora, outlook, etc. (I personally use eudora).
  Note: we may be able to omit formats for programs that import from other
  programs.
  2. ability to select messages to be downloaded by:
      a. date range
      b. subject line
      c. author
