Gregg's suggestion would work for me, especially since I could set up a 
filter to pump them into a folder.  It would also me easer on the receving 
end since people wouldn't have to figure out how to import the file. Only 
drawback is that it would be slower than receiving a compressed file.

Regardless of how we do it, it would be in addition to the web archive so 
we'd still have urls.
