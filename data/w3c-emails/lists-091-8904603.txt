Harvey,

I've forwarded this e-mail to the xtech mailing list so it can be included 
in the archives.  Please send future e-mail on the combined glossary to 
that list.

Thanks,
--wendy

>Good to see Section 2 Abbreviations in the current draft. Thanks
>for continued work on it. I've 4 suggestions, following.
>
>1. Merged Glossary I appreciate the means to incorporate current glossary 
>terms and definitions from the many documents. An extension might be to
>extract glossary terms from all W3C documents referenced among the WAI 
>documents. Either WAI-only or WAI+Referenced forms could be exposed.
>
>2. See and See Also References One potential problem appears in the
>glossary of the User Agent Guidelines [UAAG10]:
>
>A glossary term may actually contain several related or contrasted terms,
>without separate definition references to those different terms.
>In a combined glossary, these should as a minimum have cross-references.
>Both "see" and "see also" references are appropriate. WCAG10 at one
>point uses "Also"
>
>Application Programming Interface (API), standard input/output/device API
>Configure, Control
>Document Object, Document Object Model
>Document source, Document source view
>Enabled element, disabled element
>Events and scripting, event handler
>Focus, content focus, user interface focus, current focus
>Normative, informative
>Properties, values, and defaults
>Rendered content, rendered text
>Repair content, repair text
>Selection, current selection
>Support, implement, conform
>Text content, non-text content, text element, non-text element, text 
>equivalent non-text equivalent
>Views, viewports
>
>The current unified glossary:
>    http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2000/12/unified-glossary
>picks up those UAAG10 terms, approximately.
>Some examples:
>
>Accessibility [ATAG10] (Also: Accessible [ATAG10])
>Configure and Control [UAAG10]
>Document Content, Structure, and Presentation [WCAG10] [WCAG20]
>Document Object, Document Object Model [UAAG10]
>Document Source, Document Source View [UAAG10]
>Documents, Elements, and Attributes [UAAG10]
>DTD's, Documents Definition Types
>THAT ONE IS WRONG, "Document Type Definitions"
>...
>Dyslexia, Dyscalculia [PWD-Use-Web1]
>Element has five variants from five sources.
>...
>Events and scripting, event handler [UAAG10]
>Event has two other definitions
>Focus, content focus, user interface focus, current focus [UAAG10]
>Local URI reference, Non-local URI reference [SVG10]
>MacRomanEncoding, MacExpertEncoding, or WinAnsi Encoding [WCAG10] [WCAG20] 
>(PDF-Tech)
>Map, mapped [WCAG10] [WCAG20]
>Normative / Non-normative [WCAG10] [WCAG20]
>Parser, Parsing XML, XHTML
>Prompt has two definitions
>Properties, values, and defaults [UAAG10]
>Repair content, Repair text [UAAG10]
>Rendered content, rendered text [UAAG10]
>Selection , Current selection [UAAG10]
>Style sheets, Valid style sheets [WCAG10] [WCAG20]
>Support, Implement, Conform [UAAG10]
>Text [UAAG10] NEW 01-01-25 NEW LINKS 01-01-13
>    Text content, non-text content, text element, non-text element,
>    text equivalent, non-text equivalent
>Type 0 font, Type 1 font [WCAG10] [WCAG20] (PDF-Tech)
>User Agent has 4 definitions.
>User coordinate system, user space [SVG10]
>User-initiated and User Agent-initiated [UAAG10]
>User units, user space [SVG10]
>Views, viewports, and current viewport [UAAG10]
>Viewport coordinate system, viewport space [SVG10]
>
>Note that some of the terms are logically
>at the appropriate alphabetical place, but
>others are not. A reader should find the
>sought term at its proper alphabetic place
>in the glossary, and may find a "see"
>reference there. For example:
>
>Graceful Transformation, Graceful Degradation NEW 01-03-23
>See: Transform Gracefully
>
>3. Inconsistent Multiple Forms
>
>Normative / Non-normative   WCAG 1.0 and 2.0
>
>Whereas the form from UAAG10 is (as recently added):
>
>Normative, informative
>
>4. Capitalization Consistency: The entries from some sources,
>including [PWD-Use-Web1] [SSML11]
>have all words capitalized. Other sources only
>capitalize the first word of a term or phrase.
>Others capitalize only "important" words.
>
>Inconsistent capitalization occurs in [WCAG10] [WCAG20]
>
