I realize that it is not "cool" to change URL's, but the longer I wait the
worse it is going to be.
I really needed to organize the directory structure. So.........
The new WAI Glossary has many nice features (however unfinished)!
Have incorporated the new glossary words from UAAG 1.0 new
Draft[WD-UAAG10-20010409].
All documents are xhtml.
Using the WAI Resources style sheet, to coordinate with........WAI
Resources............go figure......
For now we will be working on
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/Glossary/printable.html called the WAI Printable
Glossary.
This page has all of the definitions together while we are trying to figure
out what to do with them.
(Everything is all on one page and VERY slow)
In the future our links to the WAI Glossary will actually go to
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/Glossary/Overview.html (or Glossary Home), a quick
loading page, that has a top link to the Printable Glossary, for those who
so desire.

Separately, but linked from the WAI Glossary Home page are:
WAI Abbreviations http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/Glossary/abbr.html
WAI References http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/Glossary/refer.html  (That is
refer, not "reefer")
and many pages by one or two letters of the Alphabet
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/Glossary/B.html ,
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/Glossary/J-K.html ,
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/Glossary/S.html ,
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/Glossary/V.html ,
http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/Glossary/W-X.html , etc.

Only the definitions that start with "A", are on the WAI Glossary Home
page http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/Glossary/Overview.html , for neatness.


As you can see, all of these Docs live in a new WAI directory on CVS and
Jigedit, named surprisingly, Glossary.
