Good point, William..............I'll fix that.  The talk in Boston seemed
to center around some kind of permanent dating system, if it is to be
normative.  I am all for having this be dated as we go along, what do you
all think we should do at this point?..................Katie

You are never asleep at the wheel are you William?  Take
care.................Katie

I don't know if this has already been worried to death but...

If the glossary has "acronym" in it (which includes "abbreviation" in its
definition), it should have "abbreviation" in it - particularly since it's
the basis for a tag of some sort?

If this is the latest working draft, why is it dated 10 February?
