So might documents.

Also documents might include content.

It is possible that content could include elements and documents.

Files could include any/all/none(?) of the above.

And of course all these are objects (which also might include 
some/all/none/any).

I may be mistaken but it's also possible that any of these can have a URI 
and now that I've emailed this it is referenced by a link. (within, of 
course, a document).

This fails to take into account instances and statements about the 
instances - all of which are data (and often simultaneously metadata)

Now if I could just transform any/all of that gracefully!

Once again "Welcome to the Pedantic Web".
