Good question.

What is the WEB.  It is HTTP retrievable information?  Or any information
retrievable over TCP/IP?   Or IP?    Or via other protocols?

I don't know if I know what the definition of the Web is?     Funny how you
use a term but can't define it.

What is the definition?

Subject:Glossary: Web Content

I just noticed that the WAI glossary [1] is lacking a definition for
the term "Web Content", which is rather odd. I wanted to reuse a
definition for EARL, but found that I couldn't just steal one from
WCAG, which is a shame...

Really, "Web Content" should be used to indicate any network
retrievable "Web Resource" [2], but I think that WCAG uses it in the
sense of "content suitable for use in a hypermedia environment", i.e.
anything that can be handled by HTTP.
