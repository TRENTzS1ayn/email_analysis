Yep, I agree with that. Still, I think that a lot of people see "HTTP"
(an perhaps FTP) as being all that the Web really has to offer... and
it's the sense of "Web" that I felt WCAG using. Not essential to the
definition though so yes, go with the former.

"Web Content" is any network retrievable "Web Resource".
