I am not quite in agreement because you can do "content negotiation"
while seeking a single resource. Therefore, it would seem that
content is what you get back as the manifestation of a resource.

I would also say that content does not include the HTTP
entity header, for example. 

This is one reason why UAAG 1.0 equates content with the 
document object.
