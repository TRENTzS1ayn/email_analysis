This from Tim Berners-Lee [1]:

"My definition of the Web is a universe of network-accessible 
information, and I break the "full potential" into two by looking 
at it first as a means of human-to-human communication, and then 
as a space in which software agents can, though access to a vast
amount of everything which is society, science and its problems, 
become tools to work with us."

Tim has said that the Web is first and foremost "defined"
by URIs. HTML is just another format. HTTP is just another
protocol.

From Web Characterization [2]:

  "In this context we use them to describe the information 
   space known as the Web."

So, in my mind, the Web is an information space. The
resources in this space are identified by URIs.
