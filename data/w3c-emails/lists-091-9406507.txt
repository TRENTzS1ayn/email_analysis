Now consider the following: the markup was illegal, so the
user agent has to do some repair. Is the Web content what
the UA received over the wire, or what the result of the
repair is?

In UAAG 1.0, we ended up saying: content is generally
what the user agent retrieves, but it may be subject to
repair. We are interested in the result, which is the
document object.
