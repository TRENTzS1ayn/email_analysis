Check out information on the Semantic Web home page [1]:

 "The Semantic Web is a vision: the idea of having data
  on the web defined and linked in a way that it can be 
  used by machines not just for display purposes, but 
  for automation, integration and reuse of data across 
  various applications."

I strongly recommend coordinating with the Semantic Web
Activity if you are trying to define this term.
