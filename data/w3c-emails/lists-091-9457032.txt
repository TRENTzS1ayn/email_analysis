Leonard Kasday

March 18, 1943 ? May 15, 2001

We sadly note the sudden and untimely passing of our colleague Dr. Leonard
Kasday, Universal Design Engineer at the Institute on Disabilities at Temple
University.  Dr. Kasday?s work on improving the accessibility of the world
wide web for all individuals with disabilities was well-known throughout the
country and even the world.  In Pennsylvania, Dr. Kasday was instrumental in
the development of standards and policies governing the accessibility of all
state websites.  His accessibility checker, the ?WAVE?
(www.temple.edu/inst_disabilities/piat/wave/) is one of a select number of
tools promoted by the government to assist web designers in improving
accessibility (www.section508.gov/acctools.html).

With deep appreciation for the extensive contributions that Dr. Kasday made
to web accessibility for people with disabilities and with profound
recognition of the need to continue the important work begun by him, the
Institute on Disabilities at Temple University will establish the Leonard
Kasday Student Assistantship.  This assistantship will be awarded to a
Temple University student who will work for one academic year at the
Institute on activities that promote accessibility of the World Wide Web.

Arrangements have been made for a memorial service on Thursday, May 24, 2001
at the Morris Arboretum in Philadelphia, PA.  (For directions, go to
www.upenn.edu/morris/drctns.htm).  Guests will be assembling beginning at
12:30 PM, and the memorial will be from 1:00 ? 4:00 PM.

In lieu of flowers, people may wish to make a donation to the charity of
their choice, in Dr. Kasday?s memory.

Dr. Kasday is survived by his wife, Dr. Linda C. Knight, in the Department
of Diagnostic Imaging, Division of Nuclear Medicine, at Temple University.
