1. Good to see the many entries in Section 6 Abbreviations/Acronyms.

Acronym is defined earlier, Abbreviation isn't.

All entries therein are ALL-CAPS. No abbr/acro differentiation appears
therein. Making that judgement is admittedly difficult.
None of the entries show any source for more detail. That is a significant
project, I expect.

2. Document Type Declaration, Document Type Definition (DTD) [XML 1.0 
(second edition), 6 October 2000,
http://www.w3.oreg/TR/REC-xml]

Definition:
The XML document type declaration contains or points to markup declarations
that provide a grammar for a class of documents. This grammar is known as a 
document type definition, or DTD. The document type declaration can point 
to an external subset (a special kind of external entity) containing markup
declarations, or can contain the markup declarations directly in an 
internal subset, or can do both. The DTD for a document consists of both 
subsets
taken together.
