BUT WHY HAVE AN 0870 NUMBER?

Five GREAT BENEFITS
 of having an 0870 number!

1.  With 0870 number you can operate in a larger area because your Business is not regionalized.
(It is a fact that when people are looking for a service they do not consider companies that are outside their telephone code area. With 0870 number you can be anywhere in the country and your customers wont know it!). 
How much business are you losing?

2. An 0870 number encourages serious customers to call!
When someone is seriously looking for a service or wanting to buy something specific they will contact every number that offers it. When a company uses a 0870 business number they are stating that they are a serious business worth calling. Time wasters are deterred and real customers increase!

3.  0870 numbers can make your company appear larger and more established! How? 
For example one 0870 number could be for technical support, another 0870 number for the complaints line, another 0870 number for sales and another 0870 number for enquires BUT all of these numbers can be directed to the same telephone!
4.  Use a 0870 number as your complaints line. It is a fact that people are more focused and less inclined to stay on the telephone a long time when they know they are paying to complain!

5.  Having an 0870 number deters time wasters and sales calls!
Many business waste hours per week in unproductive telephone calls! Time is money!

An 0870 number is an great asset to your business and 
from TeleLines UK it is FREE!
