There's a new type of bicycle that allows you to pedal with your arms as 
well as your legs.  There is no loss of stability or steering due to its 
unique and patented handlebar system.  It rides like a traditional bike, 
and you can augment your output using your upper body.  Great workout!

Take a look at http://www.Ultra-Bike.com for details.
