OK folks..............down to the brass tacks.................the first
definition we will start with is...................the envelope
please.....................


"Normative / Non-normative or Informative"

#1

From............User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0
31 July 2001...............at..........

http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/WD-UAAG10-20010731/glossary.html#n .........we
have................

Normative, informative:

As used in this document, the term "normative" refers to "that on which the
requirements of this document depend for their most precise statement." What
is normative is required for conformance (though the conformance scheme of
this document allows claimants to exempt certain normative provisions as
long as the claim discloses the exemption). What is identified as
"informative" (sometimes, "non-normative") is never required for
conformance.



#2

From..............Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0
W3C Working Draft 25 January 2001

http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-WCAG20-20010125/#glossary

Normative/Non-normative:

Throughout this document we refer to several "non-normative" examples. These
are included to help readers understand concepts. Normative items are
prescriptions for what must/should/may be done to create accessible content



#3

From Al G.............

The definition that I got from American Heritage dictionary care of Atomica
for
'normative' would work fine as the definition, with the added note that it
is
used to distinguish the scope of writing in the document that is considered
part if defining the precise requirement, as compared with heuristic
preliminaries and illustrative follow-up.



#4

From Whatis Glossary.....................

http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/0,,sid9_gci214069,00.html

normative:

In information technology standards, normative parts of a standard are those
that specify what implementers should conform to and non-normative parts
consist of examples, extended explanations, and other matter not dealing
directly with the specifications.
