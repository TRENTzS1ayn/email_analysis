1] is there a method for selecting my display font.
For example i have arialuni.ttf  that I can choose to use
 for viewing pages in Netscape.  Can I do the same in Amaya.

2] I found that my favorite editor destroys unicode stuff...
Is there a freeware editor for unicode that is available for Win98.
