This :

<html>
      <table border="1">
          <tr>
           <td>row1</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td rowspan="2">row2</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
              <td>row3</td>
          </tr>
      </table>
</html>

causes Amaya 4.2.1 to crash when the page is unloaded.

It seems that its freeing boxes which don't exist, but I've not been
able to work out a fix for it.  Is there an easy patch for it ??
