On a brief test of MathML capabilities I found that 

&div (alias of &divide)
&diamond (alias of &diam)
&approx (alias of &ap)
do not render in amaya .....   these aliases are on the
alphabetecal character listings at w3.org  

is it the intention of the Amaya group to NOT render 
aliases  or is it a matter of needing the time to do so!
or perhaps a few have been missed... if so i will try to
find the slips for you ....
