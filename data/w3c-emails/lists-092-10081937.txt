I am trying to use the mathml test suite as provided by w3.org

when i jump into the  characters -- a  page
it first presents some jpegs of how those characters are supposed 
to appear --- so far so good

but then instead of doing rendering for test purposes it just displays
 mathml tags as source.   am i missing something here.  
where is the rendering for visual examination of rendering???
