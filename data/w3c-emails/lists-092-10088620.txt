Ah for pete's sake .....
looking at the source of each section
they do a snapshot in jpeg --- no mention of what 
    system generated the fonts in picture though
and then they put <pre> tags around the mathml
so that rendering is disabled .... 
To use as a test document one must get a local copy 
then remove the <pre>  
-- too bad it wasn't white-space:pre which doesnt work in amaya
  this would have allowed on-line  testing ;-]  ;-]  ;-]  
Maybe someone with close ties to testsuite group 
would advise them on how to make the suite into 
something more useful....   and maybe a staement
on what system was used to generate characters displayed 
in the jpegs  ---
