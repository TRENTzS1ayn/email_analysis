Hmm.

I just recompiled it on my Linux system, and the problem is definately
there.  Then I tried it on solaris 2.6, and the fault is not
apparent. 

So it looks like it's something particular to my version of linux:

Linux dugite 2.2.10 #1 SMP Tue Aug 10 19:01:45 MDT 1999 i686 unknown
gcc 2.95.2
GNU Make version 3.79.1
amaya - V4.2.1  22 December 2000

    I tested this table on each available platforms solaris, linux, win95/98/nt
    and all worked fine.
