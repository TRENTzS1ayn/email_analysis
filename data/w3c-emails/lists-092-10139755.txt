often i judge on what is done rather than 
what is said.

the w3.org group uses frames !! to see this in
action look at the mathml section and the 
testsuite. 

since mathml is relatively recent, any use of
frames by w3.org to pressent info on it must
also be recent.  and it is a slight handicap to
 testing Amaya browser  until one writes a shortcut
into the REAL page ...  

so  GO FIGURE on the deprecate concept for frames.
