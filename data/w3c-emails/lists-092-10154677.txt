using Amaya on windows 98 -- binary version
started playing with edit features to see if i 
would use as prime editor....

Problem #1] Defaults to no edit. that is good from my POV
 but i have to pull the menu and click on Edit Mode  TWICE
 to get the checkmark to appear ... at first i thought i had goofed
but it is consistent!! -- definite bug

Problem #2] If at start of line SHFT-END should hilite the line
  for delete/copy/paste.  Similarly if at end of line SHFT-HOME
  should hilite the line for cut/copy/paste.  This is the normal 
  action of shift-home and shift-end in windows.  The cursor moves
  but doesnt hilite -- definite bug

Problem #3] If I pull up a friend's page and want to try some edits
 to see what is causing a shifted table problem, i can do the edit
 to the source view but when i try to save it locally, the SAVE AS
 function is greyed out and SAVE wants to save under original name
  which i dont have write access to.  A workaround is to first download
  his document as a local copy and work on it.  However I would 
 prefer to browse / edit / view  until i find the glitch and then either
 tell him what it is or report another display area to Amaya.  Briefly
why does the source view not allow save as operation....
