In windows if one hilites using shft and arrows

if one is at start of line x  and one does shft-down arrow
all of line x including the line terminator is hilited for a cut/copy

but in Amaya the same procedure also includes the first character
of the next line requiring a back up of one character to delete the line
  i view this as a bug as it is radically different than other windows 
editors.    and in conjunction with the shift-end bug  makes line deletion
a major pain ...... 

and further on double pull to toggle to editor-on    once it is
swiched on a single toggle will switch off and a single will 
switch back on  --- it is only the initial toggle that has to be done twice 
to stick......
