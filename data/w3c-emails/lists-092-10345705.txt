Steve,

I suggest you move this discussion to a more appropriate
forum.  If you want to suggest changes in the name space
specification, send your proposal to xml-dev@xml.org

But I am still curious about your proposal and I am not sure
I understand it. The sample html document at the end of your
message is consistent with the current namespace specification.
How would you write it in the syntax you propose?

Vincent.
