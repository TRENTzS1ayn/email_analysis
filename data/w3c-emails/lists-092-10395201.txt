Along with most of the old problems, I am now seeing another
table problem.  Miscalculation of width when no spec given.

A good example (using win98 version and 800x600 window)
is to pull up the Configure help page and look at the table
for Amaya Home Directory.  First line of right column
should not wrap but entire table width adjust and center justify
 again.   but wrap it does on win98  screen at least.

And also I mention the unclosed corners that need tees instead
of corner elements -- looks all broken to these eyes.
