2] The above was printed from the show parse errors view and 
redirected to a file nicely as well as printing.  However both
times (printer/file) at completion of the job, the browser was 
shut down and i landed at my desktop (win98).  I have never 
tried a print from any other window so dont know if this error
is peculiar to trying to print from parse errors window.  It should
just return to calling level of program.  ie still in show parse errors.
or even at basic browser .... but not exit to desktop.....
