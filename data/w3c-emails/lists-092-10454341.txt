Sorry if we didn't satisfy your all requests. I guess you forgot 
that we have a limited manpower and several different missions.

It's annoying to have to wait for a long time in this case, but we're not
ready to spend many efforts on that. Any external contribution is welcome
here.

I'm not sure it's so simple, but this should be considered.

These tables are well displayed

I see not indication in the HTML 4.0 recommendation that says that
it's incorrect.

I don't see what is wrong in Amaya.

We don't plan to add complex algorithms here. The table formatter is enough
slow today.

This is in the todo list.

>     See Amaya Configuration help document -- Amaya Home Directory

What is wrong?

This is in the todo list.

I'm not sure it's still true.

It would be better to do that but that takes time.

People asked the full list of what CSS rules Amaya doesn't support.
It would be helpful for us if you can provide that list.
We try to progress in each release, but it's a long long way.

> Editor Problems
> E1] If one starts with edit mode off, it takes two toggles to switch
>     edit mode on.  Thereafter the editor mode toggle functions correctly.

I did you start with edit mode off?

> E2] Shft-End and Shft-Home do not highlight text for cut/copy operation.

Word selection was added, but not Shft-End and Shft-Home.

> E3] Shift-DownArrow includes first character of next line in highlight
>     when it should not do so.

It's considered as an extension to that last character, so the last character
in included.

> User Interface Problems
> U1] The move one page up/down scroll selection may not be adapting
>     to screen size.  This is most noticable in the Show Source
>     window.  For 800x600 main window, this results in jumps that do

>     more extreme, for 640x480 main window, lines are skipped entirely
>     when paging action selected.  Algorithm must take into account

No idea of what is the problem.

> U2] After scrolling to bottom of document, scrolling up to top
>     overscrolls on many documents using an image watermark background.
>     And scrolling down overscrolls on some documents using an image
>     watermark background.

That occurs sometimes.

> U3] The scroll bars can't be pulled to the very bottom or right edge.
>     No information is lost but this is untidy.

We keep a space at the bottom of pages.

> Printing Difficulties
> P1] Amaya deadlocks during printing when document contains
>     the following style attribute:
>     <h2 style="page-break-before: always;">The Title</h2>
>     If the style attribute is removed, printing works ok.

I tested on a document and it worked well. It should occur in
specific cases.

> Keyboard Shortcuts
> K1] Standard shortcut nomenclature should be used in menus.
>     For example Alt + P  instead of Alt p    and
>     Ctrl + Enter  instead of Ctrl Return. 
>     NOTE: I can't find Return key on a standard keyboard ;-]

No because Amaya needs a lot of shortcuts and so interprets differently
Alt P and Alt p. Amaya also accepts sequences of two shortcuts. It's not 
because Windows applications are limited that we should maintain the
limitation.

> Compose Function
> C1] Creating a soft hyphen adds a &173; to the document which
>     will not pass some validators.  Should use &shy; instead.

Amaya doesn't generate a &173;

> Address Dialog
> A1] Currently  www.w3.org  will not get a page from the web
>     (needs http:) but \temp\foobar.htm will get one from local drive.
>     Either the default mode should be switched around so that
>     http: is assumed (to coincide with other browsers) or that
>     the service MUST BE declared (which is Amaya like solution).

This is in the todo list but with a low priority.
