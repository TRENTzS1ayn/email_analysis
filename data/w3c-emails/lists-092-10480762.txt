Hi,

In Amaya, with text inside a table that is in turn inside a form, applying a font style (for example, font-size: 6pt) to the form affects that text. In IE 5, Navigator 4.x, or Mozilla 0.8, the text is not affected. I read somewhere that the font CSS property is inherited by all descendants. Is Amaya correct about this? If not, what source file should I check to see the relevant code?

Thanks,
An
