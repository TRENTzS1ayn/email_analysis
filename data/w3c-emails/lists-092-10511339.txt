As a test on my own site i called up

http://www.cgocable.net/~jrussel/mathml.htm

and noted using file/document info that the filename was clipped
and then entered 

http://www.cgocable.net/~jrussel/

which takes me to my home page which is a frames one
 (correctly displayed) but file/document  showed
 the name as http://www.cgocable.net/~jrussel/mathml.htm
that is it didn't update the name when an aliasing occured.
I would call that a bug -- not a critical one -- but it reveals 
an area to be worked on 
  doc info routine when 
1] redirect or aliasing occurs
2] long doc names clip or not, which end, ellipses if clipped
