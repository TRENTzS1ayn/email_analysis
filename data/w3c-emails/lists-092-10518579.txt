The Amaya group has placed a high prioriy on Internationalization
issues which is very commendable.  However the help docs are
not too helpful in this area. Perhaps a new help doc could be
prepared for next release that brings together data on currently
implemented languages for:
1] Dialogues [en, fr, de -- from Config help]
2] Help files [en, fr  -- from examination of help directory]
3] Dictionaries [en, fr -- from Config help]
4] Language negotiation [en, fr, jp -- from Config help]
5] Character sets one can use when editting with Amaya  ???
6] Character sets one can use when viewing with Amaya  ???

Currently different dialog boxes are used for dialogs and negotiations
Perhaps consolodating all language settings into a single dialog
box can aid in organization.  Also, while the selectable choices are 
limited, it may be of help to either add prompt suggestions or
scrollable selections (the prefered Windows way for selection from
a known group).
