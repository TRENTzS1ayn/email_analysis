Hello John,

That menu should show you the complete URL in the "Location" field.
Under Windows, if the name is too long, you can click on the value of that 
field and scroll. 

It's not the best UI interface, though. Do you think that adding
a scroll bar could make it easier to understand?

Under Unix, the popup window dynamically changes size, so you can see
the whole URL (although you may end with a big long window).

In which dialog box? Many do clip adding the "...". For example, the
document status bar (bottom of the screen) shows the beginning of the URL,
then "...", then the end of the URL.
