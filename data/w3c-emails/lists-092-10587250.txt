The development team did a very nice job at adding access keys
for the menu and aiding editing via keypad only....

However one spot is still annoying or an 'agro' for some users.
There should be a set of keys for shifting a window up/down
a line at a time.  There is pgup for screen at a time and ctrl pgup
for top of screen.   At times the up/down arrow do this function
well. but at other times it fails and produces an interesting 
scroll as it moves one line, redisplays and repeats until hitting
the end of document.  I notice that this occurs only if focus has
yet to be set on that document. Perhaps the fix is to make sure
the focus is set on the start of the CURRENT document as it
is accessed.

So what i thought was a shortcut key thing may really be 
an initialization of a routine thing.
