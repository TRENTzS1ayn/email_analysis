I have only just discovered Amaya and have just tried to use it to 
open an XML document - but all that happened when I selected the 
document was a yellow (blank) screen.  I could see the original file 
by selecting 'source' - but there was no indication as to how I could 
specify the CSS stylesheet that I was trying to use.  I made a link 
to the one I created by clicking in the browser window and 
selecting the right one - but that didn't change anything and I still 
couldn't see my document!  What am I doing wrong?!  My XML 
document is perfectly formed, so that's not the problem!
