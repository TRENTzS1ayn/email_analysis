We decided to work with 8 bits characters (iso-latin or UTF 8) outside the 
Thot API and to handle only document text buffers as wide characters.
This implies to change the current Amaya code.
For all Amaya modules and Annotation modules we have to:
Remove all Text()Removing all "C_"
Replace "UCHAR_T" by "unsigned char"
Replace "CHAR_T" by "char"
Replace "USTRING" by "unsigned char *" (pay attention to declarations USTRING  
 x, y; -> unsigned char *x, *y;)
Replace "STRING" by "char *" (pay attention to declarations STRING   x, y; -> 
char *x, *y;)
Replace all "ustr..." by "str..."
Replace "usprintf" by "sprintf"
Replace "ufopen" by "fopen"
Replace "TtaAllocString" by "TtaGetMemory"
Replace "wc2iso-strcpy" by "strcpy" (check if the copy is necessary or not)
Replace "wc2iso-strcmp" by "strcmp"
Replace "TtaWCSdup" by "TtaStrdup"
