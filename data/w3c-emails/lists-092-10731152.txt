the most important fixes to the document are
lines 54 and 55 have a height="100%" attribute.
Neither table or tr  tags have this as a permitted attribute!
delete them and your table will display ok in amaya.
However there are several other errors such as missing
quotes arround an attribute value in line 26 and missing 
semicolons on character entities in lines 57 and 75....
validator.w3.org   will show others as well  
but clearing height attribute is sufficient to get good display of table.
