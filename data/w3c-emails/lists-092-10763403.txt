Report on Amaya 4.3 when tested against the 
W3.org test suite at http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/test/

Fails test 1.1
@ This sentence is black. If it is red then...

Fails test 1.4
@ This sentence should be black, not red-- class selectors cannot begin with digits in CSS1.

Fails test 1.5
@ This sentence should be black, not red-- ID selectors cannot begin with digits in CSS1.

Fails test 1.6
@ Hello.  The first "hello" should be green, but this part should be black

Fails test 2.1
@ Purple unvisited, lime (light green) visited, maroon (dark red) while active (being clicked)
visited links are not indicated as such -- probably lack of a history stack!!

Fails test 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6
total failure on first line, first letter, pseudo elements

Fails test 3.1 (!important)

Fails test 3.2
@ This list item should be blue......
  and so should this; neither should be purple.
both lines show as grey

Fails test 4.1.4 floating elements

Fails test 4.2 no right border in red

Fails test 4.3 square doesn't align to center

Fails test 4.4 line heights

Fails test 4.5 canvas colors

Fails test 5.2.2 cursive and fantasy fonts are not provided

I discontinued at this point as there is more than enough work here
for someone to work on css1 for a long time.

Also my diagnostic page at
http://www.cgocable.net/~jrussel/am_dsply.htm 
leads off with 5 CSS1 issues.  Hopefully many of these
can be cleared in next version as CSS support is 
becoming more important in Web design.

I think that the w3.org test suite should be used 
more often by the Amaya team to benchmark progress
towards completion of some of the older specifications
such as CSS1 and HTML4.

The major issue IMHO is cascading.  Author settings
should override user settings unless the !important
flag is used. Currently this is not happening for
the background-color component which leads to other
problems such as display of www.w3.org with background
setting of anything other than white...
