Great!

> About Me
> ========
> Just a minute!  Before telling about me, you must accept my heart felt thanks for spending your valuable time to read this document. My Name is Joy from Indian subcontinent. I am a graduate in computer science.  And I am really impressed by the new technology XML and willing to work hard and provide a solution for non-profit organizations. I also have group of my friends who are willing to contribute.  We just have described the problem in the following section.
> 
> Vision Statement
> ================
> Building a solution for public sectors to publish documents and conduct exams without any hassles in using special symbols (for example, symbols in Mathematics) by utilizing the XML standards based languages like Query Markup Language (QML), and MathML (Math Markup Language).  
> 
> Solution Framework
> ==================
> The major entities are:
> 1. Equations Editor: Software used to key the equations. (Amaya)
> 2. Interpreter: Integrated with Editor. It converts the document to XML Standards based languages such as MathML and QML.
> 3. DB: Stores the questions in MathML & QML.
> 4. Web Browser: View the HTML document
> 
> Step 1
> ~~~~~~
> The questions are entered through the equation editor e.g. Amaya.  We must provide an interface in such a way the question is converted to MathML. It must be stored in database server as MathML & QML.  QML?s plays vital role in representing the question format. And the question is coded in MathML. The editor must be able generate MathML code and QML Code.  After that it must be sent to the database server. Can I use Amaya and the features what I specified above?

Today Amaya supports the presentation markup of MathML but not QML.

> 
> Step 2
> ~~~~~~
> The stored questions will be extracted from Database server and displayed in the web browser (Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator).
> 
> We have planned to used Amaya as the equations editor.  Since it generates MathML.  And I need clarification for the following:
> 
> 1. Is there any development team working on the same area?

iMath develops a Math editor based on Amaya (see http://www.imath.org)

> 2. Where can I get the architecture of Amaya?

You can get online documentation from http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Overview.htm
l

> 3. Can I join with Amaya experts and get help from them?

This is the role of the mailing list www-amaya-dev@w3.org

> 4. What is your opinion about this project?

I didn't see the interest of QML

> 5. How do I display the questions that are of QML and MathML format in the Web Browser?  Do I need any plugin to be developed or is there any existing plugin?

There is no support og plugins in Amaya. We use namespaces to mix XHTML, SVG 
and MathML in the same document.

> 6. Kindly suggest web sites, which are relevant for this project.

See above.

> 7. How long will it take to finish? 

It's difficult for me to answer.

> My Status:
> ~~~~~~~~~~
> I have the source code of Amaya windows version. And I am using Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 and its very familiar one for me.  Now I have compiled and got the executable file of Amaya. Now planning to understand the Amaya Architecture.

> If you find the problem is not clear, let us know.  So that, we can present it in different way.
