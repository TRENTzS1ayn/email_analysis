Fixed.

> @ This sentence should be black, not red-- ID selectors cannot begin with digits in CSS1.

Fixed.

Fixed.

> Fails test 2.1
> @ Purple unvisited, lime (light green) visited, maroon (dark red) while active (being clicked)
> visited links are not indicated as such -- probably lack of a history stack!!
