Hi all!

I have been using the amaya editor with GTK support to edit all my pages 
and I noted some small problems (see notes.html in attach).
Despite of those small problems, this "version" of Amaya is OK and 
stable. For those who have problems with Motif environment, this version 
could be a solution (I don't know if there is a GTK implementation for 
Mac)...

I hope those notes may help Amaya to became better and better...

Thanks (and sorry about the late in this feedback)!

Manuele
