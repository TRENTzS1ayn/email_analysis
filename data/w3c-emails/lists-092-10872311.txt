I downloaded Amaya 5.2 GTK and was checking it out, and quickly noticed 
that the scroll bars behave very strangely. (Well, the vertical scroll bar 
anyway, I didn't use the horizontal scrollbar - all the pages were only 
the width of the window.)

In some documents, clicking below the vertical slider moved down one 
section, in others it did nothing at all. Default behavior in other 
applications is that this should either take me down the height of a 
window (same as the PageDown key does) or in some environments it  centers 
the slider on a location corresponding to where I clicked. (That is, 
clicking in the middle of the scrollbar moves to the middle of the page, 
clicking at the bottom of the scrollbar moves to the bottom of the page.) 
The "down one widow" seems to be the more common option.

Likewise, clicking above the slider usually means "up one window", in 
Amaya GTK it seems to mean "go to the top of the window".

My system here is Mandrake 8.1, running KDE if that has any impact.

(Also a table on www.linux-mandrake.com/en was displayed very strangely, 
but that might be their fault. At the top of the table was an image, the 
text in the next line of the table and below started to the right of the 
image and was unreadable as it was covered by the next column. Other 
browsers, like Opera or Mozilla, display the text in a readable fashion.)

Other than that, it seems like a good enough product.
