If a New XHTML document is created by using the option
in File > New > New XHTML document and one selects an
existing HTML document in the Browse dialog box, no
warning is given.  In fact, I would expect no saving
style dialog box until I save or it is necessary to
have a definite location for the file.  This probably
applies to New CSS, SVG, and MML.
