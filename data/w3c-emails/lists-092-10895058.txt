Hi,

  I've just started trying to tinker around with
Amaya's source code. I'm having a compiling problem
(actually it's a linking error). Apparently, it cant
find the zlib.lib file. I've followed the steps
provided by Amaya's site for Windows compiling. I'm
using MSVC++6.0. Is there anything that i missed?
THanks!!

regards,
Alan
