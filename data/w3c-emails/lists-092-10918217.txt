Try the following procedure :

Open the Amaya workspace,
Look in the project tree, you should see zlib at the end, try to set it as the 'Active Project',
Then build it, and finally build Amaya, after resetting it as the 'Active Project'.

Otherwise, if nothing more happens, the Hard Way :

You could to launch a Dos Box (run command fo win9x or cmd fo winNT/2000/XP),
Then move to the zlib directory in the Amaya source,
and launch the following command
nmake32 zlib.mak
And then build Amaya directly with the Msvc GUI.
