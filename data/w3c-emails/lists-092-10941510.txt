Hi all!

I updated my Amaya to the version 5.2 (cvs update) now I found a problem 
that may be a bug. :(
Almost everytime that I try to use the "save as" option in "File" menu 
to save a document in a remote server, Amaya crashes with "Amaya 
Irrecoverable" error message. It usually crashes after the 
authentication window, but it saves the document in the server almost 
always... Somebody also found this bug or it's just me?


My environment :
Red Hat Linux 7.1
gcc version 2.96 20000731
glibc version 2.2.4, release 18.7.0 (rpm)
make version 3.79.1 release 5 (rpm)
autoconf version 2.13 release 9 (rpm)
automake version 1.4 release 8 (rpm)
libwww version 5.3.1 - sources downloaded from cvs database

I have the outputs form "configure" and from "make all", if somebody 
wants to get a look on this...

Ah! I received the following error messagens in my console when the 
problem had been produced...

Gtk-WARNING **: gtk_signal_disconnect_by_func(): could not find handler 
(0x81FEC80) containing data (0x888D774)

Gtk-WARNING **: invalid cast from `(unknown)' to `GtkWidget'

Gtk-CRITICAL **: file gtkwidget.c: line 1385 (gtk_widget_destroy): 
assertion `GTK_IS_WIDGET (widget)' failed.

Thanks a lot!
