I've come up with two related fixes for the expat parser, following your
suggestion, Irene, to trace the function EndOfAttributeValue () in the 
module Amaya/amaya/Xml2thot.c. One issue appears to be a bug in expat, 
so I'll present it first. The symptom is that multiple spaces are 
incorrectly preserved in attribute values. 
 
This line of code is clearly intended to suppress multiple spaces, in 
libwww\modules\expat\xmlparse\xmlparse.c line 2815, in function 
appendAttributeValue(). The logic gets short-circuited as currently 
written: 
 
if (!isCdata && (poolLength(pool) == 0 || poolLastChar(pool) == 0x20)) 
 
The second test above is skipped due to the expansion of the poolLength() 
and poolLastChar() preprocessor #defines. So two additional sets of 
parenteses are needed, as follows: 
 
if ((!isCdata && (poolLength(pool) == 0) || (poolLastChar(pool) == 0x20))) 
  
By adding the parenteses, multiple spaces are suppressed, as intended, when
parsing the following sample input: 
 
  <meta name="description" content="Software design &amp; 
   consulting for workstations, servers, &amp; embedded firmware. 
   Systems programming, quality-crafted applications and 
   enhancements for Internet, Linux, Windows." /> 
 
If you would please test and verify this fix, then I'll post the related 
fix for preserving linefeeds. Thank you. 
 
Regards, 
Marc
