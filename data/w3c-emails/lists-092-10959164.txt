Hi,

  I've noticed that there's a problem with Amaya in
regards to links on a page. Whenever i tried to click
on a link, it wont load the page linked. It onli loads
when i right-click on the link and it'll load but on a
new window.  THanks.

Regards
ALan

p.s. the reason why i post in the amaya-dev mailing
list is becoz i feel this is more of a development
problem than user problem.
