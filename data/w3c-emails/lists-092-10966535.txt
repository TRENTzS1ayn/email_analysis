Hello Alan,

in fact in Amaya you need to double-click to follow a link. This is because
Amaya is an editor, and it needs to be possible to select a point in the text
of a link to edit it.

This has been discussed in the www-amaya list - the default for browser mode
is being changed to only require a single click, but normally Amaya starts in
editor mode. You can change it from teh edit menu, or from the browser/editor
mode button on the toolbar.

Cheers

Charles McCN

  Hi,

    I've noticed that there's a problem with Amaya in
  regards to links on a page. Whenever i tried to click
  on a link, it wont load the page linked. It onli loads
  when i right-click on the link and it'll load but on a
  new window.  THanks.

  Regards
  ALan

  p.s. the reason why i post in the amaya-dev mailing
  list is becoz i feel this is more of a development
  problem than user problem.
