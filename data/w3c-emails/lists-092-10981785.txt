Hello Alan,

What you're looking for is in in the libwww directory:

Library/src/HTReqMan.h

I suggest you send libwww related questions (everything under that
directory or the calls that start with HT...) to the libwww mailing list:

www-lib@w3.org

Could you tell us what kind of tinkering are you doing with Amaya, just
for curiosity's sake? :)

Thanks,

-jose
