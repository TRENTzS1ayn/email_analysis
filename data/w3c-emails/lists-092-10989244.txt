Hi!

  THanks for the answer.... it seems odd but somehow
or rather, each after i post a question, i'll seem to
find the answer after that but i really appreciate you
guys answering them:)

  The purpose why i ask so many libwww questions is
simply becoz i'm trying to implement CC/PP Exchange
protocol in Amaya. Currently, it's the best custom
browser available for me to tinker with its request
headers. Any pointers. So far, i havent succeeded yet.
Seems that after i added the extra CC/PP info into the
request header, each time i key in a URL in Amaya and
enter, Amaya will just close by itself. Guess there's
still some bug i havent figured out.

regards,
Alan

p.s Thanks again, Jose!
