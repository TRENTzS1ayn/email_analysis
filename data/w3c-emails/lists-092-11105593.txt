Amaya 5.2 still discards line breaks in META tag content, so this update 
was apparently missed in the October release. 
 
Would it be possible for me to help implement this change? I can now 
build Amaya from CVS, since aiding with debug of "wrong color in images". 
 
I'd appreciate any information about where the changes should be made 
in the source code. 
 
Thanks, 
Marc

It's not too late to be implemented for the October release.
