As a fast check of whether the help doc was keeping
pace with the features changes in Amaya 5.2
1] the screen shot for general preferences does not
agree with the window that Windows 98 viewers see.

2] The dreaded Ahat has snuck into this document as well

3] Most topics are separated by <p></p> which i think
  is bad practice. The one on ftp however has a < /br>.
  which displays differently (ie blank line is absorbed in
  rendering.  Both types of coding should be removed and
  the spacing done consistently using CSS methods.

If the powers that be wish, i can take a stab at redoing the
 page for consistency...
