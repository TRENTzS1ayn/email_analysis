The method Amaya uses for maintaining conformant code makes
it impossible to hold on to designers pretty formatting.  This may
be why meta tags lose their linefeeds. May I suggest that at least
linewrapping after a set number of characters be done as it is for 
the rest of the document. This will allow keywords and description
tags to be readable and not make document 500 characters plus wide ;-] ;-]

In addition the entire line breaking mechanism should be studied.
Right now if one inspects the amaya generated codes, one finds
that the th tag  will wrap after the first word always EVEN IF THE
LINE is short enough to be a one liner.
Also the /li tag tends to pull a word to the next line as an orphan.
And anchor elements are broken in a most unreadable way 
isolating the <a part from the rest.  A better break spot is after 
the closing > before the text/img string.

There is also no user configurable setting for line length.

I would rather maintain my own code in a READABLE form
which was the original intention of HTML. But some attention
to formatting of source may be a nice project for someone.
If there are set rules or at least a common philosophy of how
code should be prettied, i would like to know as it would be
a nice project as a side utility....  file conversion projects
are my forte so if someone has ideas on what 'prettyprint'
means in html  please let me know....   all i see are 
'dirtyprint' examples except for my own of course ;-] ;-]
