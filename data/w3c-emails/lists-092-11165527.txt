Amaya 5.2
Windows 98SE English

Installation:
1.  Company field is required although I am not a
company.

2.  Shortcut is lowercase, uppercase is expected.

User Interface:
1.  Document background color is set to white but
appears yellow.

(X)HTML
1.  If &middot; entity is used in XHTML written in
iso-8859-1 encoding, it appears as the A-hat followed
by a middle dot.  This problem occurs when encoded as
Unicode and not supported in reader, but this is not
encoded with Unicode.
