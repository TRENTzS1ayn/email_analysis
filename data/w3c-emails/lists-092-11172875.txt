Here are bugs in Amaya 5.2a on a Windows 98SE English
system:

Installation:
1.  Installation never quits although visibly it does.

User Interface:
1.  If Window Geometry is saved in maximized state, it
will not later load in a maximized state.
2.  Structure view does not scroll or wrap as user
types content longer than view.
3.  Content is blurred while scrolling document.
4.  There should be an option to set Amaya as the
default browser and/or HTML editor.  It should also be
able to associate with *.css, *.mml, *.svg, etc.

(X)HTML
1.  If link is made by selecting a window, charset,
hreflang, and type attribute values should be detected
and included.

Accessibility
1.  Links should require title attributed upon initial
creation.  Advisories should be given if already created.
