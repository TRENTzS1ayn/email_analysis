Hello,

The problem is that Amaya supports only few fonts anf these fonts haven't the 
glyphs that corresond to the entities you mention.
We are currently working on a unicode version of Amaya that will support more 
fonts (so, much entities). We hope to release a first unicode version for the 
end of October.

Cordially
