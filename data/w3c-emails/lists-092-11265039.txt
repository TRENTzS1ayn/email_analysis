The cascade order is (winners first):

1.user specified !important
2.author specified !important
3.author specified
4.user specified
5.user agent default

But I believe that the !important is not implemented in Amaya at the moment.
This is a known accessibility bug (unless it has been fixed already), and is
also an SVG bug (it is required for SVG).

cheers
