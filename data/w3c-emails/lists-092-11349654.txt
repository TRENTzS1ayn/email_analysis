Not sure if this is the right place for Amaya bugs?   The Amaya help menu doesn't tell me where to go.

Using Amaya from CVS today..


I have an html page with inline SVG at:

http://www.graphviz.org/cgi-bin/webdot/webdot/svginline.html


The bug is that just under the diagram there is a line with "]>" on it.
I'm not sure if this is my bug, or Amaya's, but I'm hoping that someone
here can tell me?

The characters come from the end of the preamble to the inline SVG in the middle of the html:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
<!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.0//EN"
  "http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-SVG-20010904/DTD/svg10.dtd" [
  <!ATTLIST svg xmlns:xlink CDATA #FIXED "http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
]>

Shouldn't this entire <!DOCTYPE....> block be ignored for layout?
