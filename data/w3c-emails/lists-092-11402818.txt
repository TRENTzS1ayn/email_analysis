It's used to parse the document and to parse expressions
generated by transform commands.
Edits on the screen work directly with the document tree
(DOM tree) and doesn't use the parser.

The parser genetates a document tree (DOM tree) and
the thotlib generates the presentation (plus symbol)
according to the document tree. It uses S and P schemas
to associate that presentation.

It uses either a symbol font or draw lines (see the function
DisplaySymbol in Amaya/thotlib/view/displaybox.c)

It's a construction so it displays several boxes (one
for the symbol, one for the index).

There are no such functions 'processor', "initprocessor", "doprocessor"
within the Amaya code.
