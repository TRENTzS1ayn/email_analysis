   |Nobody is working on that at present. You could try to do that and
   |I'll help if you need.

Thanks,  I will continue my efforts.  
I have done some improvements on that code and I will ask you 
if my modifications are correct or not after some more hacks.

   |I don't think so: There is 2 chains: BxNexChild that links boxes
   |attached to an element and BxNext and BxPrvious that link
   |displayed boxes.  The box of the root element (pMainBox) is
   |special: BxPrevious points to the last displayed box BxNext points
   |to the first displayed box

I'm sorry for my poor understanding. At a glance, I was confused with
the 10th argument(pMainBox) for that function; its BxNext and BxPrvious point
to same box.  Ok, I understand that is from the specification.

   |The idea is to split the current box with the wrong script and
   |insert a new box with the right script. The problem is to update
   |all current parameters.  Of course the function SplitForScript
   |should be used.

Yes, I think so. It seems parameters are not updated correctly.
In other problem, when Unicode character is inserted at the head of Latin text,
it seems a redundant box has been allocated.

PS. Should I stop to post this issue to www-amaya-dev and
    write you(Irene Vatton) direcly?  
    All most members on this list may not interested in the I18N support.


Happy Holiday!
