Hi,

I've done an amaya 5.3 package for Mac OS X (using fink). If people
could check it works and report success to the fink project it will be
moved to the 'stable' branch. Details follow:

Amaya 5.3 (and 5.3 with gtk) is now available for Mac OS X via fink
(<http://fink.soureforge.net>). It can be found in the CVS checked-out
packages under unstable. See the fink FAQ for for details on how to
update the packages via CVS, and how to use packages from unstable.

Changes necessary for this package:

Mofif/Lesstif : 

configure patched to replace references to /sw/Lesstif with <base>/lib
and <base>/include - fixing a problem when Lesstif has been moved out
of <base>/Lesstif (in new Lesstif packages) and also when /sw is not
the base installation directory (rare, but possible).

- -force_flat_namespace added to Options.in. Fixes dynamic linking on
Mac OS X 10.1.

Gtk : 

added -I<base>/include to Options.in (couldn't find imlib).

Both :

Changed refs in configure to 'appkit' to 'apppkit' to prevent
it finding Cocoa appkit.

Changed amaya/Makefile.libwww to link against the amaya-supplied
libwww. This fixes a build failure if the libwww fink package was
installed (ironically).
