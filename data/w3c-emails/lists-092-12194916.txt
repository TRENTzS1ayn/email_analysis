A file I created with Amaya 5.3 was shown as invalid by the online HTML
valuator.  It said:

Line 184, column 50:
  ... e of the Boy Scouts of America in Indianapolis.  [?].
                                                        ^
Error: illegal character number 133

I have attached the file that this occurred in.
