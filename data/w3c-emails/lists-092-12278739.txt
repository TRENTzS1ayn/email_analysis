Currently, when the Shift key is held and arrow keys are used, it highlights
that text.  When the End key is pressed without the Shift key, it goes to
the end of the line.  I would like these two functions to be combined so
that I can hold Shift and press End or Home and it will highlight from the
current insertion point to the end or beginning of the line respectively.
Currently, this function is either broken or not implemented.  It scrolls to
the end of the document without highlighting anything when Shift and End are
held.
