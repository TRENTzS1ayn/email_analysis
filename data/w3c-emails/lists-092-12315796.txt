I am not sure if this is already implemented, but I think a plugin style
system would help in Amaya or any new Amaya-type project.  You could provide
a core and individuals could add plugins for what they need.  This would
result in smaller download sizes.  You don't download HTML 3.2 functionality
if you don't need it.  It would also be easier to maintain as you would only
need to download the part that has been changed.  I am sure this probably
will never happen, but it is a suggestion nonetheless.
