The XmlThot.xml file appears to have a invalid header.  The version header
is:
<?xml version="1" encoding="ISO-8859-1" standalone="yes"?>
I opened this file and since IE validates XML file types, it said for the
"1" version number, "Invalid version number.  Error processing resource
[...] Line 1, Position 16.

If I understand XML's specification correctly, the version number should be
"1.0" not "1".  I am new to the CVS thing, so correct me if this is not an
error.  I am just looking at what is in the CVS base currently.  I haven't
tried compiling anything.
