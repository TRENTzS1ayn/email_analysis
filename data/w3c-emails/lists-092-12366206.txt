I wish to use the Mingw compiler.  Does anybody know the syntax to use for
the make command or what needs done to compile with Mingw.  I have the 1.1
package.  From the site, it says I might need to modify the make files for
other compilers, but I don't know what needs changed.  I am a newbie to
actually compiling Amaya.  If this post is more appropriate in the regular
Amaya group, please let me know.  Thanks for any help.
