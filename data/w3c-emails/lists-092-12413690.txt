Hello Brant

This bug seems to be very odd.
I can reproduce it, but :
   - only on a Windows platform,
   - only with your document,
   - only the first time I load your document. Once the document has been 
saved with Amaya, the following loadings don't generate extra spaces any more.
In fact the first time I load your document on a Windows platform, the 
application receive a buffer from the XML parser that contains twice as much 
CR/LF characters than on a UNIX platform.
Before to continue, I would like to know if the attached HTM file has been 
saved with Amaya or with another editor ?
