Amaya Version:
Amaya 5.3 binary for Win NT/2000

System:
Windows XP
AMD Athlon XP 1700+
512 MB RAM
60 GB HD

Description:
In source view, if there are line breaks, the position of the cursor and the
indicated line in source view do not match.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Amaya.
2. Open a document.
3. Open source view.
4. Find somewhere where the source is similar to the following:
 <p>something here
continues here</p>
5. In the graphical view, click between "continues" and "here".
6. Look at the source view, it would look like:
> <p>something here
   continues here</p>
I think it should be
  <p>something here
> continues here</p>
