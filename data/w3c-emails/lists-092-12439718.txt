Amaya Version:
Amaya 5.3 binary for Win NT/2000

System:
Windows XP
AMD Athlon XP 1700+
512 MB RAM
60 GB HD

Description:
When a <p> element is highlighted and text is typed, the text is typed
before the element rather than overwriting the element (in this case the
expected behavior would be to create a new <p> element in place of the old
with the typed text).

To Reproduce:
1. Open Amaya.
2. Open the attached file (default.htm, 3.37 KB) (pictures and style sheet
will be broken, but this should make no difference).
3. Click between the words "Spring" and "Fellowship" in the <p> element
under "Saturday, June 8".
4. Press F2.
5. Type "C".

Expected behavior:
The highlighted <p> element is overwritten with a new <p> element
eliminating the highlighted paragraph.  Source would be <p>C</p>.

Actual behavior:
Heading says "Saturday, June 8C".
