Amaya Version:
Amaya 5.3 binary for Win NT/2000

System:
Windows XP
AMD Athlon XP 1700+
512 MB RAM
60 GB HD

Description:
If a table cell is selected using F2 and typed over, results are not as
expected.  Undo does not undo to original condition.

To reproduce:
1. Open Amaya.
2. Open attached file (settingsun.htm, 5.38 KB).
3. Click cursor in cell with contents of "Josh Brown".
4. Press F2.
5. Type "J".
6. Click Edit > Undo (J is not inserted in caption of next cell, but
previous cell is not refilled).
7. Click Edit > Undo (A new column is created with "Josh Brown" instead of
inserting it in original cell.)

Expected results:
"Josh Brown is replaced with "J".  Undo 1 is OK and appears to be consistent
with other Undo functions.  Undo 2 should insert "Josh Brown" in original
cell.  Preferably both of these will occur on first Undo.

Actual result:
Cell is now empty, "J" is inserted as part of the caption of the table in
the next cell.
