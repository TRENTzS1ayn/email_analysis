Amaya Version:
Amaya 5.3 binary for Win NT/2000

System:
Windows XP
AMD Athlon XP 1700+
512 MB RAM
60 GB HD

Description:
Certain cells seem to select and replace incorrectly.  I do no know which,
but I can reproduce it.

To reproduce:
1. Open Amaya.
2. Open attached file (settingsun.htm, 4.12 KB (modified from previous
posts)).
3. Highlight all of "Robert M. Saywell", just the text not the element.
4. Type "G".

Result:
"G" is inserted in next cell at beginning and original cell is now empty.
Previously reported Undo bug applies here as well.
