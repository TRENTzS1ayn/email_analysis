I think it is reproduced at least so far if there is another element in the
cell (specifically abbr).

  Amaya Version:
  Amaya 5.3 binary for Win NT/2000

  System:
  Windows XP
  AMD Athlon XP 1700+
  512 MB RAM
  60 GB HD

  Description:
  Certain cells seem to select and replace incorrectly.  I do no know which,
  but I can reproduce it.

  To reproduce:
  1. Open Amaya.
  2. Open attached file (settingsun.htm, 4.12 KB (modified from previous
  posts)).
  3. Highlight all of "Robert M. Saywell", just the text not the element.
  4. Type "G".

  Result:
  "G" is inserted in next cell at beginning and original cell is now empty.
  Previously reported Undo bug applies here as well.
