Amaya Version:
Amaya 5.3 binary for Win NT/2000

System:
Windows XP
AMD Athlon XP 1700+
512 MB RAM
60 GB HD

Description:
In structure view, it sometimes shows extra whitespace before anything is
shown.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Amaya.
2. Open attached file (default.htm-5.34 KB)
3. Put insertion point immediately after "History of Firecrafter (h) by Ev
Smith".
4. Click Views > Show structure.
5. In the vertical scroll bar, between the slider and the arrow at the top,
click twice.

Result:
Approximately 15 non-existent empty lines appear above DOCTYPE.

Other notes:
If the slider is used to scroll down, the slider lengthens and the white
space disappears.  If clicking is once again used to scroll up, white space
appears again.
