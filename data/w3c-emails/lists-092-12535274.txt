UPX might be of use in making the Amaya executables smaller.  I know that it
works on Win 32 PE executable, I am not sure about UNIX or other platforms,
but it is open source.  It is available at http://upx.sourceforge.net/.  It
compresses most Microsoft executable formats and a few Linux executable
formats.
