Amaya Version:
Amaya 5.3 binary for Win NT/2000

System:
Windows XP
AMD Athlon XP 1700+
512 MB RAM
60 GB HD

Description:
Like a previously submitted bug, control characters are inserting
characters:
INSERT inserts a - (hyphen I think)

I have tested other keys and this seems to be the last control key inserting
stray characters.

Also, most likely not under your control, but pressing the Back or Forward
buttons on my keyboardmall.com keyboard while Amaya is visible causes a very
noticeable screen flicker.  Other programs have a flicker, but it is not as
noticeable.
