Disclaimer: I am not 100% familiar with the MML specification or the way
Amaya handles MML, so this may not be a bug.

Amaya Version:
Amaya 5.3 binary for Win NT/2000

System:
Windows XP
AMD Athlon XP 1700+
512 MB RAM
60 GB HD

Description:
There seems to be an extra line between the start of the math element and
the start of the mfrac element.  I cannot delete this extra line.

To reproduce (actually see what I mean):
1. Open attached file (default.htm-17.0 KB).
2. View structure view and at the bottom of the div class="body" element,
there is a math element.  The structure view appears as:

math alttext=2/3
-
-mfrac
--mn
---2
--mn
---3

The line appearing above as "-" cannot be deleted.  I have also attached a
screen capture (screen.png-32.9 KB) if you don't understand my ASCII
graphic.  In the screen capture, the suspect line is highlighted in yellow.
