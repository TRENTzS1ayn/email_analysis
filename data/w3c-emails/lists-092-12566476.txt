To:"Amaya Dev Forum"<www-amaya-dev@w3.org>

Amaya Version:
Amaya 5.3 binary for Win NT/2000

System:
Windows XP
AMD Athlon XP 1700+
512 MB RAM
60 GB HD

Description:
I have Section Numbering on.  This is a prerequesite for this bug.  With
section numbering on, and the cursor is in any level of heading beyond H1
(H1 is not affected since section numbering does not occur for this element)
and HOME is pressed, the element is selected instead of moving the cursor to
the beginning of the line.

To reproduce:
1. Start Amaya.
2. Turn on section numbering (in Special menu).
3. Click a level two or higher heading (H2 ... H6).
4. Press the HOME key.
