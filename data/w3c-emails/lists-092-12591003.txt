Thanks for the report. It'll be fixed as soon as possible.

> Amaya Version:
> Amaya 5.3 binary for Win NT/2000

> Description:
> If a table cell is selected using F2 and typed over, results are not as
> expected.  Undo does not undo to original condition.
> 
> To reproduce:
> 1. Open Amaya.
> 2. Open attached file (settingsun.htm, 5.38 KB).
> 3. Click cursor in cell with contents of "Josh Brown".
> 4. Press F2.
> 5. Type "J".
> 6. Click Edit > Undo (J is not inserted in caption of next cell, but
> previous cell is not refilled).
> 7. Click Edit > Undo (A new column is created with "Josh Brown" instead of
> inserting it in original cell.)
> 
> Expected results:
> "Josh Brown is replaced with "J".  Undo 1 is OK and appears to be consistent
> with other Undo functions.  Undo 2 should insert "Josh Brown" in original
> cell.  Preferably both of these will occur on first Undo.
> 
> Actual result:
> Cell is now empty, "J" is inserted as part of the caption of the table in
> the next cell.
