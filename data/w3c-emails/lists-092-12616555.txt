Amaya Version:
Amaya 5.3 binary for NT/2000

System:
Windows XP
AMD Athlon XP 1700+
512 MB
60 GB

Description:
When a part of an anchor element is highlighted along with some more text to
either side and F2 is pressed to select the element, the status bar reflects
the anchor as selected, but the highlighting does not.

To reproduce:
1. Open Amaya.
2. Open attached file (default.htm-5.79 KB).
3. Highlight "Constitution (o) and".
4. Press F2.

Notes:
Notice that, although the status bar shows "a \ strong \ td ...",
"Constitution (o) and" is still highlighted even though " and" is not part
of the anchor.

PS: Sorry if I am keeping the Amaya developers busy with these bugs, but I
just report them as I find them.  I like Amaya and I think it is the best
editor (other than bugs).  I would try fixing some of these bugs myself, but
I do not have a good knowledge of C nor can I yet get Amaya to compile.
