An alternative approach might be to have a "split element" function, which
would split an element at the caret.

For example, in a list item, or a dd, or a link, i might have the following
(source-code-sort-of)

  <element name>this is |an example</element>

with the caret represented by the bar | just before the word "an". I could
use the split command (ctrl x ctrl x or whatever) to make

  <element name>this is </element><element name>an example</element>

This is something I would find useful for links, list items and dd elements
in particular, and perhaps for other items too. I wonder how it would work in
a table - split a cell into two to create a new column? just create a new
cell in that row, and stretch the others? If it was in a cell with rowspan Z,
presumable it would create one cell without a rowspan and one with rowspan
Z-1?

(I agree that having the current behaviour for enter is a feature...)

  Let me try to explain what happens here, and why it happens.

  Suppose you have the following list:

    1. aaaa
    2. bbbb BBBB
    3. cccc

  and the caret is in the middle of the second item, between bbbb and BBBB.

  A - The first Return allows you to split the content of item 2 into two
  paragraphs:

    2. bbbb
       BBBB

  B - The second Return creates a new, empty paragraphs between those two
  paragraphs, but you still have a single list item:

    2. bbbb
       |
       BBBB

  C - The third Return splits the list item and creates a new one:

    2. bbbb
    3. |
    4. BBBB

  If your goal was just to split the list item, you have to delete the new
  empty item (just do F2 and Del)

  D - The fourth Return splits the whole list and inserts a new empty paragraph
  between the two lists:

    1. aaaa
    2. bbbb
  |
    1. BBBB
    2. cccc

  The story is a bit long, I agree, but making it shorter would skip one
  step (at least) and then prevent users from getting one (at least) of
  the structures listed above.

  If I understand you correctly, you suggest to skip step B (and possibly
  C). The second Return would then create:

    2. bbbb
    3. BBBB

  But how could you create a new paragraph within a list item (step B) or
  create a new item such as in step C?
