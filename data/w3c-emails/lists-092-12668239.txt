I have listed on the attached HTML page all of the links on the site that
from my end are broken.  This was approximately 8% of the links.  25% of
that was because I am so far from the Australian server, but the other 6%
has no reason for being broken on my end.  The report also lists all valid
URLs, MIME type stats, FTP URLs, broken links by page, and broken links by
link.  It even includes a site map of the Amaya site.  I hope it is useful
in fixing any broken links.
