In a CSS file, highlighting does not undo across blank links.  For example:

a{some: style}

p{some: otherstyle}

If the cursor is after "otherstyle" and SHIFT is held and the UP key is used
to highlight to "a{some: style}", it works fine but if I decide I don't want
it all highlighted and press DOWN while holding SHIFT, it stops at the blank
line between the two style rules.
