Amaya is opening PDF files as if they were text.  I even am using the type
attribute of the <a> element which is set to application/pdf and Amaya is
opening it.  I don't think this is correct.  There are two indicators that
it is unsupported, the file extension and the type attribute for the <a>
element.  I have not tested this over the Internet but within a local file
system, this occurs.  If you wish to test this over the Internet, you can
find some PDF files through http://www.firecrafter.org.
