Hi,

I've written two packages (amaya and amaya-gtk 5.3) for fink - a
debian-based package system for Mac OS X. These should make life easy
for Mac OS X people. The necessary changes are minimal.

However I've found one problem: if libwww is already installed (by
fink) the build fails when bin/amaya is linked.

...
/usr/bin/ld: Undefined symbols:
_HTCache_resetMeta

I assume this occurs because the linker finds the fink-installed
version rather than the amaya built version of some libwww library
(libwwwcache, I guess).

Does that sound right? And is there a simple way to ensure the right
libraries are found?

Thanks,

Damian Steer
