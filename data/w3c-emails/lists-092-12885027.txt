Heads up folks.  

The next release of RedHat is not supporting Xft 1

See RedHat bug # 67775

Amaya needs configure mods, and possibly other changes, to
find and use Xft2 header files.

Description of Problem:
/usr/X11R6/include/X11/Xft/Xft.h is not provided by
Xft-devel-1.9.1.020607.1058-3.i386.rpm or by
XFree86-devel-4.2.0-52.i386.rpm

Other programs (e.g. Amaya) depend on it.

Shouldn't Xft-devel be providing a compatabilty library?

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
Xft-devel-1.9.1.020607.1058-3.i386.rpm
XFree86-devel-4.2.0-52.i386.rpm
rawhide-release-20020701-1.noarch.rpm

We don't support compilation with Xft1 for the next version of Red Hat.

Programs that use Xft2 need to find out the compilation flags for Xft
by running "xft-config --cflags" or "pkg-config --cflags Xft".
