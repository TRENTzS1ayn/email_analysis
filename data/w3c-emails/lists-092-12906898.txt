UNSURE (Seems better, need more experience)

2. When copying and pasting in text mode, the paste frequently loses
spaces and hypertext. Seems to be working better now, but doesn't always
capture all the formatting but maybe I'm not selecting it properly. A
related problem is in the source view, when I copy and paste and href
elements, sometimes the internal whitespace is lost within the tag.

PENDING

1. I really wish it wouldn't rewrite my names/id to prevent
collision, this has cost me hours in accumulated time in figuring out
where I have broken fragments. When I copy something, it's fine if the
new (pasted) name/id number changes, but not the original name.
2. When editing <pre> deletions in one part create alterations in
unrelated portions of the same pre element.For instance, try
inserting white space at the end of the "<schema ..." line in: 
http://www.w3.org/Encryption/2001/Drafts/xmlenc-core/Overview.html#sec-Encryption-Syntax
4. Feature request: bounce (increase/decrease) the nesting level of nested
lists easily.
5. A shortcut key for skipping/replacing+next in the spell checker so I
don't have to rely upon the mouse and compex navigation to quickly move
through the document.
5.1 If I select one of the options in the spell checker
replace the mispelled text with that option, just don't skip it!
6. Why doesn't it respect CR/LF when I paste text into the window?
11. when I paste from another X application, it crashes 50% of the time.
