dear Sir/madam,

I am a student currently working on : how the MathML
script can become 
a matematical expression by studying the amaya source
code. 
It seems that amaya use The Thot Toolkit API. So my
lecturer said that 
i must understand the thot Toolkit first. He told me
to make a simple 
application using Thot. 
I have some question:
1. Amaya use Thot for creating MathML document.
   Does Amaya use thot function for displaying the
MathML document ? 
2. Can i make a simple application using Thot Toolkit
under windows? 
   cause i heard that Thot is not available on windows
platform.
3. I already have The Thot Toolkit API manuals that
contains 
   about 200 functions. But there is no explanation
how to use these
   function. Is there any tutorial or document about
how usinsg Thot 
   Toolkit API ?

I'm waiting for your answer as soon as possible.
Thank you very much.

kind regards,

The Fe Ping.
