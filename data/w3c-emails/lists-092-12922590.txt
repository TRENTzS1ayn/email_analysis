I guess you should read:

   http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/AmayaArchi.html

which is a short introduction to the Amaya Architecture.
You should also read:

    http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Appman.html

which explains how to build an application based on Thot.
See more comments in line.

Yes. In fact it uses Thot functions to create and modify
the tree structure and Thot displays the corresponding
elements based on the MathML presentation schema (file
MathMLP.P). To know more about presentation schema and
the P language, refer to:

Yes, you can. Amaya is in fact a Thot application. Look at
file EDITOR.A, which defines Amaya as a Thot application.
To understand this file, refer to

    http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/languages.html
