Hy,

I am working with the source code of SVG editor of Amaya and i find this
bugs:

- Make a  line parallel with the axis x  with the mouse its impossible,
the second point of line is changed when this element is created.
- Its difficult select with the mouse a line parallel with the axis x.
Following a code of a element line parallel with the axis x:
<line stroke=black y1=400 x1=92 y2=400 y2=400 x2=196>
