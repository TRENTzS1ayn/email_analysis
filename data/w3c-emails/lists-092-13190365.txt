I'll answer GTK related question :

3.  CTRL + U is what you're looking for.
Text widget (all interface editable text, not the canvas text) is submitted to GTK rules.
Taken from GTK.org :

Motion Shortcuts
Ctrl-A   Beginning of line
Ctrl-E   End of line
Ctrl-N   Next Line
Ctrl-P   Previous Line
Ctrl-B   Backward one character
Ctrl-F   Forward one character
Alt-B    Backward one word
Alt-F    Forward one word

Editing Shortcuts
Ctrl-H   Delete Backward Character (Backspace)
Ctrl-D   Delete Forward Character (Delete)
Ctrl-W   Delete Backward Word
Alt-D    Delete Forward Word
Ctrl-K   Delete to end of line
Ctrl-U   Delete line
Selection Shortcuts
Ctrl-X   Cut to clipboard
Ctrl-C   Copy to clipboard
Ctrl-V   Paste from clipboard

6 : Mouse and menu copy and paste are bugged, thanks for the report, we'll fix it. Please use keyboard shortcuts meanwhile (ctrl+c ctrl+y), as this way works.

7 : As Amaya is also an editor, shift+click is used for extending selection to be consistent with every other editor out there.

11 : Could you give us a reproducable scenario in order to reproduce the bug here ?
