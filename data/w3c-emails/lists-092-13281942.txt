Hy,

we are working on Amaya's source code and we have a question about the 
possibility to include a file across different directory. We'd like to use a 
variable of type AnnotMeta in viewapi (a file in the directory 
\thotlib\view), but AnnotMeta is a type defined in annotlib.h (a file in the 
directoy annotlib). We have added "include annotlib.h" in viewapi, but there 
are errors during the compile time.
Why? What we have to do?
Thanks,

Francesca
