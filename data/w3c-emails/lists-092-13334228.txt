The file viewapi.c is part of the Thotlib library which is used by the Amaya 
application
and the library works with its include files but not with include files of the 
application.
If you have a specific treatment to do when a view is open, you have to use 
Thot events
and add the specific code in the application.

By example the file EDITOR.A associates the Amaya function ViewToClose to the
closing of a view:

ViewClose.Pre -> ViewToClose;

See the "Thot Application generation manual" that explains how to generate 
menus and the mechanism of Thot events.
