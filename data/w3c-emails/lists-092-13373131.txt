Please note that in the past [1] I reported:
  5.1 If I select one of the options in the spell checker
  replace the mispelled text with that option, just don't skip it!

[1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-amaya-dev/2002Jul/0004.html

After some discussion I understood that my requirement to double click on a 
word (instead of single clicking it, then mousing to the replace button, 
then clicking that) was a "feature request." I felt it was a serious 
usability bug. Turns out this is the way it works on the Windows version, 
but not the Linux!

[13:45:53] <reagleMIT> now, if only amaya's spell checker was usable...
[13:46:48] <janet> reagle, I have pretty good luck with the spell checker
[13:47:43] <reagleMIT> Yea, but if you click on the word with the proper 
spelling, it retains the mispelling!
[13:48:07] <janet> really? I didn't have that problem - at least last night
[13:48:09] <reagleMIT> request to change the behaviour of clicking a 
suggested word means *use* that word is considered a "feature request"
[13:48:53] <reagleMIT> really? run the spell checker over my team page... 
tell me what word it finds first
[13:49:56] <janet> reagle, trying
[13:50:09] <reagleMIT> then choose one of the suggest words (double click on 
it)
[13:51:11] <janet> OK, so the first misspelled word I find is secratary
[13:51:23] <reagleMIT> double click on the suggested word
[13:51:25] <janet> so I click on secretary once, then I click on replace+dic
[13:51:38] <reagleMIT> no.. *double* click on the suggested word
...
[13:52:56] <janet> let me try the double click
[13:53:12] <janet> Oh, I doubled and it changed
[13:53:22] <reagleMIT> really?
[13:53:27] <janet> yes.
[13:53:38] <reagleMIT> so maybe there is a bug
[13:53:59] <reagleMIT> maybe i should find someone with windows and try it
[13:56:55] <reagleMIT> ah ha, thanks janet! it does work in the windows 
version
[13:57:18] <reagleMIT> so there *is* a bug in the linux version -- and i 
wonder why irene was saying the desired/expected behaviour wasn't 
implemented?
