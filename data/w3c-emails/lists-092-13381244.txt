I built Amaya on RH 7.3, with the options
.../configure  --prefix=/usr --with-gtk --with-dav

(gtk-config --version shows 1.2.10)

As I scroll a document, the size of the scrollbar oscillates, and my 
position in the document jumps.

I also built amaya 6.4 without specifying the --with-gtk option, and the 
scrollbar acts the same way.
