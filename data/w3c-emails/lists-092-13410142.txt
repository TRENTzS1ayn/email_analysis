Amaya doesn't build the whole document image but only the part which is displayed.
When you scroll, Amaya removes the undisplayed part of the document image and
regenerates the new necessary part. The scroll slider represents the displayed part
in the whole document file (not the whole document image because for large documents
the whole document image doesn't exist). That explains why the slider size changes when
you scroll the document.

This method works in general but not always. Sometimes we have a problem with scroll 
events. When the user moves the slider, Amaya updates the document image and 
generates a new slider position and slider size. Sometimes after the update the slider is
no longer at the current mouse position and the scroll widget, even if it knows that the slider
was modified by the application, continues to generate events which add extra scrolls up 
and scrolls down.
Probably the solution is to change the mouse position when the slider is updated, but
that's not easy to do.
