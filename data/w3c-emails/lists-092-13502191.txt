I guess your patch was integrated in the Motif version (we added a call to setlocale
in Amaya/thotlib/dialogue/interface.c) but there was a still confusion in the GTK 
version.
We provided a support for multykey in Amaya long time ago because some 
Unix platforms didn't provide it. This support lets the user enter the sequence
'e to generate a ?. If the user wanted to use that specific Amaya support
he had to define the variable ENABLE_MULTIKEY=yes.
As GTK provides a correct support for multykey, we don't develop a
specific support in the GTK version but the test of the ENABLE_MULTIKEY
was still there.
