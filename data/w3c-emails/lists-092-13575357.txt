True.

Amaya adds internals nodes in the tree to improve the
rendering. A mn that plays the role of Baseroot is not
displayed in the same way as the mn that plays the role
of index. The document tree includes additional information
that avoids to check every time the position of the mn element
when it's within a mroot.

All document elements are present in the document tree but
there is no presentation information in that tree.
An abstarct box tree describes a view of the document.
So when you have the main view and the structure view open
there is one docment tree and two abstarct box trees.
As presentation information is quite expensive in memory
space, the Thotlib generates only the minimum necessary
part of each abstarct box tree (it depends on the size of the
window). For large documents abstarct box trees are often
not complete, and are regenerated when the user scrolls.
