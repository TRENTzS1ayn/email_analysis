Here is the thread of the discussion we had on this topic last monday, 
discussion begun on the annotation mailing list.


>>>> Hy,
>>>> I'm trying to open a LMML document with Amaya, but the layout is strange. 
>>>> There is not the titles, no itemize and a lot of other things.
>>>> Why? The LMML site say that many of the XML-editors currently on the 
market
>>>> support the LMML format. Amaya not?
>>>> Thanks,
>>>> Francesca


>>> Hello Francesca,
>>> Could you send us your LMML sample so that I can test its layout in Amaya.
>>> I have a look to the LMML site and I haven't found any sample.
>>> Thanks
>>> Laurent Carcone

>> It's in Italian, sorry.
>> I'm sending you my LMML sample (provaconreti.xml) and the XSL file 
>> (layout.xls). For the DTD file, you can find it to the LMML site.
>> Francesca

> Thanks for the examples.
> Amaya doesn't valid xml documents, it verifies 'only' their well-formedness, 
> builds a DOM-tree that corresponds to the source document ans displays the 
> content of the elements in the formatted-view. You can associate xml 
> style-sheet to improve the display (as it is made in your document) but for 
> the moment, Amaya supports only css style-sheets, not xsl ones. It's the 
> reason why the layout of your documents looks 'strange'.
> Regards
