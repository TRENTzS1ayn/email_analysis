The first time an empty document is generated. Thot generates
automatically an empty document to let you display a window.
Window information (menus, position, size, etc.) depends on 
the document type and the displayed, view.
The second call displays the actual parsed contents.

This function generates the future displayed image in terms of
boxes. Abstract boxes give presentation contraints and concrete
boxes give the screen position, pixel sizes, etc.
To see that I suggest you to compile amaya with -DAMAYA_DEBUG.
Then you'll click on Help>About Amaya, in your AmayaHome directory
you'll find a file view.debug that describes abstract boxes and
boxes.debu that describes concrete boxes.

DisplayBox translates a concrete box into Win32, or X-Window, or
GTK, or Postscript primitives.
