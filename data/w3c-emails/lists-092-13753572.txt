Hi,
This bug happens in W2K and NT:

1- select a word
2- menu: Style ==> colors, set a background color by clicking
    the other mouse button
3- do sometjing
4- reselect the same word and reset bg color by clicking
    "default colors"
5- Amaya crashes or runs amok

This happens in HTML docs, didn't test other.
The workaround is to enter the source view and to delete the
related <div> tag.
