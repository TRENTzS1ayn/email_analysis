dear sir/madam,

i'm a student and now  currently working on my final project.

i'm studying Amaya code which based on Thot. So i have some question 
about Thot.

1.What is Thot? From some document and article i've found, there are 
some definition and i can't figure out what is Thot. Some says:

  - Thot is structured document editor (is Thot an editor? )

    if thot is an editor what is the purpose or function of this 
editor? is it use to write schemas or what? And what is the relation this 
editor with Thot Languages (like P, S, T, A Language)  and Thot compilers?

  - Thot is a library for manipulating structure document 

    is Thot is the same with Thot toolkit API which consist of about 
200 functions? Thot 

  - Thot is an Application Generation Languages. (what does it mean?)

 2. Is Thot only runs on Linux ? What about if i want to make 
application on Windows ? (i think it can because Amaya is under Windows too, 
right?)

3. in order to understand Thot, at least how to use it for a building 
simple application, I need to know how to use thot from the beginning. 
What steps i must do for the first, second, an so on. Would you tell me 
the steps ? 

Or would you tell me where i can find a simple application using Thot 
so i can study it ? 


4. What is the advantages using thot to build an application ? When someone need to use Thot and when his is not ?


Would you answer my question, please ? because i need it for my final 
project. Thank you very much.

kind regards,

Hui Ping
