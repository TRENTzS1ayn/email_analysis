The attached file, derived from

http://www.mirror.ac.uk/help/reports.html

exposes a problem with the rendering of invalid HTML documents; namely
that the text gets wrapped in odd places.  When saved and reloaded, the
resulting document renders correctly.  The only difference between the
first and second Thot trees is a Pseudo_paragraph containing the
definition list not present in the second (this appears to have been
generated to hold the font element, but was not removed).
