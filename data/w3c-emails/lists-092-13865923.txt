For instance, if I originally save a document as UTF-8, then try save-as 
(or even save) again it does not give the default as UTF-8 but as 
ISO-8859-1. Same thing with the mime type, it does not get the defaults 
from the document. I have to guess what I might have chosen before because 
it is not possible to save it again with other values than the original 
ones to the same URI (I get an error).
