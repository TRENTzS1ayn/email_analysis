Hi,

 I read about this problem on the mailing list archive.  It has to do
 with the FTGL code Amaya apparently uses.  I fixed the bug a couple of
 months ago and sent the patch to Henry.  It's in the most recent
 codebase (and in some 1.4.x release, too, can't recall which x exactly,
 sorry).

 It has to do with pixel packing/unpacking alignment.

 HTH,

 Marcelo
