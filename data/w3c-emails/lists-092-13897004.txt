>  It has to do with pixel packing/unpacking alignment.

Thanks for the information !

Actually we intialize texture drawing as :

glwindowdisplay.c :2612: 
glPixelStorei (GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT, 1); 


After downloading ftgl, i found out this in the code :

        glPixelStorei( GL_UNPACK_LSB_FIRST, GL_FALSE);
        glPixelStorei( GL_UNPACK_ROW_LENGTH, 0);
        glPixelStorei( GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT, 1);

perhaps it must be included in the macosx version...

ps1 : For now we don't have a macosx here to test... 
ps2 : [OT]
it seems that exist a :

glPixelStorei(GL_UNPACK_CLIENT_STORAGE_APPLE, 1) 
that allows use of AGP... might be worth trying it.
