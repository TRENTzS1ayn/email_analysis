Hi, 

     I have a very strange problem. I compiled amaya 7.2 from source 
with --with-gtk; the resulting binary works well: 

(0)pern:~% software/amaya/Amaya/obj/bin/amaya 
(0)pern:~% 

     The I did a make install; amaya ended up in /usr/local/bin:
     
(0)pern:~% diff /usr/local/bin/amaya software/amaya/Amaya/obj/bin/amaya
(0)pern:~%

But: 

(0)pern:~% /usr/local/bin/amaya
Gdk-ERROR **: 86
  serial 125 error_code 86 request_code 51 minor_code 0

So, the amaya binary is working ok when called from the build dir, but not
when installed. Can anyone help me? 

                 Romano 

Please, if you don't mind, Cc: me with the answers. I'm not in the list ---
utter lack of time; but I will check the web archives.

Thanks!
