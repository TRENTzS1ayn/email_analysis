Hi

I am still working on getting a real process together to compile Amaya as
fink packages for OS X.

One of the issues I am facing is regularly downloading a large package via
telephone. This coud be alleviated by using CVS, but it seems that it might
be helpful to have source tarballs that are more modular. For example libjpeg
and libpng are not required anymore by default, and it would be good to have
a source tarball available that didn't include them. I presume this requires
a change to the packaging files.

On a related note, at least in OS X it is possible to compile libwww
seperately as a package. Are there special configuration requirements for
Amaya to use libwww or could it be compiled against a pre-existing
installation of libwww? Again this would allow packaging systems (not just
fink, but also deb and rpm, at least) to live with smaller chunks, and at the
same time readily ensure that they manage versioning requirements, upgrading
libwww etc as required.

Cheers

Chaals

(PS No actual progress on compiling at the moment - I don't have a Mac right
now...)
