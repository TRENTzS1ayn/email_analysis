About compiling 7.1:
I have compiled amaya (without the i18n trick) 7.1 on OSX 10.1.5
and then updated the page.
I had tested only with a google search and it was worky, but
today I discover it crashes on www.w3.org!
After testing several sites, it seems to crash when it needs 
to load a separate CSS stylesheet. Any hint to debug this?
