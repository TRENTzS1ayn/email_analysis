It is the case of people compiling for the Mac, using fink (similar to debian
packaging). It would be nice if the packaging mechanisms supported using CVS,
but as far as I can tell they don't at this stage.

What would be ideal is to have several tarballs generated - one for people
who want the full source, and others that are designed around the idea of
modularising the source (it seems unnecessary for people to download
unchanged versions of lib* every time they want to compile a release
version, and especially libpng/libjpeg which aren't used).
