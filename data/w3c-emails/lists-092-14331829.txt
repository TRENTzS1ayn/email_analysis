This fils should be available in a gtk distribution.

The files "MathML.h" and "SVG.h" are generated when file SVG.S and
MathML.S are compiled. Probably make considered that SVG.S and
MathML.S should not be compiled.
I suggest you remove in the directory Aamaya/amaya all files *.STR *.PRS
and *.TRA then you relaunch "make".

The "--with-gtk" version uses the system library called by gdk_imlib.
The "--without-gtk" version uses normally the local library. To use the system 
library (located at /usr/local/lib/libpng.so.2on my solaris8 box), I have to
configure "--without-graphic-libs".
