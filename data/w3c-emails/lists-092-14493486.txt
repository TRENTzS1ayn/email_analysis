Hello Carine,

Good debugging. Thanks!.

I see the problem. It should be throughout PATH_MAX, rather than FILENAME_MAX. 
In addition, as we're not using the local library anymore, I don't need
the L_tmpnam limit anymore, just its actual value (6) as implemented
in the function above. This must have been some legacy stuff that
stayed there.

I commmited the change to CVS.
