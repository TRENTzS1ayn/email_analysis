Hi,

I'm currently packaging amaya 7.1 for fink (mac os x), and I'm seeing:

sed: 25: conftest.s2: filename expected
creating Options.orig
sed: 25: conftest.s2: filename expected
creating tools/Makefile
sed: 25: conftest.s2: filename expected
creating libjpeg/Makefile
sed: 25: conftest.s2: filename expected

Trying a quick autoconf I get:

sed: 31: /tmp/csBxkXhV/subs-3.sed: filename expected
config.status: creating batch/Makefile
sed: 31: /tmp/csBxkXhV/subs-3.sed: filename expected
config.status: creating tablelib/Makefile
sed: 31: /tmp/csBxkXhV/subs-3.sed: filename expected
config.status: creating amaya/Makefile
sed: 31: /tmp/csBxkXhV/subs-3.sed: filename expected
config.status: creating pluginlib/Makefile
sed: 31: /tmp/csBxkXhV/subs-3.sed: filename expected
config.status: creating annotlib/Makefile
sed: 31: /tmp/csBxkXhV/subs-3.sed: filename expected

Hmm. Ideas? The only change I can think of is that 10.2 uses bash
instead of zsh for its sh, but changing that makes no difference.
