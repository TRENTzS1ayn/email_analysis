Warning: this is from a non-coder, just a serious user who wants very 
badly to have use of the latest release for setting up docuemt archive 
using XHTML. Pre-compiled binary crashes without useful messages.

Release 7.1
SuSE 8.1/i686
Failed to build, error and abort about 12 minutes into build process.
I tried to allow use of GTK libs from SuSE Gnome2 update: 
gtk-1.2.10-460.

Synopsis:
1. Logged on as root, opened archive in /usr/local/src.

2. Created LINUX-ELF subdir and ran ../configure.

3. After "make" everything ran fine for about 12 minutes (AMD Duron 800 
with 384MB RAM). Noticed lots of warnings, but things kept going.

4. Got just past "libraptor is installed" then....

5. Process aborted with roughly 100 lines similar to this (pardon the 
wrapping):

html2thot.o: In function `GetNextChar':
html2thot.o(.text+0x5714): undefined reference to `gzread'

and

pnghandler.o(.text+0xa3d): undefined reference to `png_set_dither'

and

jpeghandler.o(.text+0x648): undefined reference to 
`jpeg_destroy_decompress'

and then:

collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
make[1]: *** [../bin/amaya] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/local/src/Amaya/LINUX-ELF/amaya'
make: *** [amaya_prog] Error 2

As a non-programer, I can't imagine what the problem is. Should I submit 
the complete list of error lines, or some other file from the build 
directory?
