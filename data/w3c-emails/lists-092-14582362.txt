I tried out your advice about inserting instructions like -L/usr/lib 
(where all those libs were) at the line for IMGLIBS and for EXTRA-LIBS 
but to no avail. I get the same errors both times.

If knew how to compell the config to build and use the bundled libs, I 
would, but after reading the INSTALL instructions, the configure script, 
and the advice on the website.... well, it's over my head. I can't find 
the configure option for "compile and use bundled libs."

Sorry to be such a nuisance, but I'd like to learn how to make this work.
