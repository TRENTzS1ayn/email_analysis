First Amaya Welcome Page Competition[4]

  Call for Participation

    Amaya[5] is a browser/authoring tool that allows you to publish documents
    on the Web. It is used to demonstrate and test many of the new
    developments in Web protocols and formats. Amaya is a complete Web
    browsing and authoring environment and comes equipped with a WYSIWYG
    interface, similar to that of the most popular commercial browsers. With
    such an interface, users can easily generate HTML and XHTML pages, as
    well as CSS style sheets, MathML expressions, and SVG drawings. Amaya has
    also advanced I18N and annotation support.

    The Amaya developers invite their user community to help design a new
    Welcome page. This is the default page that the Amaya browser displays
    when launched. The proposed page should not only showcase the different
    features that Amaya supports today, but also show how these features can
    be combined.

    The winner of the competition will be mentioned in the Amaya Welcome
    page. The winner can decide to forfeit this right.

    The Amaya team reserves the right, after discussion with the authors, to
    modify the winning submission in the manner it feels fit to best suit its
    shipping inside Amaya.

    The competition begins on 10 December 2002 and ends on 3 February 2003.

    Submissions must be sent to www-amaya-contest@w3.org. Your submission
    must include a text copy of the copyright waiver[6], duly completed, all
    related files (images, CSS style sheets, ...), as well as an image
    capture. Incomplete entries won't be reviewed. Please indicate in the
    copyright waiver[7] if your submission can be made public or if it should
    be kept confidential.

    You may participate more than once. However, each submission must be sent
    in a separate message.

    Contest home page is available at http://www.w3.org/Amaya/contest.html[8].

    Send all your remarks to the www-amaya@w3.org mailing list.

  Rules

       *  It must be possible to display your submission with Amaya.
       *  A submitted page must use markup when possible. Pages that are made
          of only a single bitmap image will be rejected.
       *  Try to combine all the possible markup languages that Amaya knows
          how to handle today (XHTML, MathML, CSS, SVG, ...). (sample[9])
       *  The submitted page must support WAI[10] Priority Level 1[11] at
          least.
       *  Submitted pages must be valid[12].
