Hi Irene,

I am running into a "gdk_imlib.h" not found issue.
That include file does not seem to be part of the GTK toolkit.
I notice that it is available separately also for Solaris2.8. 
I do have to compile that separately, correct? I have the
gdk_pixbuf stuff, but not gdk_imlib.

Please advise.

Thanks.
