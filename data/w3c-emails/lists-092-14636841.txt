Hi folks,

keyboard shortcuts are a really cool feature of Amaya - one of the 
accessibility features it implements fairly well. (I know, there are 
missing ones from time to time or conflicts - this is an open source 
project, and this is an area that I would have thought the user 
community could take a more active role, myself included).

In using the spanish and french versions I have realised and been told 
by other users that there are problems and potential problems with some 
shortcuts, because the keyboard mappings are different. For example on 
a french AZERTY keyboard the "-" and "6" are on the same key, so using 
them for zoom and h6 can create a conflict.

I was wondering if anyone has a quick solution for modifying this, so 
that it is possible to launch a different shortcuts file according to 
the keyboard mapping - this should be dynamically variable and take its 
default from the X11 keyboard map or whatever the windows equivalent 
is, but even having a configuration option would be a good start.

I presume that doing this would be a good opportunity to look at 
different mappings for different profiles. In particular the idea of 
having keys available in browser mode and different keys in editor mode 
(similar to the way that vi works) has been discussed in the past. If 
it is easy to change keymapping profiles this seems like a good 
possibility.

I think this is also related to the ability to provide Amaya in 
different default languages, although there might be no overlap in the 
implementation.

Last important feature is to make sure that people know whether they 
are going to lose their profile between upgrades (I think not but 
haven't checked), and that they can take new mappings - for example for 
new functionalities that didn't have them before.

So pointers to where in the code these things are effected would be 
appreciated. If I make progress myself I will send comments, of course.

cheers

Chaals
