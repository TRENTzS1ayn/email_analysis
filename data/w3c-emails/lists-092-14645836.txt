Amaya lets you customize your keyboard mapping.
You just have to define a file amaya.keyboard (Unix) or amaya.kb (Windows)
in your AmayaHome directory.
If people provide other examples of these configuration files, we will include 
them in our distribution.

Personally I don't appreciate that behavior in vi. It's often source of errors.

Normally you should not lose these files between upgrades except if Installshield
does an extra job.
