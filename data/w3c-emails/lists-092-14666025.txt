Right, but the problem is that I don't know of any mechanism for selecting
between keyboard profiles if you use more than one of them. Having a
distribution with several optional keyboard files would help, but there are
people using azerty keyboards, qwerty keyboards, and belgian keyboards, all
of whom can be expected to use the french version, so they still need to pick
a keyboard file.

I will start to look at the code, but would appreciate any pointers...

I will work with the folks at SIDAR on shortcuts files for spanish keyboards
as a first step.

Fair enough, but there are a lot of people who do appreaciate the behaviour
in vi and might appreciate it in Amaya too. If it is easy anyway then it
would be interesting to try. (If it is way too complex then it might still be
just an interesting idea for the future, of course...)
