Hi all;
I need an annotation system for my Phd project and I did a survey of 
annotation tools. I found out that the Annotea implementation in Amaya is 
really good and I would like to use it as the testbed. In my project I need 
to extend the Amaya in order to be able to use it for the further stages of 
my project; I have may own RDF vocabulary (RDF schema) and I want Amaya to 
support my vocabulary (schema) and implement the annotations as semantic 
annotations rather than commentary annotations.

I have downloaded the source code of Amaya, but unfortunately, I couldn't 
find any documentation and it is really difficult to understand the source 
code with limited comments provided for each function.

The only information I found is as follows:
http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/AmayaArchi.html
http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Amaya-dev.html

Does anyone know where can I find detailed documentation or anything that 
can help me to understand the implementation of Amaya? Any help would be 
appreciated,
Thanks in advance,
Yeliz Yesilada
