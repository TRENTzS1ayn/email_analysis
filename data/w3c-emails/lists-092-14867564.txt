Hi,

Stupid forgetful me. Amaya 7.1 is now in fink stable, and 7.2 has been
submitted (a while ago). I've given up on the [Less|Mo]tif version,
so there is now just an amaya package. People using amaya-gtk should
install amaya, which will delete the old version.

At some point I need to get i18n working, and (ideally) gl. Both are
causing problems currently, alas.
