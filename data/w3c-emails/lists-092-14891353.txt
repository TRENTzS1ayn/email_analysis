A quick follow up to this:

I remembered gtk-mac because (although that is moribund) an OS X
version based on that work has been developed:

<http://gtk-osx.sourceforge.net>

It seems to be related to filmgimp (now cinepaint, I believe), and is
the project seems very active.

I grabbed a copy from cvs and tried it with amaya. Well, it was
doomed, but I knew that. It seemed to start building correctly, though  The
problem is thot seems to need X specific things. If amaya were 'pure'
gtk (if that's possible) then it might have worked.

Anyway, potential for the future.
