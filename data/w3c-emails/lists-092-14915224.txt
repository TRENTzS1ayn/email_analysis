Hi,

I've been trying to get amaya working with opengl on Mac OS
X. It's been a pain, but it appears to be a font issue:

<http://rdfweb.org/people/damian/amaya_nox.png>

This is a build using freetype2 supplied by fink. It's pretty obvious
that this is missing fonts.

<http://rdfweb.org/people/damian/amaya_x.png>

This is a build using the X supplied freetype2. At first glance all is
well, but there are (seemingly) random missing characters.

The first issue is probably something to do with fink, but can anyone
suggest what's up with the second? The most obvious problem is the
'W's are missing, but not always.

Suggestions gratefully received :-)

Damian
