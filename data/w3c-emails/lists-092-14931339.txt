The font code using opengl and freetype2 works on linux and windows without those bugs... so there must be somewhere something special in fink or mac osx about fonts or freetype 2...

If you are a OS X developper (if you have Mac OSX (Project Builder)), could you try to load same font and characters using FTGL lib and demos and see what happens ?

FTGL also use freetype 2 and opengl, but in a OS X native way, 
so we could get more infos about the problem, as it's nearly the same problem...

You could also try to compile/test/use FTGL in the fink environment to test fonts in fink...
