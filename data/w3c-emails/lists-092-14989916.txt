Hi, I'm working on a project about "Amaya" for my graduation at 
University. I would like to include the option Validate CSS in the 
Menu and the W3C Validator there, too. But I need to know whether 
this option is possible in the Amaya code, which part of the code 
should be modificated and how it would be compiled.
 
Thanks a lot.
