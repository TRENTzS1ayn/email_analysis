on a similar note , many editors allow you to add command line 
macros into the menuing system.  This would allow add-ons 
that users can do without recompiling .....   An example of this
is my beloved textpad where i easily added tools items for 
several browsers  so i can view code as the actual browser
would see it... normally only your system default browser is used.
and i can call my mailer from the editor to do a fast check.

this would be a nice user convenience  but probably way down the 
list of priorities as basics  need to be solid first ...   cu

Hi veronica,

I added www-amaya-dev@w3.org in cc, because other Amaya developers
could be interested too.

1- Edit the file Amaya/amaya/EDITOR.A to Insert the entry in the right menu
    I suggest to insert it into the menu Style.
    If you add  the following line
    "view:1 Style button:BValidCSS -> ValidCSS;"
    It will create an entry "BValidCSS" into the "Style" menu,  only displayed
    by the formatted view of the document (view:1). When invocating that menu
    entry it will call the function "ValidCSS (document, view)".

2- Compile the application. The building will stop because the function 
     ValidCSS () doesn't exist.
    In the file Amaya/your_obj/amaya/EDITORactions.proto you will find
    the declaration of the function ValidCSS (). Take a copy of that
    declaration
   and put it in the file Amaya/amaya/EDITORactions.c.
   Then you have to write the code of the function.

3- You have also to add the text of the new entry into dialogue files.
    Check the position of the new dialogue in the generated file 
     Amaya/your_obj/amaya/EDITOR.h.

4- Open the XML base of dialogues:
  Amaya/tools/xmldialogues/bases/base_am_dia.xml
    It's available on the CVS base but not included in the tar source
   (please ask us if you need it).
    Pay attention, this XML base uses UTF-8 characters.
    Add the corresponding entry at the right place in the base (just
    after the previous entry).

5- Regenerate dialogue files with the script PERL
 Amaya/tools/xmldialogues/scripts/Am_dial_managment.pl
    The first time you have to define the parent directory of the
     Amaya tree (for me it's /home/vatton/) and the object directory
    (for me it's LINUX-ELF).

6- Update the file of Amaya profiles Amaya/config/ProfileDefs to make 
    that function available in right profiles.

I guess the integration of validators is interesting for Amaya users. I 
propose
to integrate your work in future Amaya releases if you agree. Let me know if
you need more help.
    Irene.
