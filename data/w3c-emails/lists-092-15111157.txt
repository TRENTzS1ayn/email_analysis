Hello:
 
Trying to compile Amaya on Solaris 9, during the make, I'm getting this:
 
../../thotlib/dialogue/appdialogue.c:2041: for each function it appears in.)
../../thotlib/dialogue/appdialogue.c: In function `TtcSwitchCommands':
../../thotlib/dialogue/appdialogue.c:2787: `FrameResized' used prior to declaration
../../thotlib/dialogue/appdialogue.c: In function `MakeFrame':
../../thotlib/dialogue/appdialogue.c:3810: `FrameHScrolled' undeclared (first use in this function)
../../thotlib/dialogue/appdialogue.c:3833: `FrameVScrolled' undeclared (first use in this function)
../../thotlib/dialogue/appdialogue.c:4034: `FrameResized' undeclared (first use in this function)
gmake[1]: *** [dialogue/appdialogue.o] Error 1
gmake[1]: Leaving directory `/home/jrankin/tmp/Amaya/obj/thotlib'
gmake: *** [thotlib] Error 2
 
Any ideas on what the problem may be? Let me know if you need additional info.
