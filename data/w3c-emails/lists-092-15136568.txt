Hi:

I'm having a problem making Amaya 8.2 on Solaris 9, it looks like it
might be a motif error:

My configure is:

../configure prefix=/home/jrankin/Amaya  --with-motif

then I try to make it:

gmake SHELL=/usr/bin/bash

and after a while this happens:

Recursive element MTD
Recursive element CellWrapper
DOCTYPE unused
DOCTYPE : won't be created
Construct1 : is a temporary element.
SemanticsContent : is a temporary element.
TableRow : is a temporary element.
MathMLCharacters : is a temporary element.
(if test "../../amaya" != "" -a "../../amaya" != "." -a \
         "../../amaya" != "../amaya" ; then \
    /usr/bin/cp ../../amaya/EDITOR.A . ; \
    /usr/bin/cp ../../amaya/xpm/logo.xpm . ; \
fi)
THOTDIR=../.. ; export THOTDIR ; \
../bin/app -DXML_GENERIC -D_I18N_  -D_MOTIF     -D_SVG -D_I18N_
-DANNOTATIONS  -
DXML_DTD -DXML_NS EDITOR.A
gmake[1]: *** [EDITORAPP.c] Error 138
gmake[1]: Leaving directory `/home/jrankin/tmp/Amaya/obj/amaya'
gmake: *** [amaya_prog] Error 2

Thank you for your help. Let me know if you require additional
information.
