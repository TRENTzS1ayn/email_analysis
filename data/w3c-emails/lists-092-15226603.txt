Hello,

I tried to build amaya on Aix 4.2 using gcc and linking to Motif (not only I
like it more, but I am not able in any way to compile gtk 1.x on Aix...).

I did configure and use gnu-make

The build gives the following erros (apart some redefinitions):

../../thotlib/base/fileaccess.c: In function `readFloat':
../../thotlib/base/fileaccess.c:307: structure has no member named
`negative'
../../thotlib/base/fileaccess.c:308: structure has no member named
`exponent'
../../thotlib/base/fileaccess.c:309: structure has no member named
`mantissa'
../../thotlib/base/fileaccess.c:309: structure has no member named
`exponent'

further on:

/bin/sh: /usr/local/build/Amaya/rs6k/annotlib/../bin/str:  not found
gmake[1]: *** [Annot.STR] Error 127


but it may be caused by the first error...

I see that aix 4.1 should be supported but no binaries are provided. Any
suggestions? Do you need further information?

thanks,
    Riccardo
