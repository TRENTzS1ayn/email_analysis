Yes grm is the meta compiler that generates str, prs, tra and app compilers.
The file APP.LAN defines the grammar of the language A of Thot.
Make should build grm, then str, ..., then app is launched to generate 
EDITORAPP.c, HTMLAPP.c, etc. These files are necessary to compile amaya.

You could before go into the Amaya directory and launch "autoconf" then go
back in the aix subdirectory and execute "../configure" (--with-gtk is the default value).
I remember also that I launched "gmake MAKE=gmake" on AIX platforms.
You could also launch "gmake MAKE=gmake -n " to see what gmake tries to do.
