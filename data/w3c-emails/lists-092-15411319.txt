I have built amaya on an AIX 4.1.5 R2 system with gcc 3.3.2.  When I try
to run it, I get the following error:

Gdk-ERROR **: BadValue (integer parameter out of range for operation)
  serial 735 error_code 2 request_code 51 minor_code 0

Note that the gtk test programs run ok (using gtk+ 1.2.10 and glib 1.2.10).
The glib and gtk test programs did not run until I recompiled them without
optimization.  I have now rebuilt everything without optimization, but
I still get the above error.

I suppose that I sould get and build the GNU debugger and then try to debug
this (the AIX debugger does not seem to work with programs built with gcc).
But, before I do that, does anyone know how to interpret the above error
message?
