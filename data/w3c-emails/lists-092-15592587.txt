I am trying to build Amaya 8.3 on an AIX 4.1.5 R2 system using gcc version
3.3.2.  I am using gtk+ 1.2.10.  When the build gets to the point of trying
to link bin/grm, there are several undefined references.  The show stopper
is the following:

../thotlib/libThotEditor.a(appdialogue.o)(.pr+0x2044):../../thotlib/dialogue/
ppdialogue.c: undefined reference to `.TteLoadApplications()'

I have searched all files in the distribution and can not find any file that
contains a subroutine named TteLoadApplications.

Other undefined references are ZoomIn and ZoomOut, but I have found these in
amaya/init.c.  Note that init.c is not compiled at this point, and I have not
yet tried to compile it.

Also undefined are the variables appArgc and appArgv.  As a workaround I
added the following to  batch/grammar.c:

710a711,712
> int appArgc;
> char **appArgv;
732a735,737
> 
> appArgc = argc;
> appArgv = argv;

In addition I had to add the following to the link (g++) command line to get
this far:

-lThotEditor -lgdk_imlib -lgtk -lgdk -lglib -lX11 -lXext -lpng -ljpeg
-ltiff -lz -lungif -lgmodule

I tried getting the latest source from CVS, but I still could not find any
file that had a subroutine named TteLoadApplications.  Any help would be
appreciated.
