Yes, I did exactly that (I called the subdirectory 'aix').  I ran configure
as ../configure --with-gtk.  When is the app compiler created and run?
The file EDITORAPP.c does not exist at the time that grm is being built.
It looks like the app compiler might be built by Amaya/aix/batch/Makefile,
but not until after it tries to build grm.  Some interestisting lines
from the Makefile:

COMPILERS=../bin/grm ../bin/str ../bin/prs ../bin/tra ../bin/app

GRMS     = APP.GRM PRESEN.GRM STRUCT.GRM TRANS.GRM

all : ../bin $(GRMS) $(COMPILERS) \
          ../bin/printstr ../bin/rescandialogue

APP.GRM : APP.LAN ../bin/grm
        (DIR=`pwd` ; THOTDIR=$$DIR/$(THOTDIR) ; export THOTDIR ; \
        cd ../../batch ; $$DIR/../bin/grm APP)

I expect that configure is doing something wrong, but there are no error
messages when it runs.  I have captured the on screen output from configure,
and could make it or anything else available if that would help.  I expect
that all the other problems have the same cause as this one.
