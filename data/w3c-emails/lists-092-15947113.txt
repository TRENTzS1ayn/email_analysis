Hi Matthew,

I have some remarks about your new documentation files posted in the CVS base.

1) There still a lack of navigation bars, so it's extremely difficult for us to
   have a look at all these new pages today.

2) Some pictures are still missing (see browsing/working_with_the_amaya_browser
_and_editor.html)
   "The button bar displays the OO button ..."

3) I guess some pieces of the documentation like <span style="color: #FF0000">
open</span>
   will be replaced by links.

4) You use the attribute style to mark dialogue hierarchy, it would be easier 
to define a class
   "dialogue_path" and attach the color to that class:

   <span class="dialogue_path">Special &gt; Preferences &gt; General</span>
instead of:
   <span style="color: #0000FF">Special &gt; Preferences &gt; General</span>

5) On Unix platforms the font size is a bit too small.

6) It's frustrating to don't have links in sections See Also

7) Information change:
   In "browsing/working_with_the_amaya_browser_and_editor.html" section 
"Character Sets"

   "When the XML parser analyzing the document encounters a character that 
does not match a
    valid UTF 8 character, the document is considered to be invalid. The 
parsing stops and
    Amaya displays an error message. Amaya then activates the Reopen in 
ISO-latin-1 option
    on the File menu"
should be replaced by
   "When the XML parser analyzing the document encounters a character that 
does not match a
    valid UTF 8 character, the document is considered to be not well formed. 
The parsing stops and
    Amaya displays an error message that propose either to reload the document 
as an HTML document
    or to show parsing errors. If show parsing errors is selected Amaya then 
activates the
    Reparse in HTML option on the File menu"


Regards

     Irene.
