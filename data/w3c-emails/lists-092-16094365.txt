Hello all,

The next Amaya release is closer now. We need the German, Italian, Spanish, 
Portuguese and Turkish translations of the following dialogues/messages :

**Modify doctype
**Remove doctype
**Change/Create doctype XHTML 1.1
**Change/Create doctype XHTML 1.0 Transitional
**Change/Create doctype XHTML 1.0 Strict
**Change/Create doctype XHTML 1.0 Basic
**Change/Create doctype HTML Transitional
**Change/Create doctype HTML Strict
**Change/Create doctype XHTML + MathML
**Change/Create doctype MathML
**Change/Create doctype SVG
**Document
**Characters
**Xml support
**Create or change the doctype causes the document to be reparsed. Pending 
modifications won't be undone.

Thanks in advance
