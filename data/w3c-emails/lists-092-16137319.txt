Sorry, I hit the wrong button, so I'll try again.
for Castillian Spanish:  Usar
for Mexican Spanish:     Use
I don't understand the meaning of "type"  el tipo means type or kind for
example:  What type of car do you have?  If it means newspaper type or
printing, it should be "letras impresas"
Hope this helps.

Universal (general) spanish, if such a thing exists.  As long as it is
understandable in both, that is the goal.  I would probably say Castillian
though.
