Hi,

it seems to me that the pages about how to insert an image and about text
alternatives should be in the same group as the ones about SVG - Amaya
actually allows you to insert different kinds of graphics (and the fact that
the bit about images is listed as being image maps, and includes the idea
that you can use the graphics button to insert an image is just plain
confusing).

Should I do an edit and send this back to the list?

cheers

Chaals
