Hello:
I had not realized 'Create Doc' was, in fact, the download command. Now 
I have the user manual downloaded, at least in part.

What I have is a single large document. Links which point to sections 
within the document work. But others point to separate documents which 
don't exist in the same directory.

Is there some way to 'install' this document which parses the pages into 
a directory structure. If not, how do I download a complete user manual, 
preferably with an index?

It would be useful if the user manual could be made available as a .pdf 
document.

Incidentally, when I attempt to read the download in Internet Explorer 
5.1 for Mac OSX, I get a parsing error:
Line 6297
Char 16
Error Reference to undefined entity 'Integral'

These browsers open the file without complaint.
Netscape 6.2, Opera v5.0, iCab 2.7.1
