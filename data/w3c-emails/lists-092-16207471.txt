Douglas,

if you used the fink install of Amaya you should have the manual downloaded
already - just select help and open a page. If you select

  View -> Show address bar

(this is off by default for help pages, which I find frustrating*) you will
see that it is all in the directory /sw/lib/Amaya/doc/html for a default fink
install, otherwise it will show you where it is.

You might need to change the permissions of that directory and things in it
to edit the files.

*Why I find it frustrating is that Amaya is an open source project. The
documentation is not yet complete or perfect (given the amount of work the
Amaya Team and contributors manage to do it might never be possible to catch
up with them completely), and Amaya is a good editor for working on its own
help files. It would be nice if it was more obvious that doing this and
submitting improved pages is a good thing to do (although it makes yet more
work for the Team <sigh/>).

cheers

  Hello:
  I've just installed Amaya and X on MacOS 10.1.4

  I'd like to download the Amaya user manual to read off line. However,
  for the moment I don't have a printer which I can access from OSX so
  'Make Book' doesn't seem to apply.

  Any suggestions?
  Thanks: DW
