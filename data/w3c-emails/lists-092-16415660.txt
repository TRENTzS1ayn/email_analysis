Okay this line about the Index was due to your previous contribution.
I removed it.

I added her name in the CVS version.

We fixed a set of errors in the current documentation: broken Math 
expressions,
some missing links, invalid css values, but we didn't have time to fix a set 
of
other problems. Do you think you may work on them?

1) In the page Manual.html a large set of links point to the Web server 
instead of
   local files. That's extremelly annoying when users are disconnected.
   I'm surprised because Amaya generates relative links when it's possible. 
Did you
   work with both local and remote files at the same time when you generated 
these links?
   Anyway, could you replace these links to the server by relative links to 
local files?

2) In the initial version of the documentation we generated a div element to
   isolate the part of each page that will be included by the make book command
   and so navigation bars were not collected.
   You omitted to do the same in the current version and the final book 
includes all
   navigation bars.
   Could you fix that?

3) A style attribute is associated to each td element (see subdirectories 
style_sheets,
   viewing, etc.). It's not necessary to give a specific width to each cell. 
Browsers are
   able to compute them correctly. It's also not a good idea to repeat each 
time the
   value "border-top:solid 1.5pt;   border-left:none;border-bottom:solid 1.5pt;
   border-right:solid .5pt;   padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt".
  I suggest you create a class "description" which will be associated to these 
tables
  and you add a CSS rule ".descrition td {...}" that collects these common CSS 
rules.
  What do you think?

That's all for the moment.

Happy New Year to everybody!

     Irene.
