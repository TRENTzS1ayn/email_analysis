The id value should be a significant text but it's not an obligation. In any 
case
it must be unique in the document. The Amaya command "Create a target" on a div
generates an id attribute that follows these rules. It uses the text of the 
first
significant word in the div and adds 1, 2, etc. when this new generated value 
is already declared in the document by another name or id attribute.

The id value can be used as any other name. Links to the div may be 
href="#id_value"
for a local link, or href="document_url#id_value" for a remote link.
