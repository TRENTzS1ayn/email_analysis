Hi Brant,

I think this is a great idea. I would be inclined to include it as a
supplement to the user manual.

Are you aware of the (pretty basic) attempt at some tutorial stuff I did that
was in the documentation until the rewrite? (I think it is still in CVS).

I would suggest that you do this in HTML.

Cheers

Chaals

  I am thinking about writing a tutorial to familiarize users with the
  features of Amaya.  If I pursue this, I would like to know:

      * What features should I cover?
      * How should I format it?
      * What has given you the most trouble using Amaya (besides bugs)?
      * What formats should the tutorial be available in?

  Thank you ahead of time for any input.
