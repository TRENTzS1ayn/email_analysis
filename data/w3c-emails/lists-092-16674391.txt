Hola Bartolome, Emmanualle,

There are some people who have been working on translating Amaya
documentation into Spanish - so some of these are available. They also set up
a mailing list to let each other know who was working on something.
Emmanuelle can provide the details I hope (and is one of the people who
translated some pages).

Cheers

Charles McCN
