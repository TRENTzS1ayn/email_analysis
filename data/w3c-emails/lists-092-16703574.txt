Hmm InstallShield is completely buggy. i just prepared the future Spanish document 
package that will let users customize the install with the English and Spanish help 
pages. Today it's already possible to choose French and/or German help pages.
Unfortunately due to a bug in InstallShiel, adding that package corrupted the whole install.
No Spanish directories should be generated like no French or German directories
were generated previously.

So now, we have to change our distribution method to avoid that problem.
