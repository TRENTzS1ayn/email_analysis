I added this file in the CVS base.

Right. Now there are English alternate texts.

Yes. The "timeline_help.html" is called from the Timeline view.
"WebDAV.html" is now linked from the page "Saving and Publishing Amaya"

Done.

Fixed.

You're probably right but I'm too busy to do that now.
Could you change the Spanish and the English version?

I have no strong opinion, but it should be homogeneous.

8.0 and the date should be 15 April.

Yes, it's a good idea.

That requires a development. I guess it won't be done for the next release.
