Hi, 

New to the list, but I've read the FAQ and seem to be having more than the
usual troubles compiling on NT.
First, trying to build the compiler project (after setting up the
dependencies as described in
http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Win-Compiling.html)
it fails to find a "resource.h"...not sure which resource.h it's looking
for, so I pointed it to amaya\amaya\resource.h.
But, it's dying now because COMP_ICON is undefined...

help.

Joel
