We're doing important progress in the Amaya compiling for Windows platforms.
This is already available on the CVS base and will be available in the 2.3 
release
planned for mid-december.
In the current 2.2 version you have both .mak and .dsp files and it seems that
that generates troubles.
I guess you can try to install the source, remove all .mak files and process as
explained in http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Win-Compiling.html 
Regards
  Irene.
