Hi Irene,

no need to thank.
But you forgot to tell me what is the intention behind this
message in en-libdialogue

61 Not any view is selected for printing

and the one behind the only message in *-transdialogue.
If you give me an idea of what is intended I will provide you
with the translations in time for the release.
All the best,

        Roberto
