Hello John,

Are you sure about the cache directory?
I made the change myself. Shouldn't your directory say:

>  c:/Program Files/Amaya/blahblah to 

c:\Program Files\Amaya\blahblah

If you change to "\" and it still doesn't work, 
culd you search for your thot.rc file (not the one in Amaya\config, but
elsewhere) and mail it to me?

Thanks,

-Jose
