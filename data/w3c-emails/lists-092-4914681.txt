1] also found that setting of temp directory
also refuses  spaces in folder names ;.....

2] set location of homefile directory  which home icon
   brings up nicely.....  but i cant find a way of making
   this my starting location.... each start of browser
   brings your default screen instead ...  i was able to
   start at my own home page in 2.2

3] one nice thing is that i can full screen my view window
and save the configuration now ....  this is good workaround
but windows philosophy is to AUTOMATICALLY retain this
info and not force user to save it...  but at least it
can be saved without  using editor to bit fiddle an ini file
     so i will not complain any more abt this item.....

so it boils down to folder name restrictions and bad
colors on a 256 color pallette....... 
frames is a BIG fix item so i am sure that item will
get lost
