Amaya is able to manage different documents at the same time.
Suppose I have two opened documents on my screen, the main document
A I'm working on and another B I want to refer to.
I could resize the window of the document B because I just want
it doesn't take too space on my screen. That doesn't mean that I want
to have small windows for all documents.
