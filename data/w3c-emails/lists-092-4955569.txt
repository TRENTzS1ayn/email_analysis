That depends on the current state of your computer.
If you have a set of icons displayed on your screen you 
quickly saturate the 256 color palette. Amaya has an 
algorithm to get an approximate color when it cannot obtain
the requested one. Of course the result depends on the 
current set of allocated colors. Greys are the especially
cases where the result could be the most surprising.

Frames support is not our priority.

Thanks for the report.
