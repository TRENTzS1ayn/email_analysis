Using Win 95 , i tried to select new background and foreground colors
from the palette ---- no change 
that is i went back to color setting to see
what the 'name' was for a red background
but it said light-grey   hmmmm
I notice that the click action minimizes the pallette. I then max it
  and close it and then hit apply to make it work.  
The click action should close the pallette leaving one at the dialog
where option to apply may be selected ...... 
just a function return missed i think!

Question -- can i enter a hex code value instead of a name.
if so what is the format such as #C0C0C0 ETC.
if not what is the list of 'names' allowed.
The configure.htm help file is quiet on the possibilities.
