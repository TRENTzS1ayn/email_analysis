regarding site www.bol.de:
1] it has many html 4.0 errors so amaya will of course 
    have difficulties.... most common error is unescaped &
    within hrefs.......  but there are more basic errors of
    bracketing as well
2] Even if all html repaired, Amaya will have problems because
    of nested table structure that appears to viewer as scrambled
    or overlaid tables .... upper  level has problem remembering 
    dimensions of nested tables.
3] On 256 color screens, the colored blocks come out dithered
    with dots, crosses or other markings inside instead of pure
    color intended........

on the lang="de" not recognised in <html>:
this was a bug reported for 2.2 and i think the team just missed
one function where it remained unfixed.
