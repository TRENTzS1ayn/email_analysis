I have successfully built amaya on NT.  However, I encountered two problems.


  (1) When building compilers.mak, resource.h was not in the
.../Amaya/batch directory where it was expected.  I found it in the
.../Amaya/amaya directory and moved it to the batch directory.

   (2) When compiling winthotcompilers.c, COMP_ICON was undefined.  I didn't
know where to look for the definition so I simply defined it in
winthotcompilers.c.  I added  #define COMP_ICON 1. 

At this point I was able to complete the build and execute amaya.exe.
Although I did not test it extensively, I did use the math editor, the
browser and a few other features.  All appeared to work without problems.

Should I be concerned about how I fixed the problems?  Is there a more
appropriate fix?  

Also, one last detail.  When using the .mak files under NT, I'm unable to
get them to execute recursively (when in MSVC++ I've tried rebuild all,
along with building the specific makefile, e.g., compilers.mak).  When
building compiler.mak, which is the first step in the instructions provided,
it reports the error that libthotkernel.lib doesn't exist. I have to execute
each .mak myself (libthotkernel, app, prs, etc.).  I'm new at using MSVC++
and NT and wonder if I'm missing something.
