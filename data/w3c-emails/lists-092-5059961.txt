Several things that I can't find in the docs are:

1] Specifications of minimal hardware/software to run Amaya
-- can a 386 manage it, 486 is ok but slow on color rendering.

2] Hardware required for effective use of browser
-- still hung up by your anticipating wide displays 
   and full color ---- really bad effects with 256 color

3] What file formats, mime types, and other standards
    are supported.  Docs are very quiet on non support
    of gif transparency and animation.  This should be
    explicit.
