Besides forgetting whether the main view window was full screened
or position/size of windows.... the browser also forgets some of the
checkmark settings  such as Edit -- Editor mode.......
when one unchecks it, the expectation is for it to remain unchecked
until the USER selects it again.....
However , each run of the browser sets it back to on......
Perhaps a complete review of user option and configuration 
settings saves on exit  / restore on starup is necessary....
A complete list of options that should be remembered might be
published in a doc for review so others may spot missing 
 user setting params for inclusion in next version.....
Also once this is in place, perhaps a menu item
would be needed to RESTORE DEFAULTS
so that those users who mess up badly can quickly
 get back to 'out-of-the-box'  settings........
If these configs were stored in an ascii .ini file
 similar to the windows way
then advanced users could fiddle with settings
 [after reading the docs of what the settings could be of course!]
