First of all, the --prefix given to ../configure when compiling Amaya2.2 
doesn't make its way down to libwww. The libwww Makefile gets to know where I 
store my gzip, my mkdir and lots of other "important" binaries, but somehow
the libwww/Library/src/Makefile "forgot" about prefix and just put /usr/local
there for keeps. Strange. No big deal, unless I somehow want to install libwww.

Then, I have another problem with libwww. I seem to have a broken md5 
installed in my usr/local since god-knows-when, and libwww puts
-I/usr/local/include FIRST in its include-paths. Even though my
C_INCLUDE_PATH doesn't have /usr/local, even though my prefix said
"I dont want to use /usr/local" libwww still went there to get stuff.

Of course I shouldn't have a broken/obsolete/old/different md5.h in
/usr/local/include, but I still feel that libwww that comes with it's own md5 
stuff, should not put usr/local first in the list of places to look for md5.h.

I had to edit libwww/Library/src/Makefile to NOT look into /usr/local/include 
since the error messages I got while using my old/broken/whatever md5.h were 
not quite easy to grasp. They do NOT tell you that your old md5.h is different,
it gives you all kinds of aftereffects on sources that include md5.h.
Not for the faint of heart...

So, could you please remove the redundant "/usr/local" dependency?

Having an option to use existing libz/libpng/libjpeg would also be kind of 
cool.
