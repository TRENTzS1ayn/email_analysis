Dear all,
First let me congratulate you with your excellent browser/editor. Thanks to
Amaya we were able to start 'prototype'-tagging MathML in one of products!
About the fonts:
The STIX working group is developing free fonts containing 2000 symbols for
scientific publishing. STIX is part of STIPUB, a group of leading publishers in
the field STM publishing (ACS, AIP, AMS APS, Elsevier Science and IEEE). The
goal is to get rid of all the (propriety) copyright hassles for authors and
publishers. The STIX fonts will be freely available for everybody.
I am the representative of Elsevier Science within STIX. Elsevier Science has
already started with the development of app. 900 of the 2000 fonts.
Our font developer needs input from you - that is MathML browser/editor
developers - about the best way to define the font specifications for your
'rendering machine'. At this moment we are stuck because we do not know how some
of the symbols will used in your browser/editor.
Could you please contact us ASAP.

With kind regards,
