Hi,

We would be very lucky to have free available fonts for mathematics symbols.
As you know we have two different platform families and so two different fonts
managements: one based on the X technology and one based on the Windows 
technology.
At the same time we're currently investigating the Unicode support and the GTK
interface. I guess you plan to deliver Unicode fonts?
