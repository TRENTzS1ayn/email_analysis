Hi,
?
I'm not sure what's up with those source files (I can't find them on my
installation), but try removing them from the project.

Hello again,
?
I did go back and build the project just how An specified and I'm still
getting 4 errors of unknown file locations.? I can't find these files
anywhere within the source tree and I'm not sure how to proceed from here.?
Are these file supposed to be in the original source tree?
?
