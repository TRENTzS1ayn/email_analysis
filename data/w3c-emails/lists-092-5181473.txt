Debra Jusak, Lisa Golden, Jennifer Beckham and I are working on developing
a piece of software for the Windows platform that would allow students to
complete math schoolwork on the computer.  The primary target users for
this software are students with physical disabilities who can not write
and need someone to scribe for them as they do math. 

We have decided to use an existing user interface that accepts input and
turns it into mathematical notation.  We wanted to use an application that
implemented MathML.  Amaya seemed to be a good place to start because of
its document creation and printing capabilities, and because of its open
source.  This project is introduced at
http://sloth.wcug.wwu.edu/~csnyder/scratchpad-description.html.  A paper
explaining some of the things we want our software to do is at
http://sloth.wcug.wwu.edu/~csnyder/scratchpad-examples.html.  We welcome
any comments and feedback regarding using Amaya in our project. 

I created the Scratchpad Examples document using Amaya, and have
discovered several issues that warrant addressing.  One is that when I
print the document, some of the parentheses that are part of mathematical
expressions are misplaced on the page, interfering with the text in the
document.  Jennifer Beckham has experienced this problem when viewing the
document in Amaya.  Has anyone else experienced similar problems with
Amaya, and has the problem been addressed?  Also, is Amaya going to be
able to recognize and deal with content MathML?  Is there a projected date
for this? 

We are excited for this project and are looking forward to talking to
others about our efforts. 

Thank you for your time, Carole Snyder
