Hi,

When inserting a text input or text area, then typing some text in it,
Return/Enter is prevented. But if you click on some part of the typed text,
return will suddenly work. This can cause the text input/area element to
split, and sometimes leave some out-of-place text out of the text frame
(it's not text in the document, but text inside the frame so it doesn't show
up in the struct view...). Things go bad from there. Three questions:

(1) How/where does the code stop the user from entering Return/Enter when
inside the frame?
(2) Is the problem that, when changing selection inside the frame, the code
for (1) is no longer called for checking?
(3) What's the suggested fix? :)

Thanks for any help!
-An
