Hi,

I'm observing some strange behavior with the input buttons submit and reset.
When I change the value text by editing it directly, and then press the Del
key, and then press the Left cursor key, the value text grows. And it keeps
doing this until it gets really long. Is this a known bug?

Also, can someone suggest a P file modification to make the value text
read-only; i.e., so it can only be changed via the attributes dialog but not
by direct editing of the value text?

Thanks,
-An
