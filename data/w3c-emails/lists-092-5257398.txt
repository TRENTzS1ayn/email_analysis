I don't think so

Thanks for your proposal. The first step in to create an italian copy
of dialog files. We already have:
- an English version  -> files are Amaya/config/en-*
- a French version -> files are Amaya/config/fr-*
- a partial German version -> files are Amaya/config/de-*
- a partial Turkish version -> files are Amaya/config/tr-*

Some Windows dialogues are Windows resources. For them it's
necessary to create the italian resources and to apply a little
patch to the Amaya code. We can help you for doing that or we
can do that by ourself as soon as we have previous italian dialog files.

I guess you should be interested by the two new features:
- Profiles that allows you to configure Amaya with a simpler interface.
- Templates which allows you to prototype HTML pages.
These two features are developed at the request of French teachers.
Let we know if you have specific needs.
