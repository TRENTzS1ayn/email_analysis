Good work. Your report was quite complete and I could pinpoint the bug.

The problem comes is libwww's cache functions
expect a URL like name (spaces coded as %20) and Amaya doesn't do so.
So, the space gets suppressed farther down.

I'll work on a fix tomorrow, but until this one is available, you should
avoid using spaces in the cache directory's name or in the temp directory.

Coding them as %20 won't help you now because this would create a dir name
with a %20.

I don't know if you could create a win95 alias dir on your disk and make it
point to the place you'd like to have the cache.

Sorry for the inconvenients.

-Jose
