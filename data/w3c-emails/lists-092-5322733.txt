to try to eliminate problems from previous versons or
my own setups leaking thru to testing this edition
i did a clean sweep using add/remove and then even
tossed anything closely resembling amaya stuff...
then a reinstall with latest binary which when very smoothly
however when i started, i noted that the default background
color was set to lightgrey1 --- 
however on a 256 color screen (sorry this computer only has isa 
bus and cant get another video card even though they are dirt cheap)
the screen is actually a light blue with little grey dots in it
[not as bad as the dots grey gives though]    so perhaps a better
choice of default would be white ---- or get the initial color pallette
right ----  if grey is speced in an html doc it looks ok and even the
interface itself has grey in it   but the  user background settings
just do not come out correct in 256 color mode.  sorry
