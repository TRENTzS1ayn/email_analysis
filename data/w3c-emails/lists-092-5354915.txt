A box which intersects the clipping area is rendered. In fact only the part of
box within the clipping area is displayed. If the smaller box is out of the
clipping area, it's not rendered.

Normally the clear is also limited by the clipping area. So the smaller box
should not be cleared.

I'm not sure that the work is well done, but we planned to take into account 
that
some boxes have a background to compute the right clipping area.
Did you detected a case where that happens.

That should work when the bigger box has presentation rules:
Background: color +  FillPattern: backgroundcolor
+ Showbox
