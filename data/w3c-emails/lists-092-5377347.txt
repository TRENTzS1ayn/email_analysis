Hi there,

so you can put on record that I am doing the job.
I have started writing the it-* files and I expect to have
the job done in a week or so (I believe I am roughly at 1/3
of the work now).
BTW, how can I enable the it-* files?
In the time being I have just made the en-* files be symbolic
links to my it-* files, but, of course, this is just a quick
and dirty hack ;)

Ok, I will let you have the italian dialogues at the soonest.

The I will have to translate all the documentation.  Any hint
so as to make the best possible job?

Please let me know if I need to do any paperwork in order for
my contribution to be ok as far as the licensing is concerned.

Good.  I will have a look to these new features.
I would also be interested to get in touch with the teachers you
mention.  Do they have a Web site?
All the best,
