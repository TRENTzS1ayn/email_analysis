As one of the major areas that you are now working on 
(along with CSS and internationalization) is tables, i
offer this sample file that exhibits problems with nested
tables in conjunction with css style classes.... 
The source is an old one http://www.bahnhof.se/~chimbis/tocb/links
that i downloaded and corrected html4 errors before testing....
rendering gets lost in nested tables but text is also a span
class so i dont know if it is an interrelated effect....
perhaps removal of span class may isolate error to table
but i send file now as the problem may be an interrelationship one.....
[[testing on win 95 with 256 color 640x480 display]]
I still also have some palette dithering problems with gray color
as my default and color picker issues but will leave that for present as
the tables   and css   rendering are more important issues .....
