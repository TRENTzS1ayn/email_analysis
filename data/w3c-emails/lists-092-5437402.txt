typing  http://www.amazon.com   or http://amazon.com
gives a redirection page with  a jump spot that doesnt work!!
is this a case of illegal html  -- i tried to save the page
but the file / save  area was grayed out for some reason 
 -----
trying to view source on a 640x480 screen opens the 
   source window so far off to the right you cant even
   grab on the move bar --- so only can maximize
is a port address no longer valid in an URL  as
this is only thing i can spot that may hang the jump???
