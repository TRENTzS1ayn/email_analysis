I realize that one of the many goals of the Amaya project
is to build the editor so that it will construct HTML valid code.

A real problem exists in that a valid HTML document does
   not guarantee a 'good' rendering.  In this case 'good' means
    readable text.  

I have offered a demo where tables are used with incorrect math on
   width elements.  Although this is obviously bad practice it is not
   invalid.
If this is an authoring issue, then the editor/composer tool should
protect against bad math.  Amaya does not!  I was able to create
a simple 3 col x 2 row table and then add width attributes of
50% , 25% and 40%  to the columns..... 
If it is a browser problem then the browser should back up and
render in a reasonable fashion.......  
Most browsers accept this fault as 'controllable'
I suggest that Amaya lead the way and show that editing tools
can prevent the error from happening in the first place......
Spelling, Grammar, and Math are common failings of the creative
   people who are web designers..... that is why tools more powerful
   than ascii editors are used.  Amaya already has solid mechanisms 
for spelling (multiple language dictionaries) and grammar (html
 enforcement) so why not math checking........
Personnally I avoid width setting as much as possible to allow 
for display window flexibility   but there are those that use it
and it is legal  so  the math must either be checked  or tolerated
  --- which is it to be...
