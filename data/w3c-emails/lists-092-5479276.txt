After worrying about math, and then testing, i find that amaya
can cope with image widths adding to more than 100% without
problem ... but i have found where my demo file illustrates tables
getting messed badly ...... 
tabdemo.htm is a simple three column two row table with bad math
and a very narrow middle column .... with straight text in each column
there was no problem with rendering ... Amaya just used its own 
rather than width setting ....  however it all fell to pieces when i chose
to put a dl in the center column. offsets required by dt elements are
not provided for in the preceding table column settings and text bleeds
thru to next column instead of wrapping ....  this is a bug for sure.
I suspect when the demo file is viewed with lots of pixels say 800x600
there will be little if any problem but on a 640x480 screen there is 
strong overrun of the data term into the third column clobbering
existing text there.
