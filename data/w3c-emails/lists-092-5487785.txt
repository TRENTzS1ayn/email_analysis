while using structure view and source view in developing 
my demo table with deliberately bad math, i noticed that
opening this view windows occurs off to the right side of
the work area.  I dont know about the 800x600 screens 
but i suspect the windows are in good spot on them but
on a 640x480 screen these windows open so far off to the right
that i cant even grab the window top to drag it on screen.
the geometry manager should check for the screen window
size and adjust the positioning of these new windows appropriately.
they need not be fully on screen but enough of them (say 100 
pixels should be there for drag purposes.... and a method of
user defining where they open would be ideal......
Just a not tested with this hardware situation i think.
