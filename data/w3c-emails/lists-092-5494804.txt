Another situation of not tested on hardware xyz
is the windows 9x version on a 256 color device.
In preferences - color there is a color picker or palette option
Within this option on top line of swatches are several gray 
patterns ..... if i right click to select , instead of the
selection showing in my color selections box, the picker
has gone to minimized ... i must max it and select done
for the name to show up in the dialog box --- that is bug number one
 it should not min the picker  but exit it and set the dialog box 
appropriately as if done had been clicked......
then to check i request a new file to work on  but the color
is not rendered correctly but with dots ..... but the swatch of
color that it was picked from is correctly displayed so my
video driver and crt are capable of showing the color but not 
the gui......    if i read a file that has that color selected as
its background either with stylesheet or bgcolor   it is also
correctly displayed.... that is bug number two .....  each 
hampers the use of Amaya as an editor because they restrict my
designing screens with battleship grey or silver backdrops.....
some may question my artistic choices  but that isnt the point....
if a color is on the palette, then it should be selectable,  and conveniently
  without mining/maxing/done on the picker screen.....

so three big errors    [1]tables , [2] window positions, [3] color picker
that i am seeing because of 640x480 and 256 colors that other windows
testers may be missing .... hope someone can duplicate errors 
 then isolate to code area  for later fixing ......
