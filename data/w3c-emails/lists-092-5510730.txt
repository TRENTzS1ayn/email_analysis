It looks like Amaya 3.0 outputs "&" as a form parameter separator.  It 
should use ";".

To see for yourself, try this chunk of HTML in Amaya:
<html>
<head>
</head>
<body>
<FORM METHOD="GET" ACTION="http://www.w3.org/">
Cheezy:
<INPUT CHECKED TYPE="checkbox" NAME="cheezy">
Creamy:
<INPUT CHECKED TYPE="checkbox" NAME="creamy">
<INPUT TYPE="submit">
</FORM>
</body>
</html>

Hit submit.  Note the resulting URL:
http://www.w3.org/?cheezy=on&creamy=on

Netscape, IE, and Amaya generate URLs with an ampersand form field
delimiter, and every CGI library that I know of uses ampersand as the
preferred delimiter.

However, the HTML 4.0 spec says that semicolon is the way to do this:

http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/interact/forms.html#form-content-type
http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/appendix/notes.html#ampersands-in-uris

Someone needs to take the lead here and implement semicolon as the 
preferred separator.  It seems that Amaya, being a W3C reference 
implementation, is the best candidate.  That will hopefully, in turn, cause 
the CGI libraries out there to start implementing semicolon as an alternate 
separator.

Thoughts?
