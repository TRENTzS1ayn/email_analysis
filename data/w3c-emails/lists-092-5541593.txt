I started a new document with file -- new  menu selection
it gave an url that was on my web site ....
i reset the address to file:\temp\temp.htm
and tried to save ... but it still wanted to save to web site url
but couldnt because i havent enabled upload from amaya....
i then tried to save as    but it defaulted to url agn
and i had to retype the file address.....
this is a bug !!!   windows 95 platform .....
