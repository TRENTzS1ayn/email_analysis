my website is temporarily off-air
but amaya is set to start on its home page
--- it times out ok and i requested www.w3.org
loaded aok but when i press  ( and dont ask me why )
  the right arrow   --- screen goes to black
   then left arrow --- wink  still black
   then up arrow --- wink  still black
   then down arrow  ---- oops it continues to scroll
     merrily down the page and cant be broken out of except
     with the three finger salute ... 
can others duplicate or is this instability only because the 
initial page was off air and timed out ????
windows 95 platform and version 3.0
