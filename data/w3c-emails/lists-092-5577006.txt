http://kahn.neta.com/~cherry/mathml/
starts my screen flashing with the index page 
for a series of mathml examples... the flashing
eventually stops..... 
could it be that a 486-100mhz computer is no longer
a supported platform.... does your system require 
 heavy duty processor ??? 
but once one reaches the examples they are rendered
much more reliably that eLite .... and i havent found
  any other browsers that cope with mathml at all...
just wondering if this effect happens to others (or perhaps
all testers have super-duper workstations)
