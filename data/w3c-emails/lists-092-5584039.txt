I am working my way thru configure.html, and trying to 
clarify how document reads to newer users of Amaya...

In the keyboard preferences area (and looking at amaya.kb)
1] What are the default settings established internally by Amaya
2] Does setting a new mapping in amaya.kb override defaults of above
3] What is syntax for page up key   as i assume up is up arrow
4] What is an L6 key ????
