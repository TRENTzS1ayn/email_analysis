Not all keyboards are standard qwerty so these 
questions come up:
1] is there a way to refer to individual key's reporting number 
   so that a name like End is not needed
2] if this capability exists, is there also a utility program
    that can be run by a user to find the key reporting number
    so he can add a mapping to amaya.kb   
This would allow users of extended keyboards to take over
    the tailoring issue rather than having to make requests
    for xyz to be added to Amaya.
Some of this may already exist ... please enlighten me
and i can alter configure.html  to help others .... thanks
