To aid in internationalization of Amaya --- on the 
preferences -- general menu either the dialog box
   should repoint the documents pointer or another
 entry box should be provided to select different 
directories  for the help files to have parallel copies
 in each supported language.  For example 
[whatever]/docs/en   would have the existing
        /docs/it   would have italian versions etc....
personally i think the existing dialog entry should
select the subdirectory as well as the alternate
   menu item wordings.....
