Because new windows open off to right side too far in windows
version on 640x480 screen, i tried to resize the source view window
and save it ....... 
resized ok ......
when calling preference/geom manager, the view source window
 disappears --- this is bad
i continued to do the save operation and then  did a view source
  it opened to where i had positioned it ok    BUT
if i shut down amaya and restarted , the sizing/positioning
was gone !!!!    so the save really didnt happen.

so two  errors already  ... and i believe an even better approach
than having to save last settings, is to have latency built in
as other programs do .... any sizing/positioning should be
AUTOMATICALLY SAVED including maxed/mined mode .....
and menu item only to restore to default values if settings
really fouled up.   Also if one knew where the settings where 
kept (and it was in help docs), then a crude fix or positioning
could be made by many.  

this is in addition to the default positioning  acknowledging
screen size settings  that i brought up previously.
