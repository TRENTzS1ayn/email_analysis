certain hypertext jumps open a second html window.....
calling help opens a second html window
however the geometry manager cant save any changes in
size or position of this second window .....
how can one choose the way he sizes - positions  help
    and make it remember ......
once again knowledge of where this is filed would help
as would a 'latent effect' concept  be more predictable
and fit in with learned knowledge of how windows programs
are supposed to act......
