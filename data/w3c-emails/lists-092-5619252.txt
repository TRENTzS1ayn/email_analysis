I just noticed that another group of files is
setup with xx- prefixes to indicate language 
this is a good method as well but i favor 
folders as that tends to keep number of files 
per folder controllable and it is easy to spot 
a missing parallel file as each folder should
contain the same number of documents....
whichever method is used it should be the 
same for both dialogs and docs (and other
    files that are in parallel languages)......
and it may be time to ask for volunteers to
work on translating documentation to other
supported languages .... now there is a task
  for one who is more wordsmith than codesmith.
