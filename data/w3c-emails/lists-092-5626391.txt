I have added a Home function in my local version, but it didn't recompile
cleanly, (Jose cleaned things out until it did) and I have only updated my
English dialogues (I am not sure what the expression is in other languages).

the change is pretty simple. The diff is
cvs diff EDITOR.A

30a31
>     view:1 File button:BHome -> GoToHome;  

And adding the Home command before Save in the xx-amayadialogue files in
config
