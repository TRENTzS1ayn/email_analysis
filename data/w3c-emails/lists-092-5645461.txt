this version (3.0) doesnt seem to do floating images yet ...
this is a long overdo item as it was even around in html 3.2
and is part of 4.0

is there a web page that logs   bugs 
as to reported by _ on _
      / verified by _ on _
      / working on by _  on _
      / in CVS as of _______
this page would help those of us reporting bugs to verify
what others are seeing and then once someone is actively
working on it we can provide test cases or extra symtoms
and can see that there is progress being made....
those of us without cvs compile can at least be assured that
fixes are coming in the next version ..... 
method doesnt have to be as convoluted as mozilla  but 
some feedback tracking is necessary .... i am not even
getting responses to some simple queries from early last week....
