just used amaya 3.1 to access
http://www.neta.com/~cherry/mathml/
and does my screen ever strobe on that page ---
pulses for about a minute and then is ready for mousing
clicking on ppex.html  brought a very nice mathml presentation
except for indices very hard to read on eqns 5 and 6 ....
but good news is that zooming twice made them readable....
so zoom is aok .... strange marks at end of line  between eqns
   10 and 11   as well as 13 and 14     but these could be revision
  indicators   [normally on left margin ]
