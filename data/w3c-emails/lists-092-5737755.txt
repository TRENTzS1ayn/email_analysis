Hi all,
We have the first large subset of scientific fonts available. This set will be
extended to some 2000 characters. The work is done under responsibility of STIX
(an initiative of STIPUB, which is a group of mayor commercial and
non-commercial publishers, see http://www.ams.org/STIX/). The STIX fonts are and
will always remain COMPLETELY free. Only if you change them, you should name
them otherwise.
This set is large enough to do some serious editing, viewing and testing.

To make the (complete) set widely usable, we need YOUR COMMENTS, so that we can
adjust things before we release the final version!
So, if you want to use the final set of 2000 characters in your application,
please implement and test them extensively now and send us your comments or
questions.

Please find the fonts and explanation in the attachment.

With kind regards,
