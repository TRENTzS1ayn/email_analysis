This is a side-effect of a valuable feature. To save time when
downloading a Web page through a slow connection, Amaya displays
the document as soon as the text is available, before receiving
any image. Then, when an image has been completely loaded, it
is displayed, and this may need some reformatting, especially
when the <IMG> element in the HTML source does not specify the
expected size of the image through attributes height and width.
The document you mention is a directory, with an image in each
line. In addition these images have no attributes and they are
higher than the text of the following line. So, the document get
reformatted and redisplayed each time an image is received.

A possible fix would be to set attributes width and height for
each image. As this page is generated by the server, the change
should be done on the server side. Unfortunately that's not
something the amaya team can do.

These strange marks are in fact empty <mtd> elements. These elements
are generated by Amaya, following the MathML 2.0 specification:

   http://www.w3.org/TR/MathML2/chapter3.html#N14513
   "Table rows that have fewer columns than other rows of the same
   table (whether the other rows precede or follow them) are effectively
   padded on the right with empty mtd elements so that the number of
   columns in each row equals the maximum number of columns in any row
   of the table."

Equation 11 is in fact a MathML table <mtable> and its first row
has only 2 <mtd> elements whereas its second row has 3 <mtd>.
Amaya adds a third <mtd> in the first row and displays it like
any empty element as a grey rectangle.  These grey rectangles are
needed to show the structure of any new expression built when creating
or editing an equation. The author can then see what has been created
and what content has to be provided.

We could consider displaying the empty <mtd> generated to balance rows
in a different way, or not displaying them at all. But this may be a
problem when editing a table. Any suggestion?
