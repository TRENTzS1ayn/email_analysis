Hi,

I tried to compile the latest amaya using MSVC++6.0 on a Win98 machine. The 
compiler.exe was sucessfully created albeit with several warnings. The 
compilation of amaya.exe proceeded smoothly until a fatal error was 
reported:
linking error:
cl.exe cannot load Plugins.lib
and compilation died.

I opened Plugins.lib and noticed it was an empty file.

How did Plugins.lib came about? Does it comes together with the .tar file or 
was it a result of creating compiler.exe?

Please enlighten this puzzled sole. Many thanks in advance.

-Ken Mar
