Wim,

Many thanks for sending us the Esstix fonts. I am impressed. They contain
a lot of characters already. So, we decided to make an experiment with
these fonts in Amaya. We have made a new release two days ago and another
one is scheduled by mid-May for the bi-annual W3C meeting. You can then
understand that our current schedule is very tight. Therefore we can't
make any commitement about supporting the Esstix fonts in the next release,
but we will try, at least as a demo.

Please keep us informed of any progress you will make.

Vincent.
