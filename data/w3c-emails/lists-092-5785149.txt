Good news -- the taxman let me keep enough money
 to buy a pentium ......

Several issues that i have been mentioning cleared up

1] colors work ok if in tu-color mode
2] gifs look more attractive
3] position of windows are ok for 800x600 screen
4] cherry's site with multiple copies of icon that 
    doesnt agree with amaya default  redraws quickly
    enough to tolerate......
5] Scrolling glitches are hidden by speed of the machine

So the developers can have choices now .......
1] Improve performance of display and program for
   older stuff like 256 colors and  640x480 windows
2] Change the baseline specification for hardware
   and require a Pentium 
Personally I think option two is a copout but with
   limited resources you may choose to work on
   advanced features and internationalization issues
   like getting ALL keyboards up and running....

Some issues still exist though and the most vexing
one is that the color picker terminates oddly on the
right or left click selector ..... instead of either 
doing the update and exiting from the preference
menu completely .... or returning to the dialog box
indicating the choice and allowing it to be APPLIED
 (my choice)   it simply minimizes it. one then has
to restore it and select exit to get back to the
dialog box ..... real kludgy .......
