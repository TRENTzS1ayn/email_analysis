Some areas that are still causing problems within Amaya 3.2.1
(July 11, 2000) from my viewpoint [Windows 95 and display limited
to 640x480 @ 256 color] are as follows (arranged editor issues first):

Startup Sequence
1] The toolbar with the STOP icon should be displayed and enabled
   earlier in the startup sequence.  At present, if one has a startup
   or home page on the internet and there is a service problem, there
   are situations where the display hangs up searching for a site but
   with no STOP or 'breakout' method available.
   TEST: by removing cable connection and starting browser with home
   page on the internet.

Table Display
2] If a table has no height= attribute, the height is computed
   by the browser. If a table declares height=   then ????
   Most browsers will check 'set' value against needed and use
   the maximum of the two.
   Amaya uses the height setting to be consistent with the img
   height attribute which normally scales image to the speced height
   but this leaves problems if speced less than needed TEXT.
   If there is no spec on how to handle this conflict,  it is easy
   enough to err in favor of the user by:
a] setting height to default value
b] resetting height if height= attribute used
c] computing what is needed to prevent outside of border material
   (this routine is already there for no height speced)
d] comparing needed to height 
e] using the maximum of the two values  NEEDED and HEIGHT
   This routine would work whether or not height was speced.  
   and would prevent out of box messages in most cases!
   TEST: by using sample file amdemo3.htm provided by mail.

3] Table borders are thin lines which can be covered up by the
   cell contents.
   TEST: by viewing 'http://www.cgocable.net/~jrussel/color16.htm'
4] Tables become confused if stacked more than two levels down.
   TEST: by viewing 'http://www.bahnhof.se/~chimbis/tocb/links'
   where text is printed outside their associated box.
5] Errors in math during table construction that are editor
   detectable, should be flagged to user.

Other Display Problems
6]  The move one page up/down scroll selection may not be adapting
    to screen size.  This is most noticable in the Show Source
    window.  For 800x600 main window, this results in jumps that do
    not retain one line of last screen (for continuity) and even
    more extreme, for 640x480 main window, lines are skipped entirely
    when paging action selected.  Algorithm must take into account the
    number of lines displayed! I didnt check horizontal scroll but
    this may have similar problem.
7]  After scrolling to bottom of document, scrolling up to top
    overscrolls on many docs.  Examples of this are 
    'http://www.cgocable.net/~jrussel/netacces.htm' and
    'http://www.cgocable.net/~jrussel/mathsci.htm'
    And scrolling down overscrolls on some documents such as
    'http://www.cgocable.net/~jrussel/home.htm'
    This is with a jpg image background that doesn't go completely to
    top or bottom of screen.
8]  The scroll bars can't be pulled to the very bottom or right edge.
    No information is lost but this is untidy.
9]  Horizontal rules have a hook on the left edge. Either the rule
    isn't being drawn to the correct thickness or first character
    isn't in correct proportion to rest of rule.
10] The default img size is too small. This results in unnecesary
    screen redraws on common screens like 'http://www.w3.org/History'
    which uses icons on each line that is a file.  
11] Images are not floated correctly although this is part of
    HTML 4.0 specification.
12] Image elements placed directly after a header element closer
    do not align correctly with margin settings.

Color Selection
13] Many color-picker selected colors do not look like the ones
    displayed in the picker swatches. This is 256 color mode related!!
  
Compose Multi-key function
14] Creating a soft hyphen adds a &173; to the document which
    will not pass some validators.  Should use &shy; instead.

Documentation
15] Standard shortcut nomenclature should be used in menus.
    For example Alt + P  instead of Alt p    and
    Ctrl + Enter  instead of Ctrl Return

Address dialog
16] Currently  www.w3.org  will not get a page from the web
    but \temp\foobar.htm will get one from local drive.
    Either the default mode should be switched around so that
    http: is assumed (to coincide with other browsers) or that
    the service MUST BE declared (which is Amaya like solution).
