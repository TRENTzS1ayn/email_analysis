Found a nice site that demonstrates two small rendering problems
the site is http://www.geocities.com/tmason1
and is a geneological hobby site with clean layout
unfortunately two things that display well in other browsers
do not do so well in Amaya. Looks like little slips......

1] when the text is center justified, list bullets remain unjustified
and appear at extreme left although the text portion is centered.

2] blocks of white appear around <font size="-1"> blah blah </font>
instead of acknowledging the background color setting.
Yes i know <font> is deprecated and there are better ways of
  obtaining the same effect (read as 'I wouldnt do this')  but it
 is legal and others do use it in their design  so browsers should
 be able to handle.

I think these two thinks may only need small tweaks so i thought
they may be nice 'easing back to work after the holidays' type of
 activity.....      welcome back
