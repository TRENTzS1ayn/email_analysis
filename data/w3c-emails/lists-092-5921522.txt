I have been using a A:an  pseudo element
setup in my .css file to control the appearance of 
the anchor element a name=foobar  
but i just ran stylesheet thru validator and it complained
that :an is not permitted.
also both spec on css1 and css2 say nil......
if this is true , how do i control appearance of anchors ????
