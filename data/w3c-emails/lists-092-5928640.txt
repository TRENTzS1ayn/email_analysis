In CSS2 you use a[name] as your selector (any a element with a name
attribute.

In CSS1 you have to additionally add a class to the anchor in order to select
it. (That will also work in css2, but it is a slightly bulkier approach -
bring on good-qwuality implementations!! ;-0

  also both spec on css1 and css2 say nil......
  if this is true , how do i control appearance of anchors ????
