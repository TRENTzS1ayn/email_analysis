found a site which causes Amaya to hang up!
although the site doesnt verify and code is real ugly
 Amaya should not hang up!.  It should abandon 
  site as unreasonable code   or timeout  somehow...
A nice touch would be an error message saying 
  site was stinko and webdiva should be notified!

Amaya cant correct or accomodate bad design but it 
should be able to cope by abandonment rather than choking!

see http://www.themysterybox.com/hmas  for example.

Published authors are not technophils so their attempts
at websites give me lots of examples that break down on
various browsers.   for example www.mcneilbooks.com
displayed ok on netscape 4 but messes up on netscape 6
(not as badly as on Amaya though).
