The URL http://www.w3.org/Amaya/  demonstrates 
some problems i am seeing in win98 binary version.

The sidebar title areas are not aligned to middle as source specs
could it be that align='center' is meant??? or does middle mean vertical 
justification???
the problem may be because of the included icons but it causes
 line wrap where unnecessary and bad centering.

Quirky author slip  <span>Hom</span><span>e</span> 
where colors are same for both spans !!!
