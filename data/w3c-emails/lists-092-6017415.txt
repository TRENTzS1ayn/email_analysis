Hi,

I configure an Apache server to send a special mime.types when serving
files with a special extension :
myfile.dchtml is served with "application/amaya" mime.type

myfile.dchtml are in fact generated html files.

The goal is to tell every client to launch Amaya when this type of document
is requested. It works. Because Amaya does not know this special mime.type,
the document is opened in text mode. Is there a way to let Amaya know that
these document are in fact HTML documents ? 

Thanks.

Best regards,
Catherine.
