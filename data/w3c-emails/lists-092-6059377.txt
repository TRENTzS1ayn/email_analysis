Thanks Ir?ne. But all these extensions may already be defined and used by
other applications. That's why I was thinking of defining a specific
combination of mime type and extension. 

So I patch Amaya code to add a new extension and tell Amaya that files
having this extension have to be treated as HTML. To do that I :

- open AHTURLTools.c
- search for the IsHTMLName function 
- add the new extension among 
         if (!ustrcmp (nsuffix, TEXT("html")) ||
             !ustrcmp (nsuffix, TEXT("htm")) ||
             !ustrcmp (nsuffix, TEXT("shtml")) ||
             !ustrcmp (nsuffix, TEXT("jsp")) ||
             !ustrcmp (nsuffix, TEXT("xht")) ||
             !ustrcmp (nsuffix, TEXT("xhtm")) ||
             !ustrcmp (nsuffix, TEXT("xhtml")))
            return (TRUE);
- compile and build


There are more and more applications which are defining their own
extensions to treat special html files. I am thinking for example of .asp,
.php, .dwt (dreamweaver HTML templates files)... So having a ressource file
to define that in Amaya without recompiling would be useful.

Thanks to think about it.
Best regards,
Catherine.
