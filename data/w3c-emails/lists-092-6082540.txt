All in all it is better if you can use HTTP to give you a content-type for
the file (and if you can specify one with new documents). Then the suffix is
not so important. The other problem with suffixes is that there are clashes -
Some RealMedia files and most RPM packages use the extension .rpm so it is
only possible to find out what they are from getting a content-type. And
beause the Macintosh OS has always included a content type (of
sorts) Macintosh users typically do not bother to use any extension since
they don't need one.

  Thanks Ir?ne. But all these extensions may already be defined and used by
  other applications. That's why I was thinking of defining a specific
  combination of mime type and extension. 
  
  So I patch Amaya code to add a new extension and tell Amaya that files
  having this extension have to be treated as HTML. To do that I :
  
  - open AHTURLTools.c
  - search for the IsHTMLName function 
  - add the new extension among 
           if (!ustrcmp (nsuffix, TEXT("html")) ||
               !ustrcmp (nsuffix, TEXT("htm")) ||
               !ustrcmp (nsuffix, TEXT("shtml")) ||
               !ustrcmp (nsuffix, TEXT("jsp")) ||
               !ustrcmp (nsuffix, TEXT("xht")) ||
               !ustrcmp (nsuffix, TEXT("xhtm")) ||
               !ustrcmp (nsuffix, TEXT("xhtml")))
              return (TRUE);
  - compile and build
  
  
  There are more and more applications which are defining their own
  extensions to treat special html files. I am thinking for example of .asp,
  .php, .dwt (dreamweaver HTML templates files)... So having a ressource file
  to define that in Amaya without recompiling would be useful.
  
  Thanks to think about it.
  Best regards,
  Catherine.
