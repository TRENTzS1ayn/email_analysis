the site http://www.geocities.com/tmason1
has a 'hits counter' at the bottom of the page.
But it does not display correctly using Amaya.

If the page (and images) are saved using Amaya
  the offline version does not show counter  correctly
   using Amaya  or MSIE

If the page (and images) are saved using MSIE
  the offline version DOES show counter correctly
   using Amaya and MSIE

the weird part is that Amaya can handle the counter
    but only if offline doc was saved by MSIE

i suspect that downloading to amaya from the net 
  transforms the file differently   than downloading 
  from a local source     hence the ability to view
 locally if not transformed (msie save)
   but even MSIE cant deal with the transform from net!
Bizarre but small potatoes in the scheme of things i suspect
