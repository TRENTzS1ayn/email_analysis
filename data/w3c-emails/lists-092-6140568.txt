Hello,

 Just a remark which would have helped me a lot !
 
 Could you set the ?compile Amaya? links at the end of the page 

   http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/cvs.html 

to 

   http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Autoconf.html 

instead of

   http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/SourceDist.html#Installing

which leads to almost nowhere.

 In the same time an INSTALL file would be nice. Something like the
last paragraph of the README.amaya file (How to compile Amaya Source
Release) should be enougth.


Thanks,

Olivier.
