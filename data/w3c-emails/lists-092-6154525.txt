Most browsers handle unbreakable strings that are wider than
the window by forcing a horizontal scroll and providing the horscrollbar
at that time.

Amaya chooses to break the word (with an added hyphen but not
 always at the grammatically correct point). This sometimes leads to
very unusual columns in tables and negates the concept of 
unbreakability.  Is there any specification on how to handle this
situation or is one of those 'let each do their own thing' which makes 
it ver interesting for html and web page authors.

And I notice that Amaya has a horizontal bar (with that quirky cant
get to the end feature) even when it doesn't need it.  Is this a 
design decision to ease the pain of deciding when needed and doing
 a recalculation during redisplay. On other programs, i use the 
appearence of the horiz scroll as a clue to wide material.
