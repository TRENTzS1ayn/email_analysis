Hi there peeps,

I found out an interesting tidbit about IE the other day, thought you might
like to know.

It's really easy to get Amaya to appear on the IE edit button AND to get IE
to pass proper URLs to it so that you can use IE for surfing and Amaya for
editing. Simply enter the following into the registry.

If someone would like to add this to the windoze installer program, everyone
could use it...

Cheers

Geoff

REGEDIT4

; integrate Amaya with Micro$oft Internet Explorer for editing
; any other PUT capable editor presumably will work the same way

; add amaya to IE edit button list; with IE4 it has only one choice, that
; which is registered to edit .htm files
; edit path below to where amaya is installed...
[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.htm\OpenWithList\Amaya\shell\edit\command]
@="C:\\Program Files\\Amaya\\windows\\bin\\Amaya.exe \"%1\""

; tell IE / Windows Shell to send proper URLs to it rather than the filename
in
; the windows "Temporary Internet Files" directory
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\App
Paths\amaya.exe]
"useURL"="yes"
