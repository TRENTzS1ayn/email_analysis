Hi,

 Does anyone work on XML for Amaya ? I've seen that there is a parser and
an XML2thot program but it doesn't seem that is it possible to give to
Amaya an XML file with the correct XSL file to get an HTML page. 

 Since Amaya (and Thot) understand HTML, would it be a lot of work
to have an automatic translation of an XSL file which give HTML to a 
Thot presentation file. If yes, what about parsing the XML file to
put it in the Thot tree and then using the XSL file (which then should 
be translated to a Thot translate file) to get an HTML file ?

Olivier.
