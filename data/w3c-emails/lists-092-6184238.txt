I am unable to compile Amaya.  I'm using MS Dev Studio 6.0 SP3 on a
Windows 2000 machine.  I've followed the instructions at
http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Win-Compiling.html for building using
*.dsp files, but I get the following error:

NMAKE : fatal error U1052: file 'cpp.mak' not found

This makes sense because the only make files included in the source at
http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/SourceDist.html are headers.mak and
libgcc.mak.  I think this distribution is missing required make files.
If so, can someone provide them?  Thanks.
