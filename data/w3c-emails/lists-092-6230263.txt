The reason for my linking error is that "Compilers.mak" needs to
include "comctl32.lib" in its LINK32_FLAGS line.

I've also discovered that "libpng.mak" "libwww.mak" have hardcoded
absolute CDs (change directory commands) to
"\users\guetari\Amaya\Windows\zlib" and "thotprinter.mak" and
"amaya.mak" have several hardcoded absolute and otherwise incorrect
CDs and paths as well.

But I was eventually able to get Amaya compiled and running.
