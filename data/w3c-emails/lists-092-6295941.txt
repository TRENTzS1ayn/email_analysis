At one time there was a list of 140 named colors that the
major browsers both suported.  But these color names 
have been omitted from HTML spec and only basic 16 defined.

Amaya renders some but not all of these 140 colors.  Would
it not be more consistant to either:
1] remove support for any but the basic 16 - everything
    else to be speced in geek HEXCODE    or
2] complete the support for all 140 of the colors for backwards
   support of pages.

Personally, I am in favour of #1, dropping any but the basic 16
as this would shrink the size of the browser as well as promote
following the standard as much as possible ....  and 
consistancy of rendering would be improved ....

either no support  or complete support of the named colors
but haphazard support  should not occur.
