I'm currently developping a small application (webwader) for checking
web sites : it sends the url of the pages to verify to a browser
which takes care of the display.
For this feature to work the browser must be able to receive information
from other applications. For instance, on Unix, Netscape has
the option "-remote openURL()"; under Win32 , DDE can be used to implement
communication.

As far as Amaya is concerned nothing was available, so I've added a
server functionnality to the Motif-Unix version. It is a very
simplistic implementation based on XtAppAddInput(), the new input
being a socket. When a string (the url to show) arrives through
the socket CallbackDialogue is called and the page is displayed.
It is a very, very limited implementation but it works : a list
of html pages can be rapidly and automatically visualized by Amaya.

A more sophiticated implementation could be interesting. I'm thinking about
Xml-Rpc or SOAP. Is it realistic to expect such a development from
the Amaya team ?
