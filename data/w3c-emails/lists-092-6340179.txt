Although blink is an annoying ?feature? to be avoided as much as 
possible it did become part of CSS1.  So it should be supported
by browsers claiming CSS1 compatibility.  But Amaya , like
microsoft doesnt support text-decoration: blink.  Is this going
to be fixed in future versions to try to get full CSS1 support.
Web site authors are reluctant to adopt CSS1 because 
implementation is so spotty even four years after adoption.
