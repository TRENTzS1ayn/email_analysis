 I have heard that another step is being taken at end of year
or early january.  I hope that it will COMPLETE the implementation
of HTML 4. and CSS1  as well as progressing on newer specs.

It is important that these older specs are finished off to demonstrate
Amaya's abilities in rendering valid sites in a reasonable manner.
There is no expectation on invalid sites but those sites that are
conformant and are rendered badly are still far too frequent. 
This is discouraging when trying to promote Amaya to the 
 'unwashed'  ;-] ;-] 

Seasons greetings from Canada (Santa's Home) and 
a happy and prosperous News Year's to all.
