> 
> 1: Various people have had problems with the

> 2: What (if any) are the inherent limitations of the
> Windows-NT release, compared with a Unix version? I
> think I read somewhere that the Thot implementation

> NT is limited. Can someone tell me the implications

> 3: I understand and appreciate the "mostly
> authoring,

> 
> 4: Is the plugin architecture unavailable on NT? If
> so, how do you suggest adding additional data

> 5: I understand there's going be another release
