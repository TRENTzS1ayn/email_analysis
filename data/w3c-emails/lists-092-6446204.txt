Reported problems were due of missing files in the distribution and was fixed 
in following releases.
For the rest you have to follow instructions in the "Windows compiling 
section" page.

Thot is another application based on the same library as Amaya. It's a generic 
application able to handle an unlimited list of document types. The limitation 
of the Thot implementation on Windows platforms compared to the Unix version 
concerns only dialogues. Windows dialogues must be based on resource 
descriptions and that doesn't let Thot handles generic dialogues on these 
platforms.

We (the Amaya team) don't plan to provide a support for java applets and 
javascript, but external contributors may provide them.

On all platforms the plugin architecture is unavailable.
I guess a general mechanism should be added to allow connections of Amaya with 
other applications.

The new relase is now available. It only provides improvement of existing 
features
