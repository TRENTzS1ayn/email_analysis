Amaya doesn't support positioning of boxes yet. (MSIE and Netscape did, but
MSIE 5 for the Macintosh doesn't handle float anymore - my personal
favourite. <sigh/>)

I think the footer has a problem because it says where the bottom of it is
but doesn't say what should be the top of the footer, so ther is no reason
for it not to have 0 height (this is just at first glance).

cheers

  This bit of CSS2 does not make sidebar in Amaya although
  it does in msie5 and net6.  But the footer has problems in
  msie & netscape so i guess everyone is struggling with
   boxs.  colors are only there to distinguish blocks of text.
  Anyone have ideas on why it doesnt work  and/or
  better ways of doing sidebar .... my main page
   does things with tables which is nicer when sidebar
  ength mismatches page content.

  #header  {position:absolute; width:100%; color:blue}
  #sidebar {position:absolute; top:15%; left:0; color:green}
  #main    {position:absolute; top:15%; left:10em; color:aqua}
  #footer  {position:absolute; width:100%; bottom:0; color:red}
