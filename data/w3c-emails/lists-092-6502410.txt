I heard that the W3C uses Amaya and Jigsaw for development of the software
(perhaps in relation with CVS?) using the new PUT protocol.  How is
authentication handled for a large code base, are there any add on packages
to the PUT indexer in Jigsaw that perhaps allow for e-mail messaging or
other forms of communication?  Is there a CVS backend?

Curiously interested,
David
