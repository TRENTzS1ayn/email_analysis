Hi,

I'm playing around with some of the Amaya functions to insert different HTML
elements into a table cell. Sometimes, after insertion of these elements
inside a table cell, the table cell width is not updated properly. Should I
be calling some kind of an update function after manually inserting these
elements, to force the table to resize and redraw?

Thanks,
An
