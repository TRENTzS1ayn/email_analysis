Hi,

I want to add a dialogue that allows the user to change the Title from the
Types menu instead of having it in the main view.  The docs don't really
mention the actual coding process very well, any pointers on this?  Do I
want to use a MSVC++ resource dialog or have Amaya create one?

Thanks for any help,
David
