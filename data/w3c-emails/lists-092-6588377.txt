How would I add the palette of Greek alphabet letters to the menu bar?
Meaning under Types, have something like Types->Math->Greek Alphabet and
that would open up the palette.  Can I just add something in editor.A that
maps to the function CreateGreekKeyboardDlgWindow ?

Thanks for any help,

David
