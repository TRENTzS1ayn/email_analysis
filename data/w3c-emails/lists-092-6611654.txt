Hi. Does Amaya support any CSS2 positioning directives?

I would *really* like to develop web pages using CSS on my Linux machine.

Is there *any* browser with a decent level of support for CSS positioning
for Linux? I've been trying the Mozilla builds, but they're still
pre-alpha in terms of quality.....
