I was taught that end of sentence was followed by two spaces...
Ordinary HTML reduces spacing to single space.
Hopefully there is a stylesheet solution  but I have yet to
find it... I thought white-space: pre was the way  but by  
definition this uses the preformatted methods of html which
would include source file carriage returns....... but i want 
wrapping to be done according to page width/ type size
as normal html is done ..... there is a nowrap option which
is even worse .... they should have included a : wrap or : auto
to cover this ..... Does anyone have a solution other than
adding &nbsp;  entities after each punc
