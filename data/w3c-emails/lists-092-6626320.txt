Hi,

I entered 2 HRs, then a paragraph. In the main view, when pressing the UP
cursor key from the P, the first HR is selected, not the 2nd one. But in the
structure view, it appears to work properly and selects the 2nd HR.

Also, after moving up, you can no longer move down from the 2nd HR back to
the P. Doesn't seem to be a problem when there is only one HR.

I'm using 2.4.

Thanks,
An
