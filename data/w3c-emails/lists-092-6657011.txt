Where is this \ generated?  It seems like it would be easy to change, no?

There was a bug in the Windows 2.4 version. Amaya generated always a \ even

If you call InitDocView (CurrentDocument, ....) instead of InitDocView (0,

in the function InitializeNewDoc, it should display the new document in the
same window.
