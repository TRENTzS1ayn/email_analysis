New.html comes from the global variable DocumentName. This variable is
intialized in Amaya\amaya\init.c and you can change its intial 
value by whatever you want.

I'm not sure that I understood well your question but you may have a new
window if
you asked for or if the current document is modified. Otherwise and
exept for
Help, new docs are displyed in the same window.
