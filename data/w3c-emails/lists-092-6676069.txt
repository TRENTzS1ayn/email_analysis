I'm interested in splitting up the Greek Alphabet palette into several
smaller palettes and was wondering how I might go about this.  This is the
progress I've made so far and the current situation.

1.  I created a menu item in Types called Greek Alphabet which mapped to a
function called CreateAlphabet which called TtcDisplayGreekKeyboard and
CreateGreekKeyboardDlgWindow etc.  That worked fine so now I can open up the
palette from the menu bar.

2.  Then, I created another palette as a copy of EN_GALPHABET and called it
EN_CALCULUSPALETTE so I assume that each button has the same ID.  Then, I
wrote another function CreateCalculus which called
TtcDisplayCalculusKeyboard which called CreateCalculusKeyboardDlgWindow.  I
also added all the prototypes.

3.  When I open the program, I get the menu item Calculus Palette... but
when I click on it it does nothing.  Any ideas?  Perhaps I'm going about
this wrong?

Thanks for any help,

David
