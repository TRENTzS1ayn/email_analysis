Where are the files (ie en-amayadialogue en-amayamsg) read and processed.  I
know where amaya.profiles is processed but can't find en-amayadialogue's
processing code.  I'm interested in improving the way amaya handles
dialogues and automatically mapping names to functions.

Thanks for any help,

David
