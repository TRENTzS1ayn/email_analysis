Hi,

Is it correct to check using:

(!pave->AbPresentationBox) && pave->AbCanBeModified && pave->AbLeafType ==
LtText

instead of:

(!pave->AbPresentationBox || pave->AbCanBeModified) && pave->AbLeafType ==
LtText

?

In the current code, some cases such as the dummy element at the end of HR
or IMG is considered a text leaf using the 2nd line of code. Is that OK or
not?

The first line of code will stop that, I think, but it also require
non-presentation boxes to be modifiable to be considered a text leaf. Is
this OK?

Thanks,
An
