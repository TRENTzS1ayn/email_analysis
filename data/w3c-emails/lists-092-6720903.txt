Sorry if this is a repeat, it might have failed the first time.

Here's what I'm trying to do.  I'm trying to create a generic Help function
that I can call from any Dialog box that  recieves a Document, View and char
string of an http to open.  Here's my function:

OpenGenericHelp (Document document, View view, char http[100])
{  document = GetHTMLName(http, NULL etc etc)
}

(or something to that effect).  So let's say I add a button to the
SaveAsDialogProc function in windialog.api that if someone presses Help, it
opens a new window with the help documentation like so:

case ID_DIALOGHELP:
  OpenGenericHelp (0,0,"http://www.help.com");
  break;

the function works, it opens a new window with the help documentation
however...
1.  if I close the new help window, that closes the dialog box that
initiated it causing of course, Amaya to be stuck where it was (because the
focus never was shifted back from the dialog box where the new document was
instantiated)

2.  If I open the new document and then hit OK or Cancel in the box that
initiated that new Window, then both windows remain alive and also I can
close the help one and go back to the other one okay.

Any ideas, is this something to do with View or Document?  Could someone
tell me how to use these variables?

David
