I would like to add some more palettes to the Amaya browser... 
I tried to create a palette just like the main GALPHABET one
and I copied all the functions and defined it in Editor.A
and -amayadialogue files but to no avail, it won't load up
when I click on it.  The only thing I can think of is that
I'm using the same DialogProc to run it (it's the same buttons
right now) and if there are cases that aren't defined will
that cause it to break?

David
