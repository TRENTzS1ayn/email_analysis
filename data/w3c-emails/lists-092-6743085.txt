I by accident renamed Amaya.exe in the Windows/bin to amaya1.exe one day and 
I noticed that everything worked fine except that the menus were being 
initialized off of en-amayamsg instead of en-amayadialogue and also that it 
wasn't initialized amaya.profiles.  Is there any reason for this weird 
anomaly?

Curious,

John
