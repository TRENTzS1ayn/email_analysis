Hi John,

That's normal. The dialogue is managed by a genereric Thot toolkit which uses
the application name to connect the application to its dialogue file: the name
is $(lang)-$(appli)dialogue
When the application is named amaya it's looking for $(lang)-amayadialogue. 
When
it's named amaya1, it's looking for $(lang)-amaya1dialogue.
The file $(lang)-amayamsg is an additional dialogue file also managed by the 
Thot toolkit but its name is explicitly given by the application itself.

  Irene.
