That's interesting that Amaya reads its own name and reads files in based on 
that name.  Is there some design issue related to this?  Also, is this the 
same case for amaya.profiles (is it read in like $(appName).profiles or just 
hard coded because I noticed that it wasn't reading amaya.profiles when the 
exe was amaya1.exe

Thanks,

John
