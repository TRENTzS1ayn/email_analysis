Hi,

I've been quite taken with Amaya and the graphml/SVG experimental
facility.  However, I don't quite see how this can fit into the "real
world" since neither netscape nor IE seem to support this.

So, for today, is their anyway to make use of Amaya vector graphics ?

I was hoping to find either a netscape/IE plugin which can handle this
or some means of converting inline graphics to bit mapped graphics (say,
on the point of publishing to the web server).

Any thoughts ?

Thanks,

Pete
