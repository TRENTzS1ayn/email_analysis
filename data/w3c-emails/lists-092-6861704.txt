True.

If you have scrambled or overlaid tables you probably had trouble
when you downloaded the last Amaya version.
Note that you had to uninstall the previous Amaya release before
installing the new one.
I don't know why InstallShield doesn't install correctly the new
version over the previous one, but it seems to keep old files which
can cause this kind of error!!!

That is a Windows strategy for generating unavailable colors.
