One of the requirements of the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines that
Amaya currently fails is checkpoint 4.3 Allow the author to preserve Markup
not recognised by the tool.

If the source view allowed saving of the source, then it seems that it would
be possible to have a mode where the source view was interactively TIDY'ed or
corrected as Amaya itself does currently. (which could be overridden by the
author. Of course if the document is not valid Amaya need not process it
further, should the author reject the corrections made)

In general, it would be nice to incorporate tidy features into Amaya. I
realise this is not in the primary development path, but it would seem like a
useful feature, and a good way to use the source view.
