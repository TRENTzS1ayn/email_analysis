Dear Irene,

I have three qestions that I think you can help me with (I'm runing Amaya on Win98 platform, I downloaded source from CVS week ago.):

I'm tring to change the button bar, say, I'm tring to add a new button. The questions I have are the following:

1. In order to add a new button(I name it NEW), I need to create a NEW.xpm file to define the image of the button. Do u have any idea how to do that? I can create a .tif file, is there anyway I can convert?

2. Would you please tell me how to resize the buttons? Which file I need to change to redefine the look of the buttons?

3. I'm be able to add the NEW button by modifying the InitDocView function in the init.c file, amaya.h file, amayamsg.h file(to define to msg when cursor points to the button), en-amayamsg file. 

After rebuild it and run the rescandialogue, the NEW was added, but when I point the cursor to the NEW, no tip msg at all.
I don't know what the problem is, but I found a mismatch between amayamsg.h which stopped at
#define AMAYA_MSG_MAX    190. 
But  en-amayamsg file stopped defining the msg at 189. so when I add a new definition at amayamsg.h (191), how can I define its content in en-amayamsg(name it 190 or 191 ?).

Your kindness help will really really help me out. Thanks  a lot.
