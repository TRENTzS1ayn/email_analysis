There is a Thot API function which lets you update Window titles: 
TtaChangeWindowTitle
Please have a look at the code in Amaya/amaya/init.c and 
Amaya/amaya/HTMLactions.c

This is a type that allows us to compile either the standard version or the 
Unicode
version. It's important to respect that constraint for the future.

Please have a look at the two documents:
http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Amaya-dev.html
and http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Unicode-dev.html

The type STRING is defined in Amaya/thotlib/include/ustring.h

  Irene.
