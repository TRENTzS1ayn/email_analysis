May I suggest that it create them both in a single parent
directory?  That way "gtar -ztvf amaya-src-2.4.tgz | head" will
be enough to tell you where everything ends up.

Because it didn't try to create it.  The messages have been
lost im my command tool, but basically it said there was 
no such directory as libwww when it tried to put files in it.

So what about this ../install.sh not being found?
