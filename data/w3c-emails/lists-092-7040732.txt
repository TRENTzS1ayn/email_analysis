A few more questions and considerations I've run into trying to customize
Amaya..

1.  Thanks Irene for the info on the title TextArea.  When someone changed
the title in that text area, did it call the function UpdateTitle to
change the source code?  


I am asking because I would like to add a dialog that still allws
the user to update the title but implemented through menu selections
rather than a text area. 


Also, are the way Address and the Text area drawn defined in
MakeFrame?  Can the font and shading etc. be specially customized? 

2.  My colleague Tiana and I are still trying to figure out how to add a
second row of toolbar buttons.  I was looking through the MakeFrame
function as previously suggested but could not find the Windows
implementation of where the Toolbar is drawn, only the gnome toolkit one. 


Does adding a second toolbar involve using the amaya resources
file to add another toolbar or do I just continue to draw buttons and have
the MakeFrame define where they go? 


3.  Is there a batch program that builds a release version or some make
utility?  We would like to be able to do some beta testing without having
to send 100 MBs of .obj files :)  



As always, many thanks for the help,

David
