Amaya and libwww are two distributions in the same tar file. They have exactly
the same access rights, the same user id and the same group id. I'm quite sure 
your problem was due to an accidental error during the unpack.

This file is located in the directory Amaya.
It seems you had a great trouble during the unpack. Could you check that you 
have
a valid amaya-src-2.4.tgz file. Perhaps you omitted to set the binary mode when
you downloaded the tar file by ftp?
