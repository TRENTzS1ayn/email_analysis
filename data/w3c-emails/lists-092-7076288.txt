As you can see the function UpdateTitle updates both the text area and
the window title.

They are created by the function TtaAddTextZone.

The MakeFrame code differs with the used toolkit. So you have ifdef sections
for Windows, GTK and Motif.
On Windows the button toolbar is created by a callback procedure WndProc.
See Amaya/thotlib/dialogue apply.c

Normally yes.

I suggest you to create a new directory Amaya\myproject where you copy all the
.dps files given in Amaya\Windows (don't copy .dsw and .mak files). You also
need a copy of the file Amaya\Widows\amaya\amaya.mkf. There you could build 
and test your own Amaya version.

  Irene.
