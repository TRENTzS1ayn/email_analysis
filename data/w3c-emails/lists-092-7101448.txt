Hey, I'm trying to resize the icons in the toolbar to increase
accessibility.  After searching through the code, I'm inclined to think that
the size is defined in either inites.c or initpses.c because it defines
things like

#define gray_width     16

which I thought was a size rendering of the box for a particular color set.
But after doing some testing those numbers don't seem to affect the toolbar.
Also, I don't think that resizing the toolbar in the resource editor (for MS
VC++) does the trick because when you load up Amaya again, the icons become
all off-centered.  It appears as if the toolbar.bmp was layed down in that
Frame and then the old sized boxes were superimposed onto them.  I can put a
picture of it on-line if that explanation is not sufficient...

Any ideas where the size of the boxes over the toolbar is defined?

Thanks,

David
