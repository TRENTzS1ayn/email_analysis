In answer to your question about including the brace/bracket/integral/etc.
pieces, I'd recommend including them.  They will be given code points in
Unicode and many current math layout programs, e.g., TeX, use them.  In
principle scaling braces and brackets can be done, but it's a bit tricky,
since straightforward scaling renders the enlarged characters too boldly.
The stem weights should correspond to those of the simple math characters in
an expression.  For example, if 10-pt type is used, the stem weights of a
two-line brace should be similar to that for 10-pts, not 20 pts.

Thanks for your work!
Murray

Dear all,
As you already might know, STIX is working on a font set of 2000 characters
that
will be freely available for everyone.
We now have a font test set containing some 50 scientific characters.
If you distribute or develop scientific (math) software (MathML, Tex
typesetting
sys, browsers, etc.), please test them in your software (they are, and
always
will be free for you to use) and comment on them. We are now in a stage that
we
can adjust them to your requirements!
Attachments: TT font, Type1 font and a readme.doc (MS Word) and (same)
readme.pdf (Acrobat pdf). You'll have to install the font on your system to
be
able to view the examples in the readme docs.
Thanks.

With kind regards,
