Hi there,

today I have downloaded

  ftp://rpmfind.net/pub/amaya/amaya-2.4-1.i386.rpm

for installation on a friend's PC.  After the installation
I was a bit disappointed to discover that the Italian dialogues
are not present.  As I believe this was not intentional
I dare to ask: why not package amaya-2.4-2.i386.rpm
with the Italian files in?
Thanks a lot,

            Roberto
