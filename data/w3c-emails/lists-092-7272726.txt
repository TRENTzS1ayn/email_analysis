Hi,
I'm an undergraduate student in the US who's designing a new web language
as a thesis project.  The idea is to write a very simple, HTML-like
language which facilitates web page layout (an alternative to the complex
and not always completely effective tables and frames of HTML).  

I'm hoping to implement this language with Amaya.  It looks to me as
though most of what I'll need to do is rewrite the HTML S, P, and T files
as well as html2thot.c.  

Does this plan sound feasible?  Am I missing any obvious problems?  Do you
know of resources that might be helpful to me?  Any and all advice would
be much appreciated.  

-Chris Cutler
