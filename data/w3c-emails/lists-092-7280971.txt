I am attempting to compile the lastest Amaya source distribution for
Linux on the PowerPC architecture. The configure script (invoked with no
argumnents) produces this warning:

configure: warning: Thot editor sources not found

but finishes with this hopeful message:

Amaya package is now configured
Amaya configured with libWWW
Amaya configured with Math support
Amaya configured with Graph support

So I attempted to "make all." The compilation produces a few warnings
but they do not appear to be serious. However, the compiling stops when
it reaches this point:

====> rescandialogue is done

which is followed by many more errors too numerous to repeat here. Make
finally gives up with this error:

System wide unix-thot.rc not found at
/home/hajhouse/prog/src/amaya/config/unix-thot.rc
Missing file: HTML.STR
Structure schema not found
make[1]: *** [../amaya/HTMLP.PRS] Error 139
make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/hajhouse/prog/src/amaya/Amaya/amaya'

I would appreciate any ideas on getting Amaya to compile on my machine.
These errors are very puzzling to me since I followed the compiling
instructions exactly on a freshly unpacked source tree from the official
tarball. Thank you.
