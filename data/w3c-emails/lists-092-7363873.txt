Hello Jeff,

Thanks for your report. You're right. This is an oversight in the
Makefile. Right now, it takes the zlib.h from the system include directory.
I'll patch the makefile to add a -I to take it off from the png/zlib
directory. Hmm, what would be more interesting is to take it off from the
system zlib.a...

No, those arguments look ok.

In the meantime, a quick solution is to add a symlink from 
~/Amaya/libpng/zlib/zlib.h to either ~/libwww/Library/src 
or ~/Amaya/obj/libwww/Library/src.

~ == the path where you detared Amaya
obj == the directory where you're compiling Amaya.

This will make it work for you.
