It would sound more in keeping with Amaya to have the table of contents
render as the structure view does, with H(n) elements being treated as
children of  previous H(n-1) elements. If you could select n so that only
H1..H(n) were shown, that would be a bonus. If you could edit this view in
the same way as the structure view (and it moved the content that was not
shown as well) that would be even better

  Hi, Irene -
  
  My main goal is interactive collapsing and expanding of each "branch" of the
  hierarchical "tree" of headings. The Table of Contents view currently shows
  an outline of the heading hierarchy, with all sub-headings always visible.
  
  Selective hiding of sub-headings would allow the user to focus at different
  levels of detail; this is especially useful for navigating large documents.
  To accomplish this, I propose displaying the heading hierarchy in a tree
  widget, like those used in GUI file managers. 
  
  Specifically, a small icon is displayed to the left of each heading: a "+"
  indicates the presence of one or more hidden sub-headings; or a "-"
  indicates that any children are already visible, or that no children exist.
  The user can toggle between the collapsed and expanded states for a heading
  by clicking on each icon, or via a keystroke.
  
  Editing is a secondary issue: when sub-nodes are hidden, I'd like the
  ability to prune and graft the entire branch to another location, via
  cut-and-paste. Ideally, the tree widget itself should have hooks to support
  this capability. 
  
  Assuming that such a tree widget is currently unavailable for Thot, I
  propose to port an existing widget from an open-source library such as GTK.
  Then I would populate the widget with the headings which are currently
  displayed in Table of Contents view. Perhaps I should refer to the result as
  an Interactive Outline View.
  
  Does this sound feasible?
