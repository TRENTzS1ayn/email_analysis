Charles -

My main question is whether a collapsible outline view is feasible for
Amaya. In response to your comments:

>If you could edit this view in the same way 
>as the structure view (and it moved the content 
>that was not shown as well) that would be even better

A tree widget would be the most intuitive tool for the user to view and
modify the hierarchy of headings. Although working to be free from Microsoft
products, the best example I can give is MS Word's Outline View. 


>If you could select n so that only
>H1..H(n) were shown, that would be a bonus.

I sometimes use Word's support for this, via buttons labelled 1 through 9;
but I find that it's -much- more important to have separate control of each
branch.


>It would sound more in keeping with Amaya 
>to have the table of contents render 
>as the structure view does, with H(n) elements 
>being treated as children of  previous H(n-1) elements. 

I like the parent/child relationships as currently displayed in Table of
Contents view. If you believe that a different scheme would be better, would
you please give an example?

Thanks,
Marc
