The alternate view doesn't render any presentation attributes.
We could render them in the formatted view, but the introduction of these
attributes hurt me. CSS allow us to control this kind of presentation and
I cannot understand the interest of these new attributes.
You have to know that we're currently changing the table rendering to take
advantage of the new CSS box model supported by Amaya. This will help to
render frames and rules.

I don't know. I transmitted the question to our system team.
