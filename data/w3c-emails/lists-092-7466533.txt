The P language provides the material to hide or display a box in a view.
This is the P Visibility. The default Visibility level is 5. When the 
visibility
of a box is less than 5 it's not displayed, when it's more or equal to 5 it's 
displayed.
You can add a new hidden attribute "XX=displayed, undisplayed" which sets 
respectively the box Visibility to 5 or 4. Then you can write a callback 
function
attached to the activation of the displayed icon that changes the value of 
that
attribute in the sub-tree.

With Thot events, callbacks and the API you can implement any specific 
functionality.
See the example of the Make Book which moves a part of a document into another
and the developer documentation.
