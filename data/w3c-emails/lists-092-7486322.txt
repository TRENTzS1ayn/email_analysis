Thanks for the detailed feedback. Two small questions to help me become
familar with the source code:

1. Are the Developer web pages available for download as a tarball? These
pages don't seem to be included with the user-oriented htmls which come with
the binary or source releases. It was a little awkward to get the previous
(v 2.1) pages individually via Save As.

2. Do you have a tentative date for the next release?
