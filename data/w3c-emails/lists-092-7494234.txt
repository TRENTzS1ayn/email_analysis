Hi,
I'm attempting to modify Amaya so that it will read files written in a
markup language of my own devising.  It looks like (among other things) I
need to write the equivalent of html2thot.c for my language.  I'd like to
use html2thot.c as a guide while I do it, but I'm feeling a bit
overwhelmed by the size of the file.  Could someone give me an overview of
the structure of this file?  What are the important functions?  What
precisely does this file do and how does it get called?  In the comments
of I've noticed references to a stack and to an automaton.  What are these
and how do they work?  

Any help would be appreciated.  Thanks very much.

-Chris Cutler
