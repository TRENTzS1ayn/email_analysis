How are MathML and GraphML dealt with in html2thot.c?  Amaya understands
elements from these languages in the middle of HTML files but I can't find
any much mention of them in html2thot.c.  I'm wondering if the best way to
implement another language is to do it how MathML and GraphML are done.  

Again, any help will be much appreciated.  Thanks.
