Hi,

Is there a Thot or Amaya function that lets you scroll the text caret
(cursor) into view, making it visible? For example, if you insert something
big and the caret ends up after that object. The view remains at the same
scroll point but the text caret has moved beyond the view, below the object.
Does this make any sense? :)

Thanks,
An
