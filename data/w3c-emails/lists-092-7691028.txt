Hello. Please note that I'm not in amaya dev mailing list...

I quickly looked at Amaya documentation and saw that its downloading
possibilities are next to nothing. I have no time to develop Amaya
but sure will share my views with you. Here is what I would find very
useful in a web browser.

 -*-

User should be able to "print" the webpage to his local directory.
This would be done by downloading the document, the frames, and their
images. The result is that user is able to view the webpage offline.

 -*-

At the moment, as far as I know, browsers can only save the main document
or alternatively frames. Images would be saved one at a time (which can
be heard if the page is full of math text with embedded gif images for
formulas).

Paper printing is only way to copy the page "as is" at the moment.
But the trend is to save paper.

Juhana
