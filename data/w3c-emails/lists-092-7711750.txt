Except that it doesn?t render frames at all, doesn?t get the <font> tag or <select> menus, fucks up forms etc. etc.
And I doubt that all the pixels gone wild in tables rendered by Amaya are a result of poor HTML.
This is no browser (yet), it?s a weird prototype.  Sorry.

Yeah, but congratulations for the editor.  The only one I?ve seen that seems to have reasonable logic behind.
