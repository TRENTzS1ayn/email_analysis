I just came across Amaya today... I thought this was a
better option than Chimera.

I have a general query.. does Amaya support Applets?
I found a lot of code that refers to Java and applets.
But when I try toload a page having applets I get a message
saying, "your browser doesn't support Java".
Can anybody clarify ??

Thanks
