Are you using the Amaya v3.2.1 tar file or the CVS version? It may be that
the .dsp files that come with the tar file aren't up to date. What seems
to be missing in the print makefile are the jpeg and png library dependencies.

Go to Project/dependencies

A popup will appear. There, choose thotprinter and click on the 
libjpeg and libpng cases if they are not selected.

This should fix up things.
