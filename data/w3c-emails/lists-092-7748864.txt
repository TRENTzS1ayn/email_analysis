Hello.
Thank you for the reply. It looks like saving of frames could be added
quite easily with one step recursion.

Yes, I knew Amaya is an editor. My reasoning was that people who write
a web editor thinks like me about these issues. For some reason I have
have lost my believ in browser writers...

Also, editor stores more about the document which makes an editor more
suitable for me when I would like to add my own special features.
Amaya looks very good to me. My project is on entirely different topic
but I very often need a very powerful web-scripting which is not yet
available (as far as I know). Think about patent.womplex.ibm.com
and automatic saving of patent document images only... when the document
is entirely in the program as a data structure, I find it easier to
write custom tools for doing the task.

Regards,

Juhana
