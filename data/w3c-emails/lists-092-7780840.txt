Thanks Jose,

I had to check the libThotTable, and the compilation process went fine
until the end. Great!

So, if I try to sumerize the Dependencies for Amaya :
amaya depends on libjpeg libpng libThotEditor libThotTable libwww thotpinter 
libpng depends on zlib 
libwww depends on zlib 
thotprinter depends on libjpeg libpng libThotTable printlib 

Hope this will help for the documentation.

By the way, ...\Amaya-v3.2.1\amaya\AmayaPage.html, nice style sheet and page.
Best regards,
Catherine.
