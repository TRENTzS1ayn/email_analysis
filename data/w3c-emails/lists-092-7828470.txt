Hi,

The S file defines the cellpadding and cellspacing as integer values. To
support percentage values, these could be changed to text. The problem is,
the P file uses rules like cellpadding (...) > 0 which I think only allows
integers. What is the possible fix for this? Create a hidden attribute that
is the numerical value and use it?

Thanks...

An
