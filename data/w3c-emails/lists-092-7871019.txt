I downloaded the source code for version 3.1 of Amaya and compiled it with
success. However, Amaya does not seem to understand frames properly. Which
syntax Amaya accepts for frames? By the way, my pages with frames can be
seen without problems in Netscape and Internet Explorer.

Thanks in advance for your help,
