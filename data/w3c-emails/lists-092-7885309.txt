How can I disable some menu options of Amaya? I tried to modify
the EDITOR.A file, removing some lines, but it did not work.

The reason for this is that Amaya will be called from another application,
and this application should not allow the user to edit the file. He/she can
not also open another document, unless the document is referenced in some
link of the current document.

Thanks one more time,
