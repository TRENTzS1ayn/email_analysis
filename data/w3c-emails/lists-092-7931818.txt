Greetings,

My apologies if this issue has already been discussed; I checked the
archives for zlib.h and didn't see relevant posts.

Anyway, I'm currently trying to build 3.1 on my debian laptop (slink).  I
ran into a problem and thought you should be made aware of it.   While
making in Amaya/linux/libwww/Library/src, HTZip (I think it was HTZip)
includes zlib.h, but zlib.h isn't on the include path.  I found it in
Amaya/libpng/zlib and added the -I manually; everything else seems to be
going well.  I"ll mail some more if I run into any other problem like
this.

It's great you all are working on this project; I would much rather use a
completely compliant open-source browser than any of the Big Monster
Browsers.  Thanks for the good work.

Ben
