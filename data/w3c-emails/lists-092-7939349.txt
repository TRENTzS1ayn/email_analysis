Hello Ben,

Thanks for your report. This is a known problem, but we haven't had time
to fix it yet (but will do so before the release). I need to tweak a bit
the configure and Makefile.

We hadn't detected the problem before because we always had zlib installed 
in our workstations.

I had the same problem as you while compiling on my debian box. I fixed it
by installing the zlib package.

Sorry for the inconveniences!

-Jose
