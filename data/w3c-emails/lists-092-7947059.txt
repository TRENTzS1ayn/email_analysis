Hi,
I've just compiled Amaya's latest release with Gtk+. The program starts
but it seems that all the interface's callbacks are disconnected since
it doesn't react to any event. I've tried it with Lesstif and it works
fine. I wanted to ask if this is a mistake from my part, or if it is a
fixed bug. If it's none, I'm willing to contribute some bits since fully
internationalized editors cruely lack under Linux and I understand Amaya
will be one in a near future.
Regards,
Chahine
