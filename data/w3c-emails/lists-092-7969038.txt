Hi,

I got all the files for libwww and amaya with cvs. The perl script was also running without any problems. Compiling of Compilers.exe was als done and ended up with some warnings.

If I try to execute Compilers.exe and then select amaya.mkf everything still seems ok. But when I execute Build I got a message that something illegal happened and Compilers.exe has to be shot down.

In Compilers.exe the line
APP -DMATHML -DGRAPHML EDITOR.A 
appears immediately before the message appears.

I compiled it with MSVC 6 under NT2000 and tried it under NT4 SP6 and an old Win95 machine. Always the same problem.

Can you help me to get it to work?
