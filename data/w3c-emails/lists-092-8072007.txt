latest version indicates NO work has been done on
color rendering on 256 color display ......
as per previous versions
the default gray background is rendered with dots thru it
the opening page displays a dark blue title while 
both netscape and iexplore show magenta !!!!!
the bottom blue box has dots all thru it while in netscape/explorer
it shows nice solid light blue background ....... 
this comparison to other browsers indicates that the
hardware and software driver for 256 colors is capable of
doing a reasonable job .... when the correct pallette is initialized
however someone must view amaya on 256 display to see and fix
choice of pallette !!!!!!!
------------------------------------------
onew creature comfort missing in Amaya is when cursor is placed on
a link,  the icon doesnt change to give feedback that that zone is
'clickable'  -----  color alone isnt enough as anyone can make their text
any color they choose. ie they hide links by making them same color
as normal text and what is more commonly done  make text appear
clickable when it isnt ...  underlines are no guarantee either ......
but changing the pointer icon ----- now that is THE solution
    most others do it [aka defacto standard].  Can you make Amaya 
do it ....  maybe option selectable if it goes against some philosophy
      of how things should look  --- similar to option selecting 
     underline of links  if   USER things it should be that way
one may suspect I am into letting user choose the look/feel as much
 as possible  eh!
