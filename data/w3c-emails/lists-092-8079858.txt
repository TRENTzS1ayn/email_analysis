The problem may be in the initial pallette selected
or PERHAPS it is in the color dithering algorithm
being used .... either way it is fixable  by scanning
one of the open source browsers like mozilla or 
maybe a photo rendering program  to see how
they manage it ..... graceful degradation for
  older  hardware is always an engineering tradeoff
  but in this case is doable....
