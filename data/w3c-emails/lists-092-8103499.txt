these I would classify as nitpicker issues but are
things that should be easy to clean up.....

1] the horizontal scroll bar is working ALMOST.
It will not move over to the absolute right edge
either by clicking on end icon or in bar itself....
this is probably a boundary checking issue 
deep in the programming of the scroll element .....

2] when unordered lists are nested,  the symbol
used for the second level is rather unusual .....
although there is no real standard for the bullet
if left undefined ....... a good choice would be
in level sequence  solid circle,  open circle,
 solid box, open box  ..... 

see what i mean by minor stuff .... i know programmers
like to focus on s tate of the art issues or major
programming challenges that test the brain  but 
its these rough edges that the user likes to see
sanded over and painted once and for all ....
like nice colors,  regular context feedback such as
icon changes,  glitches erased and nice screen displays....
