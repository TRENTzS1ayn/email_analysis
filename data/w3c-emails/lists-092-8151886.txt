I downloaded the NT version of the source code.
I tried to build compilers project/workspace using .dsp/.dsw. When compiling
compilers.rc it complained that resource.h is missing. Adding \amaya\amaya\amaya to
the resource include directory path successfully included resource.h but now I am
getting an error 'Undefined keyword : COMP_OPEN and COMP_COMPILE.

Is it because I am including the wrong resource.h file and I am missing the correct
version of it?
Also I am using MSVC++ 5.0 and not 6.0. Is this a problem?

Thanks,
siva
