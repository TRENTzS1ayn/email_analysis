 I am using the latest beta test version with
 windows 95, 256 color, 640x480 display.
 The test page that breaks is one that uses a stylesheet and gif backdrop
 with a fancy border.  There is no problem with display UNLESS AN ANCHOR
 ELEMENT WRAPS TO A NEW LINE. Thereafter the display is crud. If
 I resize the browser so that anchor is not wrapped and do a refresh , the
 problem cleans up until further in page with next wrapped anchor
 element.  Full sized window seems better.  Also less problems occur
 with on-line copy than off-line one ...
 Although some rapid scrolling made the on-line version hang my
 computer.   And the border itself is not rendered well in comparison
 with other browsers.
