Greetings from newbie;

Just downloaded Amaya 2.4 
in hopes that thru it I can manage what sites my child visits. 
Questions in that regard:
1) What language is Amaya written in?
2) Does it have filtering capabilities?
3) If no filtering capabilities, can I buid a localOnly proxy in Delphi5 and
hook into Amaya? I would be using a trustFile  approach. If its in the trust
file, you can go there. 
4) Has someone already figured this filtering thing out?

Thanks in advance!
