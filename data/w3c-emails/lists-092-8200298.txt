One function that would be extremely useful for tracking
error situations would be a menu item that started a 
mail msg or at least created a bugreport.txt file that
included all o/s , hardware,  browser compiled-options
and versions and critical user defined settings....
this would allow debugging team to isolate errors
to particular platforms or compilation forms...
i have seen this in other software where on the 
help menu is a report bugs item that sets this up.
the user simply adds details abt what he is doing
at time of the bug .... 
the debug team rarely has to ask --- what version
 of windows are you using or what did you set foobar to!
just a thought
