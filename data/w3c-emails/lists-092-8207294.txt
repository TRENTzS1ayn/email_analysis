Hi,
I'm adapting amaya to work with my own XML language and I'm having a
problem with images.  I've added a PICTURE terminal element to my S file
and put an entry in the element table for my language in fetchXMLname.c
that maps img tags to the PICTURE_UNIT element.  After processing an img
tag and successfully creating a PICTURE_UNIT element I set the text
content of that element to the file name of the image source.  When I run
amaya and load a page with an image, no errors occur but the image does
not appear.  When I force the PICTURE_UNIT to have 200x200 dimensions in
my P file and load the page again, I can see a bitmap with the word
"picture" and a rectangle and a circle in grey and white, but my image
still doesn't appear.  Do you have any suggestions of things I may have
forgotten or done wrong?  Thanks.

-Chris Cutler
