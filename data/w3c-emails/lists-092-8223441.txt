I can open up the project in MSVC5.0++ and I've had luck on several machines compiling it but occasionally I get an error when I try to open up the Resource Tab something along the lines of :

Code page 1252 is required to support French (France) language resource in this file.  Please see "Multiple Language Resource Files" topic in the Miscellaneous Section of the README.  Unable to open this file.

Code page 1252 is loaded like

#pragma code_page(1252)

any ideas?

David
