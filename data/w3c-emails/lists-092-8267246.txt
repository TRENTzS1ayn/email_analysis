I'm trying to add a new dialogue that allows someone to change the Title
of the document.  I know that originally this function was TextTitle but
now I want to somehow invoke TextTitle through a DlgProc function in
windialogapi.c... is this possible?  Is there some ThotCallback I have to
do to accomplish this?

Thanks,

David
