Sorry for the delay. The whole team is working hard for preparing the new 
release
planned for the end of this week.
We planned in this release to replace the Title text zone by an entry title in 
the menu
Types. The text zone is now removed but the new dialogue entry is still 
missing.
I'm writing the function that lets the user edit the title within a dialogue 
box.

  Irene.
