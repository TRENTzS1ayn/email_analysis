Hi Gediminas,

Amaya only support today iso8859-1 and we made a patch just to display
other iso8859-x characters.

Amaya doesn't use the UNIX locale because it has its own dialogue language.
You should launch the French Amaya version (fr) even if you have a UNIX locale 
sets
to English (en).

Amaya load fonts according to the current language used for the dialogue or any
part of the document.
The function FontIndentifier in Amaya/thotlib/dialogue/font.c generates the X 
font
identifier from internal parameters: alphabet, family, hightlight, size.
If the alphabet is set to '4', Amaya will request a font "......-iso8859-4"
The parameter alphabet sent to FontIndentifier is stored into the Language 
table
initialized by InitLanguage in Amaya/thotlib/document/language.c

Our goal is clearly to move toward a unicode support, and so having a full 
support
for any language. This work is in progress, but it's not finished yet.
Meanwhile, if you want to display iso8859-4 characters you have to patch the 
current code:
