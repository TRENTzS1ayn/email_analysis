There is a "LINK_NUMBER" variable in amaya source code(HTMLP.P).
 If I want to show the index of links in the increasing order on the
screen,how to make use of it?

I have tried to turn on the "LINK_NUMBER" flag at the compile time.
After compile is done,the amaya browser always show (0) in the front of
the link ? What is the problem with it ?

Can anyone tell me ?

regards
I am apologized for my poor English  :~~
