The LINK_NUMBER is a compiling option for generating the HTML presentation.
We currently use it only at the print time.
If you want to use it on the screen you have to change the compiling 
directive in the file Amaya/amaya/Makefile.in
-          $$PRS $(ALL_AMAYA_OPTIONS) HTMLP ;\
+          $$PRS $(ALL_AMAYA_OPTIONS) -DLINK_NUMBER HTMLP ;\

but today this piece of P language is a designed to be displayed with pages
and perhaps need some update when you want to use it without page.

You have to assign an internal attribute HTML_ATTR_InternalLink for generating
numbers.
See the function SetInternalLinks in Amaya/amaya/HTMLbook.c
