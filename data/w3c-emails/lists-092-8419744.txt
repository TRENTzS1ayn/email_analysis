I guess this problem was already solved in the CVS version. It didn't come
from this piece of code but from the function LocateSelectionInView
The variable moveAfter is set to TRUE when the current selection points to
a box which is neither a text nor an empty box.
If you have "<b>AAAAA</b><a>xxxx,/a>BBBB" and the anchor is selected, the 
instruction
"ContentEditing (TEXT_SUP)" removes the current contents of the
selection (<a>xxxx,/a>) then moves the selection to the beginning of the next 
element
(BBBB). As it's a delete previous we have to call the function TtcPreviousChar 
for
moving to the end of the previous element (<b>AAAAA</b>)
