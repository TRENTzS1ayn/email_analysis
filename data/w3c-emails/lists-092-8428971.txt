These functions should work and perhaps you removed too many things from the
Amaya code. These functions are managed by ThotInput in the module 
Amaya/thotlib/dialogue/input.c which normally manages editing inputs.

The keyboard events from X-window are managed by FrameCallback in
the module Amaya/thotlib/dialogue/appli.c

We never experimented that, but it should work. After small adaptations  work
we successfully built the program print. You certainly can build a browser on
the current code. Let me know if you need a specific help.
