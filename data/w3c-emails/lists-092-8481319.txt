Hi,

yes, it means that code is not valid. In the case of bgsound it is becuase
there is no such element in HTML 4 - it is a private extension that is only
recognised by some browsers.

You can, of course, continue to enter such codes if you like, using a source
editor, but your pages will not be valid HTML.

regards

Charles McCN

  Hello,
  I started using AMAYA and find it very versatile.
  When I choose structure view in my document, I find that some lines appear in red.
  Does it mean that AMAYA considers these codes  unacceptable?
  Those lines of code were entered by using notepad editor.
  One example is "bgsound".
  Can I continue to enter such codes?
