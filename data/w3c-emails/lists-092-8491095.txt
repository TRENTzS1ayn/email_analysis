This  'orphan'  should be better implemented and promoted
 for accessibility.  The old lynx editor used it to great advantage
 in the days when content transfer was more important than
 whiz bang presentation (with little content).
 MSIE incorporates accesskey but only on some elements
 for example on an anchor hyperlink,  the action of pressing 
  <alt><accesskey> mves the focus to that link BUT doesnt
  activate it.  
If an anchor name reference has an accesskey attribute, no
action is taken !!!

Will Amaya be incorporating the accesskey attribute and what 
will the action be .... 
i recommend that it put the focus/cursor on the link or at 
the place of the named anchor.      
Maybe this is too late for pending version  but  should be 
 on todo list as it is both valid html4  and accessibility issue.
