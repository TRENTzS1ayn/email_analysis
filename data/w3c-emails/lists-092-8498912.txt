Amaya is not a validator but when it finds out an invalid mark-up that it
cannot interpret correctly it outputs a warning in the log file (see 
special/log file)
and paints the corresponding markup in red in the structure view.
For example bgsound is not a valid tag in HTML. So if you plan to distribute 
your
documents outside your compagny, I suggest you to avoid this kind of tags.

There is a validator at W3C that will list all HTML errors in your documents.
