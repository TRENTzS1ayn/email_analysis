In Amaya 4 there is a nice system of help bubbles that appear
when a toolbar icon is cursed over.
However when side pallets are opened (for example the math pallet)
 the selections on these pallets have no help bubbles.
This is unfortunate as many of the icons are very cryptic and a 
 bit of click and try is needed
But i did find that the correct entity for ellipse is not ldots  
  but TripleDot !!!

And i have not tried it yet but i wonder if the help bubbles are
all coded in each language too???
