Hi John,

The idea is to provide a simpler interface when people wish to use
only a subset of Amaya features. But I agree, the help documentation
would more clearly match the menus provided.

> Amaya 4. changes the menus according to the profiles....
> Perhaps it is better to 'grey out' inaccessible options instead.
> otherwise the help screens are inaccurate as they are keyed
> to a specific profile .....
> for example if one is set to browser,  preferences no longer 
> has a templates option   but it is discussed in the configure.html 
> document.... if it was there but greyed out (standard notation for
> unavailable) then the help docs would more clearly match the 
> menus provided.  Also one is aware of what is available if profile
> is altered..... 
> the alternative is to have a whole series of helps, keyed to each of
>  the profiles , a maintenence nightmare in a single language and 
>    undoable in multilanguage.....
