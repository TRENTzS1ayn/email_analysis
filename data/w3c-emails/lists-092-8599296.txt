The talk about iCab makes my mouth water -- 
 i run msdos, windows and linux machines but no
  mac nearby -- in fact i haven't seen one for yrs
  except in tv commercials.......

But it is interesting to use http://www.icab.de/test.html
as a test document.   It verifies using validator.w3.org
abut each of eight different browsers tested failed at least
 one of their check tests .....  
the biggest slipup spotted in Amaya was the lack of tabbing
ability to change focus in forms.  but there are other picky
points.  Test team may want to use test.html to spot other 
problems.
