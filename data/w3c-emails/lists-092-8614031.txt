I have found several bugs in the way lists and tables are
rendered in Amaya 4.  

Although major issues like Accessibility, Internationalization,
MathML and SVG are very important and generate lots of
interesting work on how to implement and what are grey areas,
there is also a need to clean up rendering of simple presentations.
Is there someone at w3.org that is looking at these simplistic 
issues so that I can send them my bug list 

Or should it be offered to the group as challenges to the 
codesmiths.  Many of these bugs are not new, have been reported,
but got lost in the shuffle to incorporate the latest standards (which
of course is the major focus of Amaya).
