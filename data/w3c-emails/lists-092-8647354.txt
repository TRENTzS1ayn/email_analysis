I have developed a sample file that exercises the
many options available in form element use.....

This test demo also smoked out a disagreement between
  validator.w3.org and tidy.exe. Dave Raggett has been informed!

Go to my site as in the sig file and select browsers / Form element test
or    go directly to formtest.htm at my site.

No current browser tested on Windows passed all the tests  but
 I am Scot enough not to have Opera for testing purposes ;-] ;-]

Others may wish to do their own testing on whatever platform they run.
Even the latest MSIE and Netscape do not handle radio button selection
 well!     And Amaya fails bigtime.
