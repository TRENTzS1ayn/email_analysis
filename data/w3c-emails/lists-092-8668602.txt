On Mandrake 7.1 with a CVS built Lesstif I get the following error
when trying to be a CVS refreshed Amaya from this morning (November
20, 2000):

PRS=`pwd`/../bin/prs ; \
cd ../amaya; THOTDIR=`pwd`/.. ;export THOTDIR; \
. 
.

Plus the same error six more times.  Amaya and libwww are checked out
in /home/sven/cvs/dev.w3.org/{Amaya, libwww} so it should be looking
at the  /home/sven/cvs/dev.w3.org/Amaya/config/unix-thot.rc file.  So
someplace my configure want wrong.  I'm searching around for it but
I'm hopping somebody know what I did wrong.

    Thanks,

Sven
