In order to test the validity of a page I normally 
browse to the page, cut its url to the buffer,
call up validator.w3.org
paste the url and press the button.....

However when I tried to do this with Amaya 4 on MS Windows
I found two problems
1] calling up validator.w3.org drew an error message !!!

2] pasting the url to the form entry box did not work!

so i guess there may be some internal communication
between w3.org members to clear problem #1 and yet another
item to add to the form element fix listing.
