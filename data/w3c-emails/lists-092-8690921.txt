I tested the paste operation on my test document 
  formtest.htm  and paste worked ok

i then tested on www.amazon.com and paste worked aok
but i noted that form was not pretty site since amaya doesnt
do size = "x" characters correctly.  

but the issue of validator.w3.org not taking a paste may be
due to fact that it is invalid doc ... or some other quirk
but it does take a paste from other browsers.....
