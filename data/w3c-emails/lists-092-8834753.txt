I can't find that file in my win2k install.

Windows: It's now possible to change the value of the user's preferences
directory. To do so, edit the win-thot.rc and add a variable called
APP_HOME in the [amaya] section. The value of this variable should be the
path to directory. This is interesting if you want to install Amaya in an
NFS drive, but store the user's preferences locally.
