I have a page with an embedded audio object that displays
the controller.
I realize that there is no support within Amaya 4 for tying the object
to an external media player and Amaya does display an image in
the expected location.  However as I have added an alt = "descriptor"
it would make more sense to display the alt text as an alternative to
or in addition to the fake image. This way the user would know what
 was intended ... Perhaps this is an unanticipated use of the alt
attribute but i think it makes sense that whenever the correct image
is missing or images are deselected by user a first check is for any
appropriate alt attribute  prior to showing the dummy or in addition
to showing it.
