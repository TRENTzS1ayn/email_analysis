try pressing ESCAPE while the cursor is on the menu.

But you're right:  It should also work by destroying it
with the window manager.  I'm not too experienced in motif
programming, so I'd try writing a small event handler which
will dump all events the torn of menu gets.  Maybe I'll have
a closer look later (though I've not much time).
