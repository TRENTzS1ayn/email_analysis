I must congratulate Amaya group from pulling ahead 
of netscape in error tolerance (actually Netscape 6 is
 a regression in their releases).   Amaya allows hexcode
colors to be recognized even if the # is missing.  
Netscape 6 does not --> anticipate a lot of busted pages ;-]
Just a remark that Amaya is moving forward as a browser 
as well as doing a great job as a compliant editor.
