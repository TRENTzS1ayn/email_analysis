Amaya is already able the display two documents in two different windows, but
I guess it's not what you wish to do. If you plan to split a window in two 
parts
for displaying two documents in the same windows instead of two different 
windows,
you have to look at the code that creates a new window for a document (function
MakeFrame) in Amaya/thotlib/dialogue/appdialogue.c
