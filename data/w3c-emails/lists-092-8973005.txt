A brief comment if I may
Maybe I have been around a little too long in computing.
I have seen philosophy of what progs should look like 
go around in circle many times.....  
html WAS evolving to be a more readable language by
1] being scripted rather than compiled
2] separating content from look
3] introducing features that promoted human readability.....

the first regression was the deemphasis on color names
now they are saying dont use entity names
soon the tag names will change to meaningless symbols
and the whole point of user readability will be lost !!!!
