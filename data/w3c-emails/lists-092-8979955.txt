I do not know the reasoning for making XHTML case
sensitive.  But it sure will cause problems.  And it flies
in the face of backwards compatibility and the history
of all that has gone before.   Even now only a small
percentage code for html 4  correctly.  Many could care
less.   And to add unnecessary restrictions   and
    geek code for color is madness!!
