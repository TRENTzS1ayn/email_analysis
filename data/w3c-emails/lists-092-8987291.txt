XHTML is case sensitive because XML is case sensitive. There are a few
restrictions added by making HTML available in XML, but the reason is to make
it much easier to process. Although there will be some backwards
compatibility problems for a little while, most software can already produce
lower case, and fixing compatibility to XHTML will also solve a number of
other bad practices common in HTML.

being able to style elements in the source view is pretty helpful - colour is
a common appraoch, another is to use bold text for code elements. (Colour
alone means a tool cannot comply with W3C accessibility Recommendations).
