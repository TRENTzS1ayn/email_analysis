The tarball I downloaded installed both directories above, as you have
them.

No...this dir doesn't exist.

A strange thing.  Mabye you can explain how it is that when you're here:

/usr/src/Amaya/LINUX-ELF

this:

..//usr/src/Amaya/../libwww/configure

resolves to this:

/usr/src/libwww

At least it doesn't seem to with the Bourne shell I'm using!
