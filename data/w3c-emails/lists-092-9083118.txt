You're right. It was a typo on my part. My macro is the same one.

I think that this problem comes from the way that THOTDIR is solved.
In our machines it is .. and in yours it's the complete path. I can't
use your solution because it'd break the compilation elsewhere where
THOTDIR is .. .

I think that the best solution for the moment is to use .. instead of
THOTDIR in that particular Make rule. I'll do this change and, when
I understand more what configure is doing, I'll make a better patch.

Thanks for your report and patience,

-Jose
