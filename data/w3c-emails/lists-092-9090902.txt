I have found a site that will not display all of page
if i try to view it on line  but if i use msie5 to capture
the files to my local disk, this copy displays ok with amaya

there are html errors but the page DOES display ok locally!

[1] is this a timing issue. if so where can i stretch the timeout
  so that i can read ok.   
[2] is it a complexity issue -- too many objects to download from
    site at one time ???  

i would like to think that what i design locally will be viewable over
the internet but this   view / no view  quandry  puzzles me .   
For those that want to see   the site is
http://technology.niagarac.on.ca/courses/tech238g
and i am cable access so that is one less speedbump on the infobahn
