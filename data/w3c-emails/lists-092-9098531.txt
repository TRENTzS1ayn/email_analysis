after much comparison of source code view (which means how parsed)
not the true source code [[[ maybe one should question name ?source 
view? -- perhaps it should be parsed view   and another window for true 
source ....   however

the page is really mangled html and i will try to get author
 (professor who is really frazzled as all are at start of term)
  to fix up as much as possible or i will volunteer to help 
but  one meta element has a text/html  which is being 
parsed out as a /html  ELEMENT which stops the parsing but quick
a local copy doesnt try to interpret the element so the parse continues

by looking at the ?source? view in msie,  the same kind of false 
interpretation is being done for /html  but in a different way
and of course msie doesnt bother interpreting /body or /html
(plays loose with rules)  so doesnt stop working at </head>

I am sure the best solution is to write better code in the first place
but somehow i think a parse of /html  that  ASS/U/MEs that it is 
</html> is WRONG  --- the string that causes a falsing  has no
angle brackets so should not be thought an element.....

on second thought , i will hold off telling the author   as this
is a very interesting example to test on......
