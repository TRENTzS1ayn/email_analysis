Further explorations are indicative of the strangeness of the file.
Accessing   http://technology.niagarac.on.ca/courses/tech238g
by netscape, msie and amaya   give essentially the same source view
 </head> has been inserted after the first header block.
netscape and msie dont do anything on this closer but Amaya sees
 it as a quit parsing thing.

if i capture the file with msie , local copy displays ok.
if i put this copy back up on my own website   it  displays
  ok  with amaya ....  what in the code would stop amaya first
     time but not if copied to my site ....
