Hi,

I answer on the list www-amaya-dev@w3.org because it's more appropriate.

When Amaya prints a document, it first generates a file 
$TMP/Thot$pid/Thot$pid.PIV
Then it launchs the program print (see the function Print in 
Amaya/thotlib/dialogue/printmenu.c)

I suggest to:
- check that the program print is built correctly?
- check if it's possible to create the subdirectory then the file in the 
current directory $TMP

If the program print fails the temporary file and directory are not removed.
In that case you can launch print in debug mode (parameters are those given in 
the local variable cmd of the function Print)
