Thanks for the advice.

I did a bit more investigation:

The print program is indeed being launched, and it is creating a *.ps
file
(I was looking in the wrong place).
What is happening, is that the print program is crashing after it
creates the 
ps file (during its cleanup routine).

I did a stack trace on it, and here is what I found 


#0  0x89b5167 in ?? ()

    rtld_fini=0x4000a350 <_dl_fini>, stack_end=0xbffff7ec)

I'll try to actually find out a bit more, but I'm not familiar with the
code, and maybe someone knows what's going on ??
