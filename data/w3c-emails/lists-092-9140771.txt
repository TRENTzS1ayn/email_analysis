Dear all,
As you know, the goal of the STIX project is to deliver a comprehensive set of
free fonts (appr. 2000 symbols).
Still, STIX has not yet started the actual development, but we at Elsevier
Science (STIX member) wend a bit ahead and we developed some 900 symbols in TT
and Type1 for 'standard' use (that is: for non-TeX applications). This Elsevier
set will be part of the final STIX set.
Like the final STIX set, this intermediary Elsevier set is, and will remain
completely free for every kind of use and distribution (so you might want to
distribute them with Amaya).
We are trying to get as much as possible feedback from all MathML software
developers.
So, we would appreciate it if you could have a look at the set or even test it
in Amaya and give us your feed-back. Your input will be important for further
requirements and changes.

We made some initial decisions in the development process and wonder if that
would be problematic for implementation/use in Amaya. They are:
- Metrics: are they OK?
- Non-UNICODE (because not all symbols were accepted by the UTC; same for pieced
symbols): should we already change to UNICODE at this time?
- Number/sizes of pieced symbols: are they sufficient?

You can find the font set at: ftp://ftp.elsevier.nl/pub/styles/esstix/esstix.zip

Thanks.

With kind regards,
