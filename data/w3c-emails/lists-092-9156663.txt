We had a very quick look at your fonts. We only tested that Amaya was able to 
load them.
We need to do more for giving you a more complete feed-back.
We intend to built a prototype of Amaya (perhaps on Linux platforms only) 
using your
fonts for the MathML conference, but we have first to prepare a new public 
release.

It too early to answer today.

That could be more comfortable for us, but it's also possible to adapt the 
mapping.

It's okay for the moment.

I got it.
