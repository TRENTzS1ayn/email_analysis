Would it be possible to set the default valign to middle for
table cells.  This would bring Amaya into alignment with all the
other browsers that valign in the middle ......
since Amaya doesnt float images,  i am using tables to get
text located correctly... and trying for nearly same look on all
 browsers  ;-]  ;-]  ;-] 
As much as possible defaults should follow de facto standards
to make design views on Amaya close to what 90% plus viewers
of page will see.
