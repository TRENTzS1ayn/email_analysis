[1] Search should default to case insensitive --- and one could
     remove check for CASE SENSITIVE checking.  This would
    make action compatible with other browsers and more 
    importantly respect fact that most users prefer insensitive
    searches to catch every instance of usage including sentence
    beginnings and authors quirks  ....   is it unix, Unix, or UNIX
    i want to see every result even  the quirky uNix  one.......

[2] Could we have a globe icon for WWW search that user could
     set to point at google.com  or altavista  or whatever they use
     to poke thru the net.  I have noticed that even mainstream 
     browsers hardwire that icon to what they want you to use. 
     Amaya could lead the way by showing how a CUSTOMIZABLE
     browser can be built.  Worse trick is netscape that lets you 
     point at google but doesnt respect it anyways --- fie on them
