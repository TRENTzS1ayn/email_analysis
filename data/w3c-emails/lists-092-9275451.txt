displays poorly in the bin version of amaya 3.2.1
[1] The headings colors are all one color , therefore the 
     purposeful overlaps are hard to read.
[2] Some overlapping text is designed to be on separate
     lines but still overlapping.   They are rendered on
    the same line.  This is a great demo of what needs
    to be touched up before next release!!!
