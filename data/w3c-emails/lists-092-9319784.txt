Hi,

I'm sorry, I have also posted this mail in www-amaya@w3.org.
I'm actually developping an editor of mathematical formula, and I think it
is easier for user to see border of box inside function like square root or
to separate elements in a matrix.
To make that I have to modify MathMLP.P but I have made some modifications
like added LineWeight : 1;ShowBox; in "SqrtBase" section for example. But it
seems to be a bad solution because I haven't seen any border of box.
Can you help me ?
