Hi Peter,

you astonished me, because my mail agent newly created a folder to
for this mailing list, where I did subscribe a month ago. This folder
wasn't created yet because I never got an answer from anybody. I feld very
seldom and its a pity to mee that you will do also, I think. So I write to
you.
The amaya project is a nice one. So lets discuss about it. Why are
you interested in amaya, since there are so many other browsers ?

CU INGO
