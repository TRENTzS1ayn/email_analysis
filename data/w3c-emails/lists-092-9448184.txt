Hello!


IV> Hi Peter,

IV> The support of international characters in Amaya is quite complex.
IV> Of course we could switch to ISO-8859-2 charset to support another
IV> subset of European languages, but the right general solution is to
IV> handle Unicode characters.
IV> This implies 3 steps:
IV> 1- Replacing the handling of 8 bits characters by Unicode functions.
IV> Due to external constraints, sometimes Unicode characters must be
IV> encoded as UTF-8 strings, sometimes they must be encoded as
IV> wide-characters.
IV> So the adaptation of the code is not easy and adequate conversion
IV> functions must be developed.
IV> 2- We need also to write displaying functions that'll find for each
IV> character the right font and the right glyph within the font.
IV> Theses functions depends on the platform (Windows or X-Windows).
IV> 3- Then several input methods should be added to the Amaya code.

IV> Just the step 1 is quite finished now.
I'm sorry but why you want to invent bicycle ?
I mean step 3.
This locale patch (i already send absolutely idenical patch half year ago)
made you work quite simple.
after set_locale(LC_ALL,"") call on all unix platforms you can
get full unicode input. Windows as far as i know support
unicode input too.
So i say: insert of set_locale call resolve all troubles
with nonlatin1 input. At least on Linux, Irix and Solaris,
cause i check it.

I like amaya. You make great product.
But i need to add this setlocale call after
each download of fresh sources. It's annoyed me.
