Hi, Dear  all:

I'm a new comer in this mailing list. I don't know if the questions below would
be approprite in this mailing list.

1. If I want to do some development work with plug-in in IE, where could I get enough
   materials?
The answer could be given directly to my mail address.

Thank you in advance.
