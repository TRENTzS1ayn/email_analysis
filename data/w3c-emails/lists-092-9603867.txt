I used the Make Book command on the Online manual.  Amaya hung while doing so.  I am attaching the memory dump/error report files created by Windows XP if they are of any use.  I am sure memory is not an issue since I am running the NT version on Windows XP with an AMD Athlon XP 1700+, 512 MB RAM, and a 60 GB HD.
Attached files are amaya.exe.mdmp, the memory dump, appears to be binary.  Also, appcompat.txt, appears to be XML.
