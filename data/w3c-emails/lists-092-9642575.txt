Currently, "dialogue" is used as the spelling in the general preferences.  According to the Microsoft Manual of Style for Technical Publications, this should be spelled "dialog".  It says:

dialog
Do not use the spelling dialogue.

This could also be considered an accessibility issue as most software and manuals use the "dialog" spelling.

If "dialogue" is use on other systems, this is OK, but if "dialog" is used on most, if not all systems, the "dialog" spelling should be used.  The above excerpt is from the manual copyrighted in 1995.  There may be a newer version of the manual available, though.
