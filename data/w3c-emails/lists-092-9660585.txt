Dialogue is the normal spelling in  the UK, Australia, and a number of other
countries (Canada I believe is one). Dialog is the normal american english
spelling.

I prefer not to thave the en-US version. If we have to, is there a way to
specify a variant of english? The spelling dictionary is US english and I
have had to adapt it heavily for en-AU. This means I need to check manually
for en-US, since I don't know how to swap dictionaries.

If you are looking for a good english dictionary I suggest the Oxfrod English
Dictionary - it is available online by subscription, and is widely
acknowledged as the best dictionary of the english language. It also includes
different variants, such as US, Australian, and other kinds of english.

cheers
