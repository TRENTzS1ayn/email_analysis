Hi Brant, you can use the template feature. Simply create a template file,
and give its address (it will be file:///some/file/path...) in the
preferences section ( Menus Special -> Preferences -> Templates). Then to
create a new page from template select file->New->from template...

If you have several different templates, then you should have a page that
links to each of them, and make that page the one that comes up.

This might explain why when you ask to create a new file with a name that is
in use, it comes up. That is also helpful if you are at risk of overwriting a
shared filesystem.

cheers

Charles

I would like to configure Amaya to use the same header and footer on each

do this, and if not, is there a way to implement this?
