  Could I have further contributions particularly for

  linux: opera, nn6,
  no plugins..
  any others?

  How do we feel these two examples* demonstrate that SVG successfully degrades
  in a range of browsers? Please note possible inadequacies are highlighted in
  capitals.

  *http://www.learningdifficulty.org/develop/examples/objectsvg.html
  embedsvg.html is linked from it.

  Does the code need a tweak? please tell me.

  Does anyone have other examples demonstrating perhaps:
  more complex but successful degradations of SVG?
  allowing users to trigger events via the keyboard as well as the mouse?

  Are we communicating sufficiently well between groups? comments please

  please excuse cross-posting

  thanks
