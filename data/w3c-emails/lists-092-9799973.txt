In the properties for the amaya.exe file, it says libwww as the application
name and 1.0.0.1.  It also says French as the language.  Although Amaya is
built with libwww as part of it, this should say Amaya as the application
name, English, French, and any other languages supported by Amaya and 5.3 as
the version.
Related to this is that when Windows XP automatically shrinks separate Amaya
windows into one taskbar button, it gives libwww as the label.
The properties can be reached by right-clicking amaya.exe and clicking
properties.  Then, click the version tab.
