Unfortunately when the image is the sole object in the paragraph
there are also problems... perhaps in these cases (nul size), the
percent should be omitted and a full size (ie dimensions set by 
original image) used.

Since center and break convey no vertical size, the next closest 
structure should be used.  there are probably other elements that
should not be considered either.   

Using <td height="x%"><img height="100%"> may work but defies
  logic, readability, and common sense as height="100%" is redundant.
