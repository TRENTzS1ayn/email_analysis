This has been an issue with Amaya ever since I began using version 1.x a
couple of years ago. The current selection is redrawn in its entirety
everytime the mouse moves. 

While this is just bearable on my Celeron 300, it makes Amaya
practically unusable on slower machines.

This really is an annoying, ugly feature of Amaya. Is there any plan to
fix it? The problem exists on both Windows and Linux.

Applies to Amaya V4.2.1, for Linux i386 and Windows and probably other
platforms.

A little attention to the quality of the Amaya interface would make this
a wonderful application to use. As it is, it looks and feels somewhat
clunky.
