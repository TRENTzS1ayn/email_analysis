This is such a troublesome value for this particular 
attribute that coders should be warned to avoid if possible.

And specification writers should be repremanded and asked 
to clarify the defining document as to what the percentage is
referenced to.  It is very unclear and the two 'big guys' have chosen
to interpret in a way that minimizes problems but probably is
less general than anticipated by the writers.  Also since 
it has been shown that 'correct' implementation is extremely
difficult, those that make the specs should rewrite with 
restrictions or references that are DOABLE.   
This would allow mere coders to be able to anticipate the 
displayed results of their efforts.  

In brief, the Amaya group should liaze with the definers group
 and feedback the challenges of the more difficult to implement
 components of the language.
