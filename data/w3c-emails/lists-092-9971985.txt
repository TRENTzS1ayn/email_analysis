Perhaps it would be more appropriate for Amaya to store
in the same format that was input. (#1)
Or identify from the doctype which is the appropriate format
to output in. (#2)
Especially if the doctype refuses a specific format on input,
the output should DEFINITELY NOT output in that refused format.
My vote goes for action #2 as this sets a predictable and
probably the most desired outcome expected by the author.
and Amaya is supposed to be an authoring tool.
