Here is a suggestion regarding documentation for the
coming release of Amaya.  Please include a disclaimer section
on w3.org that cites areas or components that are incomplete.
Most ordinary users would expect complete implementation
of html4 and css1 as the specs for these are very old.
Components of these that are still unimplemented should
be documented as such and known bugs should also be
remarked on. Areas that have a low expectation of being 
implemented could be noted as such as well.  This 
document will assist users in their decision to download,
as well as helping those who are tracking or finding bugs
to know whether they are 'known' ones or 'undiscovered' 
ones.
There have been so many remarks on the lack of frames,
floating images and Javascript that these should be 
specifically mentioned.  Also worthy of mention is the
several issues within forms and missing CSS1 bits.   

Newer specs and components such as MathML, SVG
and internationalization do not need these disclaimers
as most realize they are in development but if one wishes
to include them for completeness of the disclaimer document
that would be ok as well.
