  Yes, it is a limitation of the current implementation.  It's not a parsing
error, it's a storing error due to limitation of way CSS rules are stored as
P structures. I don't have a way right now to try to distinghish

     A.class B { ... }  from A B.class { ... }

So I merged both, even if it has a completely different semantic, sorry .

Adding this capability need to change things inside ! And of course all CSS
rules shown are produce by analysing the internal P structures, not storing
ASCII strings (or more precisely octet strings :-) )
