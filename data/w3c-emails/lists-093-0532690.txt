1. The Open file' dialog only shows me files with .html extension. I
guess later versions will use a standard Motif-like file selector box?

2. When typing in the `Open location' field in the file dialog box,
the program appears to try to read the directory after every key I
type. This is much too slow. Try it on an AFS volume...

3. The `Format' dialog box shows labels like `miidn', `meiin' and
`mfogn', where I suppose `left' `center' and `right' is meant. Other
labels in that box have nonsense text as well.

4. When I edit in the structure view and press the delete or ^D key,
no other keys are accepted any more until I click the mouse...

5. When I try to remove an element like EM (make it plain text again),
you'll have to select `emphasis' from the menu again. There is no
indication in the menu that this is a toggle. A checkbox next to the
menu item would have been nice. A menu item `plain' that removes all
character-level elements at once could also be useful.

6. Is it possible to add a `smart spaces' mode, that automatically
removes superfluous spaces?

7. I put the cursor between two words, selected `emphasis' to insert
an EM element, then changed my mind and selected `emphasis' again to
remove it. But an element of some sort remained that I couldn't
delete. The structure view showed:

    | on a page can
    |
    | enhance your

The empty line in the middle causes extra spaces to appear in the
formatted view, which cannot be remoced.

8. It crashed. I don't know why and I can't reproduce it:-( This is
what was printed on my terminal:

X11 Error : BadValue (integer parameter out of range for operation)
No alphabet file
line 5, char 8: unexpected end tag </style>

Erreur VolReduit: dVol=2053 volume vue=  0
View is modified before creation

9. There is no <Q> element.

10. Suddenly the structure view didn't show the structure anymore, but
only the style sheet. Then even that was gone and an empty structure
view remained.

11. After I did a `create class', the view scrolled to the top of the
page and my cursor was lost.

12. Is it possible to add some more Emacs-like commands, such as
next-word, previous-word, swap-characters?

13. The default font of Amaya is rather small on my system. Can Amaya
be made to support the font-size keywords like `small' `medium' etc.,
together with a configuration option or dialog that sets the actual
size for `medium'?

14. When I move the mouse out of the window, keystrokes are lost.

15. Amaya doesn't do cut and paste using X selections. I can't copy
from an xterm, e.g.

16. I cannot change a paragraph into a PRE element.

17. The `End' key brings me to the end of the document. Why not to the
end of the line?

18. How do I enter characters like &emdash; and &endash;?

19. When I selected a PRE element and put a DIV around it, the status
line showed `Preformatted\Division\BODY\HTML' instead of
`Division\Preformatted\BODY\HTML'.

20. The list of classes in the `apply class' dialog is not
sorted.

21. The ESC key doesn't select inline elements. Maybe it is more
consistent if it does.

22. There is no way to select a stretch of text without the
mouse. Shift-cursorkey is the common method for that.

23. The latest CSS1 draft (no published yet) allows the style sheet to
be surrounded by <!-- -->, to hide it from old browsers. Thus, the
type for STYLE will become

    <!element style - - cdata>

and a style sheet like

    <style>
    <!-- BODY {background: white} -->
    </style>

should be allowed. Currently, Amaya (correctly) ignores such a style
sheet.

24. Style rules for classes are saved without a leading dot:

    example {...}

instead of

    .example {...}
