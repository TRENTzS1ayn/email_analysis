I don't agree

I changed this feature.  The program reads the directory only after typed '/'.

It is ok now. The icon file was missing.

I never see that. Can you explain what we have to do to detect this problem.

Perhaps in the next version.

Not corrected yet.

Because the directory dicopar was missing. Corrected.

I don't know this tag. What is it ?

I suppose that the error comes from a delete of something like Title or Body.
We added controls to prevent user to delete them.

Not corrected in the current version.

Ok, but not implemented in the current version.

To control Amaya font menu size add a line into .Xdefaults file :
amaya*FontMenuSize: 14

To control Amaya default document font size, use a CSS file :
$HOME/.amaya.css that includes the following line
BODY { magnification: 1}

Now it is possible.

Yes, we will change it in next release.

We will add it in next release.

OK. It is a bug.

Yes you right.
