  Hi Bert,

First note that the mailing list has been changed to be the same
as on w3.org.

  This has been part of the CSS specification draft some time ago. It has
been removed since but I think it's useful for user's preferences, so I
maintained it in Amaya.

   See http://www.w3.org/{team, member}/WWW/Amaya/User/CSS.html for the
current status, what's in, what's not.

   The full ISO-Latin-1 charset is supported except the division
and the multiply characters which are used for the rendering of
OElig and oelig wich are not part of the ISO.

   See http://www.w3.org/{team, member}/WWW/Amaya/User/Keyboard.html for
complete table of key, name and keyboard mapping.

  What should be the sorting order ? There is no predefined order,
except that HTML and BODY should go first, and an alphabetic one
doesn't seem good. 

   How would you compare ".pinky" (class) and "H1 EM" ?

Agreed, that's common use.

>Daniel answer : won't be supported, too uggly !!!

   I just hope it won't become a standard just because of Netscape
old bad behaviour on unknown elements in HEAD

>daniel : ??? was thinking it was working, will be corrected ASAP !

  Yes I am quite surprised ... Will check an correct it !
