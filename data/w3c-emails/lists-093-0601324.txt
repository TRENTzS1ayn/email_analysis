Hi,

I just downloaded the alpha 0.8 release of Amaya.

When it brings up the initial page it appears to be displaying it
as black text on a black background and so it is unreadable.

This appears to happening to me for all sites I visit other than
those that specify an explicit background color.

Hyperlinks to other pages are visible and show up as blue text on
a black background.  Consequently all I get to see is the occassional
blue word on a black background.

Discounting this, my limited perception of Amaya is it seems pretty
cool, and once the bugs are ironed out it might be able to give Grail
a run for its money.

One question, why isn't the source for Amaya available yet?  And
could it be made available?  Having source would allow me to better
evaluate whether Amaya is something Cygnus might eventually want to
adopt and provide to customers.  (In the past we have been doing
development work on top of both Arena and SurfIt!.  Neither of these
has really proven suitable for our long term use due to source code
quality issues.  The only other alternative, Grail, hasn't been practical
because the licensing terms have for a long time been problematic.)
Having the source code to Amaya available, even if only a very early
version, would give us an incite into this question.  It would also
make it possible for us to fix bugs and send the fixes back to you.

                                             thanks,
                                                     gordoni
