  Gasp, seems that you are running out of color cell in the colormap.
The current version of Amaya pre-allocate a number of colors upon
startup and it seems that it wasn't abble to allocate the full set.
Please try to remove concurent applications using lots of colors like
background images or other browsers. One can easily detect whether
Amaya couldn't allocate the full set by opening the Color palette in 
the Style menu. Each cell should have a specific color allocated.

  This is just a side effect, the blue color was probably one of the
only ones correctly allocated.

  Thanks.

  As explained in the member Activity page for Amaya,

     http://www.w3.org/member/WWW/Amaya/Activity.html

the source code will be made available in December to the members.
In the meantime we will work on the code, cleaning it, and translating
parts wich are still coded and commented in French.
In october, we will release the code for the HTML/HTTP specific parts
and binary versions of the underlying libraries. You will be able to
evaluate the API and part of the source code at this point, as well as
modifying Amaya for specific needs.
