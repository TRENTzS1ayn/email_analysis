No. The entity corresponding to character '<' (less than) is "lt".
Amaya is right.

If you make the change in the Title field, on top of the WYSIWYG view,
you must hit the Return (or Enter) key to validate the change. That's the
same for the Location field: nothing happens until you hit Return.
You may also change the title in the Structure view.

That's a bug. We will try to fix it in the next release.

Use Control + Return
The <BR> does not appear in the structure view, but it is generated
in the html file.

Not in this version, sorry.

Good suggestion.
You can also create an empty element (for instance a paragraph) and
select it, before pasting. The new element is inserted at that place.
