1. When trying to set a SPAN to bold italic, I only get italic.

2. It seems impossible to remove underlining once it has been
set. Selecting `normal' in the character style box doesn't seem to
work.

3. The cursor-left key makes the cursor jump to random places. Usually
a few lines before where it should be. Ctrl-F and Ctrl-B sometimes do
the same. (But I like the extra left/right required to cross an
invisible element boundary; unfortunately, it doesn't always work.)

4. Probably the same problem: when selecting a word and typing text to
replace it, some random element earlier in the document gets replaced
instead.
