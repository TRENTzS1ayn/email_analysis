I suppose you use item Character Style from the Style menu.
The problem comes from the standard fonts available in X-Window.
There is probably no bold italic font. But check in the Structure view:
the style attribute associated with the SPAN is ok.

I have tried. It works. Could you give me more details about the
context in which it occurs?

It doesn't happen here. Could you give me more details?
Ctrl-F and Ctrl-B are not equivalent to cursor-right and cursor-left.
They move the current selection element by element, not character by
character.

Some bugs have been fixed recently. You could perhaps get a new copy
of Amaya. The latest version has been released on July 15.
