  Hi Catherine,

  This is a known bug, I think it is already corrected and should
hopefully be removed in next release. In the meantime, I think that
i you just click on one character in the anchor and select Delete
anchor in the Menu (without extending the selection to the full anchor),
the anchor should be suppressed without crashing Amaya (I'm not sure,
it's just from memory).

Daniel
