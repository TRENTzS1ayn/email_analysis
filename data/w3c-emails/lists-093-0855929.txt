Hi,

it's really nice of you people to provide us with this.
But I would like to make a suggestion - could you please put the file on
an ftp server ? I tried at least 15 times to get it via http (using
netscape AND lynx) to no avail - the best I could get were about 800kB.
Getting it from a decent ftp server would allow to use the command 'reget' -
1,5MB are quite a lot to get via http, especially for people on the wrong
(internet-wise) side of the Atlantic Ocean...

Thanx in advance

Hannes
