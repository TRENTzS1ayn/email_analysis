Hi
After having waited for many many months for a version to test, I now
see that Amaya is out, but only for Linux.

Is a Solaris 2.5 version planned? When?

I am very interested in Amaya and if you do not have time, I can,
if you send me the source code, generate a binary for Solaris that
you could use.

Regards,
