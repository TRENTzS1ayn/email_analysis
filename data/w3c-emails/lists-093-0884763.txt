Yes. Amaya is an editor and have to show target anchors (light green) and reserve space for 
any empty element.
When an empty element (anchor in your case) exits, Amaya has to allow author
to select it:
- to insert text within,
- to delete it
- to choose this empty anchor as the target of a link.
The better way to do that is to reserve space, even if the anchor is empty.

Your example is:
#include &lt;<a name="qlabel.h"></a><a href="qlabel-h.html">qlabel.h</a>&gt;
Why you don't add the name attribute to the not empty href anchor:
#include &lt;<a name="qlabel.h" href="qlabel-h.html">qlabel.h</a>&gt;
It is the better way to have what you want "at the same place a target and a link".

But CSS allows users to put rectangles around text and Amaya supports CSS.
The solution should be to have two modes for Amaya: a browser mode and an editor mode.
But I am not sure, it is a better solution. Personally, I don't like modes.
