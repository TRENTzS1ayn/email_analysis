  it can be XTerm*background or xterm*background, etc.
I suggest to add these three lines only to
 /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults/XTerm not to the general Xdefault.
But this is not related to Amaya

  seems normal.

One could change the default background color of the pages
by adding :

BODY { background : white }

on in ${HOME}/.amaya.css . But I would rather suggest to correct
your Xdefaults.
