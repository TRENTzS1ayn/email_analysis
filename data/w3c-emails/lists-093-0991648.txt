I just joined this mailing list, and I have the same problem as
nelson@crynwr.com: the fonts are just too small.  However, I'd like
to change the font family (to Helvetica) as well as the font size.

Is there a resource to do this, or should this be done through a HOME
CSS file?  I did a strings on the binary and have been trying whatever
looked appropriate, but so far nothing has worked (or is the FontList
resource format different than just the font specification?).
