Sorry, it seems that the AIX version was badly generated.
I've redone the job and the version is now available form the http server.
I guess you have to wait a while to download this new version from
ftp servers. Could you check the date before downloading the version (the
right one is July 13 or later).

Thankx for quick report
  Irene.
