Installed the new release 1.3
System Linux 2.0.29 PPro 32Mb

Amaya starts up as far as making its top panel and then freezes.
No buttons then respond. It can be killed from the window manager using
"destroy".

Did all the recommended stuff:
If Amaya doesn't seems to work, check the following points: 
      1.the DISPLAY variable is correctly set. 
      2.eventually remove your previous registry file $HOME/.thotrc. 
      3.The binary just installed is the correct one, i.e. it is the
correct binaries for the current machine (don't try to
        start the Linux-ELF version on a Solaris machine or an old Linux
a.out installation). 
      4.If the binary version is ok, check the availability of the dynamic
libraries needed by the executable file
        amayamain (located under Thot/bin/SYSTEM/amaya). for example on a
Linux-ELF system type 

        ldd Thot/LINUX-ELF/bin/amaya

        and check that there is no missing libraries.
Result:

$ ldd Thot/LINUX-ELF/bin/amaya
        libXt.so.6 => /usr/X11R6/lib/libXt.so.6.0
        libSM.so.6 => /usr/X11R6/lib/libSM.so.6.0
        libICE.so.6 => /usr/X11R6/lib/libICE.so.6.3
        libXext.so.6 => /usr/X11R6/lib/libXext.so.6.3
        libX11.so.6 => /usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.so.6.1
        libdl.so.1 => /lib/libdl.so.1.7.14
        libm.so.5 => /lib/libm.so.5.0.6
        libc.so.5 => /lib/libc.so.5.3.12

Version 1.2 runs reasonably ok.

Ian Hutchinson.
