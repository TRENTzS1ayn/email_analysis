Hi,

I think that your problem comes from the HOME environment
variable. Try to open a Command Prompt, Set HOME to ""
and execute Amaya from the Command Prompt

Suppose that you've installed Amaya in C:\Program Files

C:> set HOME=
C:> cd Program Files\Thot\Windows\bin
C:\Program Files\Thot\Windows\bin> amaya

This problem is known and will be solved for the next release.

  Ramzi.
