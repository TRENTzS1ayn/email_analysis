Since no-one posted in response to my previous report:

 Installed the new release 1.3
 System Linux 2.0.29 PPro 32Mb

 Amaya starts up as far as making its top panel and then freezes.
 No buttons then respond. It can be killed from the window manager using
 "destroy".   ...

Perhaps someone could at least give us some information about the linux
version, motif, etc that the 1.3 binary was created with. Then perhaps it
might be possible to guess what to try next.

I have now established that 1.3 does the same freezing problem on two
machines, RedHat versions 4.1 and 4.2, Xfree86 3.3.1. No way am I going to
start randomly installing new libraries on a stable system in case that
might solve the problem. 

No I don't have motif, otherwise I would try to compile it myself.
(Actually I did try, but only got as far as ./configure telling me I did
not have motif -- which I know already -- and so my knowing that amaya
needs it.) 

More information might be really helpful, folks!
