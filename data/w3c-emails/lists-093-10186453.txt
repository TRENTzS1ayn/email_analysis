  Geez, how many times one really need to answer that !
cpp is C PreProcessor (preprocesseur du compilateur C)
The answer is at http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Autoconf.html
Section "If make failed", item 3, bullet 2:

-----------
2.be sure that cpp preprocessor is in the PATH. One can use the following shell script in conjuction with gcc, name it cpp, put it in the PATH with 755 Unix
rights: 

#!/bin/sh
exec `gcc --print-prog-name=cpp` $*

  There is a problem with the new CSS parser which hang (at least on linux
RedHat-5.1) but this was also reported on other distribs, it enters a look
when doing color name lookups on the default page shipped with the
distribution.
  Use amaya URI_to_your document to avoid it, however the bug seem serious
enough that IMHO it's worth rebuilding a corrected Linux binary,
