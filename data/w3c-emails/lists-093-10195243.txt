Although I am impressed by the concepts and some of the implementation of
Amaya (1.3), I am finding it tiring as a usable tool on Windows (NT4 SP3)
because it just doesn't handle as a Windows application should at a basic
level.

I can't select, cut or paste with any degree of certainty and I've found the
DEL key to force-quit Amaya a couple of times now. These are not killer
problems, but they roughen its functionality so that it's an effort to
drive. Is this just my installation or do others have this problem? If the
latter, will a future release of Amaya be worked on so that it runs smoothly
on Windows?

Also, I'm unclear how soon the missing features will appear in Amaya. Will
it be possible to get a view of the rollout schedule for features, or is it
too much a research tool?

Thanks.
