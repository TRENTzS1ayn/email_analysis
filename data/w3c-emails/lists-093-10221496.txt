I try to compile amaya-1.3 on an "Siemens MX300i" with the SINIX V5.41D.

This system has a 486 Intel CPU with 16 MB memory.
The gmake runs and stop with the following error:

The error is in gmake, but only when I am compile amaya-1.3.
The maximal size of the arg-list (execvp) in my system is 5120 Byte.

Is there any possibility to change the makefile??
