I can't get amaya 1.3 to print anything on Digital UNIX 4.0D. I tried to
use the print command directly and got the following message :
WARNING: cannot open file en-printdialogue 

I fixed it by taking the *-printdialogue files from the NT distribution
but it didn't solve the problem.

By the way, print has a lot of options which could be usefull for
improving the page layout (margins, ...). Are they documented somewhere
? Can print be called directly ?

Another light problem : the Views help page was missing from my Windows
distribution.
