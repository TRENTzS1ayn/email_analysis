No, I am sorry, but we don't have the resources needed for supporting
another platform.  But the source code is available and someone else
could do the port.

A good starting point is the Math page on the W3C server:

Amaya does not support Javascript. But there is a version of Amaya with
Java support that should allow you to animate documents and formulas in Java.
At the moment, the API is specific, but we are working on an implementation
of the DOM: http://www.w3.org/DOM
