Sorry, I don't have any good idea...

I'd make sure that "lpr" without arguments is printing properly;
beyond that, I don't know. It isn't obvious what is wrong, and I've
had no problems (beyond the error message we've noted) printing
on Digital UNIX 4.0D. The Amaya folks might have other suggestions.
