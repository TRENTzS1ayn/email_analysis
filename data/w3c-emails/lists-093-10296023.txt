It seems we encountered the same problems. Amaya has the best page
printed paga layout I have seem, but it is a bit young...

I use it on Linux (5.0 & 5.1), Digital UNIX 4.0d and Windows NT4.0 to
try to print a big (around 100 pages, 200 gif images !). The make book
and Section numbering are very usefull, to say the less.

On all systems, I can't get to the end of the document. It works best on
Linux, but still crashes somewhere in the document.

We solved the printing problem on Digital UNIX : it was due to a wrong
definition of TMPDIR in .thotrc, copied from another system.

I cannot reproduce exactly the problem, but I think it comes from the
layout of elements near the bottom of the page. If I can track it down
to a single page, I will post it to the group.
