Some nice ifs....

The control break for the first page header seems to be too early.  
It ought to be immediately before the first rendered output (after 
BODY), so that the document title is available and included.

If I print a table of links in Lynx (or IE), it is because I want to 
be able to key in the URLs from the printout.  Amaya is truncating 
the links.  I think it ought to retain the full URL, and, if 
truncation is needed, truncate the link text.
