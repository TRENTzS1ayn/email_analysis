The URL you quote is not valid HTML.  I would suggest you get it to 
report no errors on http://validator.w3.org/ before comparing 
browsers.  (Whoops - looks like this was forwarded by the owner of
validator.w3.org!)

Secondly HTML is a logical markup language; if you are trying to 
control precise layout, you should use PDF.

There does seem to be a problem with rowspan; it looks like it has 
recongized rowspan, but not the true height of the image.  
(Stretching the image vertically hasn't helped, but it still seems 
to have allocated less than the natural size of the image.

You shouldn't use jpeg for line drawings.

This is yet another possible rendering of the page:
