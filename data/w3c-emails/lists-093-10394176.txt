Dear Irene,

from:
http://www.w3.org/Amaya/
            (...) is available on both Unix and Windows '95/NT 
            platforms. 

whereas from: 
http://www.mactoday.com/factpg.html
            More web pages are created on a Macintosh than any other 
            platform. According to
            WebWEEK, the weekly trade journal for Internet
            Professionals, Macintosh is again the #1 platform for
            professional World Wide Web authoring. In their second
            annual survey, Macs had a 47.9% market share among
            U.S.-based professional web-site design firms where as
            Windows 95 scored only with 24.2% and Windows NT only
            16.5%. (Source: WebWeek Magazine, 1997 www.webweek.com)

are there any plans to zero this significant discrepancy?
