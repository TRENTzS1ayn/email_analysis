[SNIP]

This looks as if your gmake couldn't read the libwww Makefile.in. I verified
and this files are indeed included in the tar file of the source code.

If you have automake, try to go to the w3c-libwww-5.0a directory and 
type automake. This should generate the Makefile.in files. Then try to 
compile again.

If you still have problems, try to go again to the w3c-libwww-5.0a, then
create a subdir there called, for example, siemens. Go to the directory
and type ../configure. If this works ok, then cd to Library/src
and type make. This should generate the file libwww.a. Now copy this file
to the thot/your-architecture directory and type make amaya in that
directory.
   
I'm not sure if this will fix your problem, though.

Please keep us update,

Thanks!

-Jose
