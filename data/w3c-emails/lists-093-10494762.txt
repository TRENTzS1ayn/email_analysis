Given this list is quiet, I have not heard mention of a FAQ, so
is there one, please?

I am using Amaya 1.3 for Solaris2 (I obtained the binaries).

The following things don't semm to have been covered before so I hope
they are not in the FAQ I haven't found.

Given that there is a Web Accessibility Initiative, and in particular:
http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-WAI-USERAGENT/#Default-Style
I would like to see the following added to Amaya:
A properties menu, that will allow me to select default values for
text colour, size, and font, background colour, colour of links,
visited links.   It would be best to keep
this as simple as possible, but flexible -- so user can just
specify "enlarge all text by 400%", "replace italics by
bold", but can get to the nitty gritty: "I would like text
bounded by <H3>...</H3> displayed as .... font, ...size...colour".
I have managed to set some things in my .thotrc, but
ForegroundColor has only affected the buttons and text boxes, and
I have not been able to alter the default colour of links.  I have
not been able to alter the size of text in the document window,
only at the top.
I say a menu because this should be easy to set up, especially
as Amaya documentation will be read using Amaya.
An algorithm that will recognise that a page's colour will be "near to"
my selected colour, so that if a person has a partially
transparent image for example, my choice of a black bacground will
not render the whole image invisible.
Asking for a BackgroundColor=Black has made all the non-link
text disappear, which wasn't quite the reduction in glare I had in
mind :-)
Yes, it is tricky (distance in HSV space?), but I would like this
algorithm to be considered in the (far?) future.
A grammar for the .thotrc and other files: I don't know what some of the
values should be, and for colours,. names seem to work, but would
the #hexadecimal form, for example?  Ok, it is stated the docs
are a work in progress.
More info about the Proxy Server setup:-  This should be a "best choice",
unlike Netscape which regards a proxy as the only choice. With
Netscape, if the proxy server is down then it says it cannot
do anything instead of just using the network directly.  Their
browser has no means of temporarily disabling it, which Mosaic
had. Maybe there could be more than one Proxy server to choose
from, for a number of fallback positions?
The Views have a Structure window, but not a Source window, which could
be a useful alternative view of the same info. I like the
idea of the text-only view.

Currently I am having difficulties with the small print in Amaya, so I 
hope you will take these comment/suggestions in the constructive way they
are meant.

Overall I think it is good, and it is nice to have an alternative to 
Netscape or IE. Keeping browsers up-to-date with the fast changing WWW
is a big task, so I appreciate your efforts.

Thank you,
Hugh
