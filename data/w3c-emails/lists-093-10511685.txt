Hi,
   I am a final year student in the Indian Institute of Science,
Bangalore doing my Masters.
   I am new to this mailing-list and also a new user of Amaya. Can I get
to know the exact subset of MathML elements and entities supported by
Amaya ? I am not able to view entities like "&ll" and also MathML elements
like <mtd>.

Bye,
   Ashes
