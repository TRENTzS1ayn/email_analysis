Hi,

Tthe exact subset of MathML elements and entities supported by Amaya is
described in the Math.html page (see help command):
Amaya doesn't implement the Content Markup, but only the Presentation Markup.
The <mtd> element is supported, it's part of the matrix.
Some entities can be missing, but I don't know the entity "&ll".
Regards
  Irene.
