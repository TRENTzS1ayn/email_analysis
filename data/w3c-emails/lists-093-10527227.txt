Hallo,

I was using amaya brouwsing the www.w3.org site and came over the style
page: http://www.w3.org/Style. This resulted in the next problems:

This page was not readable with amaya: the W3C logo displays behind the
text. Browsing the same page with Netscape (4.x) It showed a more readable
page. Below I include the reply of Hakon, the producer of the page.

Amaya also produced the next error:
 *** Errors in http://www.w3.org/Style/ temp file: .amaya/1/Style
   line 257, char 57: Unknown tag <BLINK>
   line 258, char 12: Unknown tag </BLINK>

Questions to the amaya maillist: 
- Is there a list of not supported features?
- Is there a list of not supported tags?
- What is the roadmap of amaya related to those not supported features and
tags?
- Is amaya tested against the www.w3.org site (or around: the site against
amaya?)

Regards,
Corne

The page is correct, but demanding. The CSS support in Amaya hasn't
come far enough to support the features used, including negative
margins. Feel free to remind the Amaya developers that some additional
CSS support would be helpful.
