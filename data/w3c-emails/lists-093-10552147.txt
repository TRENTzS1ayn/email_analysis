I don't think this is wrong, I experience the same behavoure. I think this
is because Amaya is an editor with limited brouwser capabilities. It is not
a brouwser with edit capabilities.

You think you are filling out the form but you are not, you are editing the
file!
- Fill out the form and save the file to a local file. Open it with an ascii
editor and see.
- Have a look at the structure while you are typing.

It might be a good idea to be able to switch amaya to brouwse/test/read-only
mode so you can test your forms or browse with it.

CB
