<BLINK> is not a valid tag. Hakon Lie inserted it in his Style page, but
explains that you don't have to use that: 
"By attaching style sheets to structured documents on the Web (e.g. HTML), 
authors and readers can influence the presentation of documents without 
sacrificing device-independence or adding new HTML tags"

http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/CSSStatus.html gives previous status of CSS 
support in Amaya

> - Is there a list of not supported tags?

We plan to list them in next release

> - What is the roadmap of amaya related to those not supported features and tags?

See http://www.w3.org/Amaya/Activity.html "What the Future Holds"

> - Is amaya tested against the www.w3.org site (or around: the site against amaya?)

As much as possible. We have no time to download all www.w3.org site pages 
before each
release.

Regards
  Irene.
