Oops, the CSS support changed and I forgot to update this page. It's OK now.
Since release 1.3, the Style sheet menu item gives only the list of downloaded
CSS files. If you don't have any downloaded CSS file, this button has no 
action.

We plan in the future to allow users to read, edit and write CSS files as any 
other HTML files. The implementation is not done yet, but the Style sheet 
menu item should be useful to open a downloaded CSS file.

Regards
  Irene.
