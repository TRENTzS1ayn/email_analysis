Hi,

I know it's not the kind of questions than developpers like to be asked
but i work with Amaya & Thot for a time now (couple of month) and i don't
find what i'm looking for by my own.  My questions are:

How can i obtain up to date description of the API.  Can i use Cextract to
do it? if yes how? if no, does it exist something who can help me?

Where i can find description of the new feature added to Structure
language, presentation language ...? Some time it's hard to figure what do
the new keyword in the grammar.

I appreciate to know about any source of information, i already browse the
amaya and thot Web site, thot ftp site and mailing lists.  Did i miss
something ?

Merci beaucoup!

David
