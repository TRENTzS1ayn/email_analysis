Hi
When I "Open Document" in Amaya installed for Win95, and I "Browse" to
open a local file, Amaya totally shuts down when I "Confirm" the
selected file. I've tried the Enter key instead, as welll as opening a
new window but that does not work either. It also does not take an
address typed in the Address box.

Is there a bug in the program?

BTW I agree with Mario Alves that Amaya should focus on being a browser
-- and a proper one. Forget about your authoring service.

Thank you
Jacques
