Could you analyze what has changed when amaya decided to ignore double-clicks?
It should be a great help to understand what is the problem.

I am convinced that Amaya could be this (a 100% error free HTML 4 compliant browser) _if and only if_ the Amaya team would focus on the browser itself. A WYSIWYG HTML editor simply does not make any sense! HTML is a _language_! I bet 99.999999% of HTML authors prefer to write HTML by hand. (I also suspect that many Amaya bugs are actualy in---or caused by---the Thot system. If this is true, and then since (as I understand) Thot development has stopped, then if Amaya would focus on browsing it would be less costly to migrate to a more stable system.)

I don't agree with you Mario. 
80% of HTML authors use authoring tools (like FrontPage, Home Page, Page Mill, 
Netscape-Composer, etc.).
HLML 4, MathML and then XML are not so easy to write by hand!

True, but that needs a lot of work in current browsers.
