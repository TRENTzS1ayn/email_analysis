You know, I'm not in love with the amaya team. They don't answer
my questions, ignore or flame my remarks, and produce more bugs than line
of codes (well, that last one is not true! - put as many smiley here as
you wish:). In fact I'm even ashamed some of them are from the well renown
french INRIA. :(
Anyway, amaya is more a tool to test the standard than a declared
browser or even wysiwyg editor. As such, bugs should be forgiven. I would
defend them against unjustified attacks. And this one is not justified at
all.
More : please be sure that the easyer the tool, the happier the
user. Web creators don't need to be programmers. They shall be graphists,
artists, publicists, journalists, whatever, but the ruling of our race
(programmers) on the web is to be done. Thus a WYSIWIG html generator is
needed, asked for and used when available. Even programmers like I am
(those who focus on the result and not on the way) use perl and emacs only
because they have no better editor handy to generate good and errorfree
HTML.
I support the amaya team to develop and give as a free tool
something that otherwise is unheard of.
