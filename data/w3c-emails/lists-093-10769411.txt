Hello,

We may forget to answer some questions but we take into account
all remarks, suggestions and bug reports sent to the mailing list.
You say that you are ashamed that some of us are from INRIA.
Let me tell you that we are only two people (both from INRIA) fully 
involved in the project. We have to correct bugs, develop new
features and W3C recommandations, and answer questions. Do you think
that this is an easy task.
