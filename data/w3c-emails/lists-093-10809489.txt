Amaya wont respont to doubleclicking the
links WHEN RUN REMOTELY (i.e. from an X-client,
vd. infra).

The same Amaya binary runs well when
operated locally, i.e. from the console
of the PC where it is installed.

The remote execution is launched with the
following exchange:

bash[here]$ xhost +
bash[here]$ rsh server
Password:
Linux 2.0.32.
Last login: Wed Sep 23 11:19:41 on tty1.
No mail.
bash[there]$ export DISPLAY=here:0
bash[there]$ amaya

('here' is the PC where I am working,
'there' is the PC where Amaya is installed).
I am not a Linux sage so perhaps I am forgeting
something.

My thanks to everybody.
