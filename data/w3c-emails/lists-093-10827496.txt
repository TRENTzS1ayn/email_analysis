    The Amaya team is proud to announce the availability of the 1.3a release
    of Amaya editor/browser.

    This release includes a lot of new features and bug fixes.
    The binary is available at:
            http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/BinDist.html

    The source is available at:

This file lists the bugs that have been fixed and the extensions that
have been introduced in Amaya and Thot since version 1.2 of Amaya.

New features:
-------------
* Amaya tries to save modified documents when it crashes. Then, the next Amaya 
session proposes to reload theses documents when it starts.

* Target anchors are no longer displayed in green. All elements which can be 
used as a target for a link show a target icon. These icons are always visible 
in the "Links" view. In the "Formatted view", the user has to ask Amaya to 
show them. An entry "Show targets" in the "Views" menu alternatively shows or 
hides target icons in the "Formatted view". When the user wants to create a 
link to a specific element, s/he must click on the corresponding target icon.

* New version of the jpeg library (except for the Windows version).

* Amaya uses the latest version of libwww.  This version provides Amaya
  with an up-to-date implementation of HTTP/1.1 including pipelining and
  caching.
 
* Amaya can save documents in XML. Command Save As proposes 3 output formats:
  HTML, XML, Plain text.  When a document is saved in XML, the usual HTML
  structure is used, but it is written in the XML language.
 
* Conversely, Amaya can read HTML documents written in XML. These documents
  can then be edited and saved in HTML, XML or plain text.
 
* When saving a document in XML, namespaces are used if the document
  contains XML elements such as mathematical expressions in MathML or
  2D vector graphics.
 
* The following HTML 4.0 elements are available:
  NOSCRIPT, LABEL, BUTTON

* Some support is provided for frames: the parser recognizes tags FRAMESET,
  FRAME, and NOFRAMES as well as their attributes and Amaya displays them
  as if they were links.  You can double click them to fetch the
  corresponding page.
 
* The following HTML 4.0 attributes are available:
  onload, onunload, charset, hreflang, target, accesskey, tabindex,
  onfocus, onblur, media, longdesc, declare, archive, standby, valuetype,
  object, onsubmit, onreset, accept-charset, disabled, readonly, onselect,
  onchange, accept, label, char, charoff, summary, frame, rules, datapagesize,
  abbr, axis, headers, scope, profile, scheme, language, defer, event, for
 
* All HTML 4.0 character entities are accepted by the HTML parser and are
  generated when saving HTML files.
 
* You can create STYLE and SCRIPT elements with the Structure menu in the
  Structure_view
 
* You can edit the content of elements STYLE and SCRIPT in the Structure_view

* Characters that are not available on the keyboard can be entered by key
  sequences. For instance, e acute is entered by pressing key ' and then key e.
  This multi-key support is now available on Windows platforms. On Unix and
  Windows it is optional and needs to be requested by setting 
  "ENABLE_MULTIKEY=YES" in the registry file ($HOME/.thotrc for Unix 
  platforms or Thot/config/thot.rc for Windows platforms).

* Amaya fixes nested lists generated by Mozilla: when a OL or UL is a child
  of another OL or UL, the former is considered by the Amaya parser as a
  child of its previous LI sibling. According to the HTML DTD, the only
  allowed children for a UL or OL are LIs.

Fixed bugs:
----------
* Improvement of the auto-scroll on dragging and availability on Windows
  version.

* Improvement of the printing of tables: when a table was split by a page
  break, the page header and the page footer were overlapped by some table 
elements.

* To be consistent with other editors, the management of the Backspace is 
  modified. With a non-empty selection the Backspace deletes the current 
  selection but not the previous character.

* Improvement of CSS parsing. Style commands (format, colors, etc.) are also 
improved. 

* Sometimes it was impossible to copy/paste from Amaya to another application.

* Improvement of form handling:
  - Password fields in forms showed the text which is being typed in.
  - Some special characters in the query string were not being correctly
     escaped.
  - There was a limitation on the size of the query string.
  - It wasn't possible to type a CR in the textarea zone
  
* When the user filled a form the document was set modified.

* The default color of ReadOnly documents is now black.

* Bullets in UL elements didn't grow with the UL size. Now it works.

* When saving a document, the document status was set unmodified even if the 
operation failed. "Save As" could change attributes URL and SRC. If the saving 
failed old values were lost. Now Amaya restores the previous document state.

* Improvement of the vertical table formatting.

* Broken pipes weren't taken into account under AIX

* The attribute "content" of element "meta" can incluse double quotes. In that 
case, Amaya have to generate simple quotes around the attribute value.

Known bugs:
----------
* By integrating the newest libwww, we got a very good implementation of
  HTTP/1.1. However, this version of the library can be fragile when
  contacting badly implemented HTTP/1.0 servers. For example, servers
  that don't send the correct headers or which don't understand the
  1.1 protocol version in the request.

* Pushing the stop button in any document window closes all the open
  connections in all the document windows.

* Entities in URLs should be converted before being sent to the server.
