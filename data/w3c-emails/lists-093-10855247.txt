A plain text editing mode is difficult to handle in Amaya because
Amaya works on the document tree structure and not on its text form.
In fact editor/browser which allows you to edit the text form uses
 a different tool to edit and reloads automatically the document 
when it's saved.
You can do it with Amaya but the process is not automatic.

I guess the structure view is very useful to learn html.
