I wouldn't consider the effect you are trying to achieve to be true 
columns, which to me only make sense on paged media and allow the 
browser to select the column break position.  I would say the effect 
you are trying to achieve here should be done with two absolutely 
positioned divisions, possibly within a relatively positioned one.

In my experience IE 4 understands divisions a lot better than NS 4.
