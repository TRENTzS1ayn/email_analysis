In the current release, Amaya ignores style sheets when printing.  More precisely,
it ignores file $Home/.amaya.css, the STYLE element in the HEAD of the document,
and external style sheets linked to the document by a LINK element.  The only
way to have a CSS rule to be interpreted when printing is to use a STYLE
attribute.

So, to print a document with larger characters, you have to change the body element:

   <body style="font-size: 16pt">

Obviously, if the document contains such tags as <font size="1"> the corresponding
elements will still be too small...

We are considering some improvements in style sheet handling for the next major
release of Amaya.  Solving this problem is clearly part of these improvements.
