Mark,

Thanks for your comments. They are very well appreciated.
Here's an answer to one of your points. The other parts of your mail will
be answered later on.

You can also specify a home page when executing Amaya from the command-line :

> amaya http://myhomepage.html

or even

> amaya /dir/path/myhomepage.html

You could add an alias in your environment to map the amaya command
into one of the above lines.

I agree that the best way would be to have some kind of configuration
menu inside Amaya, where you could specify your profile, without having
to modify any other files.

Is this what you had in mind?

Greetings,

-Jose
