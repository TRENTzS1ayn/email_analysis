Hi there,

Since Version 1.3a amaya is unable to handle calls to cgi scripts with
cmdline args correctly.

When i try 'amaya http://jusa.telco-tech.de/cgi-bin/LINKS?Development'
aamya crashes with '*** Thot: Irrecoverable error ***'. When i call this by
clicking a URL I can see the correct call in the addressline but the
script is called without the cmdlineargs.

I have tried this with the precompiled version on a linux-2.0.34 (lib5) machine
and with a handmade version (libc6/lesstif) on a linux-2.0.35 machine
