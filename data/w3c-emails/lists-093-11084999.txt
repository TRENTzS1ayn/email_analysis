Hi,

Thanks for your report. It's a small bug in the Windows version which crashes 
the 
Amaya print. It'll be fixed in next release.

Today, if you want to print the Amaya manual, I suggest you to remove the item
"Editing mathematics" just before making the book.
Only this part of the manual can be printed.

Regards
  Irene.
