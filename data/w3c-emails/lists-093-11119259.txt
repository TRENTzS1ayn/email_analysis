I use a text editor and several other editors. 
I want something to test HTML 4.0 and CSS 2.0 markup and render it properly.
I want something to test MATHML markup and render it properly.
That does not exits yet. Amaya does not do this yet.
Even Microsoft word can produce HTML. I need to test then HTML from these
editors. The verification service is the only way I have of testing HTML.
That is a slow process. If Amaya could verify HTML 4.0 that would be a 
big step forward. If Amaya could point to the error that would be a 
big step forward. 
You can open two windows, Amaya and the editor. It is
easy to jump between the browser and the editor. There is little advantage
to having them in the same program.
