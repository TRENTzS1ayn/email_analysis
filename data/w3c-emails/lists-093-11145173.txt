Hello!

Is Thot capable to simultaneously use multiple presentations of a document
(in different windows), performing all necessary synchronizations between
them?

If so, why not to create SOURCE presentation for HTML structure? Is it a
question of possible ambiguity of presentations or a question of Thot's
limitations?

Best regards!
