Amaya is mainly an editor. We think that a good editor needs to be also a
browser, because the management of links and the publishing are important parts
of the editing task and they can be well done only if the editor integrates 
browsing 
facilities.
The goal of the W3C and the Amaya team is not to build a product (we don't 
have the
task force to do that), but to push some important ideas. Mixing of editing 
and browsing
is one of them. Another is to avoid people to have to learn HTML, but this can 
be true
only when authoring tools will produce good HTML code.
It seems that you don't like that approach, and you prefer to edit freely the
HTML source. That's OK today for computer scientists but not for many people. 
I agree with you that Amaya has to make progress, we are working on it, but 
you have
to accept to learn a minimum about it to discover that some features should be 
developed
(links management, multi-views, management of map areas, XML support)
