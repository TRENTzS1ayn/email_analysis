I can't build thot/amaya under solaris.


The build fromthot-src-2.1e.tar.gz seems to go smoother than the amaya on the
w3.org site.
Howerver, I still get the problem of:

gmake[1]: *** No rule to make target `../amaya/HTML.S', needed by
`../amaya/HTML.STR'.  Stop.

and sure enough, I don't see any HTML.S files anywhere, or how to make them.
