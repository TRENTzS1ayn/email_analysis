I have problems (or bugs) with amaya:
 
1- when I try to get an image on the left with text lines to the     
right of it. 
   The same html file works fine when I read it with netscape 3.0
   but with amaya I loose both the image and the text lines .???

2- The same file has a few target links between HR or rule lines.
   Only a text name or heading is given to each. The rest has to
   be added later. 
   Again, it's o.k. when read with netscape, but completely 
   disappear under amaya, all I see are the two HR lines and 
   blank lines in between.

Any solution or explanation ???
Thanks,

Claude Morissette
