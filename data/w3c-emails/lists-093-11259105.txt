Yes, this is a common problem for structured editors. But I've heard about
such thing as variable hybrid editor. And I've looked at some papers about
MultiView and TextView. But I'm not good in Thot for a while. So the
questions are:
1. Is there any interest in working in this direction?
2. Is it possible to implement this issue "on top" of Thot (i.e. completely
on application level (on level of Amaya for example), without changing
Thot's source code).
3. Is it possible to implement this issue "inside" of Thot (i.e. without
changing an application).
Excuse my possible offtopic, but this is quite interesting.

PS: It seems that Thot mailing list does not exist.
