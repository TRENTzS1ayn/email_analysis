Hello Gernot,

We verified the problem you described using solaris, linux, and windows NT
and couldn't reproduce it.

I have the impression that when you type the command string, your shell
is intercepting the ? char. Try to execute it again enclosing the
arguments to amaya inside quotes:

amaya "http://your-url?parameters"

Could you tell me if this works now? 

This doesn't explain the crash you reported. If you compiled under
debug, could you mail me a stack trace after the crash?

Thanks for your feedback,

-Jose
