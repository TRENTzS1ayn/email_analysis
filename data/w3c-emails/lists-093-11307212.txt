Hi.  Using amaya 1.3a on a Debian 1.3.1 box and 
having a problem saving the page to the server.  The 
message I get is:

"Failed to save to URL http://www.etc.etc.  
 Access to http://www.etc.etc is forbidden
 by rule Save to disk."
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
I don't understand what this 'rule Save to disk' is.

Are there any suggestions?

thanks,
