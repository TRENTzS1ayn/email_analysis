Hello Tony,

by rule == one of your httpd server's access control rules.

Should be cleared if we change it to say "by your server".

I don't know if you're authorized to write to the server, though. If
it's so, there's a bug in the current release when editing a remote file.
Amaya reports that the save failed, even though it succeded. 

To go around it, add to your thot.rc (or .thotrc file) the following
line:

NO_REREAD_CHECK=yes

We already fixed this bug and it'll be out in a forthcoming minor release.

Note that the syntax of the above rule will change to:

DISABLE_PUT_CHECK

(or some other nicer sounding name).

Hope this helps,

Thanks for your feedback.

-Jose
