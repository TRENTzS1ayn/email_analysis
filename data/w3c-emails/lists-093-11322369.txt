Thanks for the quick reply.

I do have write permission to the server,
that is I can ftp in to my directory and
'put' the files in and I can publish with
the Netscape web page editor with no problems.
I've tried every combination of http and ftp
paths I can think of, but the file doesn't show
up in my home page directory.  I'll add the 
switch to .thotrc to see if that helps.

Also, I noticed that I get Thot tool kit errors
54 and 55 in the xterm that Amaya was run from.
Any clue where I can find more info on this?

thanks,
