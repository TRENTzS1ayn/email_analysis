Amaya can publish only thru HTTP. FTP publication
is not supported and results in an error message
in the status bar.

Did you try to do an HTTP PUT (publish) using Netscape?
If this doesn't work, your HTTP server may be misconfigured.

There's a Help item (top right button) describing how the
Publishing process works. It also gives some hints on how
to configure the httpd server.

I've tested Amaya 1.3a against both Apache and Jigsaw and
have had no problems to publish from different platforms.

This was a bug that's now fixed. Instead of getting a
"Authentication failed. Retry?" dialogue, you are getting
those errors. Probably Amaya prompted you for a password
and you gave a wrong one. Also, there were some authentication
bugs in libwww which complicated the reuse of authentication
information. Thus, sometimes you could see many requests for
passwords while accessing a protected site. I talk in the past
as all of these bugs have been fixed since then.

Tell me if your server was misconfigured. Looking at the server
logs may give some other clues.

We'll soon have a minor release ready with the bug fixes.
Note that I was able to publish even when those bugs existed.

Thanks for keeping us update.


-Jose
