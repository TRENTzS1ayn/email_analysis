If you change the rule, please only use positive rules: Make it
something like REREADCHECK or PUT_CHECK and not disable_.... or
no_....!!! This avoids problems for peoples who don't read english verry
well. Specially the no_... version is often misunderstood as the
NumberOf_...... I would have the NO_REREAD_CHECK given a number value: 0
for none and 2 for twice!.

So for this (new) rule:
PUT_CHECK=true
