Hi,

I have tried it with enclosing the arguments and the result is
the same like before. The problem is it works with amaya 1.2/1.3.
Only since version 1.3a this error occurs. I think it must be an
internal error because i can see the complete URL (http://...?whatever)
in amaya's adressline.

When i can find the time to recompile amaya i will send more informations.

Regards Gernot,
