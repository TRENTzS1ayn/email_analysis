The lines should give the same results if the wanted result is
available. This is a combination of bold, italics and underline.

Most fonts come with a separate font for bold and italics (and sometimes
also underline). If the font you use is such a font and there is no
bold&italics&underline one, it is up to the application (or the Xserver)
to display a font. This can be forgetting the first code or neglecting
the last one.
