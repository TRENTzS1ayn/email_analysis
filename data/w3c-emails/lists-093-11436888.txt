Extensions 1.3b:
---------------

* Whenever there's an authentication failure, Amaya will ask the user
  if he wants to retry or abandon the operation

* It's now possible to configure different network related timeouts thru
  the registry file

* Amaya now uses the DEFLATE transfer encoding in the HTTP headers

* It's now possible to double-click within Windows selectors (Open Document,
  Spell-checker, etc.)

Fixed bugs 1.3b:
---------------

* Amaya generated line breaks into script and style elements. That has been 
  fixed now.

* Sometimes the Backward and/or Forward buttons didn't work fine if you had 
  successively loaded local and HTTP documents. Now it works.

* There was still a bug in vertical table formatting.

* While saving a remote document which was just edited, Amaya reported
  a failure of the operation, even if it was a success

* When Amaya save a document locally, the user can now give a relative path or
  the "~/xxx" path for images but the corresponding directory need to be
  created before.

* While browsing a protected site, Amaya could prompt the user many times
  for its password (bug inside the new libwww)

* When a paragraph was right aligned and updated, the current line could be not
  redisplayed correctly.

* Attributes vlink and alink were not always interpreted properly

* When changing the type of an existing element (for instance changing a H2
  into a Paragraph), the following elements (H2 elements in that case) were
  not renumbered correctly.

* The Windows version couldn't print the help page of Math.

* When MULTI_KEY is active the input method has been modified to support the
  ? character.
