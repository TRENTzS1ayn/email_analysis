I had similar problem. In my case the problem was I had a "init"
in /sbin o.k., but that was a temporary symlink to init2.0 while
I was changing to upper version of Linux. I found, by luck :) ,
in reading MachineType in /usr/local/Amaya/bin .

The command in there could not 'grep' ELF because of the symlink
init. When changed to actual init program, amaya went on o.k.

Or, it may be another problem from that MachineType script.

Run it directly, if it does not echo "LINUX-ELF", look into
that script you should find out why.

If not, look into /usr/local/Amaya/bin/amaya, command, another 
script, as you already know. 

Good luck :)
