Hi,

First, thanks to the developers of Amaya, it rocks :)

Now, where's the known-bugs list ?

Briefly, it concerns pages with single quoted attributes, eg...
<META http-equiv="PICS-Label"
content='(PICS-1.1 "http://some_url/" blah... '>
After saving with Amaya, the single quotes around the content attribute
convert to double quotes, so what was good html, turns bad due to the
enclosed double quotes.

BTW, I have read html40/intro/sgmltut.html#h-3.2.2 , so I do know the
workarounds :)

Thanks.
