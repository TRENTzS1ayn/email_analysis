Subject PNG 
"I think PNG is intended to be the replacement format to GIF, as it's more
efficient."

I believe that the main reason for the development and support of PNG by
W3C was that GIF contains a patented algorithm owned by Unisys. They
enforce licencing of the patent. Visit their web site to see the licence
conditions.

PNG was an alternative developed by a large community of software engineers
and put in the public domain (I think).

I am told that PNG has better interlacing and transparency and greater
compression than GIF but less compression than JPEG and no animation.

See URL http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-png 

Go to http://www.group42.com/develop.htm for a free implementation in C for
PNG.  Go to http://webreview.com/97/05/09/feature/pngeditors.html for a
list of graphic editors supporting PNG.

So, unless you wish to licence the algorithm (LZW) for a product, use PNG.
