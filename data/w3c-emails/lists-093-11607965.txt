This is fundamental to the Microsoft way of doing things.  Microsoft 
work from file extensions, Unix works from looking at the first few 
bytes (although compilers look at extensions) and Macintosh and web 
servers use out of band file type information.

Internet Explorer, applied to HTML, breaks the Microsoft rule in 
that it uses Unix rules, even when it should be using web rules, and 
will interpret files as HTML in spite of extensions and Content-Type 
declaring otherwise.

(Some tools for Windows will use Unix rules, but will normally only 
be launched based on MS rules.)
