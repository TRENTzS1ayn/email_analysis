In terms of semi-open standards, you already have Postscript and PDF 
(and in my view PDF is technically the right approach for most 
commercial web pages which are about form rather than content).  
Machine generated Postscript tends to look complicated but simple 
diagrams in hand coded Postcript really are quite simple.

PDF is Postcript minus programming but with file structuring for 
fast navigation.  It still has the same primitive graphic operations, 
but they have to work on numbers, not expression.

There are also the ancient Unix draw commands and more recent FIG 
ones.

Commercially, there is Shockwave.
