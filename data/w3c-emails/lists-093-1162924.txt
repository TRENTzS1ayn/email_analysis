This bug should be fixed in the next release.

The problem comes from HTML errors in your document which contains
such structures as the following:

   <PRE><H3>
   Some text
   <HR>

This kind of structure is wrong, according to the HTML DTD.
The <H3> tag is not allowed within a PRE element.
As it is not based on a strict SGML parser, Amaya can accept invalid
structures, but it has some limitations. In a future release we will try
to make it accept headings in preformatted elements.
