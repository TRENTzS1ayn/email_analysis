I did that previously with the same result. I decided to try again from scratch
and it failed again. I think I'm missing a source file. It looks like i'm
missing HTMLAPPS.c . make may not be looking in the right place but I can't
find  that file anywere on my system ether. Here's the output. Thanks.
