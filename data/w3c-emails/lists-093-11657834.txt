I've been having trouble compiling amaya on linux alpha and recently
tried again from scratch. I made the obj dir, did ../configure from that dir,
and then gmake all. I just noticed this line when I ran configure.
I think that may be my problem. where can I get these source files?
Thanks

checking for Motif... (cached) libraries /usr/local/lib, headers /usr/local/include
configure: warning: Thot editor sources not found
creating ./config.status
