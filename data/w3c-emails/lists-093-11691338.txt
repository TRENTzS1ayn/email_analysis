[ I'm resending this message since it didn't seems to have reach the list
  due to a difference in the From field and my subscription address,
  apologies if you get it twice, a couple of other mails have been lost
  but aren't probably worth resending,                          Daniel     ]

 RedHat packages for Amaya-1.3b are available for Linux for the following
targets:
     - i386 Glibc based (RedHat-5.1)
     - i386 Libc5 based (SuSE-1.3)
     - alpha (RedHat-5.1)
     - sparc (RedHat-5.1)

  You can find them on Rufus:
    ftp://rufus.w3.org/pub/amaya/

 There is also a source RPM for people interested in recompiling on other
platforms/processors.

 Those were build on RedHat/5.1, using a homebrew Motif-2.0 library
statically linked in the binary. It uses shared libraries for libz,
the graphics libraries and of course X-Windows.

If you are using amaya on Linux, the dedicated link in the RPM repository
is probably worth bookmarking:
    http://rufus.w3.org/linux/RPM/amaya.html

 Thanks to the SuSE linux team for the initial RPM spec file,

Daniel
