Here is an exchange I have recently had with Claude Morissette
concerning the Linux version of Amaya, which I retrieved within
the last week.  Claude recommended that I post this to www-amaya
to see if there is anyone in the Amaya team that can shed some
light on this.

My first query was:

Claude recommended that I check whether LINUX-ELF was returned by
MachineType, and my response was:

Claude then replied:

===========================================================================
O.K. I am new in Linux, not a guru, but here is what I would try.

You don't get any message or error output because all that stuff
is sent into space (in "air's time" we say in french :), that is to the
"null bucket" .

Look again at the end of the amaya script where you see 3 lines:
 
 ${THOTBIN}/amayamain $HOME_PAGE 2> /dev/null >/dev/null &
else
   ${THOTBIN}/amayamain $* 2> /dev/null >/dev/null &

I would replace the  " 2> /dev/null... " with:

         " 2>airlist & ",  or,  
" 2>errlist & "

for the 2 lines,
 
to get all the stuff in a file "airlist" so you can read it after.

I assume you are invoking amaya in a xterm in X-Window !

Then, if you find out what went wrong and a solution, please tell
me, I would like to know, of course :) !             

Thanks,

Claude Morissette

So if anyone on the Amaya team can give some suggestions on this,
I would appreciate it!
