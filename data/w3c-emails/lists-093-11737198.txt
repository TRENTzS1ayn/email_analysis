Just as HTML has moved towards being a page description language, PDF 
has moved to being a web site language.  On a system that supports 
HTTP byte ranges, you can fairly efficiently access PDF a page at a 
time from the server.  My main point, though, was that most 
commercial web page designers are trying to create page descriptions, 
not revisable, logical document structures, as a result, they are 
fighting HTML to get a controlled layout.

There is nothing that intrinsically requires a PDF file to contain 
binary data, and, in fact, PDF 1.1 format files created by 
ghostscript are pure text, except for the comment, at the beginning,
designed to trick mail programs into treating them as binary, and any 
bit mapped images.  (PDF 1.2 allows the unpatented deflate algorithm,
so these are compressed by ghostscript.)

Conversely, although baseline postscript is printable, there is 
nothing to stop one using exactly the same compression filters as 
used by PDF.  Note that the binary nature of PDF comes from the 
compression; the uncompressed data uses printable format numbers.
The compression is compress or zip type compression, not binary 
coding of values.

The structuring information in PDF (location of objects) does rely on 
exact character offsets, so requires that no DOS/Unix/Mac end of line 
conversions are done.

This is a fragment of a valid real PDF file containing vector 
graphics (m is move, l is line) in text format.
