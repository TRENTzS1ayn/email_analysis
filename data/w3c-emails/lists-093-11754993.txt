I had a hyperlink with the character & in the text; when saving the document,
When saving the document, this is what resulted.

zap.w3.org:/tux/u/jg> amaya
*** Errors in http://www.w3.org/People/Gettys/ temp file: /tux/u/jg/.amaya/1/Gettys
   line 137, char 27: Invalid entity "&T "
*** Thot: Irrecoverable error ***: Error 0
modified documents, if any, will be saved : Error 0

So it appears that Amaya will read in the incorrect HTML, but then only
crash when it comes time to save the document.

This is Amaya 1.3b, on Alpha, but I suspect it is generic.

Here is a snippet of the HTML that caused the crash.

Thanks for saving the file before dying; it saved some editing.
