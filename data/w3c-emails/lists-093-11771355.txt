I downloaded your page with Amaya without any error report.
I guess you fixed this error: you have to use the entity &amp; here.

That is due to another problem without any connection with the invalid entity 
"&T "
I know you downloaded a preliminary version 1.3b. Did you download the 
official 1.3b 
version of October 14?
