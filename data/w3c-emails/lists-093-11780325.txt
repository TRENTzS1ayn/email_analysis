Release 1.1c of Amaya was made in November 1997.  The MathML implementation
in that version was very prototypical, mainly because the MathML specification
itself was still under development.  Since that time MathML has changed a bit,
before it became a recommendation on April 7, 1998. The current implementation
of MathML in Amaya is now based on the recommendation:

   http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-MathML

Irene is right, tags are now written in lowercase and many entities have
changed. &nbsp; should now be replaced by &NonBreakingSpace;

   http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-MathML/chapter6.html#sec6.2.1

but not by &InvisibleTimes; which represents a multiplication, Sorry Irene.

In your particular example, I would recommend to not use any explicit
spacing, because decent MathML formatter, like Amaya, will add the
necessary spaces around operators.  Just try:

   <math>
     <mi>a</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>b</mi>
   </math>
