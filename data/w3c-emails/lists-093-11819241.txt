On Windoze:

The File->Open Document->Browse dialog box only wildcards *.html;
on Windoze, such files are frequently just .htm.  Would be nice to
have the file dialog wildcard on both, so that if your file has a .htm
extension, the "right thing" happens and you can see your file without
having to play with the file type part of the dialog.

Various of the Microsoft utilities do this correctly, so I believe it
can be done.

Silly Microsoft; but when the Web was young, they were still on 6.3 file
names...
