In previous versions of Amaya, anchors with a name (potential targets
for links) were displayed in green.  This has been changed, because it
was ambiguous (style sheets or FONT elements can also change the color
to green) and it did not work with IDs attributes attached to large
elements such as DIVs.
 
In version 1.3, every potential target of a link is represented by a
target icon (even large elements with an ID attribute), but to avoid
disturbing page layout with this icons when you are just browsing,
you have to ask for the target icons to be displayed. Use the Views
menu to do that: there is an item "show targets".
 
When targets are shown, you just have to click a target icon to set
a link. The dialog box for entering URLs is shown only when you don't
click a target icon.
 
I hope it helps,
 
Vincent.
