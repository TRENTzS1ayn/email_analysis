on DU 4.0D.

Select an entire row of a table.  Naively copy the row and try to paste it back.
You get:

 *** Thot: Irrecoverable error ***: Error 0
modified documents, if any, will be saved : Error 0

Amazingly, the recovered file after the crash is correct; I get the
row duplicated.  So whatever is causing the crash is happening after
the paste has been successfully done.
