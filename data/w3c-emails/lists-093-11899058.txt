Actually, the copy and paste problem in tables seems to be generic;
I can copy the contents of a cell, and try to paste it, and Amaya 1.3b
crashes with 

*** Thot: Irrecoverable error ***: Error 0
modified documents, if any, will be saved : Error 0

As before, the recoved file shows that the file was correctly updated.

This makes editing tables, which you often want to duplicate cells in,
a MAJOR problem.
