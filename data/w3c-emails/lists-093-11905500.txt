Hi Jim,

I tested different copy/paste on a Windows, a Solaris and a Linux version but 
they worked fine.
Perhaps, I didn't experiment the same situation. Could you give me more 
information
about the table you were editing and the sequence of operations you did.
That could help me to find the bug.
For your information, I'm currently working on the table editing: I want to 
improve the user 
interface for tables and to optimize the incremental table re-formatting.

Regards
  Irene.
