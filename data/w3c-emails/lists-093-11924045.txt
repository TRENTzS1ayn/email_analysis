Can we have Delete Column and Insert Column commands? I know that the right
number of <Enter>s will add a column at the right hand side of a table, but it
doesn't produce the right effect if I want to insert a column in the middle. 

Deleting each cell individually to delete a column is prone to errors in a big
table, too.

Thanks,
