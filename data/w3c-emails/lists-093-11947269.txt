I have observed a few quirks or bugs in Amaya 1.3a, and hope they may be
addressed soon,  possibly in 1.4.

1. It seems to update the screen very slowly when displaying a large (e.g.
140k) file. (CPU: 166MHz, 95% cycles free; RAM: 32 mb, largely free; no
disk swapping observed. Suspect unintelligent or poorly optimized video or
rendering code.)

2. Amaya does not appear to understand the font tag. (e.g., if I use a font
tag to place a Greek letter in an html file, it shows up Greek in browsers
but shows up in Times New Roman in Amaya.)

3. Image map area editing seems broken: an image map area can't be moved
once placed, and can only be resized down and right, not up and left.
Deleting and recreating the things to position them right rapidly becomes
extremely tedious. Also, there seem to be problems with show/hide image map
areas and selecting of image map areas.

Also, does anyone know of any browser (besides Amaya itself) that supports
HTML 4.0 and XML? I see 4.0-aware editors popping up like mushrooms in the
woods after a rain, but the current and the beta versions of both Netscape
and Internet Exploder conspicuously fail to render MathML correctly and
exhibit other noncompliance. Is there any estimate of when the major PC
browsers will fully support the new standard? (There is no information of
any kind with respect to HTML 4.0 support on either Microsoft or Netscape's
websites. Neither Netscape 4.5 PR2's nor IE beta 5's web pages have word
one to say about 4.0 support; and Netscape 4.5 PR2 does not render MathML
correctly. MSIE 5 I won't touch with a ten-foot-pole, of course, we all
remember the experiences people had with the betas for IE4 with its desktop
integration!)
