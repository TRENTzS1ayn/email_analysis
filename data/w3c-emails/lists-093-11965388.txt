Cascading style sheets? I haven't the foggiest how to use those. I just
want some mathematical markup in my web pages for heaven's sake...

I don't see an option for using this for font changing in Amaya either.
Indeed, if Amaya exhibited such an option and additionally converted <font
face=> to the construct you mentioned in any page loaded, instead of
ignoring the font tag, it would become my editor of choice for this project...

Well, the project got started with Frontpage, but bugs in Frontpage
(notably a serious bug handling very long documents and some page fault
showstoppers with image manipulation) have forced a move to other editors.
Also, more portable HTML would be a plus. The only editor that seems to
nearly fit the bill is Amaya, and all the browsers should be up to speed on
many of the newest HTML 4.0 things soon, where they aren't already. The
only 3 problems with use of Amaya are: 1. How to get it to convert all the
<font> tags into the new stuff; 2. How to get font control editing in Amaya
(a dropdown listing available fonts would be nice, of the variety every
other editor under the sun displays prominently in its toolbar); and 3.
Amaya is slow when the document is fairly sizable.

I'm hoping ver 1.4 will have
* Automatic conversion of obsolete tags on document load.
* Font dropdown in toolbar.
* Smarter rendering of view so as to get decent redraw speed when the   
  document is large, e.g. 180K.
* Better image map support, especially for viewing/editing of
  imagemap areas.
