> * Font dropdown in toolbar.

Fonts have to be an open list.  Even font face= allows you to have 
multiple fallback fonts and it is quite reasonable to specify 
fallback fonts which are not available on the authoring system.

Actually Amaya does have a way of setting up fonts like this 
(style|character style...), although it only seems to know how to 
render its own limited menu, and in any case, allowing Symbol in the 
menu would be encouraging the misuse of fonts.  You can also directly 
edit the style attributes from the attributes menu.

Auto translatiing <font face=... will generally introduce unecessary 
structure in the document, as it will tend to always set the style 
on a span (span is a generic inline element with minimal built in 
semantics) whereas it might be that you are trying to represent your 
idea of how <strong> should look, in which case you should put the 
style on the strong, if only that strong, or in a stylesheet, if it 
applies to all uses of strong.
