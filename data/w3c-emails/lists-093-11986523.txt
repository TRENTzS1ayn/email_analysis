We're currently working on that, but an editor needs to use an incremental
formatting which makes of course the editor rendering slower than the simple 
browser display.

This is not the right method to input greek characters in an HTML document.
Our plan is to support Greek entities and Unicode.

Perhaps the image map area editing has been broken in the 1.3a version, but I
tested it in the 1.3b version and it works fine.
