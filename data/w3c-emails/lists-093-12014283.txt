From I18N point of view, a Greek character is a character written in Greek 
language
and not only an entry in a font.
Today, you can insert a beta in an HTML document with Amaya: you say this 
character
is written in Greek and it's equivalent to a *b*. Amaya will produce the 
&beta; entity.
I think it's what you are looking for.
