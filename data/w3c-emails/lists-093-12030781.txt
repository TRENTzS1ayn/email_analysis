The greek letter entities &alpha; etc. These work on IE4 and at least 
display literally on NS4.

Or, the corresponding Unicode &#hhhh; codes, which work correctly on 
IE4 and display as a substitute character on NS4.

Or, of course, you can use UTF8 as your character set in the HTTP 
headers, or even the 16 bit Unicode character set.  UTF8 is the 
variable length Unicode coding, used by Java etc, which has an 
identity mapping onto true (7 bit) ASCII.

Font hacks only work on browsers that have soft fonts and actually 
know the font being used.

Note that HTML 4 is nominally in Unicode.  The conceptual logic is 
that the transfer character set (from the HTTP headers) is converted 
to Unicode, then &...; entities are resolved into Unicode.  
Finally this is approximated in terms of the characters available 
in the selected fonts (but only for display purposes), or, in 
practice, a similar font if the primary font doesn't contain the 
character.  This does mean that the transfer character set needs to 
support a substantial part of pure ASCII.
