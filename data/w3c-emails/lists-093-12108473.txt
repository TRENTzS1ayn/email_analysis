IE 4.01

There is no special plug in, unless you call NT4 (SP3) a plug in.  I 
suspect that you may be trying it on a less Unicode aware operating 
system.  You might need to download the latest true type fonts from 
Microsoft, although the fonts here are only those intalled by IE4,
NT4, or MS Office.

The exact build number is 4.72.3110.8.

                                           ^^ looks like

(Win32) Lynx does the best it can in console mode.  It has to work 
within the constraints of the current console code page.  As such it 
has to approximate.  But the point is that it is recognizing the 
entities.  There could be some errors in its code tables, as well.

(Lynx supports multiple display character sets, including the DOS 
greek code page and UTF8.  I would expect both of these to display 
the greek characters correctly in the greek1 version.) 

Incidentally, Amaya currently behaves like Netscape.  I regret to 
have to say this, but IE4 is currently the best implementation of 
HTML 4, as a browser.
