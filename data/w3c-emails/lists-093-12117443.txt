Unfortunately NS is currently about one major version behind IE and

That's the problem, you are making the characters look like greek by
misrepresenting them by using a font which displays them wrongly.  
HTML is a logical markup language and can be processed by tools other 
than MS Windows GUI browsers (including indexing tools and screen 
readers for the blind).

Currently the cleanest solution to mixing greek in, if you have to 
support non-HTML 4 browser, is probably to GIF the individual 
characters and use the entity codes as the alt text.  There are 
probably cases where abusing fonts is the pragmatic solution, but it 
should only be considered a solution to the extent that you must 
support inadequate browsers, and it is more important to get the 
right graphic effect, and you know that the target audience will be 
using a GUI browser with a font with the Microsoft Symbol encoding 
vector, rather than to communicate information in a machine 
processable form.

If appearence isn't absolutely critical, all browsers that I have 
tried, that don't handle the entities properly, will display the 
uninterpreted entity code, so the reader can tell exactly what was 
intended.
