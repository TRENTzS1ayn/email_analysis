&isin; and &infin; work on the referenced IE4, although not with 
Times New Roman as the body text font.  They do work with Lucida 
Sans Unicode and &infin; works with Times New Roman.

It looks like IE4 won't switch fonts and, unfortunately won't use a 
fall back font for just those characters that fail in the primary 
font.

Specifically:

<span style='font-family: "Lucida Sans Unicode", "Times New Roman", Roman'>
abc &isin; &infin; def
</span>

works as expected.

Microsoft, if you are reading this, you should use the fallback fonts
for characters not in the preferred font, and be prepared to use Symbol
for symbols not in the preferred font.  Ideally you should refuse to
do a as alpha when Symbol is selected, but require &alpha;, but legacy
pages probably frustrate this policy.
