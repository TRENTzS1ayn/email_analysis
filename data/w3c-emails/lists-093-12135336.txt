David-- I have no unicode. How can I get it? I just loaded windows 98.
We have MSDOS, NT, Sun stuff, and Windows. I always run the sun in text mode.
Lynx is great on the sun station 10.
My hobby is mathematics so I use TeX and LaTeX. The IBM TeX, LaTeX, MATHML, 
and XML plug in is a step forward. It is not complete. TtH is better. 
I have been programming computers since 1962 so I guess you would consider
me a nerd, but I try to limit the use of jargon. I think computers are a tool 
to serve mankind. Mankind should not serve the computer.
Until XML and MATHML is supported by somebody they are of little use. Amaya 
does not have MATHML. Like you say IE4 has the best HTML 4. In my IE4 &alpha; 
shows up as a blank rectangle. Amaya 1.3b shows &alpha; correctly. 
I assume MicroSoft has chosen not to support unicode except on NT4. You say I
can get unicode in truetype somewhere?
Jargon I used: unicode, MSDOS, NT, sun, lynx, Tex, LaTeX, MATHML, XML, tth, IE4,
HTML 4, truetype, and amaya.
