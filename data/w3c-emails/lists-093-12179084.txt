Hey folks;

With all due respect, all these "Some Comments on Amaya 1.3a." remarks seem
to be a lot like flames and less like constructive/supportive criticism.

I think it's worth noting that Amaya is a big, useful piece of software at
a darned attractive price and there are some sincere, creative people
working to make it as good as they can.

It sure would be nice to see more postings of the form: "I found this bug
and the fix is..." or "Here's a neat little (standards conforming) add-on
for Amaya".

Thanks to the Amaya development crew for some excellent software and I now
return to my regularly scheduled lurking :)

Sincerely,

Dave LeBlanc
