Irene-- Now there is a solution (MathML and mathematical entities) but these 
browsers doesn't implement this solution yet and that includes Amaya. Amaya 
does not support MATHML yet! I never said Amaya should implement the glitch.
I think putting pictures in the document is also a poor way to display math.
I do not like MATHML because it is hard to hand code, but MATHML is becoming the 
standard so I will use it when it is supported by anybody.
