I need to extract text from HTML documents and do this from
a platform portable C program. I've been all over the web --
dejanews, yahoo etc., and the closest thing I've found is libwww.
However, I notice in libwww (http://www.w3.org/Library/User/Start.html)
that libwww isn't recommended for use as an HTML parser. It
recommends Amaya as a full HTML parser.

Is there some part of the Amaya source code that would be suitable
for extracting the text from HTML documents from a C program?
Any tips, hints, etc would be greatly appreciated.

TIA, Howard Rubin
