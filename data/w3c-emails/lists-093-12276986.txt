This one is fairly obviously broken, I don't understand why you can't 
see it from the validation report.

^^^^^^^^  You are pusbing your luck by leaving out head and body, 
          although I don't understand this one.

         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
          These are obviously mismatched and center, being block level
          can't precede a closing inline tag.


<title>Elliptic Integrals of the First Kind</title>
^^^^^^^  You've implicitly started the body, but this is only allowed in
         head.

Elliptic Integrals of the First Kind</center><br></font></font>
                                    ^^^^^^^^^
                                    title probably confuses this, but
                                    you're closing a block element so
                                    there can't be open inline elements
                                    like font.

                                                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                                    These have already been implicitly closed
                                    by the error recovery on </center>


<p>
^^^
Most of the rest is because it has been confused into thinking you are still in
an implied head section.
