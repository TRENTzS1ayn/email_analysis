It is not very easy for me to understand. 

David-- Thank you for your help. 
I fixed http://www.neta.com/~cherry/42ex.html and 
http://www.neta.com/~cherry/42ex1.html.
I added a header.
Also it seems the validator requires <LF> for the end of line. 
I had <CR><LF> for end of line. 

http://www.neta.com/~cherry/42ex2.html is still broken.
It contains MATHML. Amaya displays all the MATHML in that file except &prod;.
Does the validator understand MATHML? 
Do I have to tell the validator that the document contains MATHML? 
Regards, Jim
