Could you tell me what exactly are the errors you had about MathML ?

Yes you can get it from http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Win-Compiling.html
(please read the instructions on how to build Amaya in the same URL).

>Why is amaya not capable of handling frames?

Amaya is capable of handling frames but not in same way than
other browsers. It displays a document containing a link to
each frame and when activating a given link you browse a document
corresponding to one of the frames.
