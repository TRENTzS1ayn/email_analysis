I have found 3 problems, maybe bugs:
1) - The Colors palette action is too much fast and it hides the palette
back
2) - Some paragraphs edited in block on other browsers (Netscape
Composer) couldn't wrap in Amaya, the hard I have tried. I have checked
Amaya built pages and found it inserts a break (LF) in the text. I'd
rather prefered plain blocked text
3) - The stylesheet tags are written in CAPS but the tags are not,
making some confusion althrough my text. It lacks coherence

Anyway, congratulations for your effort. I loved Amaya.
