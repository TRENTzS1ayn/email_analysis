Hi,


I just downloaded the new Amaya 1.3b for Linux, which has really improved
a lot.
Now displaying documents is faster than with 1.3a, and as in 1.3a most of
the new entities called by names (codes like &#8733; never work and there
exist some exceptions like &dagger; or &permil;) are displayed correctly.
I have tested this with the WWW manual "HPAM 1.12":
   http://www.astro.uni-bonn.de/~webstw/w3_man.html

The following list contains things which may be improved in later versions:
  1) When displaying a special position in a web document and clicking
     on 'reload', the beginning of the file is displayed. Changing large web
     pages one has to go to the interesting position every time.
     It would be good to store the position and go to it automatically
     after reloading.
  2) The ZOOM factor still has to be three on my 1024x768 display (14.1" TFT),
     and the images are zoomed by the same factor (which looks not so good).
     I would appreciate if zooming of pictures and text could be decoupled.
  3) I miss the blinking of text (like an exclamation mark etc.) - this
     is much better than using animated GIFs or Java applets.
     Maybe it would be nice if Amaya will support blinking in CSS and also
     by the 'BLINK' tag (which has become a pseudo standard).
     [I know that W3C CSS 2.0 specification says "Conforming user agents are
      not required to support this value" and that it is not part in HTML RECs
      (and will never be for the sake of CSS), but good browsers should support
      frequently used features.]
  4) In unordered lists (UL) there is the option 'TYPE="NONE"' (which is not
     given in the HTML 4.0 specs [only a Netscape spcial???], but supported
     via CSS 2.0 REC by 'list-style-type: none;', also not supported by 1.3b).
     I also missed the functions of the options 'VALIGN="CENTER"' in 'TD'
     and 'ALIGN="LEFT"' in 'HR' (used in combination with 'WIDTH="33%"').
  5) If images/tables are wider than the browser window, horizontal scrolling
     is not possible.

I would appreciate if the next release of Amaya and the intended new features
would be announced fully on the Amaya web page.


Thanks a lot for your help - and developing such a nice tool,

Jochen M. Braun
