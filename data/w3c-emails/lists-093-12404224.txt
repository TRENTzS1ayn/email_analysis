Blinking is very expensive without special hardware support.  It's OK 
for Windows 95 products aimed at single users who are assumed to have 
dedicated high spec machines; its not a good idea for a multi-user 
system.

In the general case, the most efficient implementation may be to 
maintain two copies of the window bitmap and copy them, to swap them, 
twice for each blink.  I think this is probably why it is considered 
optional.

I think any browser that supports BLINK needs to have a global option 
to disable it.
