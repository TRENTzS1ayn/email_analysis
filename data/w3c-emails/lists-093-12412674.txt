As the original message says: if it is not available, we can work a route
around. Those routes (motion gifs, java...) always use much more resources.

Please provide such a tag so brouwsers can implement the shortest routes to
the action requested or provide substitutes for it.

The requires much more overhead than the required blinking! With this route
YOU implement the blinking. With the tag, the brouwser implements the
blinking (and it has the option to disable it)

Here you are: With a BLINK tag, you can disable it. With your provided
options, it is not possible to disable it.

The alternatives to BLINK I can think of are:
ALTERNATE: display 2 separate things (text, pictures, etc) alternating. This
gives the power to blink between BOLD and normal or ITALICS and normal. This
can be used for blinking: alternate between text and nothing.
ROULATE: display multiple separate things (text, pictures, etc) roulating:
this gives the power to blink between BOLD, normal, ITALICS, UNDERLINE etc.
