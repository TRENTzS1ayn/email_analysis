Hello,

just a short note:  I've found that some menu items on the AIX binary
found on the W3 distribution site are somewhat hard to use.  E.g.,
when I request the structure view I end up with the alternate view and
vice versa.  Simillar problems are there with color/font palette and
within the sub menues, for isntance cite/code are swaped.

note: I don't need an urgent fix, right now I'm using it just for me
and I can customize myself ;-)  But it would be a good idea to fix
that, the way it is, I can hardly recoment it to gui people.

/Jerry
