What I'm describing here is how a browser would need to implement 
blinking.  If you want Amaya to blink, then Amaya has to either copy 
over the whole window twice for each blink, or copy over all of the 
blinking elements twice for each blink.  The latter option is more 
efficient for small amounts of blinking but would be a lot more 
expensive for extensive use of blinking.

You get blinking free on some character cell terminals, because there 
is an attribute for each character and the hardware combines a 
blinking clock with that attribute and the display data in a gate.  
Bitmap type displays generally don't have a plane reserved for a 
blinking attribute, so require the whole of the blinking areas to be 
updated for each blink.
