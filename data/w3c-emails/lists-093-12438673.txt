I don't think Amaya should implement blinking. It should just accept it and
refer to a stylesheet what to do with it, with a default for 'do-nothing'.

What do browsers which accept blinking while they print the blinking text?

What does Amaya if bold is required and the characterset does not provide
it?

Here again, I see 2 alternates: ignore blinking or change it to something
else.

Amaya, btw, has the 'alternate' view which represents a terminal. Since this
(looks like) usage of a terminal(-emulator) just go for blinking as
specified in the terminal(-emulator).
