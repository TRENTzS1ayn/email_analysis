From the HTML 4.0 Spec:

<!ENTITY % Text "CDATA">
...
alt %Text; #REQUIRED -- short description -- 

Entities are interpreted in CDATA, so must be interpreted in ALT.

This is the sort of area where the lazy parsers in most GUI browsers 
are likely to fail to follow the SGML rules properly.  Entities in 
href is another problem area with such implementations.

Amaya, Lynx, Netscape (4.05) and IE4 (4.01) display this correctly, 
but Amaya seems to fail to encode when it saves (v1.3 Win32).
