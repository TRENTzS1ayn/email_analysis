Following on from my earlier mail, I find that not only are their problems
with the Views drop-down menu but also with Style and Help.  The problem is
the same, in that the function performed is that of the item just above
that which is clicked on.

I also have a couple of ideas for future versions these are:

 - line numbers
     When Amaya, tidy, weblint or any other html analyser finds errors it
     gives the corresponding line number of the source file.  Without a
     line-number mode, this means using another editor to find the problem.

 - an "undo" button on the editor.  It would be nice to be able to "undo"
   an edit when a change doesn't produce the effect desired.

Regards,
