(Running Amaya 1.3b on Linux RedHat 5.2
Amaya installed from the Binary distribution
indexed on the W3 Site)

Hello,

Some reported bug that may help U.
After running Amaya from an Xterm line command
in the 3 different environments
Afterstep/FvWM/WindowMaker.

When a called  window appears, its bottom dives
the same way (about one inch) below my desk, making each times
(even when calling "views") necessary to resize it.

Apart from that really small inconveniency, I have begun
to employ it and thank you warmly for providing such tool.

Regards

Thierry Lhote
