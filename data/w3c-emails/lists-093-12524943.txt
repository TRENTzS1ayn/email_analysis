- It's not mine (you're not talking to w3 or amaya only, but to the interested community)
- It's no brouwser with edit capabilities, but an editor with browse capabilities
- I don't know about Java scripts or applets support.
- I guess you like it to exectue the scripts or applets.
- Since it is an editor, the support I'd expect is writing support,
not browsing support.
- All other items: ccs, color, textdecoration: It's supposed to be HTML 4 compliant
so I'd say Yes for those items. (you did not mention blink, there is
something about it not being part of html4)
