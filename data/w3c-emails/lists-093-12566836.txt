Wow.  Amaya has really come a long way in the last year.
I especially like the speed.  Also, let me thank "Sam"
(mrsam@geocities.com) for his message to this list on minor fixes
needed to get amaya to build.  I had made similar changes, but Sam's
patch is cleaner.

Anyhow, I have built amaya using the lesstif-0.87.0 library under
GNU/Linux.  I am experiencing one quite annoying bug that may be
a lesstif bug.  So, I would appreciate it if someone using amaya
linked with Genuine OSF/Motif would give this a whirl.  Visit
http://www.slashdot.org and make sure that amaya is thin enough
so that it will do horizontal scrolling.  When I do this, the
scroll bar is activated, but displays as if the entire width fit
into the window.  I.e., it looks like this:

| <============================================> |

when it should look like this:

|                             <================> |

The left half of the page is not visible, because I
am looking at the right half of the page (a funny side to
default to, and perhaps related to this problem), but I cannot
use the scroll bar to scroll to the other side.

If I make the window still thinner, the horizontal scroll
bar continues acting as if the entire horizontal area is viewable.
If I then make the window wider again, something strange happens.
The small viewable area is horizontally magnified (at least in
terms of placements of the icons) so that the same small amount
of information is viewable.  For example, www.slashdot.org has an
icon bar running across the top of the page.  If I shrink the window
so that only two icons fit in the viewable area and then expand the
window again, I will see two icons with a lot of space between them.

Anyhow, I hope this report is helpful.  If anybody can confirm
or refute this behavior on Arena-1.3b + OSF/Motif, that would certainly
help isolate this problem, and I would appreciate it.
