I have the solaris2 binary for 1.3b, and in my ~/.thotrc I have the lines

ReduceColor=
BackgroundColor=Black
ForegroundColor=White
TextColor=White
TextSize=24
ScrollColor=
MenuBgColor=Black
DocSelectColor=Yellow
ButtonColor=Black
InactiveItemColor=Gray
ActiveBoxColor=Yellow
ReadOnlyColor=LightGray
FontFamily=
FontMenuSize=24

However, on startup, the text in the body of the document I am browsing
is black (on a black bacground), but when I call up help the body text is
white.  The buttons and menus are OK, they are white, so I can access the
help. The Menus are also large print (24 point), but the body is not.  Am
I missing some options for this here, or is this something in the code?

Thank you,
Hugh
