It is probably not a problem of any great consequence but I have a
fragment of a colleague's slightly odd HTML at:

http://users.ox.ac.uk/~malcolm/Amaya-problem-extract.html

The HTML has <hr>, white_space, empty_name_anchor and <b> within an <H2>
... I thought some of this (especially the <hr>) to be illegal within a
heading but the Structure display doesn't show any red so I guess a close
read of the HTML 4 spec will show it is permitted.

Thw effect I see is that the first character of the heading text is
missing on-screen and in the Table of Contents view although it appears on
paper and in the Structure and Alternate views.

Apologies if I have missed this being dealt with in the list archives, I
did look - but possibly not carefully enough. I'm subscribed to the list
now and plan to remain so.

regards,
Malcolm.
