Extensions 1.4:
---------------

* OPTGROUP elements are accepted within SELECT elements. The corresponding
  cascade menus are built by Amaya and the right string is sent to the
  server when submitting a form that contains OPTGROUPs. An item in the
  Types/Form menu allows the user to create OPTGROUP elements or to
  wrap OPTION elements into an OPTGROUP element.

* elements FIELDSET and LEGEND from HTML 4.0 are implemented.

* Event attributes like onmousedown, onmousemove, etc. are listed in a
  sub-menu of the Attributes menu (Events sub-menu).

* When creating a Table, Amaya asks the user about the number of rows and
  columns s/he wants.
  When a new cell is created, the corresponding column is generated
  at the same position.

* When target icons were introduced, it was no longer possible to click
  the target element (an element with an ID attribute or an anchor
  with a NAME) to set a link. This possibility is available now.

* When reloading a document, the fresh document is shown in the formatted
  window at the position the previous version was shown.

* When saving a document in XML, Amaya follows the Voyager guidelines
  (http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-html-in-xml)

* When printing a document, you can decide whether the document URL is
  printed at the top of each page or not.

* A new field in the dialogue form used to insert images allows the user to
  enter an ALT attribute.  This attribute is mandatory.

* libwww has been upgraded to version 5.2. This version of libwww
  supports HTTP/1.1, rev. 05

* A first implementation of the message digest authentication protocol,
  as defined in <draft-ietf-http-authentication-03>. The code is 
  interoperable with the current (which is an old) implementation of this
  protocol inside Apache/1.3.

* When Amaya detects errors in a loaded document, it generates a log file
  which can be displayed by the entry "Show log file" in the menu "Special".

* Thot compilers (str, prs, tra and app) are available on Windows
  platforms, so it's now possible to develop Amaya on these platforms.

* When an URI points at a single image, Amaya can display this image in a
  document window.

* Each Amaya window can be switched from Read-Only (editor) to Read-Write
  (Browser) mode, and vice versa.


Fixed bugs 1.4:
---------------

* In the menu associated with a <SELECT multiple> element it's now possible
  to deselect selected OPTIONs

* Table formatting:
  - Amaya wasn't able to find the correct cell width when the contents of
    this cell was centered or when a cell included complex structures.
  - When a table of a given width included constrained and unconstrained cells
    the result was sometimes incorrect.
  - When a table with vertical spans was resized, row heights were not updated.

* Amaya constrained the structure and reordered some elements in the HEAD:
  Meta, Script, Link, Style.

* Command Apply Class did not work always, especially when the current
  selection was crossing elements at different levels.

* Relative URIs for background images were always interpreted according to
  the document URI, even when it was relative to a stylesheet.

* A background image in no-repeat mode was sometimes repeated erroneously.

* Amaya tended to raise windows too often.

* Moving the cursor accross tables and BR elements didn't work correctly.

* When a character '&' appeared in an ALT attribute (and in some other
  attributes), it was saved as is in the HTML file.  It's now saved as '&amp;'

* The use of autoconf has been improved to make the Amaya building easier.
