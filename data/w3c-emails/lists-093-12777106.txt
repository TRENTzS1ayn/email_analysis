I am also on Solaris 2.5.1, with gcc 2.7.2.3, and had the same problem.
I did a 'setenv MAKE gmake' (using tcsh) and redid 'gmake' at the top level,

and everything seemed to go fine.    This seems like an easier fix than
Irene suggested.

(gmake is on my path, but so is /usr/ccs/bin/make, which doesn't have -w)
