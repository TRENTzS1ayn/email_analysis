Since there is going to be another release in January I thought I would
point out that style sheet operation seems to be erratic. I am away
from my X display until after x-mas when I will characterize the situation
more carefully.

What I have noticed is....

1. When first loading a page containing a link to a style sheet page
   (css1) the displayed elements are altered according to the style
   sheet. When the page is reloaded though, all style is removed
   from the page.

2. Adding a tag (e.g. h1) that has a style associated with it does not
   display with the style, just the defaults for the tag. This might
   be related to 1.


suggestions
-----------
1. In hand coding html pages I rarely use the optional end tags. I still
get in and hand modify html that Amaya has generated. It would be nice
if there was an option to disable generate of these optional end tags.
Or did I miss it.

2. A way is needed to use a template document page. I have developed
a specific style including meta tags. It is somewhat tedious to put
those in using the GUI everytime.

Nice tool! I don't write text pages with vi much any more. Just clean
up the structure some when I can't get it right with Amaya.
