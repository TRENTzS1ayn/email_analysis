Hello,

I'm new to this list. I previously tried Amaya 1.1c and had the same
problem than with Amaya 1.4 Linux-ELF which I recently dowloaded. I have
checked the FAQ and Amaya's online docs...

I cannot activate the hyperlinks (silly, isn't it) !

I know that I have to double clic on the links, but it just doesn't work
(double clicking with left button, right, both [middle not active]).

My mouse works perfectly with other X11 applications, and also works OK
with Amaya's menus, etc.

What am I missing ? Amaya is currenty useless for me as a single page
"browser" :-(((

Thank U, and happy new year 1999 !
