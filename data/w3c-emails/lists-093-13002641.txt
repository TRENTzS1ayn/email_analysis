What exactly are you trying to do?

The way I do image maps is like this:

1. select "show areas" from the views menu.

2. put my image into the page.

3. select the type of area I want (generally a rectangle - they are better
supported than others) and draw it onto the image.

4. repeat 3. until I have all the areas I need

5. Go to structure view, so I can see the areas, and add ALT attributes to
them.

  I just got Amaya for Windows 1.4a and the image mapping doesn't respond.
  I've tried the help instructions about a hundred times, but no go.
  
  Am i an idiot (don't comment) or is there some other way to do it?
