Hi!  I just downloaded the solaris 2.5 binary of amaya, and started playing
with it.  Within a couple of minutes, it died with the message:
*** Thot: Irrecoverable error ***
I was typing into a table cell at the time.

the same fatal error re-occurred after restarting amaya.

Is this a known bug?  Could it be due to my machine being a solaris 2.5.1
machine, rather than 2.5?  If so, will compiling from source fix the problem?


What little I've been able to see of amaya looks nice.  I'd like to be able
to get farther however.  Any suggestions on how to prevent amaya from
dying would be appreciated...

thanks,
