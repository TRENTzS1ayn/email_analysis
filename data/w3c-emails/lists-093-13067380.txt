I just downloaded Amaya and was looking forward see a browser with full
support for CSS 2.0 and HTML 4.0, but to my disappointment it does not
support frames, nor does it contain any JavaScript functionality, thus
no DHTML is possible. Yes, I have read the archive and your argument
that it does support frames, but in a different way than all other
browsers. So what is this good for? Pages in framesets are designed to
be viewed together, not seperately. So maybe this might be a good
editor, but as a browser it is useless.

Besides there seems to be a bug with transparent GIFs. Tables are not
displayed properly, there seems to be a problem with the height of table
rows... And how do I recognize links when the mouse pointer does not
change. There is no status line or any indication that I can (double)
click certain elements...
