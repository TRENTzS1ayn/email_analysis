Tested on:
==========

Build: Windows 95 executable
OS: Windows 95 OSR 2

Bugs
====

Browsing
--------

Even with 16-bit colour modes, Amaya displays badly dithered 256-colour
images.

Structure view window does not wrap long texts, and the scroll handle is
not properly designed for horizontal scrolling under structure view.

When Amaya is looking up a remote host, I cannot abort the process.

Does not support automatic URL completions.

Floating object alignment is not properly supported.  For example, <IMG
align="right" src="http://foo.com/animage.gif" alt="my boat"> will not
align the image to the right margin of formatted view window.

Editing
-------

Sometimes typing 'h' in formatted view will not enter 'h' into the text. 
Instead it shows the 'About Amaya' dialog box. 

Loading a file automatically closes all windows, except the formatted view
windows. 

Clipping behaviours are horribly designed.  For example:

<P>
  <I>
    text
  </I>
</P>

If I try to clip the inner level of text (lines 2, 3, 4), Amaya
automatically puts the outer tag level (all 5 lines) into the clipboard.

Contents between different views of a document is poorly synchronized. 
For example, if I type some new texts into the structure view window,
texts in formatted view window are not automatically updated even when I
click on formatted view window, unless I modify the line within structure
view twice.  This can result loss of data. 

There is no way to 'demote' HTML tag levels.  For example:

<P>
  <I>
    text
  </I>
</P>

If I choose all 5 lines, I cannot remove the <P>...</P> bracket easily.

Others
------

Even though I tell Amaya to relocate temporary directory, it always create
temporary files on C:\TEMP.  The allocated directory is not removed after
proper exit. 

Suggestions
===========

Browsing
--------

An option to save window locations and view settings automatically between
sessions. 

A read-only mode to prevent accidental key presses.

Editing
-------

A option to specify startup directory.

An option to reveal hidden HTML codes under browser window, to allow
easy and precise HTML entries within proper tag/stack levels.

View windows for showing available styles, as well as how style settings
are inherited. 

Saving/loading
--------------

When saving HTML, Amaya should allow saving in 'raw HTML' (ie HTML
document that is not re-formatted by Amaya), to allow more advanced
debugging not offered by Amaya. 

When saving HTML, Amaya should offer following options: Strip optional end
tags, converting entities, deprecated tag conversions.  In general,
implement TIDY features to allow easy debugging of Amaya-generated code.

Configuring
-----------

There should be different local hotkey settings under different view
windows.
