That should work better on next release.

It's a choice.

The lock is due to the system call. We should work with processes to avoid the
lock.

It's a choice too.

It's not implemented yet.

Yes. When you replace a document by another Amaya close extra windows.

If you select the text only, Amaya will copy the text, but if you select the P
element, Amaya will copy the whole structure.

It's a feature. We want to avoid to redraw all opened views for each new 
entered character. It makes Amaya more reactive.

Removing the <P>...</P> will make the structure invalid. Amaya won't allow you
to do that.
But when it's valid the entry Transform in menu Edit allows you to do this 
kind of things.

Directories are not removed but it's the case of files within these 
directories.
The next release will allow you to locate directories in another place.

We're implementing a preference menu which will allow you to register the
current window sizes as default sizes.

It's available yet. The pen button swiches to browser<->editor mode.

We could use the directory where the startup file is located.

The structure view could be used for that??

It's not clear for me. The next release should allow you to disable and enable
CSS style sheets on documents. Is it what you want to do?

A document edited by Amaya is reformatted because Amaya works on a tree and not
on a linear representation of the document.

The future is XHTML and Amaya will be able to generate it in its next release.
With XHTML there is no optional end tags. But I agree Amaya has to offer a set
of options at saving time.

What do you mean?

The next release 2.0 will be available soon (normally April 29). I guess it 
should solve
some the problems you mentioned but not all of them.

Regards and thanks for your report
