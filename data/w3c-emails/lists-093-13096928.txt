Hi

While creating a link in Amaya, the URL has to be typed in, there is no
'browse' option. I also cannot find a default url or something like that. Is
it possible to have a browse option where the URL must be provided? The
resulting URL should be relative to the current page.

Comparing the menu's in the formattted view and the structure view, I see a
difference in the order of the menu's. Also, the link menu is missing. Can
this be outlined or updated in the next release?

Is it possible to have the 'structured view' (or an other view) as the
default view in stead of the structured view?

Thanks,
CB
