David ,

Amaya is presented in the W3C pages on the subject as a browser/editor that
is experimental and fully HTML 4 compliant, unlike MS or NS browsers. It is
an editor as well, so it seems to me you didn't answer the question of the
original writer. Also, who mentioned anything about freeware. The claims
about Amaya is what is at issue here.

Amaya is an editor, not a browser - in particular it has no
pretensions to be a freeware competitor to IE and NS browsers.  I
believe it is funded by W3C and, as Microsoft are a major member of
W3C, I cannot see it getting any funding to compete with Microsoft
products.

Second, what has MS being a major player in the W3C have to do with funding
or the inability of Amaya to be a full featured browser. Amaya is a
"experiment" of the W3C right? Why wouldn't someone fund such a project in
spite of having a competitive product. Why, everyone knows that Microsoft is
into "open source" support, right?!? What's the competition. No one, in their
right mind, new to the Internet would use Amaya. It's too confusing relative
to the MS/NS/Olympia/HotJava/etc. browsers. This "experiment" appears to be
for those that, at least partly, know what their doing.

Third, Amaya does not support frames, as frames are presently used/viewed.
Whether Lynx displays frames the same as Amaya is irrelevant. The question
really is "Is frames, as they are used now on the Internet, HTML 4
compliant?" If they are, Amaya should display them as they are meant to be
displayed. If not, what is the Proper HTML 4 protocol for creating them
properly.  That is the issue here.
