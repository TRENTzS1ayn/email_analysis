That was implied rather than explicit.  Many people reject IE and NS 
for more or less political reasons and are looking for a freeware 
replacement when they try to use Amaya as a browser - they tend to 
end up as described in the subject. 

On frames... my reading between the lines is that the writers of HTML 
4.0 were documenting a faite accompli and would rather have excluded 
them from the spec entirely.  As this is only an impression, you are 
free to interpret it things the opposite way.  You might want to 
note, though, that the frames DTD is based on the loose version of 
the non-frames DTD, not the strict one.
