A new patch release of Amaya (0.8c), dating from 
October 8, is now available to the public.

This release is for both Linux and Sun/Solaris
platforms.

When retrieving any of these versions, make sure
that the file name includes the patch release
number as follows:

amaya-linux-elf-0.8c.tar.gz (Linux ELF version)
amaya-linux-0.8c.tar.gz (Linux a.out version)
amaya-linux-0.8c.tar.gz (Linux a.out version)
amaya-solaris2-0.8c.tar.gz (Sun/Solaris version)


If you use an ftp server to retrieve Amaya, please verify
the name of the files before downloading them. If they're 
not the same, then wait a day or two or try to use another
ftp server. Copying files to mirror ftp servers usually takes
some time.
