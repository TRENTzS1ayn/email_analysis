Hello,

I am evaluating amaya (windows version). This soft seems well-conceived and overall
well-customizable. Thanks to developpers !
However, I write to this list to report a disadapted display functionnality (in regards
to my needs, of course) : 
When amaya displays a gif image, the image always appears with a black line on the bottom-right corner. I thought it was a marker to show the image size and that an option
could disable its display. But I can't find in any doc explain a way to do so. That's why I am asking if anybody has already seen this problem and if there is a workaround or a fix ?
