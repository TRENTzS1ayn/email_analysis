Hi Everyone ,

 I have downloaded recent version of Amaya , I am having problem during
the following command

 make all

It throws following error during compilation

make: Fatal error in reader: Makefile, line 36: Read of include file
`.depends' failed

Where is the .depends file and what about it ?

Following is my configuration

 Source:   amaya 1.4a  ( downloaded from W3C)
 System:   Sun Solaris 5.6

What can be the problem ?

thank you in advance

bye

Deodatta
