Do you mean that HTML 4 browsers for blind people are not HTML 4 compliant
just because they doesn't display frames as IE or Netscape?
I guess you make a confusion between structure compliance and rendering 
compliance.
One major benefit of HTML is that it describes information which can be 
read on different devices (dumb terminals, large color screens, and in 
near future mobiles). Obviously it mustn't be displayed with the same 
rendering
on all these devices.
CSS have also be designed to alter the *standard* HTML rendering.

I'm interested. If you have enough time to send us a message about it?
