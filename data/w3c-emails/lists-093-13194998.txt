You got a point there. I just suppose I have a hard time seeing (no pun
intended) the web as a medium for blind people. I know however that
they use it - I actually got a question about my own site from someone
who couldn't see it.

Hmm, no. But then I think you contradict yourself here a bit. As it is
as you say, wouldn't it be appropriate if Amaya could display frames in
the same way as, say, Navigator? Perhaps one should be able to have an
option somewhere switching between methods to display frames? 

And my main gripe about Amaya is that as over 90 percent of the
visitors to my site uses either Navigator or Explorer, and I use frames
on one part of the site, AND Amaya is an graphical editor it would be
very nice if I could view the results in Amaya and not have to change
to some other app for this.

BTW, you talk about different platforms. Isn't that the future of XML?
(I'm reading up on XML right now). Are there any plans to do an
XML-editing module for Amaya or as an stand-alone test editor?

Not now, sorry. It has to do with (among other things) the display of
images as compared to the rendering in Navigator. Perhaps I'm too
impatient to use Amaya properly.
