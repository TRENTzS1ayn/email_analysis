I'm following this diskussion and wonder why
it is so often stated that Amaya is NOT a browser
(i. e. not primarily) but an editor.

I think Amaya is a fine browser as well, if you
want to browse e. g. a local text-only collection
and you want to edit it occasionally.

What I am really missing is the possibility
to switch the single/double-click behaviour for
browsing.

I think this should not be too hard ... in relation
to the problems which have been solved.

Maybe it's really a more political problem.
As we learnt that Microsoft is involved ... (???)

Please let Amaya be a browser as well ;-)

Regards
Roland
