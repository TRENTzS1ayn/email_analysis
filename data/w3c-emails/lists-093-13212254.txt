Well, maybe you could look at 
http://www.eng.dmu.ac.uk/~hgs/blind/
to see *some* of the organisations who are on the WWW relating
to blindness.  Then there are the organisations for and of
deafblind people, who basically use braille (rather than speech)
to access the WWW.

No, this says "there is not just one way to do this".
Just because Amaya, Lynx, Getweb, www4mail, do this
DIFFERENTLY doesn't make them WRONG.  This is no contradiction.

So they have to write the code at least twice?  And this is when
they have all the other stuff to write?

So up to 10% of your visitore are not worth the trouble?  You have
obviously not considered those in poorer countries who are
browsing the WWW using e-mail alone.  Those methods
were started by W3C, actually by CERN, with the Agora program.
