Hi,

I'm not sure what to check next...  I have Amaya and Thot and most of
the code compiles; until it gets to "str" stuff (whatever that is)...

Restarting make all, or in this case make thot (based on a comment in
the archives) I get the following errors...

I have tried from scratch several times...  checked that I am using
gcc2.8.1 (I added a softlink cpp-->g++ because I was initially getting
cpp not found).  

My system is i586 Linux (RedHat 5.2), kernel 2.2.5, XF86 3.3.3.1, and
Lesstif obtained for this effort...

Any pointers to my silly mistake(s) would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Pierre
