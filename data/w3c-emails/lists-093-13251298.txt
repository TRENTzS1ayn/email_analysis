>BUG IN WINDOWS 95 1.4A VERSION OF AMAYA - INSTALLER
>---------------------------------------------------
>The Windows 95 distribution of Amaya:
>        1.4a binary release
>        amay-Windows95-1.4a.exe
>
>In the install, the default install directory is:
>        C:\Program Files
>It should be this instead:
>        C:\Program Files\Amaya

Not true. Amaya installer shows you the directory in which the
directory root of the Amaya tree will be installed and you 
are free to modify it.

The root directory in Amaya in Thot. if, for instance, you shose 
C:\Programs Files, Amaya will be intalled in C:\Program Files\Thot.
This is not typical to Amaya, but always the case for any program.
