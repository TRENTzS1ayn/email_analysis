No, this C:\Program Files is ok. You will find it creates one subdirectory
and everything goes to that subdir.

On the other hand, it is remarkable that the dir is named 'thod' with amaya
being a subdirectory thereof. This is due to the fact that Amaya is based on
Thod.

If this Thod is expected to be used for other applications as well, the
Amaya installation should install the Amaya specific stuff in an own
directory (C:\Program Files\Amaya by default) and store Thod in it's own
directory (C:\Program Files\Thod by default). In this case, Amaya
distributions should come without thot distributions too. There is no need
to update to the same Thod version if there is a new Amaya version.

If this Thod is to be used by Amaya only, the install tree should be
reversed: Amaya containting a Thod subdirectory.

My 2 cents,
Corne
