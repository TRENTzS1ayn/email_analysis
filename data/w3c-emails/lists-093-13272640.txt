You were asking for an option to change how it is done.
This means it must be capable of peforming in at least 2 different
styles according to how they set your option, -- how it does it now
AND how you want it done. That is what I mean about writing 
the display functionality twice.

No, -- I did not see (possibly missed) the URL for it.

The existance of the "no frames" version could
not be inferrred from what you wrote (you said you used frames
on part of the site, with no reference to a no-frames version
of that part).  You also told us that a blind person said that
they could not see the site and then went on to mention this
percentage, so that is what I was talking about
here:  assuming your users are using Netscape or IE, when 
blind users could be using Brookestalk, PW Webspeak, IBM homepage
reader, or some other browser than those two, and other users
could, for quite valid reasons, be using many different browsers
include mobile phones and e-mail.

It is a tool, and I don't believe it is perfect either.  If 
the forcefulness of my comments seemed religious, it was 
brought on by your assumption about blind people.  I currently
cannot use Amaya, because I cannot configure it to use large
print, and use light on dark colours.
