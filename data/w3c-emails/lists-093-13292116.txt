Excellent news!  Thank you.  I look forward to trying this
out.

Something to consider, which is non-trivial, and obviously 
not based on code I have not seen :-) --

Under NetScape I set the thing to use my colours always.
Sometimes this catches me out, when GIF images have clear
backgrounds on the assumption that the page is white or light
grey and the image is of text; I end up having to read 
"black on black" text -- although due to sampling I get a light
outline of the text in a grainy sort of way!  So I turn
off "use my colours always", then this problem
also comes up when people set the forground colour to black
but not the background colour, so my default (black) is used.
Or the reverse -- they set the page to white, and I get my default
(white).  My workaround for that is to use a vile shade of
green for text at the moment!

Is it possible to use HSV space to map these colours to be
as far apart as possible?  If the pertinent colours are "Near"
then move them apart so they are not.  This may be a topic
of Human Computer Interaction research at the moment, and it
may be awkward from other points of view:  one  would need to
have loaded all the images one was going to load to work out
which were the critical colours to move, then how to move them
would be an issue.

Anyway, I plant this seed in the hope that you get a "bolt
of inspiration" about how to do this, if what you have already
written doesn't cover it.
