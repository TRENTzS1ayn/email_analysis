I welcome anyone who might be able to use the 'net. If my statement
about blind people was perceived as offensive I apologies. I have
nothing against blind people at all. The blind person visiting my site
did not complain about not being able to navigate it, she asked as
question about period cooking recipes. I just had forgotten that blind
people actually use the net. No big deal.


Cheers,
