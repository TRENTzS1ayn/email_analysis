Apology accepted.  Thank you.

No, I understand that.  The assumption that got to me was:
" I just suppose I have a hard time seeing (no pun
intended) the web as a medium for blind people." -- which is
not "having anything against" blind people, but leaves
them excluded nonetheless.

I know what you mean by "No big deal", i.e. it was just an
oversight, but this "forgetting" is precisely what I was 
talking about.  The rise and rise of GUIs continues, but I 
think screen reading programs were still a year behind the
last time I read about them.  I have been trying to get 
large widgets under X on the Suns for about 10 years, but
these things are forgotten.  Then there is the issue of
accessibility for deaf people, terminals with "visible bells",
text alternatives to audio files....

If I have inspired you or anyone to consider these matters
further I have a section on WWW accessibility here:
http://www.eng.dmu.ac.uk/~hgs/index.html#wwwaxs
More contributions to it are welcome.

But I will end here, before my "soapbox" collapses! :-)
