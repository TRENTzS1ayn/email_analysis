I don't clam that Amaya shouldn't used as a browser. I want just
to mention we know that Amaya miss some functionalities to be considered 
as a good browser.
Our task force is limited and we clearly give priority to editing 
functionalities.

That will be available in next release 2.0 we're preparing for the end

There is no problem with Microsoft. Microsoft is a W3C member but doesn't
influence our developments. We choose to focus our activity on editing
just because we think that the Web should be a place where users are actors
and not only consumers.
