Could Amaya please allow the author to add ALT for AREAs, in the same way it
does for IMG?

Also, it would be nice to have a default configuration which provides
keyboard shortcuts for most functions and a way of doing everything including
changing the active sub-window and selecting text via the keyboard

All the menu functions are accessible from the keyboard via the F10 (linux)
or ALT (windows) keys, and in Linux using fvwm2 I can move the mouse cursor
around using ctrl-shift and the arrow keys, but haven't found a way to make
clicks from the keyboard. For a blind user, moving the mouse around to find
things is difficult anyway - if it were more like the dialog boxes, where I
can use TAB, arrow keys and SPACE to do everything it would be better.
