I'm new to this list, so I'm not quite sure if this has been debated
before, but I've been unable to find the problem in the archives.

I have severe problems with the widget set. In many of the text input
fields I can only enter weird characters that I didn't know I had. If,
for instance, I want to fetch a page I choose the "open" dialogue.
However, the input field will not be responsive to most keys, and the
few keys that do register produce characters that would hardly qualify
in most URIs. The problem extends to virtually every type of input
widget.

My system is basically a Red Hat Linux 5.2, although most of the
original libraries have been updated. I've tried the standard Linux/ELF
distribution as well as the RPM distribution, and they both  yield the
same result.
