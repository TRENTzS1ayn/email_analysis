It will be the case in the next release 2.0. ALT will be mandatory for AREAs.

The problem is to find out the right list of shortcuts. That could be 
experimented
out of the team. We're ready to publish a list of files amaya.keyboard or 
amaya.kb.

By the way, we plan the replace in the Windows versions the ESC key by the F2 
key
to select enclosing elements. What do you think?

We're looking at this problem, but we're not sure to fix it for the end of 
this week.
