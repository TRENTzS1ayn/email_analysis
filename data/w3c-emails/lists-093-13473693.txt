  The problem is to find out the right list of shortcuts. That could be 
  experimented
  out of the team. We're ready to publish a list of files amaya.keyboard or 
  amaya.kb.
  
  By the way, we plan the replace in the Windows versions the ESC key by the F2 
  key
  to select enclosing elements. What do you think?
  
I don't use windows enough to know for certain, but it seems like a good
idea. (It is easy enough to reconfigure it anyway). It would be nice to have
the option of selecting the 'windows' interface or the 'unix' interface
keyboard file, for people who are swapping across platforms.

  We're looking at this problem, but we're not sure to fix it for the end of 
  this week.
