Hi,

ESC is ok. Why do you want to change it?

Much more important is to select text with shift combinations like
shift-home, shift page up, ...

a <br> is normally inserted with shift return and not ctrl return. For me
that's much more annoying in the Windows version.

In general most of my HTML work is done with amaya because it does not
support any special browser enhancements. When the next version is available
via CVS I will surely try to compile it myself.
