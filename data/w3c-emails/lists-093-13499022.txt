As a Windows user, I find "Esc" very unnatural. It is a key I expect to use
to close or cancel things. F2 seems much more logical.

I agree with these. These are very common features in Windows applications
(especially the keyboard shortcuts for selection) and Amaya would be more
user-friendly (on Windows) if it used these conventions.

I use Amaya because of it's functionality, which I think is very good, but I
wish the interface had a Windows feel. At the moment it feels like a Unix
port.
