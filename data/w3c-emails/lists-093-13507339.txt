Not that I want to discourage  you from amaya hacking, but if all you
want is an amaya 1.4a on Alpha to run, you can pick up the RPMS that
have been recently generated courtesy of Daniel Veillard.

Sorry it took so long; my old alpha died, and it took me forever to
get around to installing Linux on my newer alpha.
