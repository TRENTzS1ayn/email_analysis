There are 2 classes of Amaya users: Those who primarily use Windows boxes,
and would like it to look like a native Windows app; and those (like me),
who like the fact that Amaya feels the same on both Windows and UNIX,
making our lives tremendously easier.

I see no solution short of having two sets of bindings: one Windows
like, and one UNIX like.  These bindings could share quite a bit, but
be different in some respects.

So I see nothing short of letting the user do the bindings the way they 
wantas a good long term solution, and sending out (at least 2) bindings 
that users can choose from.
