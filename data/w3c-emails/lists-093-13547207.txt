The page http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/New.html lists all new developments 
included in
each public release.
As we plan to publish a very new version next Monday, we'll certainly list the 
most
interesting new features in the Amaya home page.

We first experimented specific XML/CSS support and Namespace. We're able to mix
in the same document XHTML, MathML and GraphML (our SVG experimental DTD) 
elements
and we can apply CSS rules to all these elements.

Our new plan is to support generic XML/CSS, but it needs some additional work.
We'll have it by the end of this year.

Regards
  Irene.
