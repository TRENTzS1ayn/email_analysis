Is it possible to provide an "intelligent transformation" which takes
formatting markup (such as XFO, or HTML using only presentational markup to
differentiate structure) and transforms it to structured content using
heading, list and paragraph structure?

Much of the list problem has been done in Perl for the html2txt
transformation program. I had a look and found lots of HTML-to-text things,
but the one I know can deal with nested lists, and heading styles which I
think are pre-defined. (Note: this is the conversion utility used by W3C
team. I will post a URI for the home page which gives the source next week,
when I have found it again.)

The challenge is to transform an arbitrary set of font styles into headings
by using the size, weight, style (i.e. italics, underlining, etc) and
postioning into headings, and paragraphs.

This would mean it is much easier to produce braille or audio style
sheets for documents which have been written without any explicit structure.

In the meantime, keep up the good work. Amaya is getting better and better.
everything in http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU is now done using Amaya, and the team
working on it deserves to be congratulated.
