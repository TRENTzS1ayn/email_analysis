The Amaya team is proud to announce the availability of the 2.0 release
of the Amaya editor/browser for both Unix and Windows platforms.

  Binaries are available at:
            http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/BinDist.html

  Source is available at:
            http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/SourceDist.html

  A FAQ is available at http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/FAQ.html

An important milestone associated with this release is the opening of the
Amaya CVS base (read only mode for the moment). We'll send a follow-up 
message later this week giving more information on how to retrieve Amaya
from the W3C CVS server and how to compile it.

To know more about the features of this and older Amaya releases,
see  http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/New.html

N.B. Due to some technical problems, we won't be able to upload this
Amaya distribution to our ftp server until tomorrow. It's available thru
HTTP, though.

Many thanks to the feedback from our users, which has helped improve
many aspects of Amaya. Keep it coming!

======================================================
  Extensions 2.0:
 
       *  First implementation of a multi-document, multi-level Undo/Redo
          command.
       *  WAI guidelines on Image and Maps.
       *  COLGROUP and COL elements are accepted and can be created within
          TABLE elements. The rendering is not implemented yet, though.
       *  CSS properties "left-margin", "top-margin", and "display: none" are
          now interpreted.
       *  Amaya is now able to load, edit, print and save CSS files and plain
          text files.
       *  The entry "Style Sheets" in the menu Style allows one to
             o  link a CSS file using the standard Amaya paragdim: Click to
                select the target or display a form allowing us to type the
                URI. The corresponding LINK element is automatically created
                and CSS properties are applied     to the document.
             o  open a CSS file used in a document.
             o  open a CSS file used in a document.
             o  disable CSS properties of the CSS file.
             o  enable or re-apply CSS properties of the CSS file.
             o  remove a CSS link.
 
       *  After a "Make Book" the document is automatically switched to the
          Read-Only mode. This will avoid the user to edit it or save it by
          error.
       *  Publication thru the net now uses the HTTP/1.1 etags and conditional
            headers to avoid the lost updates problem..
       *  The 409 HTTP error message (conflict) is now shown in a popup
          window.
       *  Added DEFLATE content encoding support under Windows.
       *  First support of disconnected browsing mode thru the libwww cache.
       *  Command SaveAs allows you to save a document in XHTML, following the
          specifications and guidelines of the latest XHTML draft.
       *  Adding new menu entries:
             o  Back and Forward: navigation commands
             o  Editor/Browser mode: setting Amaya mode (read only or
                read/write)
             o  Amaya at W3C: link to the
                http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/BinDist.html page from the Help
                menu.
 
       *  Implementing a new policy of colors allocation.
       *  First version of Preferences configuration menus.
       *  The Verfiy each PUT with a GET option is now turned off by default
       *  It's now possible to browse with a simple-click or a double-click.
          By default Amaya uses the double-click, but it could be switched to
          simple-click in the General preference menu.
       *  Using the Publishing preferencesmenu, it's now possible to choose
          the default name for saving URLs that end in "/".
       *  New version of the Thot API:
             o  Changing of TtaAddButton and TtaChangeButton to merge Windows
                and Unix dialogue API.
             o  New functions: TtaGiveNextElement, TtaGetFirstLeaf,
                TtaGetLastLeaf
             o  A new Thot event: TteElemClick
       *  All user Amaya preferences and personal files are collected into a
          home directory. By default this directory is $HOME/.amaya on Unix
          platforms and C:\TEMP\amaya on Windows platforms. These files are:
             o  a personal amaya.css
             o  a personal amaya.keyboard (amaya.kb on Windows)
             o  a personal dictionary
             o  thot.rc personal preferences. This file is generated and
                updated thru the Special/Preferences menu
             o  other temporary files and directories used by Amaya.
 
       *  After a paste command, the selection is now set at the end of the
          pasted text where the user could continue to insert text.
       *  The Amaya CVS base is now available in read-only mode at
          http://dev.w3.org/ The Root directory is now Amaya instead of Thot
          and the libwww is no longer considered as a part of the Amaya code.
          The source tar file includes the libwww code (libwww is a directory
          next to Amaya) and one who acceedes   the CVS base needs to get the
          libwww code (cvs get libwww) to compile Amaya.
 
  Fixed bugs 2.0:
 
       *  Scripts can now be created within the document Body and are no
          longer moved into the Head at parsing time.
       *  When creating a new polyline in an area map there was a bug which
          generated wrong coords values on Windows platforms.
       *  Comments in files amaya.keyboard and amaya.kb are now allowed.
       *  When a document included the sequence
          <form>..<table>..</form>..</table>   Amaya closed the table at the
         end of the form. Now it reports a parsing error   on the end tag
          </form> and avoids to split the table.
       *  Copying an image from a remote document to a local document didn't
          work.
       *  When following a link which had a "?foo" ending, Amaya treated that
           ending as a query string.
       *  Some attributes values appeared with strange names in the
          Attribute menu.
       *  When the current position was in a sequence of empty blocks
          (paragraphs, for instance), the Backspace key deleted two of these
          blocks at once and did not select anything.
       *  When pasting a paragraph with an attribute at the beginning of a
          table cell or list item, it was turned into a pseudo-paragraph, and
          produced wrong HTML code when the document was saved.
       *  Amaya locked up when one applied the strong command to a text
          displayed at the beginning of a line.
       *  CSS selectors like "PRE SPAN.test" didn't work.
       *  The CSS parser didn't parse well the rule url("...").
       *  SMALL elements could be displayed too small.
       *  <basefont face="...."> was saved as <basefont facee="....">.
       *  When putting an attribute on a text string, the attribute was
          generated   as text in the HTML output.  Now a SPAN element is
          generated to carry   the attribute.  This bug occured with
          attributes title, dir, and most event attributes (onclick,
          ondblclick, onmousedown, etc.).
       *  Amaya crashed when loading an isolated image with a filename without
          a suffix.
       *  People who compiled Amaya on Windows platforms couldn't display jpeg
          images. The problem is fixed now.
       *  The authentication handlers were  desactivated while doing a HEAD
          pre-check during the lost update PUT procedure.
       *  While browsing an image, pressing the reload button didn't show the
          image again.
       *  It wasn't possible to browse images when the request was redirected
          to a URL having a different end name.
