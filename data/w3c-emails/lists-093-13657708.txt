Seems like amaya/windows/libThot* and amaya/windows/thot* dirs (except
amaya/windows/thotprinter is there) didn't make it into the distribution I
just downloaded. amaya/windows/libwww is missing too - which somewhere it
says is included in the distribution on the W3 site.

The file I downloaded was Amaya-src-2.0.tar.gz 4,162kb.
