Hi,

I've looked in the docs, and checked the mailing list archive, and haven't
seen anything, so here it goes...

I just installed the program, and it works great.  However, My backspace
key is doing the same as my delete key, and my ctrl-h only prints an 'h'
on the screen.

It appears that the bin/amaya.keyboard file is the place to configure
things like this, and the syntax looks very clear.  However:

1) How does one specify the backspace key?  I just see an entry for
<Key>delete.

2) What is the internal function for doing a backspace?  That is something
that could be added to the file in the form of comments:  A list of
functions available to be bound to keys, and the names of the keys that
can be used.

Thanks,
- Robb
