Has anyone got Amaya 2.0 to print on w95?

I got a copy of 2.0 this morning using the numeric form - I trust someone
is going to clarify the situation about the UK office hijacking the URL to
their mirror (for .ac.uk sites). It would be nice to have known what was
going on and to have some idea of when the AC.UK mirror gets updated.

Anyway, my first move was a bad one - to "make book" on the online manual
(no problem there) - and to try to print it. I never have managed to get
any useful action using the "print" button (it seems to go directly into a
print-to-file dialogue), I have found that File/Print works better and
stuck to that. This time I went straight for the print button, got a C++
Assertion Error box appear and then on clicking "ignore" my PC shutdown
directly to the "You may now switch off" screen. (But it didn't shut
tidily, it ran scandisk on restarting.)

Of course, I cannot reproduce that particular failure 8-) ... however
Amaya 2.0 is being consistent in that every time I try to print, it goes
through the motions and then shuts itself down (just Amaya that is, not
w95) without sending anything to the printer.

I think I'll go back to 1.4a - which did not get uninstalled by the 2.0
installation. That begs questions in itself - (1) could that be part of my
problem with 2.0? and (2) are there instructions as to what I can delete
safely from c:\Program Files\Thot\ hierarchy once I have got 2.0 in
working shape?

regards,
Malcolm.
