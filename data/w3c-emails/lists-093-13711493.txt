Hello,

As you found out yesterday, the RAL hosts an official  local mirror of the
www.w3.org server in the UK. This work was done in the context of
an Esprit project and we have other such mirrors in Sweden, France,
Germany. The DNS switching to a mirror is done transparently, in function of
the Internet Autonomous System to which your IP domain belongs.

I completely forgot about them before making my Amaya announcement. 
Currently, the mirroring takes place about once every hour and is done via 
satellite links to all the European hosts.

Sorry for the confusion!

-Jose
