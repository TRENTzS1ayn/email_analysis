    Hi

    After installing the latest Windows version  yesterday from http, as the
    other sites came up with error messages, I have endeavoured to open some
    of my html pages. This is now producing two problems..



    1.0   During the editing of any html file the window closes without a
    command be given.

         1.1  This has the effect of deleting all files on the C: (boot)
    drive. Just the files not folders(directories) or any files contained
    therein. I really mean all the files                     including 
    "readonly, hidden , system " the start up files have all disappeared.

         1.2  The machine will only boot from a floppy and I restore the
    missing files from a backup when it restarts normally until the next time
    I run AMAYA.

         1.3  I have repeated this six times with identicall results.

         1.4  A side effect appears to be that a 2nd backup copy of  each html
    file worked on is saved on to the C: drive where it resides along with
    io.sys

    config.sys etc etc. 

    2.0  Have I forgotten something?

    3.0 Are the files being deleted during a closedown deletion of temporary
    internet files

    4.0  Have I picked up a "nasty" ?
