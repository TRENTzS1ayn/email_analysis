Hi,

Did you changed the Amaya configuration using the preferences menu?
Otherwise Amaya shouldn't remove files except those loaded with
Amaya and these temporary files are stored in the c:\temp\.amaya\1 ... \9 
directories.

Could you give us more information about your system configuration?
One person reported that Amaya could not work as soon as he installed IE5
on his Windows box. Do you have IE5 installed?
  Irene.
