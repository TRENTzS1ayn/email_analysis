Hello,

Due to the reports sent early today about erased files in the c:\ drive, 
we decided to temporarily remove the Windows and Windows NT Amaya 
distributions from our server. 

We're carefully re-examing the code. So far, we have been unable to 
reproduce the reported bugs. If you are a Windows user and saw a weird
behavior, please contact us.

Thanks in advance and sorry for the inconvenience,

-Jose
