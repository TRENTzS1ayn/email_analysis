  Yes. I forgot to update the page Configure.html. I updated the version on our
  W3C server. See http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Configure.htm
  Functions you are looking for are GotoPreviousHTML and GotoNextHTML. If you 
  want
  to define your amaya.keyboard file keep in mind that the configuration 
  directory
  changed with the release 2.0: this file should be located at 
  $HOME/.amaya/amaya.keyboard
