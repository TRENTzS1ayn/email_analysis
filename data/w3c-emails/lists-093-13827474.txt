Maybe I have missed something, if so I apologise. I am playing (just a
little) with HotMetal and Amaya.

HotMetal has no facility (that I have found) to take the source for an
edit from the web, you have to get a local copy on your disk sepoarately.
Most certainly one up for Amaya!

HotMetal does, however, have the facility to upload pages back to the
server by FTP. Amaya seems to fall short here. It is not clear to me that
I can get Amaya to do a SaveAs by ftp to my public_html hierarchy. If I
have missed something, do please tell me! If I haven't, then can I request
this facility for the future please?

I should add that we don't allow _any_ PUT operations on our server and
there is no point in suggesting that I should lobby for PUT to be enabled!

regards,
Malcolm.
