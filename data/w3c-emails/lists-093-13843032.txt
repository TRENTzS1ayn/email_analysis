Hi,

I have a problem with my external style sheet. It works with Amaya 1.4 and
IE4, IE5.

The style sheet was created with the standard notepad of Windows NT. Amaya
2.0 processes only the first line. When I write the whole style sheet in one
line. Everything works as expected.

Maybe Amaya 2.0 has a problem with CR/LF at the end of each line? Does Amaya
expect only CR or LF? You can test this on our homepage
http://www.derago.com/english.htm . I could not check it with a Unix version
of Amaya.

That is my only problem with 2.0 up to now and the new version is really
much better than the old one.

Thanks
CC
