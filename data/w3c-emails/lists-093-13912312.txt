I meet exactly the same problem with win98. Did you run IE5 ?

Amaya 1.? did function till I installed IExplorer 5. But no more after
installing IExplorer 5. Amaya 2 doesn't function too.
If nobody does experiment the same difficulties, I could uninstall IE5 just
to see what happens, to be certain that the prob comes from IE5.

Hi

I have just downloaded the update on Amaya 2.0a. (4274 KB).

Unfortunately I cannot get it to set up.

After two installsheild Wizards process nothing further happens and my
machine reverts to where it was prior to clicking on the icon to start
setup.

Help please
