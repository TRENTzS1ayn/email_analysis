Hello Amaya readers.

First of all, Is something wrong with the maillist? I send an email
yesterday and have not received it back. I hope to see the maillist is
working.

Now the real issue:
After building Amaya on HP, Installing gave the next errors:

ERROR 1:
ln -s /appl/tools/amaya2.0a/Amaya/applis/bin/amaya
/appl/tools/amaya2.0a/bin/amaya
ln: /appl/tools/amaya2.0a/bin/amaya: No such file or directory

/appl/tools/amaya2.0a is from the configure option
'--prefix=/appl/tools/amaya2.0a'
The 'Amaya' subdirectory is created in the installation.
The 'bin' subdirectory of 'Amaya' is not created.


ERROR 2:
cp: cannot access ../../dicopar/*.dic: No such file or directory
I guess this has something to do with dictionaries but how do I install
them? It is not mentioned in the installation information.

The nice thing about standards is that there are so many of them to choose
