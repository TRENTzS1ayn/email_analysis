A few weeks ago, someone complained on this list that Amaya was giving 
little response to the keyboard, and those few keys that did respond were
resulting in strange characters.  I have managed to reproduce that
problem, by accidentally turning on Num Lock (!)

This is obviously being treated as a modifier key by my X setup, and
causing the symptoms observed.

Could whoever it was please confirm or deny whether it is this causing the
problem on their system.

Could someone possibly explain the conventions wrt modifier keys under X,
as I don't quite follow it all.  I notice that xterm and all the usual
apps don't seem to be affected by Num Lock status, although my fvwm2 key
bindings are.

I presume that this could be fixed by Amaya (probably just by stripping
top bits from the keycode).  However, it occurs to me that this could
actually be a nice way to get symbols into Amaya; if I could turn Num Lock
on and press I for an integral sign, p for powers etc that could be really
cool.  If it were configurable then this could prove to be a useful
mechanism for specialist documents (currency signs, for instance).

Many thanks to the Amaya team for 2.0 - it is a great improvement on
previous versions.  I have yet to have it crash on me ;-)  There are a few
bugs, but I will report those when I have sorted myself out (exams in 2
weeks ;-( ).

Thanks again,

Ewan Mellor.
