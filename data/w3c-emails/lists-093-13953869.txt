Hello,

with the recent release (2.0a) printing
works better than in 1.4a ;-)

Printing seems to be ok when started via
the menue "File/Print", however, when
I push the button a dialogue opens
which asks me for the name of a pdf-file.
Then the output is printed to this file
in pdf-format.

Just to inform you ... nothing serious ;-)

Roland
