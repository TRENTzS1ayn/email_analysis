Me too!

I have not had time to experiment and report properly and was concerned
that it might be an interaction with Acrobat 4.0 which I installed on my
machine the day before Amaya 2.0a ... good to know I'm not alone, I was
starting to wonder if I was the only person for whom w95 printing didn't
work quite as smoothly as it ought 8-)

In my case the "print button" does now (it never has done before 2.0a)
bring up the usual printer dialogue box (in which I have confirmed I have
my default printer set to an HP IIIsi _without_ print-to-file checked) but
then it asks for a PDF filename.

Assuming that you, Roland, do have a version of Acrobat installed, I guess
the question is what happens if there is no PDF printer installed on the
system? I'm afraid I don't have such a beast to hand to check on.

regards,
Malcolm.
