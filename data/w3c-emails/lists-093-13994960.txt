I have just built Amaya 2.0a from sources on Solaris 2.5.1, with GCC, and
gmake.

Installation:

The build went fine
The install failed in the directory obj/amaya because it could not
find ../install.sh.
...
gmake[2]: Entering directory `/home/hgs/AMAYA/Amaya/obj/tablelib'
gmake[2]: Nothing to be done for `libThotTable'.
gmake[2]: Leaving directory `/home/hgs/AMAYA/Amaya/obj/tablelib'
../install-sh -c -m 755 ../bin/amaya /usr/local/Amaya/applis/bin
gmake[1]: ../install-sh: Command not found
gmake[1]: *** [install] Error 127
gmake[1]: Leaving directory `/home/hgs/AMAYA/Amaya/obj/amaya'

I copied Amaya/install.sh to Amaya/obj/install.sh
and all went well.

Usage:

The first thing I did was set the colours and fonts.  I noticed that
the max font size is 20 points for the menu fonts.  I was hoping to
use 24 points.  I set the foreground colour to White, and the background
to Black.  This worked fine for the page about configuring Amaya.

Starting a New Amaya gave me the doc:
/usr/local/Amaya/amaya/AmayaPage.html
which then came up with white text on a white background.
I can, as yet, see no way to force an override on this, as per:
http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-USERAGENT/#accessible-content

The alternative text popups for the buttons has come up as a creamy colour
(my default X foreground colour I think) on yellow.  Also the font is
small. These are therefore illegible to me.  I cannot see where to set
these colour parameters.

The Configuring Amaya page, off the help menu, makes no refereces to
editing particular values in files.  This would work around things not
being on the preferences menus.  Also, there are variables in thot.rc
which are could benefit from explanation.  For example, what sort of value
should "ReduceColor=" take (a string, a number, ...)?

Apart from that, this is a big improvement over the last version I had.

Two (more) suggestions:

When you navigate to a link within a document (i.e a fragment denoted by
#name) I think the main browser display should reflect
this named reference somewhere.  Netscape does it in the URL, but I can
see reasons for not doing this in that particular box.

In the Geometry preferences, would it be possible to adjust the scrollbar
thicknes, and the size of the end "arrows" for up and down movement?  This
would make them easier to target with a mouse if they were bigger for
example.

Thank you,
Hugh
