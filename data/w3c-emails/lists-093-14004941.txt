I just visited http://www.w3.org/XML/ with Amaya 2.0
and did "save as XHTML".

Works pretty well: displays as expected in NS4, passes
xmlwf checking.

But...

no need for this: <?xml version="1.0" ?>
and it causes some problems with older browsers.

The system identifier in the DTD isn't right:

<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
                      "xhtml1-transitional.dtd">


I get 404 at: http://www.w3.org/Profiles/xhtml1-transitional

Also: &middot; refers to the DTD; I suppose it's more
mnemonic, but I'd rather just use numeric
character references. I thought it (&middot;) would cause
well-formedness checking to fail, but it doesn't.
If I take out the <!DOCTYPE > it does cause
well-formedness checking to fail.
