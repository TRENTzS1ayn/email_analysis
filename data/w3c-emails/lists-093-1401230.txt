        First of all,congratulations!,I hope you will finish Amaya soon.I
will try to help you in whatever I can.

        I installed the elf-alpha.8.0 version of Amaya just a couple days
ago,and I have notice some abnormal behaviour during the development of some
pages.I have read the information about bugs in "http://www.opera..." and I
didn't find anything dealing about my problems,so here they are:

-Amaya always launches a second,third.. browser when I push the arrow
buttons to move around the loaded pages.
 I guess  it's because it's still not fully implemented.
-I cannot see the cursor when I insert an image,I know that it's on the
right side of the image,but I cannot see it,and I have to push some keys to
do so.
-Is there any method,button or option to make background images visible?

And this was all I've got.I hope this will help you anyway.

Thanx for everything:
