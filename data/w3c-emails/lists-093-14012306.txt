Not a big deal this:
I have zoom set to 5.  Browsing some sites the page is wider than the
viewable part displayed by Amaya. However, this is not reflected in the
horizontal scrollbar, the "bubble" takes up the full width, so one cannot
scroll right.
Platform: solaris 2.5.1, GCC, Gnu make, compiled from sources.
Thank you.
