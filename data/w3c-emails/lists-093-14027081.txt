I had the same problem, strangely it did happen on Solaris but it did not
happen on HPUX: on HPUX it finds an install in /opt/imake/bin/. I think this
is because ../configure finds install in ../install. I edited Options.orig
after ../configure and changed every relative (../) directory to the
absolute directory, this helps too.
