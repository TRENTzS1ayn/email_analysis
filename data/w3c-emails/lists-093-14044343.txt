Not so - at least, I can only speak for myself and not for Roland.

In my case, I still have my HPIIIsi driven through AdobePS4.1 as my
default printer and all other software (includinging Acrobat 4) is
printing ok to that by default. Only Amaya goes past the printer
confirmation panel to then try to "Save As PDF".

Malcolm.
