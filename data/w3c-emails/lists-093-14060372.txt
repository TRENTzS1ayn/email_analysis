  Your problem does not come from Amaya. Amaya allow you to print
using the driver of your default printer or of another one you
can choose from the list of printers connected to your computer. 
If the there is a driver but no printer corresponding to this
driver is connected then the control is given to the driver. This
latter displays a dialog allowing you to enter e file name or to
cancel the process (THIS DIALOG IS NOT AMAYA ONE). And Amaya
never asks to save in pdf format.
What your are talking about is a driver problem and _not_ Amaya problem.
