RPM distributions are not managed by the Amaya team. I guess these 
distributions don't
include the library libjpeg. Perhaps your current version of that library is 
incompatible
with Amaya includes.
Our binary distribution for Linux uses a static library and should display 
jpegs correctly.
Could you check that?
