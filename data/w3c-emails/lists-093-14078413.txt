Hi,

We wanted to follow X11 conventions and we took into account local modifiers 
defined
by xmodmap or X configurations. I guess Amaya and Thot are the only two 
applications
doing that and the only two applications having troubles on some Linux boxes.
I will remove the call to XLookupString as soon as possible.
