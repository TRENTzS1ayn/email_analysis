I couldn't get Amaya to compile on FreeBSD 3.1-RELEASE for i386.  I had
successfully installed the binary distribution of LessTif 0.88.1 for
FreeBSD-ELF. The configure program could not find the thot sources or
detect that Motif was present. I tried both "make all" and "gmake all,"
but neither would work.
