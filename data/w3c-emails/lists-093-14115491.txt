I use both Unix (Linux RH5.1)and Windows 98 versions
Hello,

Make book problem
----------------------------

I have a "site" made of a main directory (/) and subdirectories 
(/toto/ etc..). I have a HTML file in the main directory (/foo.html) that 
have "chapters" links to documents in subdirectories 
(/toto/foo.html). These "chapters" have pictures stored into the 
main picture file (/pictures/bar.gif) and also "chapters" in sub-sub 
directories (/toto/titi/bar.html) or in the same sub directory 
(/toto/bar.html).

When I launch "Make Book" it 's a real mess, sub documents are 
incuded but sub-sub documents are not. When I check the HREF's
I find "/toto/titi/toto/titi/bar.html" or "/toto/toto/bar.html" images and 
".." directories are also bad handled.

Unexpected crashes
-----------------------------
unexpected crashes too and other thing I will investigate more 
precicely myself.

File system handling
------------------------------
A deep rethink of all file system function is to perform because it 
sucks everythink it can. Perhaps on windows it's possible to call 
standard Save As an Open boxes that will causes less problems.
On Unix it's not better, I got the directory not listed error (already 
reported).

Image incertion
----------------------
When we insert images the default filter is ".gif" perhaps it should 
be "*.gif" not speaking about "*.jpg, *.jpeg".

PS 1: It is possible to have more often binary RPMs release (Linus 
style) so it can allow peoples with little "CVS & compiling 
competence" can repport and have last updates too. If there are 
more peoples all bugs will be obvious, Just script automated 
building and FTP;)

It can be done like mozilla.org with "Nightly build" and "Milestone 
release" (like 2.0).

PS 2: Implement new features is cool but there are still too many 
"stability" bugs.
