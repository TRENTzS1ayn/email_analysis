Hello,

I recently tried Amaya (Linux version) and quite liked it as a visual editor
for small HTML texts.

In the current 2.0 version as well as in the 1.3, I observed that 
Amaya doesn?t *save* changes the author made to the title (<title>...),
although Amaya lets the title to be edited. This looks like a bug, or did
I forget anything?

yours,
Michael
