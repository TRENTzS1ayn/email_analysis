Hi all,

I just found out Amaya 2.0a is released. Have I been dropped from the list
or has it not been published jet? It is released on 7 may 1999 (check
http://www.w3.org/Amaya/).

Ok, I downloaded the source to build it for HP and I found the next minor
issues:
- After running `config`, the generated Options.orig does not report the
current version in the comment field and in "AMAYA_VER=". Strange, both are
wrong but between the 2 they differ.

- Amaya uses libwww, which is clear from the installation: it is stored in
an own directory. But Amaya also uses libjpeg and libpng. It would be nice
if those libraries are also on a different level like libwww. I have spend
time to tune those libraries for my system in the past for other tools and
I'd like to use this efford. How can I have amaya use my libraries?
