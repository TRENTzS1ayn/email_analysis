The thot sources are never detected, but I'm somewhat puzzled about
configure not finding LessTif.

FreeBSD 3.2-RELEASE includes a precompiled package of Amaya.  It's
available at:

ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/3.2-RELEASE/packages/www/amaya-2.0a.tgz

You might need to install the upgrade kit from
http://www.freebsd.org/ports in order to use it.
