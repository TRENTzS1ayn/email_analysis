Hi,

First of all, congratulations to all the Amaya team. As an early follower and an every day user, I must say Amaya really gets better with at each release.

Tough, there are some problems left :

When I try to open a style sheet (even the most minimalistic one) Amaya freezes. I can't close it, I have to kill the process. It works fine on Linux (RedHat 5.2).

As mentioned in other postings, the behaviour for printing is different from the button and from the menu. This "feature" is there since early versions. I finally got both to work the same. Infortunately it's a buggy behaviour : after opening the Amaya printing window, when I click the OK button I get the Windows standard printing window. So far, so good. If then I clik the OK button, I get back to the Amaya printing and so on. For the moment, I can print any more from Amaya.

I had to do some heavy cutting and pasting between tables in two documents opened in different Amaya windows. There was a lot of crashing. I finished the work saving after every single cutting-pasting.

I do not know if switching from Escape to F2 for element selection was a good idea, but it was at least a bit surprising. OK, I know I can revert to my old habits (I immediately did for the document saving shortcut, switching back to good old CTRL-S, wich is the most common way to save under Windows).

Inserting a row in the middle of long table or increasing the column span of a cell takes forever with a lot of screen repainting and flashing. At the end I was getting a bit sea-sick. The time span seems to be proportional to length of the table.

All in all, Amaya 2.0a is has improved a lot over version 1.3. My remarks are only meant to make it better.

Cheers,
