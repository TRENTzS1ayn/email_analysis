I guess the problem comes from the configure. Could you check your file
Options? Mine defines:
INSTALL = /usr/local/gnu/bin/install -c

You're right. There is a bug in the page AmayaPage.html

These colors are controlled by the "Menu foreground color" and
"Menu background color".

"Yes or No", but that is only useful for limited screen less than 256 colors.

Amaya reflects the URL where the document is located instead of the current
target position.

I apologize but I don't think we'll do that in near future.
