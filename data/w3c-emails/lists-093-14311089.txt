This seems to be the problem.  Do you have Motif header files installed?
The configure script is checking for the existence of Xm.h, which on my
system is under /usr/X11R6/include/Xm/.  You will need a full set of these
headers to compile.

If you do have them, perhaps the configure script is failing to spot them.
Tell us where Xm.h is located in that case.

Ewan.
