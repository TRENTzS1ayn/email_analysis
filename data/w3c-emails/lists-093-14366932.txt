Today Section numbering is controlled document by document by an internal 
attribute
but that attribute is set and unset by the command SectionNumbering.

I guess there are 2 requests in your message:
1) you want to have a global control of this feature instead of a control 
document by document.
2) you want to keep the set/unset value from a session to another.

The solution is to replace the command SectionNumbering by an entry in the 
configuration
menu. In that case the default setting can be controlled by the user and can 
be kept along
different Amaya sessions.
What do you think?

  Irene.
