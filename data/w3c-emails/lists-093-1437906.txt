Well, there is a bug somewhere.

Did you try to change the background color of the whole document body?
When doing that, the background of your images stay white and the
foreground takes the same color as the document background.

Are you sure that the *background* of your PNGs is transparent? It seems
that it is the *forground* that is transparent.

Vincent.
