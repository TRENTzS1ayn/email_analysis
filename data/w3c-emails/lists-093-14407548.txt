I have attached my keyboard file, which provides keyboard shortcuts for the
file, edit, view, and link menus, and some common types - lists, and INS and
DEL

There are a few remappings from the default - ctrl-s and ctrl-t as well as
some of the undocumented commands for moving around.

It has emacs-like commands for file things, and edit things. I haven't made a
concerted effort on keyboard shortcuts for some things that I think should
have them, like some types, the transforms menu, and some styles and
attributes stuff I use a lot.

It would be nice if there was a way to access each menu - in most windows
applications it is done by Alt-F, Alt-V, Alt-E etc.

But I don't know how to do this in Amaya.
