I guess you forgot to compile schemas before compiling the Amaya application. 
The file
EDITOR.h is generated by the app compiler.

"Execute Compilers program, you will have a Window with a menu "File". Choose 
"File/Open" and load the file Amaya\Windows\amaya\amaya.mkf."

Let me know if you do it and the building still fails.

  Irene.
