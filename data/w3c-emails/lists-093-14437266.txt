During the last month we were involved in many external events. So we had some
difficulty to follow the mailing list.

We're considering that, but not for the June release.

All that is normally available in the 2.0a release. Perhaps it needs some
improvement.
In current version 2.0a Shift+[any movement of cursor] works if you have 
removed
or commented these lines in your file amaya.keyboard
<Key>Up:       TtcPreviousLine()
<Key>Down:     TtcNextLine()
<Key>Right:    TtcNextChar()
<Key>Left:     TtcPreviousChar()

You can also have your personal file $HOME/.amaya/amaya.keyboard and
add your personal shortcuts.

Sorry, on Unix platforms we only support PostScript printers.

Oops, there is a bug here. I will fix it.
