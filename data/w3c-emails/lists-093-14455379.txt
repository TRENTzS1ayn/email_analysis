It would be really cool to have a history which was built as a tree, so that
the various dead-end paths where I used the back button were included in the
history. In my mind this is a bit like the structure view of a document, only
the document is the history of site I have been to. Since I frequently have
several documents open at once, and I want to link things, it would make
editing a lot easier if this browsing feature worked faster.

But I suspect it is not a very urgent priority.

Thanks Irene for explaining how to get keyboard selection - this is a very
helpful feature.
