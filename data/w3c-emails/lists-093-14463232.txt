The kaffe Java interpretor was integrated in Amaya, but since 18 months that 
integration
doesn't work well. It's why it's not officially distributed.

If you want to contribute to the Java version you are welcome. All the Amaya 
source code,
including Java modules, is available on our CVS base and you can discuss about 
that with
Arnaud Le Hors (lehors@w3.org). Arnaud is working on a Java DOM API for Amaya.

Regard
   Irene
