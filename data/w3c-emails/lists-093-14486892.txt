I looked at the page and a bunch of lines were all rendered in the same
place. I've actually had Netscape do the same thing to another site I worked
on. I don't know what causes it - it seems to be pretty random. If anyone
knows why it happens I am also interested.

For what it's worth, the HTML looked pretty good to me.

cheers

  Hi:
  
  I was just looking at my webpage using the amaya browser.
  Unfortunately, the renderer seems to do a poor job
  at least compared to netscape. I am wondering if this
  is an amaya problem or just me abusing html.
  The page in question is:
