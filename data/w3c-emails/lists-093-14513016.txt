Although Amaya 2.0a doesn't appear to be able to parse XML yet,
it does know about .xml and possibly the equivalent media type.

However, when I tried it on a piece of XML from one of the earliest uses
of XML, an IE4 channel definition file, it put up a save as dialogue.

It seems to me that XML will often come with a custom media type, so
the ability to force a URL to be parsed as XML would be desirable once 
XML parsing is properly implemented.

(Incidentally it hung - menus were live, but stop, exit and end task were 
ineffective when I tried to load the CDF (renamed as .xml) from the local
disk.  I've had several hangs like this on other documents with Win32
v 2.0a.)
