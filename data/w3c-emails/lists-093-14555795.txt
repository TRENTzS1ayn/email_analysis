DTD's are the actual meta-language.  There is no reason
why Amaya couldn't render any XML document that can be 
described using CSS (internally it more or less just has
to treat <xyz>...</xyz> as <span style="xyz">, except that
it also has to allow block/list/inline overrides).  Moreover,
it ought to be able to edit XML structure, even if it 
cannot render it in the manner intended.

The aspect that might cause structural problems for Amaya is
that it must infer a DTD compatible with the document's de
facto structure, although the DTD only needs to conform in
the following ways:

- the root element may only be at the root;

- any other element must either require an end tag or never
  permit an end tag, but may be nested arbitrarily within any
  element with an end tag;

- any attribute that is ever used for a particular element is an
  optional attribute for that element.

Incidentally the test file that didn't make it hang, but wasn't 
successfully parsed, was the XML version of the XML specification!
