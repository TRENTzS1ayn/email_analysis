If Amaya put up a save as dialogue, it's because it didn't get a right
MIME type "text/xml". Could you check your server configuration?

Amaya automatically detects the document format and displays it in a text 
format
(including tags) when it's not able to apply CSS rules to the current 
structure.

Amaya doesn't provide a full XML support yet. But it's already able to display 
and
edit XHTML, MathML, and a subset of SVG. It uses XML namespaces to mix these 
structures
in the same XML document.

Could you send us the document or its URL to try it?
