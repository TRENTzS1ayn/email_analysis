Although I've lost the Channel Definition File spec and
IE4 is well known for ignoring Content-Types, I am 
pretty sure that the official Content-Type is not text/xml
in this case, and my point was that in general XML is
likely to be served with Content-Types that reflect the
application not that it is XML.

This is the rule when I had it configured, presumably from
the MS spec, for Apache:

AddType application/x-cdf cdf

Netscape Fast Track is giving it as:

application/x-netcdf

by default.

OK, I'll send the last one to cause the problem off the list.
