Dear amaya peolple,

I had just been added to the subscriber list of www-amaya@w3.org. As I learnt 
from your repley my email was automatically processed and no human would read 
my the questions I added to my subscription. So this is a copy of original 
email:

I'm currently using "normal" browsers in combination with the webeq-plugin to 
display MathML on the web. But as the webeq-applets are not printable I 
started to modify my pages to be amaya-browsable. In this state I've got a 
problem which can't solve:
How can I change fonts in amaya? (I need to use Symbol and Chevara Outline). 
Or at least: how can I configurate amaya so that entities like &Zopf, 
&Nopf,... are supported?

And - not aproblem, but only a question - : Are there future plans to support 
the Applet-tag?

Best wishes
Norbert Steffen
