Hi,

Amaya doesn't support frames because Amaya is mainly an editor and frames will 
make
its task too complex. It's possible to edit several pages at the same time 
with Amaya,
but each page is edited into a different window with its own menus and its own 
buttons.
Frame support is not a high priority for the Amaya team.

Regards
  Irene.
