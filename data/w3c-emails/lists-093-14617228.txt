Amaya is able to display several entities by using the Symbol font. Have you 
try
to create a mathematical expression with the Amaya palette? The last entry of 
the
palette give you access to a set of symbols. I guess your 2 entities are not 
available
in our Symbol font.

We're working on the Unicode support in Amaya. That will increase the number 
of available
symbols provided that the corresponding fonts are available too.

Netscape and Microsoft plan to support XML and MathML. The right way is not to 
go back to support Applet-tag.
