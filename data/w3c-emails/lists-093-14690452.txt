When are IE and Netscape expected to fully support XML, and in particular
MathML? Pages written with Amaya that use MathML don't render properly in the
latest versions of each (IE 5.0, Netscape 4.5). This is despite the fact that
IE 5.0 supposedly supports VML, a vector graphics XML module. How does IE 5.0
manage to support VML but not all of XML?


(Of course, not knowing of any sites that use VML, I can't actually test
Microsoft's claim that IE 5 supports VML. And this claim is hard to trust at
face value, having come from Microsoft...)

Incidentally, when will Amaya support VML? Will a future version support
creating your own XML tag-sets, modules, or whatever they're called and
getting them "registered" or "made official" and provide a way to make a
browser plug-in or layout description file or whatever it will take to have
browsers render it?
