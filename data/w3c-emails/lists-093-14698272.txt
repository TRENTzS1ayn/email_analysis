1. Alter the title in the title box and save a document. The old title is
saved instead. The title only seems to "keep" if it's edited in the structure
view using the body tag and attributes menu. It appears that the title box and
structure data on the body tag title attribute are not linked/synchronized but
should be.

2. A maximized Amaya window inhibits the W95/98 taskbar in some strange way.
Changes to the icons in the system tray no longer appear on-screen, so the
modem indicator doesn't blink, ICQ messages don't appear to have arrived
(unless you have the sound alerts on), etc.
