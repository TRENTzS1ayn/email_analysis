But, it doesn't make a sense to comment them in this way. No one in the
world told you, that Amaya IS what you called "release-quality software"
-- Amaya is intended as a testbed for development of W3C standard and as
such it should be generally enough to show, that some construct in *ML
is possible. I guess, that all bugs you've mentioned are a long times
known but nobody has a time to make corrections (BTW, when these folks
from Redmont have made corrections you've asked them to do; and,
remember, you've paid a lot of money to them!).

To make it short -- as with all in this world, you get what you've paid
for!

Shall I take that as meaning the development team refuses to fix or even look
at these bugs? Even the SHOWSTOPPERS? I find that quite objectionable. Your
editor should at least be beta-quality software... and I see no reason not to
make every effort to polish it to a high state of quality. Right now it is a
diamond in the rough; it could use a lot of polishing as well as bug fixing...
