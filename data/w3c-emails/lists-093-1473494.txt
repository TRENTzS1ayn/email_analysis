Hi Juan,

In your previous message, I didn't understand what is the trouble you mention.
Now it is clear and I'll try to explain our choice:

Amaya is mainly an editor and allows you to create new HTML elements.
When you edit a document you would load a new one to copy a part of it or to create
links towards it.
Links is an important part of HTML and from our point of view, it is useful to have 
the two documents you're working on to create links between them by simple clicks.
It is why Amaya doesn't propose as a standard to close the previous edited document 
when you load a new one.

No there is no button for that.
