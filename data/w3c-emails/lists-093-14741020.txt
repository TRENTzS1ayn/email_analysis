I've noticed some sort of links to do with Opera while browsing your site.

Opera is a Web browser notorious for being not too user-friendly and for being
$$$-ware (while all other Web browsers are freeware).

I hope there isn't a conflict of interest here. I would hate to see Amaya go
down the tubes because someone has decided to make it unstable and buggy so
that it isn't a serious competitor for their commercial Opera browser.
Especially since software should be free and the w3c should be non-profit...

Or are those links to do with some other sort of Opera?
