What the heck is going on? I sent a query to www-amaya@w3.org about searching
the archives, and got a message shortly after from www-amaya-request as
follows. It seems as though my message sent to www-amaya@w3.org was somehow
misdirected by your mail system to www-amaya-request@w3.org! This should not
have happened.

In future, all messages I send from this address to www-amaya@w3.org are to
wind up at www-amaya@w3.org, NOT www-amaya-request@w3.org or any other
address...
