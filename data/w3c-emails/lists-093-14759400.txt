I'm reposting this because the first copy seems to have somehow been missent
to www-amaya-request, even though I could have sworn I sent it to www-amaya,
and a quick check of my outgoing mail logs shows without a shadow of a doubt
that I *did* send it to "www-amaya@w3.org" and NOT to
"www-amaya-request@w3.org"...


Postmaster: please fix these mail delivery bugs.


The original message follows.


----------
I've searched and searched around at http://www.w3.org, but I can't seem to
find the link to search the www-amaya archives.

I am forced to conclude that someone forgot to link the Amaya page or the
archive page to the archive search page, and as a result, the search page is
not easily discovered or used except by those who already know its URL.

Please create a link from the archive page to the search page within 24 hours,
as this would make it much easier for people to search the archives for a
certain query, such as inserting copyright symbols. As it stands now, only
those in the know can find an archive message by any means other than date.

Oversights like this contribute much to the "unpolished" impression people get
from your project. Polish, polish, polish...
