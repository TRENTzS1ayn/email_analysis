That's not how I interpreted that message. It looked to me like the guy was
stating on behalf of the development team that they (paraphrasing) know about
the bugs and don't give a damn.

Of course, I don't know whether he is on the development team or has their
sanction to speak on their behalf, so...

I was responding to what appeared to be equally unkind words. Namely words to
the effect of "I/we don't give a damn about you or the bug you encountered,
data loss or no data loss."

My initial gentle prodding prompted a response to the effect that "I/we don't
give a damn about you or the bug you encountered, data loss or no data loss,"
hence a subsequent, strongly worded response.

These statements imply that the guy whose posting implied the development team
didn't give a damn was a) mistaken and b) not actually sanctioned to speak on
their behalf. Perhaps he needs a kindly reminder that he doesn't speak for the
development team?

Hey... actually, it seems I merely asked for clarification of his message ...

and gave a subsequent "rant" conditioned on the result of that clarification.
