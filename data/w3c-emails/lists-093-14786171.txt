VML is an application of XML.  Supporting XML doesn't guarantee 
that you can support the application semantics of every XML
application - in fact most have not even been defined yet.

A browser can support XML at a basic level by permitting the
use of style sheets to render it, or it can support specific
applications, such as MathML, if it has knowledge of the
semantics built in.

If you want a MathML browser, ask specifically for MathML, as
support for XML is not a sufficient condition.
