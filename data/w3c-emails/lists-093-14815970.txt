Thanks for beautiful example of Amaya's supporting development
team (contrary to some emails from this morning :-), but let me comment
on some of yours notes:

[MCepl]  Please, make "htm" at least optional. There are still
folks (like myself) who are editing partly on smaller machines in Win
3.11. It is terrible experience to be forced to reedit all <A ...> links
from "htm" to "html" -- remember, that there are htm# things, so there
must be really massive search and replace whenever I touch my site on
notebook (which is Compaq 386SX/4MB RAM -- no Win95 there).

[MCepl]  OK, it happens to me as well (on Win95 -- not on
WinNT). And unfortunately I have not 128MB RAM, but only 32, so it
finishes much sooner. :-(

[MCepl]  Thanks for Amaya.
