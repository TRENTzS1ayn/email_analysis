You need to hit the Return key to validate the Title change.
It's the same for the above field "Address". Amaya takes into account the new 
address when you hit the Return key.
That was explained in the FAQ page http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/FAQ.html

The size is computed by Windows and not Amaya. That application is not 
developed
by Microsoft than we have a limited integration with the system.
