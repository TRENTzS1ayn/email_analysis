The project Opera is a research project at INRIA and has no relationship
with the browser Opera. That project exists for 10 years and didn't change its
name when the browser appeared on the market.

Thanks for the clarification.

(Who the heck chose the default window size and shape? It runs off the bottom
of the screen even at 1024x768... most users don't have a snazzy Matrox
1600x1200 video system like you developers :-) And most users are not going to
feel very comfortable diddling a poorly-documented .rc file to change it
either. Wish it remembered the window size and file directory last used at
each new session! If those were saved back to the .rc file every document
save, it wouldn't trouble anyone, and should work even through crashes for
users that save frequently.)
