In the specific csse, you want to cut the content of the TD not the TD
itself.

  4. Table edit is crufty in Amaya 2.0a. Specifically, one situation that

     each. Cut either td element. Then make a new row, paste the td into it.
     It should do what you want but fails, for Amaya pastes in your cut td,
     and then adds a second, blank td for no reason. (Stray CR/LF in the
     cut?) To make the table neat and rectangular, it adds a td on the other
     row too. This would be okay except that it adds it *before* the pre-
     existing td. Now you have a table like a checker-board. You can't
     delete either blank td. The only workaround seems to be splitting the
     whole table in two (with copy/paste) and then copying their lone
     tr/td/stuff and pasting as two rows into a *third* table and deleting
     the first two.
