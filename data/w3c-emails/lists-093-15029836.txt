Mainly about freeness of PDF and Postscript, but...

Outlook Exploder is a piece of junk. Even for Microsoft software.
It's their
worst IMO. Junk it and get Pegasus or Eudora.

I was the last one off Pegasus here, but the system manager
wants to use Exchange for reasons to do with other packages
(which we might re-sell).

When Postscript was introduced, people hand coded it; you
shouldn't judge it by the bloated Postscript generated by
the Microsoft print drivers.

Many free tools can generate Postscript (e.g. groff, xfig,
html2ps and even amaya).  ghostscript can convert postscript
to PDF (including Distiller markup) although the GPLed version
(5.10) doesn't compress images.  (Using HTML to create PDF is
meaningful, because the PDF fixes the layout that the designer
sees; most commercial page designers don't want the browser
or user style sheet to change the page appearance.)

Note that the HTML 4 PDF version was created using html2ps,
although they used Distiller to create the PDF.  The WAI
guidelines were done with all free tools for the PDF conversion,
although, unfortunately they used a rather old version of
ghostscript, which didn't include the hyperlinks.

PDF is, if anything, more open than TeX.  TeX is bookware,
whereas the PDF specification is available for free download
(and like Postscript is very well documented).  TeX, of 
course, is open source, whereas you need to go to ghostscript
for an open source PDF processor.  (bookware means the software
is free, but you have to buy the book if you want user 
documentation.)

Both Postscript and PDF permit third party implementation.
