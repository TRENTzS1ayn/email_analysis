TeX, like perl, has something called a Comprehensive Archive
Network.  Look for something called CTAN.

If you don't need source with a Linux distribution, there
are binary only CD-ROMs "out there" for around a $1 (US)
of the RedHat, SuSE, Caldera, .... variety.  Off the top of
my head, I can't remember the name of any company that distributes
these cheap Linux CD-ROMs, but there are a few.

He was talking about the "K" Development Environment, KDE.
It was built on top of a toolkit called QT.  QT was originally
released as free for personal use, but not for commercial,
and it didn't use the GNU Public license.  I believe that QT
has recently changed the licensing.  It is a library of GUI
calls.

Apparently free, even for Windows.

Why not use the GNU C Compiler for DOS/Windows?

Total still zero.

The differences between Linux and UNIX are slight.  The biggest
difference being that the Linux community doesn't want to pay to
use the trademark (IMHO).
