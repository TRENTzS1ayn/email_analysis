  Hi, 

We undertake to support _Unicode_ not UTF-8.
Actually, UTF-8 is used to store data in files. To process 
any kind of data (UTF-8, ISO-Latin*, ...) we need another
internal encoding and procedures to convert, for instance,
from UTF-8 to our internal representation of characters and vice-versa. 

I can't bet you that everything will be ready by the end of this year
because we plan to support Unicode in the perspective of the software
globalization. This needs more than the character encoding. 
In my opnion, even if everything is ready, we cannot release 
Amaya without a serious testing especially if 95% of the source
code changes, nevertheless, we will try to do as soon as possible 
and as well as we can.

  Ramzi.
