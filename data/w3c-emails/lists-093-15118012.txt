The only reason is lack of manpower. The (small) Amaya team at W3C
supports two series of platforms: Unix and Windows, and in each serie
several variants.  The team is already spending a significant part
of the time solving portability issues and can't afford supporting
an additional platform.

We obviously recognize the impact of Macintosh users and developers
on the Web, and we are very eager to see a Macintosh version of
Amaya.  Macintosh developers are encouraged to have a look at Amaya
and to consider doing the port.  Amaya is open source and uptodate code
is always available through the open CVS base.

Any volonteer?

Vincent.
