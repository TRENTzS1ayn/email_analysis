I guess there is a community of mathematicians interested by cross experiences.
but I cannot point you to any specific person. I carbon-copy my answer to the 
amaya mailing list www-amaya@w3.org in case any reader will be interested.

We're currently preparing a new release 2.1 for the next week. That release 
will
include improvements in the MathML support and we will continue to improve it
more and more in the future.

Popular browsers announced they want to support MathML is near future.
I don't believe there is a risk to use MathML because it's an opened 
*standard*.

Our mailing list is open to any questions, technical or not, concerning Amaya.
