Dear friends:

Using Red Hat Linux 6.0, AMDK6-2 400Mhrtz, 128 megs of Ram.

First, my congratulations on what looks like a great HTML
editor/browser. I appreciate all the work that is being done on it and
would like very much to use as my primary HTML editor.

However, there are strange things going on in Amaya that make no sense
to me whatsoever and that make me wonder if I perhaps have failed in
some very basic way in trying to operate it.

First, my urgent need has to do with the fact that when I try to access
one of my URL's, Amaya freezes every time, necessitating a
Cnt-Alt-Backspace on my KDE. In fact, the first time, it refused to even
return me to the console and I had to literally power off and reboot. I
have in mind the following site:

http://www.websher.net/inx/link.html

This is an index of Russian bookmarks called Sher's Russian Index, part
of my web site (http://www.websher.net). 

I have no problem whatsoever with this URL in Netscape on Linux nor did
I ever have any problem with it on Netscape or IE on Windows in the past
(I switched four months ago to Linux). The index starts loading WITHIN
Amaya and runs up to 99%, which is where is always hangs and freezes. I
have had no problem closing any other applications when this happens.
But Amaya keeps hanging and the only solution is a Cnt-Alt-Backspace.
The index has at the very top of the page (after the brief intro) a
hyperlink to a java file that allows the user to search 12 search
engines. I suspect that this is might be the reason why Amaya hangs. But
if that is the reason, then why should this be so. At any rate, what are
my options?

In addition to this urgent problem, there are a number of other
anomalies that need explanation:

1) All of my directory files on www.websher.net (except for the Index)
are CENTERED. Yet, Amaya refuses to recognize the centering: the text in
every department of my site appears left-aligned. 

2) None of the images show up. Instead, they appear correctly centered
but grey.

3) When I try to bring up any of my files from my LOCAL repository on my
computer, the file appears blank.

None of this makes any sense to me. Could someone please help me
understand what is going on?

Thank you so much.



Benjamin
