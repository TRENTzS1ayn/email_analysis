Dear friends:

I am taking the liberty of sharing with list members Vincent Quint's
response to my original "Amaya freezes system" letter of yesterday. My
thanks to him for his help and insight. I am looking forward to Amaya
2.1.

Benjamin

When parsing this page Amaya enters an infinite loop. It tries to
recover from HTML errors, but the structure is so weird that it gets
completely confused.  The worst cases are missing or erroneous </font>
closing tags.  The first few lines of this page contain a number of such
cases, including tags like </FONT color=#000080 size="3"> (don't repeat
attributes in the closing tag).

Being an editor, Amaya tries to fix the document structure if there are
errors. Otherwise, it could not edit the document properly, as most of
its actions are based on the document structure.

If you want your pages to be readable not only by IE or NN, but by any
HTML browser, they have to be valid.  Use a HTML conformamt editor like
Amaya to create your pages.  Discard editors that produce invalid
markup.
Refer to the HTML specification when you write HTML "by hand":

   http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/

and validate your pages, for instance with

   http://validator.w3.org/

(Change at least the DOCTYPE declaration before validating your russian
index, as this declaration is wrong and confuses the validator).

Here are some explanations:

In the following situation:

     <h3><center>WELCOME:</CENTER></H3>

Amaya ignores the <center> tag as it is not valid within a h3 tag.
You should write the opposite, h3 within center:

     <center><h3>WELCOME:</h3></center>

We have discovered a bug with jpeg images.  This bug has been fixed in
version V2.1 wich will be released this week (Thursday at the latest).

I have no explanation for that one.  Could you send me such a file, or
an URI?

Thanks for your report.

Vincent.
