Hello Joseph,

Thanks for your bug report.

In our previous episode, Joseph M. Reagle Jr. said:

> I finally got part of a keyboard file working on Windows NT by noting that people kept speaking of amaya.kb, when the documentation actually says amaya.kbd.

Oops! Thanks, I fixed the doc.

Tim reported this behavior too under NT. I changed the way that Amaya 
handles its user directories and it should work much better now. This
is now available on CVS and will be in the forthcoming release.

We'll look at your keyboard problems and answer back in another mail.

-Jose
