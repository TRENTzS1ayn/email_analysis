Amaya supports the HTML INS and DEL attributes. You can give those classes,
and use stylesheets to provide the renderings you want. (I use this for
co-authoring - you can have a stylesheet that makes all DEL display:none and
all INS appear as completely normal, and another that makes them visible with
distinguishing features according to who did them.

If you could create macros to automagically add the right class when you mark
something DEL or INS it would be handy.

I believe you can use a transform to remove the DEL elements with their
content, and remove the INS elements but leave the content of them in place.

  Hi,
  
  I have downloaded and learned how to use RCS and I have been enchanted
  how powerfull thing it is (another reason why using text files is The
  Right Thing). Howeve, I have got "new" idea:
  
  would it be possible for Amaya to support RCS (and CVS laterly)?
  
  I mean something like Versions item in Word menu, which would work on
  RCS backend.
  
  What about that?
  
  Have a nice day
