I am afraid, that this exactly is The Bad Thing. See
http://www.hut.fi/u/jkorpela/webpub.html of Jukka Korpela for reasoning
and better exaplantion of my point. I hope, that at least W3C supports
the very ideas on which HTML is supposed to be based.

However, if the idea was intended to just contrary (elimination of bold
element as much as possible -- especially in toolbar), I would vote for.

Have nice day

Matthew
