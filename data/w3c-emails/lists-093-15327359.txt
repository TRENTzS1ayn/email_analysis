  I'll see why Ctrl <key>+ and Ctrl <key>- do not work. This will be
fixed soon.

On Windows, shortcuts are introduced in something called accelerator
table.
This used to be done in a resource file (fortunately, it is not the case
for Amaya and
this is the reason why you can "dynamically" configure your shortcuts. I
even can say
that the only application on Windows allowing to do this is Amaya).
The structure of the accelerator table does not allow to combine
a sequence "a la emacs" such as Ctrl <Key>l, Ctrl <Key>d. This is the
main reason which lead me to create a particular amaya.kb file for
Windows.
