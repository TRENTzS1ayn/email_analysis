Although not insurmountable, Lynx has the advantage that it
is text only, but you can actually use Refresh: on other 
media types, even though most people actually use it as a
meta header (usually on servers that don't understand meta
elements!), often because they don't know how to generate 
30x HTTP responses, or because their ISP won't allow them
that level of control.

If Amaya generates a pseudo link, it will need to wrap images,
etc. in a virtual web page.
