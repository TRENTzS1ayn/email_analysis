The Amaya team is proud to announce the availability of the 2.1 release

  A FAQ is available at http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/FAQ.html

That release includes some extensions and fixes the most important reported 
bugs.
For more details please read the page http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/New.html

 
This is the list of 2.1 extensions:
----------------------------------
* User preferences:
  - Changed the behavior of the user and temporary directories under Windows.
  - Stopped using the Windows registry to store state information.
  - The directory where the user preferences are stored is now a fixed one.
    The user may change the location of the temporary directory as well as
    that of the cache. Windows users are advised to reselect their preferences,
    rather copying their precedent thot.rc file. You may copy your amaya.css,
    HTML.conf, and dictionary.DCT files from your old Amaya home directory
    to its new location. For more information, consult the
    Help/Configuring Amaya document.

* User Interface:
  - The Save item in menu File and the Save button are disabled when the
    document does not need to be saved.
  - Menu entries Quotation, Subscript, Superscript, and BDO can be set
    or unset from the "Character element" menu.
  - New colorful button bar
  - New Home button
  - command File/New has been changed. It now proposes 3 possibilities:
    + "New HTML document" displays a form to choose the location of the
      document to be created before it displays a blank page.
    + "From template" proposes a list of templates to be used for the new
      document when you have a template server.
    + "New CSS" displays a form to choose the style sheet location first.
  - Menu Special/Preferences contains a new item for language negotiation.
  - In addition to the color palette in the Special/Preferences/Colors
    menu, the user may now type in directly the color code (the color
    palette is only available under Windows).
 
* Thot API: Due to a conflict with the libjpeg definition the Thot type
  boolean has been renamed ThotBool.
 
* MathML: the full presentation part of MathML is now supported, but not
  all attributes are yet taken into account when formatting mathematical
  expressions.

* LibWWW:
  - Updated to version 5.2.9.
  - libwww is now compiled as a number of mini libraries instead of big,
    monolithic one.  We only compile those that are needed for Amaya, thus
    reducing the compilation time and size of the Amaya executable.
  - The libwww cache entry wasn't being updated when saving a previously
    cached document.
  - Tagged the libwww CVS base with an "Amaya" tag, showing the reference
    version used in the latest Amaya release.
 
* New list of Amaya shortcuts for both Windows and Unix platforms.
