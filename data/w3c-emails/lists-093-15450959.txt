I'm afraid I have to report the Print Button still doesn't work properly
on w95. Of course I may be mistaken in thinking this problem was fixed for
this release, perhaps the problem is still being investigated in which
case please just take this as an observation on the state in 2.1.

For reference, on w95 OSR2:
 - printing from the File Menu is fine
 - the Print Button goes through the motions without any error reports
>> but no output appears <<

Something has changed from 2.0a because with that version the Print Button
always printed to the most recently installed printer (regadless of what
printer was selected in the panel). With 2.1 I cannot find any trace of
output to any of my installed printers.

Another report I made on v2.0a was that after printing the focus was not
returned to Amaya but to the "previous" window (as if an extra <Alt-Esc>
action is being invoked). The problem is still present although clearly it
isn't of major importance.

Yesterday I got a printed copy of the "Welcome to Amaya 2.1" page that was
mis-rendered. I have not reproduced the fault this morning but I'll report
it anyway:

The print I got had the text "Release 2.1" and the paragraph leader
"Amaya" rendered well oversize. Everything else was fine (the first
paragraph was positioned for the expected, rather than the actual,
rendered size of the text "Amaya"). My only thought at present was that
yesterday I had gone forward to the online manual, done a <make book> and
printed that and then went <back> to the welcome page to print it. So
maybe <make book> had left something wrongly set?

regards,
Malcolm.
