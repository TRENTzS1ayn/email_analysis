The Amaya team announces the public availability of its CVS repository.

Checking out the code base directly from our CVS repository allows you to 
follow the development of Amaya closely and to contribute much easier. Also, 
you will be able to get bug fixes that are made between releases.

In fact, if you intend to provide patches then you should use the CVS 
repository! Access to the CVS base is only available in read-only mode.

Detailed information is found at:

http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/cvs.html

Many thanks to Daniel Veillard and Henrik Frystyk for their help in setting
this service.

Enjoy!

-Jose
