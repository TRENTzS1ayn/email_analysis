  The problem was caused by the inlining optimizing macros of glibc-2.1
and the fact that Thot includes were remapping memcpy() and memmove()
to bcopy. Both defines clashed and resulted in an invalid C code after
preprocessing. It's seems related too to the removal of the HAVE_MEMCPY
test in the configure stuff.
  Apply the included patch to your code base, I will commit it to the
CVS base as soon as possible,
  Now that this is fixed i will produce RedHat-6.0 RPMs,

Daniel
