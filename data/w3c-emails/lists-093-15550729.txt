http://www.wimbledon.org is built on a mess of tables which appear to use a
"spacer" element. Unfortunately this is not an HTML element, so it doesn't
have the desired effect. I had a look at the about this site page, which
doesn't have the problem.

I also looked at the feedback page, but unfrotunately they use a javascript
to submit the form, so I couldn't give direct feedback. About the only thing
you can do is complain to IBM or the All England Tennis Club (who run the
tournament) directly, or use another browser to complain that you can't
access the site using your preferred browser.
