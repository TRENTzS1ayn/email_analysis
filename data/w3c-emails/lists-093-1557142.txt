Hello,

We realized that two files were missing from the Amaya 0.9 tar file.
This file was made available to W3C members on November 14.

If you had downloaded Amaya prior to today (November 19), you can
request those files by sending a mail to jose.kahan@w3.org or
irene.vatton@w3.org, with the subject "Amaya 0.9 update."

As the tar file has been corrected, you can also download this now
complete distribution from the w3c servers. See [1] for more instructions
on how to download the Amaya distribution.

Best regards,


-JK
