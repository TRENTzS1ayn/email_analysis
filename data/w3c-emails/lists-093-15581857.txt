1. In the list of functions in the configuration help, it gives a function
for a new file, but not a new style sheet or file from a template. Are there
function names for those? (Is there somewhere in the source where all those
names are listed, or I can easily find them?)

2. The configuration file gives the functions FrSpellCheck and
EnSpellCheck, and I thought it should just be SpellCheck - am I confused or
is the file out of date?

2.1 seems cool...

3. Is there a way of setting different key bindings for browser mode and
editor mode? Is it difficult to make it read the key-bindings again (perhaps
from a different file) on a command, or is this too complex to do except at
startup?

cheers
