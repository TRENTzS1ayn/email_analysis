Actually that may not be so. IBM have a strong commitment to accessibility
for disabled users, many of who have great difficulty "getting another
browser". Some of the problems in this site are the same problems that group
of users experience (and IBM are producers of a speech output browser
themselves, so should have some sympathy) so they may be more interested than
you fear. In my experience a large organisation like IBM is prepared to do
The Right Thing, but cannot ensure all their employees know everything they
need to all the time. Identifying problem areas is often very helpful.

After all, Amaya is only one of the standards-compliant browsers which have
problems with poorly coded pages.

  I'm sure that all I'll get from IBM is "Use another browser". :)  They do all
  the sites for the major tennis tournaments and IE and Netscape work fine.  I
  guess I'll jsut relegate Amaya to testing my own pages before I put them up.
  
  Thanks!
