Amaya2.1 Win95-98.  Openned Amaya.kb in Notepad.
Added 2 lines:  Ctrl <key>SpecialKey='Home': TtcPageTop
                Ctrl <key>SpecialKey='End':  TtcPageEnd


Saved as amaya.txt and then changed amaya.kb to amaya.bak
and amaya.txt to amaya.kb.

So now Control Home takes me to the beginning of a page
and Control End takes me to the end of the page.

Would be interested in reading or hearing from others
about the shortcut keys they have installed.  What were
the old Wordstar key combos or WP combos or Emacs combos?

Thanks.  Really like the idea of a combo editor/browser.
