 I have compiled Amaya with XFree-3.1.2F versions, maybe your XFree server
is a bit oudated. But since the basic X protocol remains the same this
should only be warnings, AFAIK there should be no incompatibilities
of recent clients with older servers. Moreover, Amaya is dynamically
linked on Linux, so it uses your X11 shared libraries (except for Motif
which is linked in). You can check the libraries used with ldd on the
binary amayamain.

 You can still try to upgrade to XFree-3.2 binaries. 

  hope this help,

Daniel
