I wanted to use templates with amaya (WindowsNT version) but I did not found
any info how to make it work.

Well it states that I have to use a template server but where do I get one?

We currently have a directory on our server where all our word, excel and
html templates can be found. Is there a possibility to tell amaya that it
should look for templates in a special directory or ftp server?

Thanks in advance
