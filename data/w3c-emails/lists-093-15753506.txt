I grabed the rpm for rh60 last night and find that it gets an "unrecoverable 
thot error" when trying to load a page containing a PNG image. Switching the 
image to a GIF version allows the page to be loaded.

I am running rh60 with all of the current updates installed. Has anyone else 
found this problem? I have had problems with PNG using XV also if that is any 
help. The PNG files are built with gnuplot and GIMP. Netscape 4.6 and 4.6.1 
have no problems displaying the PNG images.

I also tried building the program from the sources but have had numerous 
missing symbol messages when I tried to link the various programs. I am fluent 
in C and will try to track these problems down. A first pass look a the 
problem seems to indicate that macros are preventing the necessary pieces of 
the source files from being compiled. Haven't had the time yet to trace it 
back to the cause yet.
