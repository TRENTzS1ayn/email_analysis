Instructions on the W3C page correspond to the standard distribution but
they should work also for the RPM distribution when you know where is located 
the Amaya hierarchy.

That hierarchy includes:
Amaya --- amaya ---- *.STR
        |          | *.PRS
        |          | etc.
        | config --- 
        |
        | dicopar ---
        |
        | LINUX-ELF --- bin --- amaya
                              | print

The /usr/bin/amaya should point to the binary Amaya/LINUX-ELF/bin/amaya located
in the Amaya hierarchy. Dictionary tar files have to be untared into the main
directory Amaya. For example English.tar.gz includes dicopar/Eprinc.dic and 
that
dictionary must be installed into the subdirectory dicopar of Amaya.

Windows distributions include dictionaries. Perhaps RMP distribution should 
include dictionaries too.
Regards
  Irene.
