Hello,

You can check that in the directory Amaya/tools/mkdep/
I guess you didn't follow building instrucions and you configure
at the top level instead of creating a subdirectory first.

The right way to process is:
a) create a subdirectory
b) go into this new subdirectory and start "../configure"
c) have a look at Option.orig and start "make all"

Regards
  Irene.
