   Same here, except XV ... The difference in the RPM build is that it tries
to use the system shared libs instead of the version installed in Amaya source
tree.
   The temporary solution seems to be to link with the PNG code coming from
the Amaya source tree until the problem is debugged.

Might be the lack of Motif. You need Motif development libraries to build Amaya.
