Just got the Amaya 2.1 source RPM and built it on my Alphastation
(modified Linux RH 5.1 setup - 6.0 is *way* too unstable on an Alpha...)

egcs-1.0.3a-14
lesstif-0.88.0-1 (may be important for a behavior I describe below)

Some notes:

* Jpegs load now - I had a problem with the 2.0 RPMs - worked fine
  except no jpegs.  Works in 2.1

* Some pages display rather oddly.  This is more likely the fault of
  the code than Amaya, but pages like www.slashdot.org render
  strange - larger than the window.  (Mozilla displays them fine.)  
  This would not be a real problem were it not for the fact that the
  horizontal scrollbar doesn't work and there's no way to see the
  stuff that's past the window borders.  (I've heard this mentioned
  before, but I don't remember the fix, if there was one)  Does this
  have to do with the Lesstif version I'm using?  A build from the
  tarball gives me the same results, so it's probably not an oddity in
  the RPM.

Other than that, nice job making a brwoser/editor that actually works
on Alpha/Linux! :)
