I was just wondering if Amaya is supposed to be able to click on links and
such, is it supposed to be an actual 'browser' where you can browse the
page? Or is it merely for testing purposes and not being able to click on
things? If you can't click on links, will you please add that function
into the next version? Because, Amaya is the only web browser at ALL that
I can get to run on my computer, Netscape doesn't run right, I always get
a bus error, and I like Amaya so I wish it was a fully functional browser.
Thank you for your time in reading this email.
