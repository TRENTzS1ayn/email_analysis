This is factually incorrect.  Motif is an interface toolkit, not
a window manager (though there is also a Motif window manager).
Applications written to this toolkit do require a Motif library as
well as X11 unless you run a binary which was compiled with the Motif
libraries statically linked.

XFree86 does not include Motif-compatible libraries.

Yes, try "Lesstif" by the Hungry Programmers (see lesstif.org I believe).

This is a desktop environment (and also includes a window manager),
which is not required and does not provide any libraries that Amaya
uses, though of course it is possible to run Amaya under it (or any
other desktop environment such as GNOME or CDE).

Hope that helps,
