Hi,

Perhaps it's a problem of a too short delay to detect the double click.
Can you compile Amaya on your platform? If yes, I suggest you to make a small
change just to test if it solves the problem.

In file Thot/ thotlib/dialogue/appli.c: 
-      else if (t1 + (Time) 500 > ev->xbutton.time)
+      else if (t1 + (Time) 1000 > ev->xbutton.time)

Happy new year
  Irene.
