Hello,

This morning, I obtained, extracted and build Amaya 1.4 successfully on my
HPUX 10.20 machine. No problem so far. Now the installation and  first time
running Amaya 1.4. I already have amaya 1.3a running so I know what to
expect.

Installing the software, I started putting amaya 1.4 over 1.3a:
- `gmake install` complained: the softlink from the bin directory to
the real executable cannot be created.
True, it was already available.
Please update the install with a check for existing
of components and act on it.

Since putting 1.4 over 1.3 was an accident, I moved the 1.3 install tree
and installed amaya 1.4 in a fresh place:
- `gmake install` complained: the directory given with
`configure --prefix=...` is not available.
Most installs create this directory but amaya does not.
It would be nice if the install creates the directory.

After creating the prefix directory:
- `gmake install` complained: the <prefix>/bin directory is not available.
Since other subdirs are created, the install must create
this dir as well.

So far so good: I succeeded in installing. Now the running part: In the
source tree, there is a lot of documentation in the doc directory. These
docs are not installed with `gmake install` and there is no target in the
makefile to install this documentation on its own (at least, not
documented).
Please install the documentation with the executable.

Ok, I copied the doc directory to the installation and I started amaya. With
Amaya 1.3 I have not put a homepage in my .thotrc file, homepage is empty.
This expects amaya to start with an empty page but it starts with:
/appl/tools/amaya/share/thot/amaya/AmayaPage.html. I recal I've updated
amaya 1.3 to take this page for a default homepage but I never put it in the
settings for 1.4. I found the name AmayaPage.html in the file amaya/init.c
but the file is not in the doc directory. Where is AmayaPage.html? How can
I configure a default homepage (being empty)? Please update the defaults
for Amaya to something that works after install: default the homepage
to this AmayaPage.html on the local file system.

By the way: The help->browsing (and other help->...) button directs to
something on the web (the proxy username & password box comes up) but
crashes amaya once it arives. In the distribution, there is a file
doc/amaya/Browsing.html. Please default amaya to obtain the help info
from the local file system, not from the web.This speeds-up the help
on our side and does not slow down your server.


By the way, I got amaya running and as far as I can see, 1.4 is better
than 1.3. Thanks for Amaya.

Regards,

Corne
