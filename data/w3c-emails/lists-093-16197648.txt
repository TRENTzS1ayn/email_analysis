Done

You have to do make uninstall to remove the previous installation.

That should work in next release.

The amaya home page is located in the directory Thot/amaya
If you want to set your default home page you have to edit the variable
HOME_PAGE=xxx in your file $HOME/.thotrc but xx should exist.
Personally I open by default my HotList.html file.

Amaya look for the help page on the Web because the install procedure
doesn't copy the documentation. That should be fixed in next release.
Nevertheless Amaya shouldn't crash.
