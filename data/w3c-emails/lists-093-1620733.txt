Hello,

   I'm a student currently working on extensibility of Web Browsers to support
   new DTD Models ( to manage new documents ) and their associated presentation
   form.The goal of my survey is to build a complete (simple) environnement to
   manage documents ( Browsers, Servers, indexation engine...) for hospitals.

   I would like to know where i can find Browsers-sources to achieve my work,
   and when Amaya sources will be released.
   Can Amaya support new DTDs and presentation models ?
   Does the API gives access to internal tree-structure of the documents?,or
   interactivity with new Tags developped?

Regards,

Alexandre Mutel
