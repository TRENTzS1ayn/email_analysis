Can you document it with the next release? You are right telling me I sould
not overwrite the previous release but I think if it is not good overwriting
the previous release, it is easy checking the emptyness of the installation
directory and act accordingly.

This homepage remains in the source tree which is not accessable for other
users. The installation directory is available to them. Please provide a
route to install this documentation with the executable.

How do I create/modify the default $HOME/.thotrc? I'd like to modify this
default to set the homepage and proxy variables.

As written, the HOME_PAGE= is set to nothing, I'd expect an emty page. On
the other hand, now it's empty, it fetches
/appl/tools/amaya/share/thot/amaya/AmayaPage.html, where /appl/tools/amaya
comes from `../configure --prefix=/appl/tools/amaya`. The file is not available
after installation.

For most of the (our) users, the internet is not available. How can I change this?


What I'd like to see is:
- Option to `configure` for the documentation root
if not given, default to current usage
if filespec: put it there
if URL: expect it being there.
- Option to `configure` for the homepage (for fallback / for .thotrc default)
if not given, default to current usage
if filespec: put it there if not already there.
if URL: expect it being there.
- default .thotrc file for system wide defaults. (if already available, document it)

For most of my whishes, i've found routes to fulfill them, except for the
help being not available to users without internet access.

Thanks for Amaya,

Corne
