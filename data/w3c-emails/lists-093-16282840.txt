Is it intended that Amaya (and by extension, Thot) is to be developed
publicly - i.e. by those not of the core (W3C) team?  I have found no
statement on development strategy on w3.org.

I have yet to find a low-cost graphical browser available for Linux that
I consider satisfactory in use.  However, Amaya is the closest I have come
to that and I am willing to spend time on Amaya's development to bring it
up to scratch.

Whether or not Amaya is to be openly developed, anonymous CVS (or similar)
access to the Amaya source would be useful.  This would allow
incremental source downloads, reducing download cost and load on your
server.  Is such access available?
