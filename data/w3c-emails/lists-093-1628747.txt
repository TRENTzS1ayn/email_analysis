Our plan is to make the source code of Amaya available to W3C members by the end of 
December (one month later for other users).

Amaya is a Web application based on the Thot generic toolkit which allows one:
  - to extend the HTML structure (the HTML structure is described by an external file)
  - to write new presentation models (each presentation model is also an external file)
  - to manage documents internal tree-structure through an API (each change in the
     tree-structure is automatically reported into the displayed image of the document by the 
     Thot toolkit itself).
The Thot toolkit is a part of the Amaya source code.

Regards
  Irene.
