I would like to thank Irene for trying to help me.

Well I have found the problem. The problem wasn't with Amaya, but with the
window manager which was apparently not handling correctly Amaya's double
click.

I was using  sspkg21LinuxElf Version 2.1, a port of SlingShot 2.1 for
XView3.2,XFree86 3.1.1 and the openwin script.

Now I'm under Mwm the window's manager of Lesstif (clone of Motif). Amaya
works fine.
