Hello Ewan,
 
In our previous episode, E.E. Mellor said:

You're right. We don't have such statement yet, but one of our goals for
this year is to open up our CVS base.
 
Up to now, only the core W3C team has read/write access to the Amaya 
CVS base.  Whenever we get contributions, we evaluate and integrate them
ourselves. Indirect contributions make their way inside Amaya by means
of the libraries (e.g., libwww, jpeg, png, ...) which Amaya uses.

Sounds good. What is your wish list of things to improve?
 
I'd suggest you try to coordinate with the Amaya team to avoid the
duplication of work. Feel free to contact any of us.

We're starting work on opening our Amaya CVS base to the public.
In a first time, it'll have world read-only access. This should take place
in one or two months. Depending on the response and on the quality of
contributions, we may open a write access to other people afterwards.
 
Cheers,
