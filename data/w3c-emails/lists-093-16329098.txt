Extensions 1.4a:
---------------
* Erich Koerting updated the German dialogue files. Thanks!
 
* On Unix platforms only, the variable DOUBLECLICKDELAY of the registry
  $HOME/.thotrc allows one to control the delay (in millisecond) under which
  two mouse clicks are classed as a double-click. The default value is
  500 ms.
 
* Increased the default network timeout from 20000 ms to 60000 ms.
 
* Changed the USE_CACHE registry variable to ENABLE_CACHE, to be conform
  to the other registry variables.

 Fixed bugs 1.4a:
---------------
 
* There was a memory leak when following an internal link pointing
  to an inexistent anchor.
 
* Links which point to non-existent documents or invalid URLs
  are now left in the "active" state, instead of being set to the
  "visited" state.
 
* Browsing an image from an edited document (and thus requiring the
  opening of a new document window), didn't show the image.
 
* Patches in Amaya Makefiles (suggestions from Sam and Adam)
 
* Patch for compiling libwww under FreeBSD (contributed by Don Croyle)
  
* When one created a table while the current selection pointed to an empty
  paragraph, Amaya tried to replace the empty paragraph by the table, but
  there was a bug which corrupted the Amaya internal structure.
 
* When requesting a document from a slow site, pressing the Stop button
  before the network connection was established could crash Amaya
 
* When downloading a document with images from the net, following any
  internal link in the document caused the interruption of the whole download.
 
* There was no protection against a redirection to a URL with
  protocols not handled by Amaya
 
* In case of a redirection error, Amaya would not automatically
  terminate the request
