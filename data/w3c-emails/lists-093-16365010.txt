Hi;

As a follow up to my previous message about missing files in 1.4a, it
appears that an entire directory: thot/winnt/amaya, is missing. This
directory at a minimum contains files "editor.h" and "html.h". This is
based on the presence of dependencies .\amaya\editor.h and  .\amaya\html.h
in thot/winnt/amaya.mak.

As was previously noted, the Thot/doc/amaya/Win-Compiling.html file is also
missing from the distribution.
