I agree completely (although I'm not sure I like the name, since I'm
running away from Netscape :-)

The CVS tree should definitely be read-only as far as the general public
are concerned; I think that's what Jos? was proposing anyway.  It would
also greatly help me - I now have the prospect of the second 4Mb download
in three days, in order to move from 1.4 to 1.4a.  This seems a little
daft, to say the least.
