An uninstall should attempt to remove the files it installed.  An
install should not make any assumptions about the environment it is
going into.  Casually removing a complete directory tree is a bad idea 
in either case, since you have no way of knowing what files may have
been added.  For example, I had the english dictionary installed.
Having it deleted is no big deal, since I still have the distfile, but 
what if I had local working files in there?
