I suggest you have 2 install options for this.  I almost always chuck out
the old source distributions of software some time before I get the new
stuff, so I don't have the facility to uninstall the previous versions
using make uninstall as people seem to expect. (Reason?  Disk space.).  
So having a make target to clear out files known to be in the destination
tree from provious releases is a useful idea.  But you don't have to make
its use mandatory.
