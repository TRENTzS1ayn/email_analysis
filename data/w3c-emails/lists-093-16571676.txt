IMHO: If the --prefix directory is not available on installation: build the
directory tree as necessary for the installation (see a previous mail: the
--prefix/bin directory is not created)

If the --prefix directory is available: expect it to be an installation of
amaya. Do NOT remove everything in the blind but selectivily remove files
which will be overwritten with the current version. Optionally remove files
from previous versions which are not needed anymore. And build the directory
tree as necessary for the installation.
