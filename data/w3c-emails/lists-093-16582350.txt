Amaya 1.4 is a useful tool.

I like the structure editor a lot and there are many other features like the
math editor which are very innovative.

For my normal work I mainly miss a HTML-Source editor. Just a button or menu
which opens a text-editor like notepad (Windows) or emacs would be all I
need.

Thanks for your good work.
