Hello Anne-Marie,

Thanks for your remarks. For the moment, here's a short
answer for two points of your mail.

> - I can't save any remote document (my home page): when selecting "save" or
> "save as" nothing happens in some case. When closing the document and
> answering Yes to the question about saving it, it tries to write on a wrong
> server. After reading the documentation I understand that it is since my
> server does not accept the put command, but the "save as" command should
> have worked in any case.
>
> - I cannot browse through remote Urls, or even some of the local relative ones
