Unfortunately, Amaya does not currently display animated GIFs - instead it
shows only the first frame.  We could do with someone to add that
functionality.

There does seem to be Java support with Amaya, but I have not tried it
yet myself.  It is turned off by default and seems to require extra
downloads.  Unfortunately, I cannot find the amaya-java-src-1.4a.tar.gz on
either the EU or US FTP sites.  There is a file
ftp://ftp.w3.org/pub/amaya/old/amaya-java-src-1.1c.tar.gz available, but I
doubt that that will work with the current version of Amaya.
Perhaps someone other than myself could comment on the Java support in
Amaya.

Ewan.
