  Not exactly, Amaya-Java is not Java applet support for amaya. It's
actually an experimental version embedding the Kaffe Java interpreter
to extend the capabilities of amaya using Java scripting. It also uses
the Jigsaw Java HTTP library for network accesses.

  I plan to rebuild a version of Amaya-Java, Kaffe has changed a lot since
the last working version of Amaya-Java and it's difficult to guarantee
a precise timeframe for the availability of the next Amaya-Java. 
  I will attempt to rebuild it in the following weeks though,
