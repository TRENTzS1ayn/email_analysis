For functionallity available with general tools which is usefull for amaya,
I'd like to see some 'hooks' to have amaya start my favorite tool:

For editing source, amaya should switch to readonly mode and start the
ascii-editor which is configured in the thodrc file: "ascii_editor=nedit
%d/%f". Once this editor is closed, amaya should re-read the file. As far as
I can see, netscape has a similar approach.

For handling url's which amaya cannot handle, like "mailto:" amaya should be
capable on invoking other applications, configurable in the thodrc file:
"mailto_app=dtmail %u".

Details on invocation of those applications, they accept the next options:
"%f"Filename (without directory: index.html in an url)
"%d"Directory (the /Amaya in an url
"%%"% character
"%h"Hostname or domainname (the www.w3.org in an url)
"%p"Protocol (the http in an url)
"%u"entire url (http://www.w3.org/Amaya/index.html)
And others I don't think of at this moment.

Regards,

CB
