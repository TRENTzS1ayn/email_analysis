Amaya is not moving towards a browser. We added the possibility to prevent
documents to be edited by error. Some times documents are downloaded only to
copy information or to make or test a link.

If Amaya was not tolerant it had rejected the document. But what you're asking 
is
that all browsers manage errors in the same way. What I would prefer is that 
users
ask altavista page providers to build valid HTML pages and avoid these errors.
The HTML structure is not so complex. It takes two minutes to put the <FOPRM>
</FORM> around the Table, but days of work to understand at parsing time what 
the
author wanted to do.
