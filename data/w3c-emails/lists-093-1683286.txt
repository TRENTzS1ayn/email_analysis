Because of a slight problem with Amaya 0.9a, it's necessary
to download the dictionary files that go with it. Otherwise,
Amaya will crash. 

You may find links to the dictionaries at the following URL:

http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Amaya/User/


We are currently working on this problem.

Sorry for the inconvenience,


-Jose
