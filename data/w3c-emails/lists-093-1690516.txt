We have corrected the problem. There were two missing files
on the tar file. If you have not yet retrieved Amaya 0.9a, 
dismiss this bug report and download Amaya as usual [1].

If you had already retrieved Amaya and did not retrieve
any dictionary files, then you can either:

(1) Retrieve once again the Amaya 0.9a tar file
(2) Retrieve the patch file given by [2] and
            explode it directly on the directory above 
    the one called "Amaya."
            This patch contains the missing files.


Hope this is of help.

Cheers!

-Jose
