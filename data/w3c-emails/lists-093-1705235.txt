Greetings,

I only joined the list recently, so excuse me if this is a totally dimwit 
question. I am known to have made several in my past...

When trying to use a table to construct a nice grid for holding both 
graphics and text, Amaya seems to ignore the graphics in a cell so that 
the text in the next TD element appears layered over the graphic, i.e. the
column width does not get set according to the size of the graphic. I have
tried to set the HEIGHT and WIDTH attributes for the IMG, but to no avail.

Is this something there are no specs for, so that browsers can choose how 
to display graphics in a table, or am I just being a loser with my HTML? 
Or (dare I say it) is it a bug in Amaya?

I know that the method of using a table to enforce a layout is probably 
not what it is originally intended for, but I find it rather handy 
nevertheless.

Other than this, Amaya is an excellent program. Wysiwyg SGML editors 
(such as FrameMaker+SGML) have a lot to learn from the ease of use of 
Amaya as regards the workflow of writing a structured document.

Keep up the good work,

Sami
