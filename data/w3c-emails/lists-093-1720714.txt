Hello Anne-Marie,

I visited you yesterday and I answered your questions, but I guess it is necessary to publish 
these answers in the list.

First point, you used the old release (0.8).

The "save" command doesn't work when you try to save on a server which doesn't
support the PUT. You should have a "error message". Perhaps there is a trouble when
you use a proxy.
The "save as" command allows you to write the document on other place (a local file in your
case), but you have to give a rigth path (no space in the pathname and the directory has to exist).

I didn't see examples of this problem.

We plan to have the "undo" command soon. Meanwhile please use "cut" instead of "delete".

Yes I saw. But "Lowrsc" is not a valid attribute. When you use invalid tags and attributes, the
result is not garantied.

There is no need of specific command.
You have just to copy and paste the link as any other element in the document.
If you select the characters string alone (displayed in blue), the copy/paste copies the characters string,
if you want to copy the link, you have to select the link. The ESC command allows you to move
the selection up to the link element and you can then copy the link.

I am sure there is a lack of protection in Amaya.
Can you analyze what you were doing when Amaya crashed.

It will be very useful to have precise conditions of bug detections.
Different persons work differently and sometimes we are not able to reproduce the detected bug.
In this case, it is impossible for us to solve the problem.
Regards.
  Irene.
