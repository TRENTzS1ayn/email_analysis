Hello Anne Marie,

Yes, it's a known limitation. It happens because Amaya opens a new window
if you modified the current document (to avoid your losing your
modifications). With forms it's the same: type in some text in an
input zone, and Amaya thinks the your document has been modified. 

This is something that will be corrected soon. 

Hope this is of help,


-Jose
