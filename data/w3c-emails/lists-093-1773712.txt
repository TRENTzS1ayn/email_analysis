Maybe Amaya needs to have to concept of a write-protected page?  And
since "write-protected" is not one of the attributes returned on a
page, maybe you want to use a regexp to set this attribute.  If it's a
page off my server, I can modify it.  Otherwise it gets set to
write-protected.

By the way, I've got an edit.cgi and edit-upload.cgi, which let you
upload pages to a server.  Might this be useful to the Amaya project?
