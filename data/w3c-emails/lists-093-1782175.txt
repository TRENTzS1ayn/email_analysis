Hi Russ,

The problem I described about forms is not the one you're talking about :-)
Rather, it comes from the duality of having both an editor and a browser.
Where's the line separating those functionalities? 

Actually, the solution is not very complicated, but requires some time
to think about what's the best way to program it. Anyway, this limitation
will be soon eliminated.

An easier solution: let the user toggle at will between browser and editor
mode.

I wrote a PUT script which you can access from the Amaya user's manual [1].
I am currently revising it to make it HTTP/1.1 compliant. 

How do the scripts you propose differ from a PUT script? What's the
difference between edit.cgi and edit-upload.cgi? 

I propose we take this script track of the Amaya list and use
instead some person-to-person email between you and me.

Cheers!
