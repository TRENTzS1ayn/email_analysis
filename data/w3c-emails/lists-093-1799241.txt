But Amaya's Web page says:

   Amaya is a Web client that acts both as a browser and as an authoring
   tool.

So, browser or editor?

That's not a reason for all the versions of Amaya to use a thot.ini file
(by the way, why not amaya.ini?).  The UNIX version should use a .amaya
file and the windoze one whatever file that should make sense under
windoze.

It's not a problem about the syntax, but the name of the file.  I don't
want my home directory polluted with *.ini files :-)  UNIX traditionnally
uses dotfiles as configuration files (that's why ls(1) doesn't show them by
default).

Me too.  I just think about the basic UNIX user (such as a new student).

But this is a global configuration file.  What if each user of the system
want to set the size of her of his Amaya window?

But it should be useful anyway.

Then net$crap and mickey$oft will continue to add idiot tags (well, many
are already in HTML 3.2 and it seems strange to have them in parallel with
CSS1) to their proprietary HTML instead of thinking just a bit about how to
do the things right and they will impose these tags to the W3C (exactly as
happened with HTML 3.2).  The W3C needs a leading position in browser
technology as it will continue to appear as a pawn of net$crap and
mickey$oft.

UNIX rules !
