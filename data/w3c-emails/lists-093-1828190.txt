Hello:

I would just like to say that I think Amaya is great. I would recommend
it over Netscape any day.

The question I have is that Amaya is suppose to understand all HTML 3.2
commands. I am not an expert but I was just wondering does that mean it
will be able to do frames and understand Java Applets. I am asking this
because the webpage I am working on has a ticker tape in it but Amaya
does seem to load it or the frames.
