Hello,


Here are some missing files in the Amaya 0.95b distribution 
(for SGI and Solaris 2.5 at least) which prevent to compile or run it.


1) For printing: the files en-printdialogue, fr-printdialogue are missing.
   On previous versions of Amaya, it was sufficient to take the same files
   from a distribution of Thot, but for Amaya 0.95b it seems to look
   for a new special type of font since there is this error message
   (on both SGI and Solaris 2.5):

WARNING: cannot open file fr-printdialogue
X Error of failed request:  BadValue (integer parameter out of range for operation)
  Major opcode of failed request:  51 (X_SetFontPath)
  Value in failed request:  0x2e
  Serial number of failed request:  6
  Current serial number in output stream:  8


2) make Amaya fails (at least on SGI),  because at least 
   amaya.h  and  amayamsg.h  are missing.



(Note: If you could answer me quickly how to solve the first point, 
it would help me to send an article at the end of the week).

Thanks in advance,

Philippe
