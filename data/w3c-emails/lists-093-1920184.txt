  Great, thanks a lot for your report and diffs.

  Did you try to compile Thot Editor also ? Sould be
just a matter of fetching thoteditor-src-2.0b.tar.gz from
ftp://opera.inrialpes.fr/pub/sources/thot/
extract it under Thot directory, cd to FreeBSD and type in
make thot
(also need to build the schemas in Thot/schemas to actually use it).

  Well I would be interested in the final content of the Thot/FreeBSD
directory, mainly the config.h and precompiled libraries (zlib, jpeg,
png and libwww) but I guess the main problem is to have Motif ...
Concerning the binaries I don't know what's the usual distribution
channel for FreeBSD binaries. However I would appreciate a binary
distribution to store here, e.g. a tar with :

Thot/FreeBSD/bin/amaya
Thot/FreeBSD/bin/print
Thot/batch/MachineType

that would be perfect !
If uploading, use ftp://opera.inrialpes.fr/incoming
