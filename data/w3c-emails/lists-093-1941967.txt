  Well I guess I won't have the time needed to do it in the normal way
(I didn't even took time to package things for RPM Linux RedHat).

  Well the Amaya Team will be at the WWW6 conf next week and we are
quite busy until then. Take your time, we will do a clean package
when you will have the latest version compiled. Time is not much an

version :-)

    thanks,
