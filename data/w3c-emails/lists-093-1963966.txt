  Good question, since we have a good answer :-)
The Amaya-1.0 release will occurs today for W3C Members,
they will be abble to find the new Amaya version by following
the http://www.w3.org/pub/member/Amaya/ URL ...

  This new version is twofold :

    - it can be conpiled with libWWW as usual. This is the
      estimated "stable" release.
    - it can be compiled with the Kaffe Java interpreter on
      a subset of the platforms (Linux, solaris, sunOs, linux-sparc)
      and then uses the Jigsaw client HTTP classes for network
      accesses. This provides a supported HTTP/1.1 network stack,
      and the long awaited user cache.

The new Amaya-Java also provides an easy way to extend or cusomize
Amaya without requiring a recompilation of the C source code. This
helps a lot especially for those without Motif libraries. Most ot the
Thot API is available from the Java language, providing means for
"enhanced developements".
I will present this work at the WWW6 conference next week during the
Developer's Day.
We expect the Kaffe interpreter (in fact it's a JIT compiler) to
stabilize on not yet supported platforms. Hence the Java based version
will become the standard one in the future releases.

I guess it answers your questions.

BTW: Thot-2.1 is now available on http://opera.inrialpes.fr/thot/
