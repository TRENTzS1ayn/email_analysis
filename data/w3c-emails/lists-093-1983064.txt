Amaya authors will be present at the WWW6 conference in Santa Clara next week.
It's a great opportunity to meet you during Amaya presentations (one in the 
conference
track and two in the Developers Day).
Due to the conference, meetings and vacations, you would receive no answer to 
your
mail during the next two weeks.
Regards
     Irene
