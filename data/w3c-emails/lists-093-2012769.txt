Greetings,

You people never fail to impress me. Thanks for another brilliant release.

Here is a list a few things I've discovered while everyone and his uncle has
been attending WWW6:

- - The Save As dialog does not work 100%. If you try to select the file to be
saved as from the list on the right of the dialog, the Document Location text
area does not reflect the selection, and you end up saving on top of the old
name. Learned it the hard way ;-)

- - the TD nowrap attribute does not survive reloading a file, i.e. it is lost
completely. I fixed this by modifying the translation file so that attribute
minimisation is not used.

- - Most attempts at transformations crash the program.

Keep up the good work!

Sami
