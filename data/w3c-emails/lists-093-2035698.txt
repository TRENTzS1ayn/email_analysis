New features in Amaya 1.0 and 1.0a

April 3 1997 and May 7, 1997

Extensions

  * Java support: Amaya now integrates the Java Kaffe runtime. This version
     uses the Jigsaw HTTP/1.1 classes to do network access, and provide a
     user cache. Most of the Thot API is available from the Java language
     offering an easy customization path for Amaya users. This also
     simplifies significantly the use of Amaya as a testbed since a lot of
     developements are done in Java and can easily be integrated to the
     existing base.

   * A plug-in mechanism allows OBJECTs to be executed.

   * A new command to create OBJECTs (HTML-Cougar) in Types menu.

   * Attribute LANG (HTML-Cougar) is implemented (see Attributes menu)

   * Elements SPAN (HTML-Cougar) are automatically created and deleted

   * Two new views are available (see the Views menu):

        o Links view shows and allows to edit all links in the document.

        o Table of Contents displays and allows to edit all (and only)
          headings (Hn).

     Like the Alternate and Structure view, these new views are
     "synchronised" with the other views of the document. These views can be
     printed with the document (see the Setup and Print command)

   * The Help button loads the Amaya documentation.

   * New menu "Special" with the following commands:

        o Transform (was the last item of the Types menu): structure
          transformations

        o Section Numbering: numbers headings (Hn) in the main view and in
          the table of contents. Numbers are automatically updated when
          headers are inserted or deleted. Section numbers are not saved
          with the document, but they are printed if numbering is active
          when the Print command is issued.

        o Make Book: allows to merge several HTML documents into a single
          one (for printing a collection, for instance). This is based on
          typed links (rel="chapter").

   * Printing has been extended:

        o "Setup and Print": this command proposes to change print options
          before printing. Parameters ManualFeed, Table of contents,
          Numbered links and default PostScript file name are reset when a
          new document is printed. New options are:
             + Table of contents: prints the Table_of_contents view of the
               document.
             + Numbered links: numbers links in the main view and prints
               them.
        o "Print": this command prints the document with the print
          parameters defined in previous "Setup and Print" command.

   * Directories are no longer automatically browsed when the user inserts
     them in the "Open Location" form. A new button (List) is added in this
     form that allows to explicitly browse the current directory.

   * It's now possible to extend dictionaries used by the spell-checker.
     When the user clicks on a (+dic) button in the spell-checker form, the
     current word is added to the common extensible dictionary. By default
     this common dictionary is located in $HOME/.thot.DIC, but the user can
     change this location in the .thotrc registry: EXTENDDICT=

   * Documents can be saved in text form (see Save As command), with a list
     of URLS for external links.

   * Images are zoomed according to attributes width and height. Combining
     the Control key with the Middle button of the mouse allows the user to
     easily resize an image.

   * CSS: More properties are supported: background-color, background-image,
     background-repeat, text-align.

   * The registry now supports $(MACHINE) for architecture dependent paths.

   * HTML markup is now in lowercase, to improve efficiency of compression
     tools.
