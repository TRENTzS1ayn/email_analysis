I downloaded the following tar files-thot-src-2.1.tar.gz and amaya-src-1.0.tar.gz.

I wanted to port Amaya to FreeBSD and followed all the instructions and 
finally, I generated the amaya executable in FreeBSD/bin/.But when I try to run it,
the following error was generated:

Error: Widget Barre_menu has zero width and/or height   


Where does the problem lie? What should I do?

Sudha.
