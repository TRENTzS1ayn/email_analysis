Hi,

I used Amaya 0.95 to create my web pages (link in signature).
Now I have Amaya 1.0, and when I changed the content in one page
and stored it, I noticed, that it had removed the border=0
attribute from  <IMG> tags. I was not able to add them back
using Amaya, I had to resort to vim to correct the pages.
