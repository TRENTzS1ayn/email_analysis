I can live with it being incorrect, and that you should use "x=1&amp;y=2"
as the value for the "src" tag.

In which case, my bug report is that if I read in a file containing:
<img src="wibble?x=1&amp;y=2">
When this is saved, Amaya turns this into:
<img src="wibble?x=1&y=2">

On a related note, should Amaya take your location for inserted images,
and take the "&" as "&amp;", or should it be the responsibility of the
user to enter it correctly?
