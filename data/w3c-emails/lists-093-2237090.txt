  This is harmless

  Humm shared libs incompatibilities ...

  Another one for amaya_java

  On my machine (where the Linux binaries were compiled)
I have :

        libm.so.5 => /lib/libm.so.5.0.6
        libc.so.5 => /lib/libc.so.5.3.12

There is at least a difference of one revision between both setups
for libc (5.2 instead of 5.3). I guess the best bet is to upgrade
to a libc release 5.3.

  These shared libs incompatibilities are annoying at least...

Daniel
