Exactly what happened to me...  Then I hid the plugins from
Amaya (by changing the name of the "plugintest" directory), and it's
started fine ever since . . .  Don't know exactly what those plugins do,
but they don't seem to be essential.  ;)

I'm running a libc 5.2.18 as well, so that shouldn't be your
problem.  Haven't tried the Java version myself.

Good luck,
