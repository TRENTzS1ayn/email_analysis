> BTW, do you know if somebody is working on a binary for HP-UX?

A previous version of Amaya (0.95 I think) has been compiled on HP-UX.
Today we don't have a well configured machine (with X and Motif libraries and 
includes)
to do the job.
But the Makefile has been designed to compile Amaya on this platform and I 
think you
would meet no difficulty making the HP-UX version of Amaya.
