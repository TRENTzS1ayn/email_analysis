It seems that your system losts events. I don't know why.

Thot has been designed to manage structured documents and it's a good 
candidate to
provide SGML tools. 
But Thot syntax is not the SGML syntax and Thot uses Structure schemas written 
in
language S instead of SGML dtds.

Our plan, at W3C, is to support XML instead of SGML.
