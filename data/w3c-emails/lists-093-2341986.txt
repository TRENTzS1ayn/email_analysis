  Jigsaw Java classes provides proxy support. Edit the
java.properties file located in Thot/config directory.
Add the three lines accordingly to your local setup :

; To set up a proxy
proxySet=true
proxyPort=3128
proxyHost=ballesta

This should redirect all HTTP accesses to your proxy, at least
it works fine here. If your proxy is also a cache you can
reduce or eliminate the local cache by editing the ~/.thotrc
in the [amaya] section :
setting 

NO_CACHE=yes 

disable the local cache . Setting 

CACHE_SIZE=5000000
CACHE_DIR=$(HOME)/.amaya/cache

allows to move the cache to another location and/or change the size.
One can also debug all the HTTP transactions done by the Jigsaw
classes by setting :

DEBUG_JAVA_NET=yes

You just need to restart amaya for the changes to take effect.

   hope this help,

Daniel
