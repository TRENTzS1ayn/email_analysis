First thing first, thank you very much for the source code release.

So far I am very happy with Amaya running on FreeBSD 3.0-current.

With respect to Widgets:

amulet is a very powerful graphic library with the ability to represent
constraints which are very nice for structured editors and animation.
I think that if anyone checks out their sample program "checkers" will
be very impress by its smooth animation for the game checkers.

Qt is also a nice widget and it has an interesting license such that if
you are willing to release the code for your application you don't need
to pay a fee. The advantage of Qt is that is small and it is easy to build
OO widgets with it.
