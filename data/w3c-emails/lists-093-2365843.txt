I installed Amaya 1.0a Beta today under LINUX-ELF with Java-Support.
(amaya-java-LINUX-ELF-1.0a.tar.gz).

When I try to open a document with 'http://' at the beginning of the URL,
Amaya connects to the Server, receives the requested page (the status line
shows the percentage) und than says 'Finished' in the status line, but
I only have a blank page. Not even the title has changed.

If I open a local document, everything works fine.

I also compiled everything (Thot, Amaya) from scratch - without success.

I'm running Linux version 2.0.28 (gcc 2.7.2) with libc.so.5.4.23 and libm.so.2.0.8.
I tried with Apache 1.1.1 on the same machine and on a SUN.

Does anybody know, what's wrong?
