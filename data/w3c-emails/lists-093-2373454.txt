Below is a compilation error..  Being that this is my first attempt to
compile anything for X-windows I'm a novice at troubleshooting for
dependancies I might need to support X.   Could anyone be patient in
helping me figure out what I'm doint wrong..  I know this probably isn't
enoght information, If anymore info is need let me know and I will respond
with the information.

This is on a FreeBSD 2.2.1 system.

Thanks,  Cowan
