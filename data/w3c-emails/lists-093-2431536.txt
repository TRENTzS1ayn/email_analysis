CTRL+<Key> commands are managed in the function ThotInput of the Thot library 
(located in
Thot/thotlib/dialogue/input.c).
The function InitTranslations registers key commands and the function 
ThotInput detects
when a key command is called.
The function ThotInput calls XLookupString before looking for a registered key 
command.
You should look at if the XLookupString has been changed ?

  Irene.
