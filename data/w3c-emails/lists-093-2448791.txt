My amaya.keyboard contains the default mappings, in the form

Ctrl <Key>a: TtcStartOfLine()

etc., plus some of my own favourites, e.g.

Ctrl <Key>s , Ctrl <Key>c: CreateElemCode()

which all worked before upgrading. I also upgraded my Red Hat 4.0 system to
4.1, but somehow I do not think this should have any effect, as other SW works
as usual.

Apart from this little annoyance, I must say that Amaya has come a long way
from the alpha versions last year. I do WWW development for a living, and Amaya
is now stable enough to be my primary development tool. There isn't really any
competition, as most HTML publishing packages do not pay much attention to the
underlying SGML DTD. As our company always aims at producing material which
adheres to the current recommendations, using another editor would be a royal
pain in the rear, due to the fact that after you have finished editing, you
would have to fire up a text editor and use some validation tools to sort out
the mess the publication software produces. With Amaya, there is no such need.

Great work,

Sami
