  Ok, just do a 

mkdir $HOME/.amaya/1 $HOME/.amaya/2  $HOME/.amaya/3 $HOME/.amaya/4 
$HOME/.amaya/5

It seems that the Java version doesn't check for the output directory
availability and don't create it if needed. 
This is a bug, but once the directories have been created everything
should work fine,
