Jim,

Thanks for your comments.
We will take your suggestions into account for the next release.
Here are some advices for centering text and editing tables.

You can do that in two different ways, using a CSS1 rule or an HTML attribute:

  - CSS1: select the element you want to center
          choose Format in the Style menu: you get a dialog box.
          in the first menu (Align) of this dialog box, click on the 3rd item.
          A style attribute is associated with the element (see the Structure
          view)

  - HTML 3.2: select the element (you must select an element that accepts
  the align attribute. The Esc key may be useful).
          choose align in the Attribute menu.
  choose center in the align menu and click Apply.
  An align attribute is associated with the element.

Table formatting is far from perfect in the current implementation of Amaya.
Agreed.  But you can help Amaya by specifying the width of some columns.
Just select the first cell of each column (element TD or TH) and select
width from the Attributes menu. Then enter the width to be assigned to that
column. An integer represents a width in pixels; an integer followed by the
character '%' represents the relative width (percentage) of this column with
respect to the table width.

I hope it helps.

Vincent.
