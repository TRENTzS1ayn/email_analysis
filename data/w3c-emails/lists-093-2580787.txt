I can finally edit our web space with less hassle; nothing like
reliable put!

o the text on the menus continue to vanish on me with
dismaying regularity; it causes me to have to restart amaya
as often as everything else put together.

o If I fetch a document with embedded objects from the jigedit server,
I get asked N times for the password, once for each object.  This is
very boring.

o would be nice if the forms stuff would work well enough to be
able to use the jigedit forms.

o would be nice if the jigedit forms generated correct html (at least
according to amaya, they have problems. (not your problem, but someone
else's).

o How do I get rid of the following that Amaya added the following unsolicited to head?  Netscape shows this junk in the screen, rather than ignoring it?
<style>
A:link { color : #0000FF }
A:visited { color : #7F007F }
</style>

o playing with table widths made it possible to deal with amaya and my
big table.  But at one point I got the following cryptic messages:

Thot tool kit error: 54
Thot tool kit error: 55
Thot tool kit error: 54
Thot tool kit error: 55

o keyboard accelarators, particularly for making links, would
be greatly appreciated.

o if text is selected when a target is created, that text should
be used as a target name, in my opinion; I'll have to edit these
by hand.

o if I edit a target name in the structure view, it loses the
insertion point.


o once, while playing with a target (trying to delete it by deleting
the green text), amaya went crazy; the form became wierd, and I had to
kill amaya completely.

o I would have thought that editing the Title in the dialog box up
top would edit the document title; it doesn't...  A quick perusal of
the menus didn't seem to show any other way except the structure editor.

o another core dump trace for you...
