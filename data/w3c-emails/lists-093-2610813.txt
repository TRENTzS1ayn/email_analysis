I found out something new: This only happens if amaya and the
apache-server run on the same computer (in my case a Pentium 90). It
seems as if amaya can't handle fast responses from the server while
decompressing jpg or gif images. I installed an apache on my laptop
with a 386SL which is connected via a PLIP-line, and now the identical
files are displayed and reloaded just fine.
