  Ok, I had the same problem at home ... A RedHat linux box with apache
installed by default ...
Could you tell me wether the same problem occurs with the amaya-java
version (I guess you're using the libWWW based one). At least at home,
using the java version (it uses Jigsaw Java classes for network accesses)
works fine now,

Daniel
