Are you sure that the problem doesn't come from your X server. I cannot
imagine that Amaya causes damage to other applications.

Jose would see that.

You can add keyboard accelerators by editing the file 
Thot/config/amaya.keyboard
or making a copy of this file in your HOME directory and modifying it.
The syntax of this file is explained in http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Amaya/User/Co
nfigure.html
For example if you want that "Ctrl l" creates a link you have to add the line:
Ctrl <Key>l: CreateLink()

Amaya generates a unique name. I'm not sure that the selected text can be 
choose as a unique name.
You can change immediately it by calling the entry "name" in menu "attribute".

Yes, it's a bug.

I tried it and it works.
Nevertheless, you can put the selection inside the anchor and use the command 
"Delete Anchor".
In this case the anchor is suppressed without deleting the text.

I cannot do anything with the core dump you sent. Amaya crashes in Xt library 
called
by the Motif library.
Could you give us a scenario to reproduce the crash.
