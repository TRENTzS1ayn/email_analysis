Why does this apply to the color, but not to the font-size?
Why is the anchor element rendered in large green letters?
This seems inconsistent to me.

This is a reasonable and vaild argument. (Well, I wanted the elements
to be invisible. This is why I choose empty tags, non-empty anchors
are so terribly greeen...)  But one could get philosophical about this
point...

Paragraphs allways insert vertical space. Non-empty Anchors never
insert anything but their content.  Should anchor tags be rendered
differently, depending on their content? :-)

But what is the additional vertical space introduced before a line in
a list containing an empty name tag and the additional linebreak, if
the empty name tag is the first element after a <li>-element, good for?
