There is no button or keystroke. Amaya is an authoring tool and we need many 
buttons
for editing functions. But we can add a command to do that and the user can 
attach a
keystroke to that command.

You just have to edit the registry $HOME/.thotrc
HOME_PAGE=
Many other things are configurable in Amaya. The Configure page describes them:
