I was on vacation all last week.  In meetings this week, so can respond
only sporadically.

The menu text vanising problem only occurs on amaya; it does not affect 
other applications.  Seems to happen often on alpha; you've probably got
a latent bug somewhere that only shows up there.

I still say that it would be nice if text were selected and a target
defined, that text would be used as the target name at that point.

When I figure out how to reliably generate core files, I'll let you know;
won't be using amaya again until next week at best.
