Hi.

I am using amaya-java-SUN4-1.0b.

It does not seem to be able to recognize an end tag if it contains white
space before the >, e.g., </STRONG >.  Should it?  (In other words, is it
legal HTML?)

Note that I am not a SGML expert.  An example of a situation where it
may be useful to include white space at that place is to break a long
line while still being sure that this white space is not included in
the text flow itself, on any browser, including those which would
include it if it were placed before the <.  E.g.,

foo
</STRONG>

vs

foo</STRONG
>
