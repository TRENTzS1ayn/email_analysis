Hi,

today I installed the "Java version" of amaya beta 1.0b on
a Sun. But whenever I want to start amaya, less than a second
after the window comes up it terminates again, writing on
stdout or stderr, that it got a java NullPointerException.

What did I do wrong? Are there any special installation instructions
to follow for the Java version? I used the binary distribution
found on the sunsite.cnlab-switch.ch mirror.

BTW I had no problem with the non-java version.
