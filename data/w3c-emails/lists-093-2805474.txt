This is amaya-LINUX-ELF-1.0b.tar.gz.

When a page with a table is saved, there are spurious <tbody> tags
inserted.  The following shows the transformation produced by Amaya.

    From: <table><tr><td>A</td></tr></table>
    To:   <table><tbody><tr><td>A</td></tr></tbody></table>

Another aspect is that Amaya and Weblint disagree as to what should be
done with the '>' character in a <pre> block.  This is the transformation
that Amaya performs:

    From: <pre>&lt;OO&gt;</pre>
    To:   <pre>&lt;OO></pre>

However, Weblint claims:

    you should use '&gt;' in place of '>', even in a PRE element.

Who is right?

PS: 1.0b still performs the following transformation (I reported this
against 1.0a, but my report was a bit confused by a discussion of what
was actually legal):

    From: <img src="cgi?bt=1&amp;lt=2">
    To:   <img src="cgi?bt=1&lt=2">
    To:   <img src="cgi?bt=1<=2">
