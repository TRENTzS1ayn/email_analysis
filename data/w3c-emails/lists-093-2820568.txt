Hello Lars,

If you're using the libwww version of Amaya, you need to recompile
the libwww using a -DSOCKS makefile option. You may find some more 
information in the ~/opera/w3c-library/Library/src/sysdep.h file and
in the library's home page [1].

I don't know if the java version of Amaya has SOCKS supports. Daniel
can give you some pointers on that, but he's not around right now.

-Jose
