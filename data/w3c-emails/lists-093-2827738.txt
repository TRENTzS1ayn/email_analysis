These "spurious" tags are defined in the Cougar DTD. They allow a table
to have several bodies (sets of rows). It's probably a mistake to
insert these tags when the header claims that version 3.2 of HTML is used.
We plan to release the next version of Amaya with more Cougar features,
but with a Cougar header. These tags will then be allowed.
