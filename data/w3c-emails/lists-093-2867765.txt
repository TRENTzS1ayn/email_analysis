At the begenning Amaya loades the dynamic libraries of plug-ins
(function TtaBrowsePluginDirectory, file: pluginbrowse.c) to
be ready to execute any known plug-in.

Ap_CreatePluginInstance is called by the function Ap_DrawPicture
(file pluginhandler.c). Indeed, plug-ins are treated as image
files in Amaya (Ap_DrawPicture is called by the function DrawPicture
file picture.c). In particular, the parsing of the mime type is also
done in the file picture.c by the function Match_Format which calls
the function Ap_MatchFormat (pluginghandlers.c). The result of this
parsins allows to create an instance of the right plug-in.
