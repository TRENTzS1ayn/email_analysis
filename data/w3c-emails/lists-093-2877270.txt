I wonder if I well understood your question and I hope
my answer will satisfy you.

Images are recognized with respect to IMG tag in html files.
The second step consists to determine the right type of a 
given image: gif, jpeg, ... This is done by the function
Match_Format.
In the plug-ins case, they are recognized the OBJECT element
in HTML files. Then, with respect to the mime type of the plug-in 
an instance is created and the data file (DATA element in the
html file) is passed to the plug-in as a stream. How does the
plug-in behave and how does it treat the stream is the business
of the plug-in. The task of Amaya stops after creating the
instance and passing the stream to it (except other communications
required by the plug-in).
