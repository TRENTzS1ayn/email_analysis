Thank you now that explains every thing that I need to know in order to
support plugins .

It appears that the plugin interface seems to work on FreeBSD 3.0
with very minor change to the pluging library . Specifically,
our dlsym interface requires us to prefix the symbol to be loaded
by "_". 

For example:
  ptr_NPP_Initialize = (int (*) ()) dlsym (pluginTable [indexHandler]->pluginH
andle, "_NPP_Initialize");


Browsing around the web , I found this HTML format for invoking plugins:
 <embed src="calculator.tcl" boarder=1 width=310 height=510>
I got it from :
http://www.sci.usq.edu.au/~jacek/calculator/
Which was pointed by suns' cool tcl applet of the week.


Amaya doesn't recognize the html tag: <embed> 
Not sure if this is a valid html tag or not.

Best Regards,
Amancio
