Hi Jean-Christophe,

It seems that the problem comes from your Linux installation.
The Attribute language is just used by the spell checker and the hyphenation 
algorithm,
but it has no effect on the keyboard management.

Did you see the Sami Lempinen's message concerning  key mapping
with XFree on Linux:
His message can be reached at "http://opera.inrialpes.fr/amaya/messages/0355.ht
ml"
I'm not sure you meet the same problem, but his message can help.
  Irene.
