Hi!

I've downloaded the file amaya-java-LINUX-ELF-1.0a.tar.gz and instaled
it! But i can't access any adress via http protocol, the status bar say:
contacting (some time) finished! and the browser is empty! If I try to
access a file on my computer all is OK!

After this I've downloaded amaya-1.0b.src.tar.gz and
thot-2.1b.src.tar.gz. After the compiling with and without java support,
the browser appears with the objects on the wrong positions, with the
wrong sizes (and I can't access any file via network).

Can somebody help me? and teach english to me? ;)

Best Regards
Claudemir
