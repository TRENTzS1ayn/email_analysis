Because there was no reaction at my first mail, i remail
it:
I succeded in installing, but got the
following problem: If typing a big "S", a small "s"
is inserted. Each of the other chars behaves oK, only the
"S" fails. Running a lot of other X apps, i never found
any problem with "S".
Existing documents containing "S" display properly in amaya.

Am i the only one to deal with this fault?
