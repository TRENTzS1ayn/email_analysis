There is a known bug in this java version. To solve your problem you have to:
a) use the latest version amaya-LINUX-ELF-1.0b.tar.gz

b) create temporary directories
   $HOME/.amaya/1,  $HOME/.amaya/2, ...,  $HOME/.amaya/6

c) I suggest you also suppress the cache functionality by editing the file 
$HOME/.thotrc
   NO_CACHE=YES

I'm surprised you have this kind of problem. I suggest you remove the file
Thot/amaya/HTML*.STR and restart the compiling process.
