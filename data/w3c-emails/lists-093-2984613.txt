I just installed Amaya and set up my server to authorise the PUT 
command for authoring. It works great except one thing but I see no 
real solution to that.

My server is configured to handle all .html files as .shtml for Server 
Side Includes. When I take a page to edit it and then I put it again 
through the PUT method, the server side is lost. At the same place, the 
text corresponding to the include directive is present.

I perfectly understand why this text is present but is there a way to 
change this ? I see nothing in the various documentation I read. I 
can't imagine that I am the only guy trying to do this. I absolutely 
want the include directive to be present and not the text.

Any hint or tip will be welcome

So, thanks in advance for your help.
