Thanks for your help. If I had fully understand the document, the TEXT 
tag is exactly what I want. I wish to add a common footer to all my 
pages but I don't want this text written on all pages. For the moment, 
the only way I found is the SSI mechanism.

The text tag is not implemented I think. If yes, I did not succeed in 
making it work. Is this tag working for someone or should I wait for 
this tag to become a standard ?

Is there another way to allow this kind of edition?

Amicalement,

Jean-Michel
