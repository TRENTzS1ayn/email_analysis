There is an embryonic answer to your problem within Amaya. You can use typed
links (<a href="xxx" rel=Chapter">) to note inclusions.
The function "Makebook" in the special menu allows you to replace the typed 
link
and the text around by the target content.
You can experiement this functionality with the Amaya manual.

But today, Amaya doesn't register the original context and if you save the 
document
after "Makebook" the document will be saved with the content instead of the 
typed
link. I think it would not too difficult to complete the "Makebook" function 
to do
what you want.
