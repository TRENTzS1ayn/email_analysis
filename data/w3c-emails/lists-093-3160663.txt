Could the next version of amaya please have a method of specifying
the startup geometry size of the amaya window.  Either as a command
line, X resource, or registry option .. I don't mind.

I have an SVGA laptop and the default size right now is too big
vertically to fit on one screen.  

Thanks,

John
