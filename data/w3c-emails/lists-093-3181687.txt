I loaded some of my hand coded html documents into the editor
and tried to improve them.  The editor picked up some overlapping tags
and some redundant tags which I noted in the xterm.  

I also found that every text input item specifying a size was flagged
with a message like the following:

 line 275, char 59: Unknown attribute "size"

I've studied the document over and over again and can't figure out
what amaya doesn't like about the size attribute.
