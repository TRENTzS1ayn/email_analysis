  As a testbed, one of Amaya's core features should be extensibility. It
makes sense to allow users to share in this extensibility.  The best
way to do this is have a large amount of the browser's features
programmed to be extensible, and indeed add additional ones, by
users.
  A good example of this is the emacs project. It would be nice
to see Amaya take a similar approach (especially with the dynamic
abilities of an interpreted language). It is improtant that this
language, besides being interpreted, would be a full programming
language itself, not merely a toolkit.
