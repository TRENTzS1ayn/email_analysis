  Since you're in a member organisation, you have access to
the 0.95 source release. I suggest you get it (or better wait
for Monday, and the 0.95a release). A binary release of 0.95a
should be done in a near future.

  Amaya uses libwww-5.0a for Web accesses. Libwww now support HTTP/1.1
but has not been released outside. We are waiting for the libwww release.

  Ok this is an error !

  This is related to a bug present in the distribution of 0.9a 
binary release, and previously reported. This is also related with
the incorect encoding of non ASCII ISO-Latin 1 sequences ...
We still failed to understand why this was broken in this specific
release ...

  Ok, Jose Kahan told me that 200 and 204 error code were handled,
Jose promised that support should be done in next release (maybe
not Monday) .

  Ok, fine,
but 0.9a is seriously broken at least on Linux-Elf,
so try to upgrade ...
