Hello Gordon,

Thanks for sharing your experiences on using Amaya with Apache.
Let me try to answer some of your questions.

Amaya uses libwww5.0a since many months ago. Moreover, this version of
libwww was released to the public some months ago and implements
HTTP/1.1. We tested keep-Alive connections against Jigsaw, an HTTP/1.1
server and did not detect any problems then. However, gremlins like
to creep here and there and thus there may be some hidden bugs somewhere.

From your description of the problem, I suppose that you were using
Apache 1.2b. Unfortuntately, I haven't been able to test it against
this server. Could you give me some URLs so that I could do some
remote testing?

I'm curious as to how you could get a SIGPIPE? Amaya has an explicit
call to trap them. It could be a problem coming from autoconf as the
signal trap is enclosed among #defines. I'll get back to you about
this later on.

Amaya 0.95 already recognizes this status code as well as the 200 and 204
ones.

Let's try to make it work without any problems :-)


Hope this helps somehow,

-Jose
