  Hi Arnaud,

 seems that you went throught a number of configuration problems,
I guess that most answers were in the same document but at the end
in the troubleshooting section :

>      cd to Amaya/Target directory. 
>
>However, there is no Amaya directory in the hierarchy. I assume it's

>Thot/Target and go into Thot/solaris2.

  right , an error in the doc, the base name changed ...

>/nfs/u/lehors/Thot/thotlib/include/thot_gui.h:152: X11/keysym.h: No such
>file or directory
>/nfs/u/lehors/Thot/thotlib/include/thot_gui.h:153: X11/IntrinsicP.h: No
>such file or directory
>/nfs/u/lehors/Thot/thotlib/include/thot_gui.h:154: X11/CoreP.h: No such

  Ok, just a problem of includes (and library path in the Makefile)
This potentialp problem is handled in "If make failed" section,
bullet 2 point 2.

>cd /nfs/u/lehors/Thot/amaya; /nfs/u/lehors/Thot/solaris2/bin/str HTML
>sh: cpp: not found

  Section Prerequisite : 
 "Having usual Unix development tools, at least sed, awk and cpp should be 
available."

  Section "If make failed",  bullet 3, point 2 give a replacement for
cpp using a script shell based on gcc 

>$ bin/amaya
>ld.so.1: bin/amaya: fatal: libXm.so.3: can't open file: errno=2
>Killed

  I love this one, that's the beauty of shared libs ...

  Section "If amaya binary doesn't work", point 1.

>(BTW ldd is not available on all systems, on HP it's chatr, etc...)

  Ok, didn't know for HP systems, on Linux it's ldd too ... I guess
the worse is for AIX, we were not abble to found the ldd equivalent .

  I don't think it's very complicated, is it a priority ? 

Thank you for your comments, I will modify the Makefile.orig of solaris2
Target to point to the openwin and dt directories for includes and
libraries. It's more standard than the paths we are using for development. 

>Hope this helps,

  yes definitely,

Daniel
