Amaya support proxies, since the libWWW handle them. Please check
the following URL :

  http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Amaya/User/Proxy.html

You can also wait a little to get the sources, then recompile the libWWW
to use SOCKS (one need to pass a few -Dlisten=... on the CFLAGS to use
socks instead of the direct libc API) . Then you just have to rebuild
the amaya binary with this new librarye to have a Socksified Amaya.
Check Altavista for the Socks package, it's widely available.

 If you do it, please store the binary in a shared place for the
others in the same case.
