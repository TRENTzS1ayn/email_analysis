Hi,

i have got problems with german umlauts and amaya 0.9a. When i
put in an html-document &uuml; amaya displays correctly the
german umlaut ? . After saving this document amaya doesn't write
back &uuml; to the document. It write instaed ?. This problem
occures with all german umlauts. The problem appears also with the
greater-than sign. The less-than sign will be convertet correctly.

Is this a bug in the acutal version or is there something other
wrong ?

Uli.
