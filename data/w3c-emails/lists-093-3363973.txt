Greetings,

When passing Amaya-generated code through SGML parsers or online HTML
validators, I generally encounter two problems:

1) The SPAN element is unrecognised.

Apparently the SPAN element is a feature of the CSS1 implementation.
Do you know of a DTD which would support the SPAN element?

2) Amaya fails to quote certain attributes.

For example, when specifying a TD width relative to the width of the page,
say, 30%, parsers start coughing as the per cent sign should be enclosed in
quotes. Or is the relative markup allowed at all -- i.e. is it a Netscapism?

Apart from these two observations, the documents seem to validate fine. And
I cannot emphasise enough the otherwise excellent quality of the program.
I use it for 99% of my HTML authoring needs these days. Only forms require
be to fire up the old vi.

Thanks,

Sami
