Has anyone else found that the porting instructions for Amaya don't seem
to match up very well with reality? The main problem seems to be that
there is no Thot/makes/Makefile.template as referred to in the porting
document...

I've also tried generating a makefile from the Imakefile, which itself
required some hacking to the Imake.tmpl file, but I'm not sure I hacked
it enough as I'm still having some problems with the generated file.

Has anyone else ported to a new platform yet and worked out a good way
of going about it? All advice gratefully received...

Tom
