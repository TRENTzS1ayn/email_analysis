  Well, one need Motif and some disk space. Otherwise, fetch from your
nearest Sunsite mirror archive site, in the Incoming directory :
   amaya-src-0.95.tar.gz
   amaya-libs-LINUX-ELF-0.95.tar.gz
   thot-src-2.0b-retry.tar.gz
   thot-libs-LINUX-ELF-2.0b.tar.gz
explode the two thot archives. This create a Thot subdir. Cd to the Thot
subdir, explode the two amaya archives. Cd to LINUX-ELF, copy Makefile.orig
to Makefile, change the THOTDIR to reflect the path where you extracted
the Amaya archives, launch "make amaya" and go drink a coffe (large one).
When back bin/amaya conatins your own amaya binary, of course bad things
may happen in-between but there is a documentation on-line :-)

  Well Amaya has been tested on 1, 4, 8, 15, 16 and 24 bits per pixel in the
past. We commonly use and test 1, 8, 16 and 24 depth displays. But
we don't have any true 32 bit server here. I tried startx -- -bpp 32 but
it is recognized as a 24 bit depth (XFree S3 Server for Diamond Card)
