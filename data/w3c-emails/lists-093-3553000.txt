  On sun keyboard, one uses the Copy and Past function key.
Otherwise (Linux for example) the key F6 is mapped to
the function exporting the current selection to the X11
cut buffer. The F8 key is to paste the cut buffer.
Check the Thot/config/amaya.keyboard . You can have
your own copy in $HOME/amaya.keyboard and customize it.
see http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Amaya/User/Configure.html 
under the section Keyboard Shortcut to get the syntax of the
file.
