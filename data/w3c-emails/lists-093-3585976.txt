The libwww5.0 cache doesn't work well.

Normally it works. Sometimes the trouble comes when the map is included in a 
<P>
and Amaya cannot overlaps the image with the map.

Amaya has the basic set to develop a history list, but we are working on new 
developments
and nobody here can spend time to work on this feature.

It uses only the basic set of history list.

I'm not sure we can write a tutorial.
