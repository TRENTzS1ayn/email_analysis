I've just discovered that if a <SPAN> crosses several lines in the HTML
source then all except the first line are pushed down to the end of the
displayed page (in reverse order, with the first multi-line span last,
preceeded by the second multi-line span etc).

As a specific example, a piece of HTML like this:

<SPAN CLASS="comment">/*
 * This is a test of
 * the multi-line comment
 * detection
 */</SPAN>

is rendered with the leading /* in the right place, and all the other
lines at the end of the document.
