It seems that IMGs now obey their size attributes, and TD obey theirs, 

but TDs do not obey the size attributes of an enclosed IMG.

In general, the size calculations by TDs on their contents are very poor.  This
is not just a problem with Amaya, but it seems to be worse than many other 
browsers.  I will download source, and take a look ta this area if my C skills
are up to it.
