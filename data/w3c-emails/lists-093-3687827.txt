In Amaya, you may change the way some elements are presented by different
means:

1 - Use CSS.
   You can specify rules in a separate style sheet or in the HEAD of
   some documents.
   Amaya allows you to specify your own style sheet in a file called
   .amaya.css in your home directory. All documents displayed by Amaya
   for you will then have the style specified in that file.
   *WARNING* In the current version of Amaya, the CSS implementation is
   not complete and some properties are ignored.

2 - Use the P language.
   The default style for HTML document is defined by the file HTMLP.P
   in directory amaya. You can edit that file and recompile it.
   You will find some information at:
   http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Amaya/User/AmayaArchi.html#L469
   (see section 2.3)

Hope it helps,

Vincent.
