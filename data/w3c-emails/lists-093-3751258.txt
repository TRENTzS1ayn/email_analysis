Hi!

(first) Thank you for being around to even be asking this (now that
that's out of the way...)

Would you please consider Open32 and WinCE in your port to Windows so
that it will be much more multi-platform. OS/2 is very, very similar to
Windows (i've done a little of each) except that it actually works (i
hate Win95, it keeps dying on me) and WinCE seems interesting. Anyhow,
someone needs to provide an alternative to Internet Explorer on those
little guys.

So, if you would, look into Open32. IBM looked into Windows source code
and found out which were about the 800 most abundant API calls and
integrated them into OS/2 cold turkey. Just recompile, and boom! OS/2
32-bit is done. I think that they overlap with WinCE nicely (assumption:
Microsoft also looked for the thousand or so most common calls)

Thanx much for your time here...

Aaron Stone
