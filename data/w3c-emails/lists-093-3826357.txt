  could you try to replace your binary with the patched one :

ftp://opera.inrialpes.fr/pub/patch/amaya-LINUX-ELF-0.95b-depth32.gz

Fetch it, gunzip it, rename it to Thot/bin/amaya, and chmod +x it ...
I hope this correct the problem for those with 32 bits and 15 bits 
displays ...

 It had been tested on 1, 8, 16 and 24 bit displays. We expect the patched
version to add 15 and 32 bits support.

 Right, but which window ? You can setup the size of each HTML document
view in Thot/amaya/HTML.conf
