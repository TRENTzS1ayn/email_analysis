I have now verified that Amaya does not experience the exposure problem with
an amaya.css file containing

BODY { magnification : 0 }

but the problem occurs with

BODY { magnification : 1 }

or larger numbers.

Once again, this is a condition where Amaya claims that it is finished but
the page contents does not display.

Anyone else seeing this problem?

Thanks,

Bob
