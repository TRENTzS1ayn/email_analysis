Hi Dan,

Effectively, we need to introduce new elements and new attributes specifically 
for editing.
Just some examples:
- element "Invalid_element" to support any invalid element found in HTML 
documents.
- attribute "Invalid_attribute" to support any invalid attribute found in HTML 
documents.
- element "Radio_Input", "Checkbox_Input", "Text_Input", etc. to distinguish 
typed input elements
  which have different behaviors.
- attribute "DefaultChecked" to distinguish the checked value given by the 
document author and the
  current user.

I'm not sure that it's a good idea to extend the HTML dtd with all these 
elements and attributes.
  Irene.
