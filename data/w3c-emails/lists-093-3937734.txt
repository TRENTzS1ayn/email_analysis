  I don't think it's related. The Thot editor and Amaya binary
tarball are self-contained. The touble is more possibly related
to a non standard tree setup.

All the binaries expect to be in a directory, let's say
/usr/local/Thot/LINUX-ELF/bin/{thot amaya ...}
Upon startup, the binaries will try to find it's installation
path (in this case /usr/local/Thot/LINUX-ELF/bin) in order

  1/to set up the internal variable THOTDIR
  2/fetch the thot.ini global configuration file shared by
    all apps built on top of the Thot library. 

Once the application has found it's binary path it looks
in the parents directory for a directory containing a
subdirectory "config" with a thot.ini file. 

In our example with the standard installation it will look
for
/usr/local/Thot/LINUX-ELF/bin/config/thot.ini => fail
/usr/local/Thot/LINUX-ELF/config/thot.indi => fail
/usr/local/Thot/config/thot.ini => found

  If found, the parent of config is the THOTDIR of the app.
Hence
THOTDIR=/usr/local/Thot

and the application should startup. In your case, it
seems that the binary is unable to find the thot.ini file.
Could you double check your installation wrt. the previous
explanations.

   hope this help,

Daniel
