Greetings,

Working with the latest release, I have noticed that if you have an image which
is not contained by a <P> and you try to create a link from the image by
selecting the image and clicking Create Link, the image is deleted and
consequently, Amaya's idea of the document goes all funny, usually resulting in
a crash. With images contained within a <P>, linking works OK.

The above behaviour manifests itself at least when the image is in a table cell.

Another thing...wouldn't it make sense to change the DOCTYPE statement that
Amaya produces into Cougar, as this is closer to what Amaya actually produces?
At the moment though, Amaya output fails to pass a validation using Cougar as
well (in Cougar, TD has no width attribute, for example, and STYLE requires a
TYPE attribute).

Keep up the good work,

Sami
