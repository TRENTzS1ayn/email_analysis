I don't think this is a good idea that language S must contain some extra info
for editing needs. Why don't you put this small part on an external file?
For example :
  elements " Invalid_element" or Attribute "Invalid_attribute" could be use for
  any DTD SGML not only HTML?? And then must be hide for the Language S writer.

In fact, i'm currently working on a small tools based on SP Parser that can 
transform a DTD to a language S definition. It works but it's not finished yet.
I think that given a HTML DTD it can generate a Language S HTML that is 
not so far away from the current Language S HTML used in Amaya.

For my university work, i have to developped a prototype for a SGML Browser/Edit
but with advanced features to handle hyperlink and inclusions document..etc..
I have listed all the files in Amaya directory and checked files that i must 
keep and other files that i must remove because they are hightly linked to HTML
( editions,transformation, form...). I think the most difficult work is on
html2thot.c module because it's statically linked to HTML. 

I would like to create a new Directory, says amaya2 in Thot Dir to build a small
new browser... Could you give me some advices to integrate my program into the
building process of amaya,thot?

Thanks in advance.
Best regards,
Mutel Alexandre.
