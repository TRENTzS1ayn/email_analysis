It's absolutely necessary to clearly identify what elements and attributes are 
part of the
document DTD.
Then, editors or parsers can help user by supporting invalid elements and 
attributes,
thus user can see his mistakes and learn about the DTD.

In Amaya, elements and attributes like " Invalid_element" or 
"Invalid_attribute" could
be seen as an extension DTD: a piece of DTD which is added to the current SGML 
DTD.

It's our HTML parser.

You have to change things into the generic file Thot/makes/Imakefile
Each application uses a personal directory and all variables attached to one 
application
are prefixed by the name of this application (AMAYA for Amaya).

Hope this help
