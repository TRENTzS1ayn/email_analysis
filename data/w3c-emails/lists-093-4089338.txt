Hi everyone!
  I've noticed 2 things that I'd like to mention:

  1. Did I miss something or is there no bookmarking ability?  I'd drop
netscrape in a heartbeat if there was...

  2. I'm not so sure that amaya is honoring some of the align options in
<img src> tags.  I've got a page that w/ ns 2, 3, & 4 shows multiple lines
of text w/ tags and anchors on the left and an image on the right directly
opposite of each other.  With amaya the best I can get is 1 line of text
on the left of the image and the rest below it...

I apologise if I ahve repeated anything, I didn't see similar posts in the
archives...

Best
  Pat
