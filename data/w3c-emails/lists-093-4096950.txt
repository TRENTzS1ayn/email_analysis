Amaya is an editor and allows more than one document displayed at the same 
time.
I created my HotList document (~/HotList.html) which is my Amaya HOME_PAGE (see
your file ~/.thotrc). When I want to add a bookmark into my HotList, I add some
text and link this text to the remote document (2 clicks to do that).
I agree we should integrate a function which does that automatically (creates 
the
HotList file if needed and adds bookmarks into this file).
If I have enough time I would add this function.

Right. Amaya formatting is limited. I have the solution to fix this problem,
but I'm not sure the implementation will be done in the next July member 
release.

Thanks for your remarks
