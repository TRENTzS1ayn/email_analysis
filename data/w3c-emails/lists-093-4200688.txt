  I was having this problem when using lesstif versions prior to 0.80
Ugrading to the latest version volved it for me

  This is this precise problem that the lesstif patch to amaya source is
supposed to cure ?!?

  I didn't experience it on my own attempt to build Amaya and Thot on PPC.

scratch after upgrading lesstif and applying the patch, this is probably
needed and the only reason I can guess why we are having different
behaviours ...
