Nice!  Way nice!

Congratulations, team.

I just installed it on both NT 4.0 and Win95 4.00.95B.

First thing I notice: The Views menu comes up with checks on all the
views.  Selecting, say, the Structure view doesn't change the checkmark.

Second thing: on Win95 I quickly got "AMAYA caused an invalid page fault"
(in kernl32.dll).  What is the best way for me to help debug such things?
