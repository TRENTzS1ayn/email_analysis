Hi Ralph,

>First thing I notice: The Views menu comes up with checks on all the

I will correct this problem in the next release.

Second thing: on Win95 I quickly got "AMAYA caused an invalid page
fault"
(in kernl32.dll).  What is the best way for me to help debug such
things?

This alpha release of Amaya has not been tested on Windows 95.
This will be done as soon as possible.
