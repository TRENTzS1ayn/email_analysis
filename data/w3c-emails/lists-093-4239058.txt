Yes, I saw that in the release notes; I will keep that in mind.  If there
is any useful information that I can provide as I "live dangerously", feel
free to let me know.  Otherwise I won't bother you with my Win95 experiences
if you would prefer to wait.

Thanks again; I'm looking forward to learning Amaya!
