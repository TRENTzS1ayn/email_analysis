Greetings, 
I am not certain if this is even the correct mailing address to "address"
my questions, and concerns; however, if not, please direct me to the proper
location.

I have been reading, from this site, on Amaya, and am most interested in
trying it out. 
My questions are:
Currently I have MSIE 3.02 on my system, and may be putting msie 4.0, after
the release. Can I install amaya as well? 
Is there a way I could install it presently, to try it out? 

Sincerely,


Thomas A. Farber
