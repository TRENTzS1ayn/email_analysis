Put is fundamentally unreliable using HTTP/1.0 due to a race condition
between the close of the connection and the reply message.  This depends
on exact timing in the network and of the application.

HTTP/1.1 fixes this.  What version of what server are you using to
use PUT?  Note that current versions of both Jigsaw and Apache speak HTTP/1.1.
