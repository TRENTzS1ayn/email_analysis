If I could ever get our Israel office to check if they're members, I'd try it out here for you (I have NT & 95 on my home system, and we have various NT & 95 systems here).  Would be interesting to look at our "online community" site under Amaya (http://www.vcot.com).


I finished this version of Amaya the day before the member release.
There is lack of testing without any doubt. especially for Windows 95.

However, I think that Ralph R. Swick has got it work on Winndows NT.
