I have downloaded the 1.1 beta for AIX and followed the installation
instructions, installing the binaries under my home directory.  On executing
the ./Thot/RS6000/bin/amaya file I get the following messages indicating an
X11 library problem.  I did not get this error with the 1.0 beta on the same
machine. 

I have played around with the LIBPATH environment variable, without success.

I am running AIX 4.2 with Motif 1.2 and X11r5.

Any pointers would be appreciated.


An unrelated point, the link to the Thot source code
(ftp://opera.inrialpes.fr/private/sources/thot/)  on the page:
http://www.w3.org/member/WWW/Amaya/User/SourceDist.html points to nowhere (or
at least results in a "file not found" error).
