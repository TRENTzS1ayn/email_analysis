You are right, Henrik. It should be correct.
There was a bug in Amaya : when a table cell contains only a character string
within an anchor or within an element like B, STRONG, I, EM, etc., this
character string was not formatted as a paragraph, but as a single, infinite
line.

The bug is fixed now, and the fix will be available in the next release.
