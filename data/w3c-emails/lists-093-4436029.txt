I was wondering, though, if Amaya definitely fails.  If multiple browsers fail, we can pressure Spry to do something about it sooner, rather than giving their arrogant "oh, we don't support betas" reply.

James,

The sprynet site uses a server which does not tolerate the HTTP/1.1
protocol version:

telnet ourworld.compuserve.com 80
Trying 149.174.213.34...
Connected to ourworld.compuserve.com.
Escape character is '^]'.
GET / HTTP/1.1                      <--- as soon as I typed return, the
                                         the server answered
HTTP/1.0 400 Bad Request
Server: Spry-SafetyWEB-Server-NT/1.2
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Encoding: 8bit

What usually happens when contacting an HTTP/1.0 server is that the
client sends a message, and then waits for a specific HTTP/1.1 response
header (100 Continue, I think). If there's a timeout, the client knows
it's talking to an HTTP/1.0 server. 

The Sprynet server does not give the client a chance.

Hope this helps.

-Jose

It appears that those servers don't know what to do with HTTP 1.1 requests, and all that comes back is an error that the server didn't know what to do with the request.
