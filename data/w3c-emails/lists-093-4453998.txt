Sure, Amaya is beta too, but it emphasizes that Spry needs to fix their server software, because likely *all* new browsers will have problems with their servers, which means their customers may start leaving for other providers, etc.  Not good for long term income prospects <g>.

James,

I don't know about pressure, but Amaya does fail too. The server
does not give an HTTP/1.1 browser an opportunity to fall back to
HTTP/1.0 without closing the connection.

All in all, Amaya is also in beta status!
