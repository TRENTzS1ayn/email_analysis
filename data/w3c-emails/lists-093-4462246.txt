I am trying to use Amaya on Windows 95, and it seems to have difficulty
accessing web pages. How do I tell Amaya that I am behind a proxy?


Message in Title: ERROR: Cannot access a URL
Thanks

Note also that the edit button does not contain Select all.
Selecting everything by hand and "copying" did not work either so that I
cannot show you what is in the window as a result.

PS: sorry if this obvious, I am just starting. G.
