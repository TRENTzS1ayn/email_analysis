Someone reported on a similar bug. The solution is available at:

   http://opera.inrialpes.fr/amaya/messages/0438.html

If it does not work, please tell us.

Yes, but there is another way to quickly select the whole document:
the Esc key, which allows you to travel the document tree towards the
root.  As most HTML documents are pretty flat, a few keystrokes on the
Esc key allow you to select the whole document.

Some key bindings are still missing in this alpha version, including
Copy, Cut and Paste.  The Edit menu allows you to copy from an Amaya
document to another Amaya document, not to the Windows cut buffer.

A more complete release will be done by end of August. These problems
should be fixed by then.

Vincent.
