I am using amaya-java on LINUX-ELF.

After "mkdir 1 2 3 4 5 6" amaya started loading http:// pages, but still,
all the pictures seem to be rendered incorrectly. Could it be because I am
using truecolor visual? Also it would be nice if I didn't have to
double-click to follow a link. A single click is quite enough.
