A single click would prevent from editing the text or the images that
support the link.



My question:

I have two problems with displaying TABLEs. 
First, even when doing:

<DIV ALIGN=CENTER> *and*
<TABLE ALIGN=CENTER>

TABLEs stay at the left of the page.

Does this belong to the same "TABLE bug" already explained before?


Thank you in advance.
