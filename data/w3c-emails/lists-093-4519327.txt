Given the following HTML code,

<H1 align=center>
abcdef
<HR>
ghijkl
</H1>

with all browsers I've tried, except Amaya, the part of the H1 block before 
the <HR> tag is displayed just above the horizontal ruler, and the part of 
the H1 block after the <HR> tag is displayed just below the ruler. With 
Amaya, the first letter of the part of the H1 block after the <HR> tag is 
displayed in the right margin (one line below the ruler) and the rest 
of the block is displayed on the next line, correctly centered.

I am using Thot 1.0b for Solaris 2, May 21, 1997 precompiled binary release.

Is this a known bug? ... Or is it a feature?

Bertrand Ibrahim.
