It's not really a bug.
The HTML 3.2 specification does not allow a HR to be within a H1. The piece
of HTML code you give is not correct.  Some browsers display it one way, some
other another way.

Amaya sticks to the W3C recommendations and tries to encourage the
correct use of these recommendations.  It makes some effort to recover
from some HTML errors but not too much, so that you can detect and fix
errors in your documents.

Thanks for your comments,

Vincent.
