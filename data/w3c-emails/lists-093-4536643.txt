You're right. It escaped me that H1 elements could only have inline 
elements embedded in them, and that HR was a block level element. 
The surprising thing is that AOLpress, that I had originally used to 
edit the page containing that example, hadn't diagnosed the syntax error.

Thanks,

Bertrand Ibrahim.
