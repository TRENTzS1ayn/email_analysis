Hi,


Was wondering if you are in network marketing or some type of
home-based business too?

If you are in network marketing, do you have enough leads for
your MLM? If not, say the words (words=GREAT LEADS in the
subject line of your return email) and I'll zip off a 
helpful email file that could mean the difference between
success and failure in network marketing.

Warmest regards,

Bill Brandenburg
