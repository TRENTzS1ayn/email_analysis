Well, it says it all. This binary version is full-X11R6 only. It is
not mentioned on the web server nor in the readme files.... I remind
you that solaris 2.5 is X11R5 in std release.

I also have big problems (not linked to X) with the source
distribution :

- configure always tries to compile amaya...
- one syntax error in amaya/Makefile (missing backslash at end of line)
- compilation of T language schemas (bug in HTMLT or HTMLTT)
