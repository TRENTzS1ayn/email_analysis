Folks,

Up to now, we had two Amaya mailing lists: www-amaya@w3.org and
www-amaya-developers@w3.org. Both of these files had on-line archives
of their messages.

As of today, 3/Sept/97, some new changes come to these lists:

* Both lists have been moved to the w3c main site, at Boston. The
          lists are now running under Smartlist (we were previously using
          majordomo).

* The Web archives for those lists has also migrated to w3c.
          The new URLs to access it are:

    * http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-amaya-developers/
            * http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-amaya/


* Because of lack of traffic on www-amaya-developers@w3.org, we
          decided to merge this list with the main Amaya one. After sending
          this message, we'll merge both distribution lists and use the
          resulting list with www-amaya@w3.org.


Anyone wanting to unsubscribe off the list, send a mail to:

www-amaya-request@w3.org

with subject "unsubscribe" (without the quotes).

Messages should be addressed as usual to:

www-amaya@w3.org


Best regards,


-JK
