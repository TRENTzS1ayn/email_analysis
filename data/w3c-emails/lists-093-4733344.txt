I use an upgraded RedHat 4.0 linux distribution,  X11 3.2, Metro-X
server, Pentium system, 64Mb

Your binary distribution of amaya 1.1a Seg faults when I attempt to open
a document for editing.
Limited information available from the core file follows:

Core was generated by `amaya'.
Program terminated with signal 11, Segmentation fault.
