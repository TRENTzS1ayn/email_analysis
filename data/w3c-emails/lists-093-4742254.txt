Under Windows 95, Amaya 1.1a runs very slowly with frequent pauses for several
seconds during which it will not update the screen or respond to the mouse.
It also does not load pages from the Web (no error message occurs, it just
silently fails) although it does load files from the local hard drive.

Under Linux 2.0.30 (RedHat 4.2), on trying to access a page from the Web, Amaya
1.1a either segfaults or exits with the message "Thot tool kit error: invalid
parameter" repeated twice.  The previous version (1.0b) worked fine.
