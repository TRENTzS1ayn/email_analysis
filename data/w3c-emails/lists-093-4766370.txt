Amaya is developped with MSVC++ (4.x). The source code of windows
is located in thot-src-2.1d.tar.gz and amaya-src-1.1a.tar.gz.

We did not yet release "makefiles" (MSVC projects).

to get amaya binaries for windows, you have just to
unzip amaya-WindowsNT-1.1a.ZIP and execute amaya
located in thedirectory Thot\winnt\bin or Thot\win95\bin
