    Hi!  I just downloaded the precompiled binaries on Sept 16th, and
installed Amaya 1.1b.  I'm really impressed with the math capabilities,
and also with the structure view.  However, I did notice a few bugs.  I
suspect the linux-binaries don't work on any linux system... fi anybody
has a linux system on which amaya (precompiled binary version) works,
can they please mention it?

    I'm running Red Hat v4.2 on a PPro 150 with kernel 2.0.30.  I have
32 Mb RAM, and I'm running XFree86 3.3.1 as an X-server with fvwm95-2 as
my window manager.  I installed amay in /usr/local/, moved my old
.thotrc (I had 1.0b previously) to .thotrc.old, added the correct
directory to my path, and ran amaya.

    The new amaya starts up fine.  I can do some editing in it, I can
save things, I can make math-expressions.  However, if I try to load an
document, amaya crashes with a segmentation fault.  It doesn't matter if
it is loading over the web or not.  For example, if I try to load
COPYRIGHT.html. it says 100% on the bottom of the screen, does a lot of
disk reading, and then crashes without displaying anything.

    I ran ldd on amaya, andI got this bindings  (I added the exact
version numbers by hand):
 libXt.so.6 => /usr/X11/lib/libXt.so.6    (6.0)
 libSM.so.6 => /usr/X11/lib/libSM.so.6    (6.0)
 libICE.so.6 => /usr/X11/lib/libICE.so.6  (6.3)
 libXext.so.6 => /usr/X11/lib/libXext.so.6 (6.3)
 libX11.so.6 => /usr/X11/lib/libX11.so.6  (6.1)
 libdl.so.1 => /lib/libdl.so.1   (1.7.14)
 libm.so.5 => /lib/libm.so.5   (5.0.6)
 libc.so.5 => /lib/libc.so.5   (5.3.12)

Perhaps these are incompatible with the libraries that you used to make
the binaries?  I don't know.

    Also, at first, typing a T produced a an apostrophe: '.  So, my
'itle looked some'hing like 'his.  I did:
THOTDIR= ; export THOTDIR
and that fixed the problem with T.  However, it didn't fix any other
problems.  Perhaps I will go back to .thotrc.old and try some more
variables.

    Lastly, the view don't work properly.  I think the only one that did
anything was the map_structure view, which produced one window for
"new_structure" and one window for "new_math" (I had a math expression
in the page that I was typing).  THE VIEWS WOULD NOT CLOSE by them
selves.  File->Close View did not work.  However, I could kill each view
window without amaya dying.

    Might these all be some kind of lesstif problem?  I don't know.

Hope this detailed info helps.
