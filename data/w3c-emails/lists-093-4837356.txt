Hi,

I just downloaded Amaya to my Windows 95-machine
but I'm unable to get it working. When I dubble-
click, nothing happens!

I read de readme-files, but they're only talking
about UNIX-stuff.

And in one of the files I saw this strange line:
"The first version of this testbed should be
available by the end of 1996...".

Strange program...

Bye,
Edwin Martin.
