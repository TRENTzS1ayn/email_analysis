Hi Roy,

It semms that you were using old compilers.
I suggest you:
a) to create or clean your directory Thot/SGI
b) go into this directory and configure:
../configure --disable-java
c) check the generated Options file:
check that your CFALG is "CFLAGS  = -Wall  -fsigned-char"
d) start "make all"

Hope that helps
  Irene.
