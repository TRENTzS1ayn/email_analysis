Well, I'm looking at Amaya.  The only thing I've found so far is this:

Thot tool kit error: attribute element mismatch
*** Errors in http://www.lesstif.org/:
line 23, char 96: Missing semicolon
Thot tool kit error: attribute element mismatch

This happened when it was trying to parse http://www.lesstif.org/ after
going there from http://www.dnaco.net/~kragen/x-pretty.html, but I can't
reproduce it.  I also got it when going from Help|Browsing to Links.html
via the "create links" hotlink once, but I can't reproduce it there,
either.

... and there are numerous miscellaneous quibbles about usability which
probably aren't important, unless you intend people to use the browser.
My impression is that it's intended for experimenting with the latest,
greatest experimental web stuff, not to be used by a significant number of
people.

I haven't tried the editor functionality.
