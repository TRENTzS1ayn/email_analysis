The new release seems to have solved most problems.  It is a VAST
improvement over 1.0b!  I don't think I will even attempt installing
netscape :)  Yes there are a few bugs (doesn't always go back to the right
page, table layout is ALMOST perfect) but most of them should go away as
lesstif improves (doesn't scroll horizontally).  And the "maths" support
is awesome :)

Thanks,
