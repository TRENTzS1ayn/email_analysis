> *** Errors in http://www.lesstif.org/:

This message tells you that the HTML file you have loaded contains an error.
Line 23 in this file is:

LessTif is the <a href="http://www.hungry.com">Hungry Programmers</a>' version 
of OSF/Motif&reg.

entity &reg should be terminated by a semicolon. The semicolon may
be omitted only if the entity is followed by a space or record end.
Here, it is followed by a period.
Don't worry, Amaya recovers from such errors, but if you are interested
in producing syntactically correct HTML documents, you can fix the error.

I can't reproduce it either...

If you have time to report on these quibbles, the Amaya team would be
glad to consider how to improve usability.

Yes, our goal is to experiment and demonstrate new web stuff.  But to allow
people to make experiments and to run demos, usability is important too.

I would encourage you to try. We have put the emphasis on that functionality
and we are solliciting comments and feedback on it.
