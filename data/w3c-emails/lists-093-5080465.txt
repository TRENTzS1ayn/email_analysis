I downloaded amaya-windows-1_1a.zip from the http-us site and pkunzipped
if with a -d argument. There was only one binary in the winnt
subdirectory, nothing was written in the windows95 subdirectory. Next
step was to try to run the binary in the winnt subdirectory on this
windows95 system. amaya.exe complained the wwwstream.dll was missing
(long file name problem, as it was unzipped as wwwstrea.dll), I set the
long file name to wwwstream.dll and it did not complain but it merely
loaded, spun the disk for a while and exited. I then tried renaming one
of the other dll's (wwwcore.dll) to an unusable name to see if it was
really trying to load and it complained that wwwcore.dll was missing but
nothing wrong with wwwstream.dll now. (so I set wwwcore.dll back to the
appropriate filename).

Next step is to try to study the source to see how it fits together and
recompile under VC41 on windows95, problem now is I try to unzip
thot-src-2_1d_tar.gz with a copy of gunzip obtained from the nsf.gov
server but I was unable to get anything meaningful out of the gunzip
results. (I'm a windows programmer, not a unix person so I have never
used this tool before, perhaps you can suggest a good place to download
it from). 

A suggestion would be greatly appreciated, I am not trying to bore you
with complaints, I genuinely wish to learn how amaya works and to help
contribute to the windows 95 work.
