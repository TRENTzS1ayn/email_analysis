Some bugs:

1. If the program tries to connect (using dial up networking) and you
cancel, then the whole program is locked and the process has to be killed.

2. The program always starts with the same window size and position. a) it
should be able to store previous settings. b) it should not sit under the
'taskbar' at the bottom of the screen.

3. The open files dialogue has '.html' and '.htm' files as separate
filters. They should be in the same filter. It would also be useful to have
some kind of history/recent list.

4. Whenever amaya.exe is run it creates an 'amaya' sub-directory under the
'temp' directory, with 9 further sub-directories which are usually empty.
a) the program should delete temporary files/directories if it really needs
them. b) they should be created under the 'thot' or 'amaya' directory.

5. The distribution contains both win95 and NT binaries. A lot of users
will only want one, so there should be separate zip files for each (the
binaries take up a lot of space).

6. The program cannot handle spaces in filenames - this is Windows 95 not
Unix!

7. After a few uses, everything goes pear-shaped - it sometimes loads and
does nothing - leaving a process running but nothing visible. The dialog
boxes also go wrong (showing numbers instead of buttons on the scroll bars,
wrong fonts etc.) etc.

8. Graphics are often not displayed properly, sometimes appearing as a
black rectangle, or else not at all.

9. It is very slow when displaying files.
