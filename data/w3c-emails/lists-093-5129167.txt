Same situation as already reported by someone else, but I didn't see a
solution . . .
there is no '.exe' file in the win95\bin folder.  There is a '.exp' file
(is that significant?).  Anyway, I am running windows 95 on an intel p5
with 16M ram (if you want to know) and downloaded the .zip file and
unpacked it to C:\, as instructed.
Thanks,
Lee
