Hi Mike; Thank you fo ryouir report.
However what are your reporting concerns an old version of Amaya.

>Some bugs:
>
>1. If the program tries to connect (using dial up networking) and you
>cancel, then the whole program is locked and the process has to be killed.
>
>2. The program always starts with the same window size and position. a) it
>should be able to store previous settings. b) it should not sit under the
>'taskbar' at the bottom of the screen.
>
>3. The open files dialogue has '.html' and '.htm' files as separate
>filters. They should be in the same filter. It would also be useful to have
>some kind of history/recent list.
>
>4. Whenever amaya.exe is run it creates an 'amaya' sub-directory under the
>'temp' directory, with 9 further sub-directories which are usually empty.
>a) the program should delete temporary files/directories if it really needs
>them. b) they should be created under the 'thot' or 'amaya' directory.
>
>5. The distribution contains both win95 and NT binaries. A lot of users
>will only want one, so there should be separate zip files for each (the
>binaries take up a lot of space).
>
>6. The program cannot handle spaces in filenames - this is Windows 95 not
>Unix!
>
>7. After a few uses, everything goes pear-shaped - it sometimes loads and
>does nothing - leaving a process running but nothing visible. The dialog
>boxes also go wrong (showing numbers instead of buttons on the scroll bars,
>wrong fonts etc.) etc.
>
>8. Graphics are often not displayed properly, sometimes appearing as a
>black rectangle, or else not at all.
>
>9. It is very slow when displaying files.

>Mike Miles
