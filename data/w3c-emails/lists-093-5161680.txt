I'm running FreeBSD-2.2-stable and I was trying to compile amaya-1.1a.  I
unpacked everything (thot-src-2.1d and amaya-1.1a) and tried to run
configure ... things look pretty normal until it tries to make the
Makefiles :

configure: warning: Thot editor sources not found
updating cache ./config.cache
creating ./config.status
creating Makefile
sed: 4: conftest.s2: filename expected
creating Options.orig
sed: 4: conftest.s2: filename expected

creating javalib/Makefile
sed: 4: conftest.s2: filename expected
creating pluginlib/Makefile
sed: 4: conftest.s2: filename expected
creating config.h
Amaya package is now configured
Amaya configured with libWWW
Amaya configured with Plugins support
Amaya configured with Math support
Motif libraries were not found
Thot and Amaya might not compile
Edit your Option file
Now start "make all" (GNU make preferably) to build the binaries

I'm compiling against Lesstif libraries.  I know that the configure script
from thot-src-2.1b works fine.  I've compiled previous versions of the
thoteditor and amaya and have never seen this problem.  The errors result
in zero length Makefiles and a zero length Options.orig file and hence
"make all" fails.

Any ideas?
