I downloaded the new (this date) zip and unzipped it producing the
following tree:
C:\
  thot\
    amaya\
    config\
    win95\
        bin\
          amaya.exe

I double clicked on the executable which did nothing.  I got sounds of a
file opening and a file closing on my speaker.  I have a pentium p5 PC with
16M ram running Windows 95.  Help?
