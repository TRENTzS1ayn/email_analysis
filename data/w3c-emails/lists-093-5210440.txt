I have the 'amaya-src-1_1a_tar.gz file' (14mbytes). I then downloaded a
copy of 'gzip.exe' from a gnu archive (116K, 20 Aug 1993) and invoked it
in the same subdirectory as the .gz file as 'gzip -d -N
amaya-src-1_1a_tar.gz' and what I got was a single file 33mbytes in
size, it does appear to have source code in it, but it is all one file.
What am I doing wrong? Please help me understand the procedure to
uncompress this .gz file so I can get started understanding amaya.
