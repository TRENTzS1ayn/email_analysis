Hi Charles,

>Well, I just downloaded the 9/22 windows95 binary and unzipped it using

We unfortunatelly can do nothing to improve pkunzip.

You do not need to set any environment variable.
==============================================

The environment variable HOME is not important for amaya/Windows.
THOTDIR is set by amaya itself.

All what you need is that the files listed below must be present 
in the right directory:

Thot\amaya:
==========

HTML.STR
MathML.STR
HTMLT.TRA
HTMLTT.TRA
MathMLT.TRA
HTML.trans
MathML.trans
MathML.SCH
EDITOR.SCH
HTML.SCH
HTMLP.PRS
HTMLPBW.PRS
HTMLPLP.PRS
HTMLPLPUS.PRS
HTMLPP.PRS
HTMLPPUS.PRS
MathMLP.PRS
HTML.conf
HTML.EN
HTML.FR

Thot\win95\bin
==============

wwwdll.dll
WWWUTILS.DLL
WWWCORE.DLL
WWWTRANS.DLL
wwwcache.dll
wwwstream.dll
WWWMIME.DLL
WWWHTTP.DLL
wwwhtml.dll
wwwnews.dll
wwwdir.dll
wwwgophe.dll
wwwftp.dll
wwwfile.dll
wwwtelnt.dll
WWWAPP.DLL
wwwwais.dll
msvc_40.dll
Amaya.exe
