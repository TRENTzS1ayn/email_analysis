amaya-src-1.1a.tar.gz is an unix archive file.
Sources files are stored in amaya-src-1.1a.tar
which is compressed by gzip tool.

You have to get the tar tool and then use the
following command to get amaya source files:

tar xvf amaya-src-1.1a.tar

In the near future, we plan to have a winzipped
source code of amaya.

>I have the 'amaya-src-1_1a_tar.gz file' (14mbytes). I then downloaded a
