Okay, we've downloaded the lastest zipped version of Amaya, we unzipped it
to C:\, we checked all the files and found them to be all there, we checked
the thot\ ini file, and we ran amaya.exe from a prompt line (start bar,
run) with a valid html for parameter.  We got a few spins of the disk...
and that's it.  Where do we go from here?
