Here's another workaround:

? Download the zip for the windows 95 version of Amaya

? Unpack the zip with Winzip (if you don't have it, get it!) to C:\

? Open notepad and type in:
set thotdir=c:\thot
set home=c:\thot
amaya

? Save as c:\thot\win95\bin\amaya.bat

. Find the above saved batch file (with explorer or file manager) and drag
it with the right mouse button to the desktop where you save it as a
shortcut.  Right click on the icon and click on properties.  Set it to run
minimized and to close on exit.
