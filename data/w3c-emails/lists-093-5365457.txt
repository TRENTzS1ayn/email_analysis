Sorry for the delay Brett.
It's difficult to me to understand what is the problem.

Do you try to re-use the previous hierarchy (release 1.0) ?
If it's the case could you delete all files within the object directory
or create a new object directory (.../Thot/obj for example).
Then go into this empty directory and try to reconfigure
run: ../configure
Let me know if it solves your problem and if not could you give me some
information about the contents of the file Options.orig
Regards
  Irene.
