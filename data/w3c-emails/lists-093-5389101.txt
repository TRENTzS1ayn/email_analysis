Hi Charles,

Amaya is a freeware (see the coyright), you can download it and use as
well as you want (all you  have to do is to keep the copyright of
INRIA and MIT).

I really need some external contributions. Basically, I'm the only
developer
of Amaya on Windows platforms, any contribution is welcome.

I did not release makefiles because to build amaya we need of cource
MSCV,
but we also need other compilers developed by our team. At the present
time, I'm preparing a Windows version of these compilers. When all of
this will
be ready, both compilers and makefiles will be released for the public.

Please CHECK THAT LIBWWW.MAK has not \r\n at the end of each line.
You have to edit libwww.mak using a window editor and to clean it
(suppress ^M extra characters) than you can build libwww.
