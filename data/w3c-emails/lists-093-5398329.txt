No - I downloaded all new src's for both amaya and thot-src and unpacked
them into /tmp, then made a Target directory and followed the
instructions on making.

I would be happy to give you this - it's empty!   :-)  The Options.orig
file (as well as all of the Makefiles in the different directories like
bin, tools, amaya, etc) are of zero length.  

This did not happen w/ previous incarnations and in fact if I substitute
thot-src-2.1b for 2.1d, I can get configure to work with amaya-1.1a (the
make fails due to missing files later but at least configure works).  

I did diff the configure files (from thot-src-2.1b and 2.1d), but I didn't 
see anything that could be causing this, but that may just be due to my
lack of experience w/ configure scripts.
