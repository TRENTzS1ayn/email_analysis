Browser:

? According to the documentation, the active links and target links are
respectively blue and green.  Not true.  The color specified in the HTML
"body" statement is default.

? Graphics
    - the browser doesn't recognize transparent GIFs
    - the "align" attribute in the "img" statement not recognized
    - browser apparently only uses a 16 color pallet (probably windows
colors).  I would suggest the use   of the Netscape 224 (I think) colors as
a minimum.

? Font sizes are way off where the "size" attribute is used in the "font"
statement, i.e., a <font size=2> in the HTML renders an almost invisible
text line by the browser.
