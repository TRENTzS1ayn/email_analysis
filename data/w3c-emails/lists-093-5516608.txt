Selecting:
Generally works great!  Just a few suggestions.

? Selecting with escape.  Great idea!  However, I would suggest using
another key for this function.  I would use the escape key to remove the
user from the select mode entirely, i.e. "refresh window".

? Cut, copy, and paste.  ' any plans to use windows standard of CTRL X,
CTRL C, and CTRL V shortcut keys in conjunction with the windows clipboard?

Please disregard the "align right" in the "img" comment.  I'm checking
source code generated by Amaya and that may have been a premature
presumption.

.. . . more later.
