Irene or Vincent, could you please comment this report about colors
(align and fonts too)?

If you have a glance at amaya on Linux, you will see that transparent
gifs are
recognized. This is not the case in the version released on Windows but
it
will be in the next release (I already treat transparent gifs).

Basically, if you use true colors (either 16, 24 and 32 bits) you will
have
no problem. There is a problem with 256 colors mode and I'm working on
it.
16 colors mode is not supported "yet" by Amaya.
