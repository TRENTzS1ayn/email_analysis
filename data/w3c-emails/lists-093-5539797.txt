Hi all,

The last suggestion for those who cannot run Amaya:

first of all, you do not need to set any environment variable or
excute Amaya via a batch file.

THOTDIR is set by amaya itself and HOME allows Amaya to
create the directory where it will store temporary files.

If the environment variable HOME doesn't exist, amaya uses the
default directory C:\TEMP.

I noticed (its my fault) that amaya supposes that C:\TEMP
already exists. Please check that this directory exist, if No
create it and run amaya again.

In the next release you will not have to do that.
