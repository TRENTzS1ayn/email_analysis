Browser:

? Slide bars - dragging the slide bar up and down or right and left gets it
out of position relative to the document

? <img> - the align right and align left are ignored by Amaya (used in
Netscape 3.x and MSIE 3.x to float the text around an image).

Amaya browser is less forgiving than the other two majors browsers.  An
example is using percentages in tables.  Where Netscape or MSIE adjust the
percentages internally, Amaya seems to take them literally.  This is likely
to show up again and again:  a normal looking page viewed by Netscape or
MSIE appears squeezed together or goes off screen in Amaya.  When you
change these percentages to look okay in Amaya, the displays in Netscape
and MSIE appear unchanged!

Here's my point.  If Amaya is to be a development tool, it looks really
great!.  I would suggest the developer (of web pages) be aware of the sins
of Netscape and MSIE when working with imported source code.
