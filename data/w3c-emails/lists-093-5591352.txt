Aha. So that's why I got a whole bunch of weird files in my home directory.
I use windows NT and my system already uses HOME to point to the user
directory. Perhaps you should consider using something like AMAYA_HOME? or
even TEMP which is already defined by the windows system to point to a
temporary subdirectory, usually c:\windows\temp on win95 systems.
