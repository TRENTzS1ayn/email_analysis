Hi.
As per your reply of this week about the anaya.keyboard file, I did as
instructed and the u and w keys are working, however, the following key
characters do not:
period, left parenthesis, ampersand, percent sign, dollar sign, number
sign, exclamation mark, quotation sign, and apostrophe.

more later.
