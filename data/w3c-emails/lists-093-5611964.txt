I have a problem similar to the 'keyboard with W95 amaya' problem posted by
Marc Barret. I've removed the bad lines in amaya.keyboard, as suggested in
the reply, but  now the ' (quote) and & (ampersand)  keys move the cursor
around, instead of beeing inserted in text, like well-behaved characters
should. Is there a way 2 fix it?

Thanks!
