Hi,

I'm new to this list, but the description says it's for bug reports, so here
are my impressions.

I really like Amaya's editor. I find it much more intuitive to use than other
HTML editors I've tried. This is possibly from the point of view of someone
who is happy to use Emacs to edit HTML, and may differ from users who would
use MS Word and "Save as HTML".

I find that the document back and forward buttons seem to get confused after a
few clicks. Instead of going back and forth through the documents I'm
expecting, they seem to go off to a document I was looking at earlier, even in
a different session. This seems to occur more often if I two browser windows,
and change documents in both (although back and forward might still end up
with a document I looked at some other time).

A small feature request for using Amaya as a browser (as distinct from editor)
would be a "HOME" button. How do you set a default home page at startup?

Typing a new document title in the Title field of teh Formatted_view window
doesn't actually update the document. It must be typed in the structure view
to be saved.

I'm also having trouble with editing to create a page with FORMs. There
doesn't seem to be any way of creating submit and reset buttons. The editor
also seems reticent to allow me to type text in a paragraph within a form once
I have added a form element (eg TextInput) in that paragraph. I'm new to
forms, so I might be doing something wrong.

Thanks,
  Scott Davis
