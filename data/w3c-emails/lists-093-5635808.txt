We are working on the browsing history. These bugs will be fixed in the next 
release.

As you noticed, the emphasis was put on the editing functionality of Amaya.
The browsing functionality is still lacking some basic features. We are now
revisiting the browser. As an example, we are improving the history (see 
above).
We are also considering adding a home button.  The question is: how many 
buttons
are acceptable?

Just set the variable HOME_PAGE in file .thotrc in your home directory.
This is explained in:

You can update it in the Title field of the Formatted_view window, but you
have to hit the Return (or Enter) key to have it replace the previous title.

When the caret is somewhere within a FORM, just select entry CommandLine from
the Form menu (you get it from the Types menu).  It creates both buttons.
You can then edit the Value attribute of the corresponding INPUT element
to change the label of these buttons.

Form creation in Amaya needs some improvements.
More in the next release.
