This is about amaya for win95 1.1a.
I tried amaya on a different computer. I still crashes on the
down load links but the graphics look OK. This computer has
a diamond stealth 64V. The other computer had a clone video 
card. I guess amaya does not work with clone cards. That seems
strange since windows should take care of that.
Amaya does not copy to the clipboard. I can not copy to other 
applications. That should be fixed. I is essential to be able to 
copy to and from other applications.
