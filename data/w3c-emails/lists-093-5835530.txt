You have to rename WWWSTREA.DLL or use a version of unzip that
recognizes
file names with more than 8 characters.

It is not in our charge to adapt the software with respect to each user
needs.
Amaya is a free ware and you can use it as you want and modify it
according
to your needs. The only request is to keep the INRIA/MIT copyright.

Please download the source code and try to make the modifications you
want.
If you have problems with the source code, you can ask the amaya team
and
we will help you. But we cannot make modifications for a particular use
of
Amaya this is not our task.

Regards.
