How do I run Amaya on Windows NT?

I've downloaded the archive and unpacked it. I haven't found any
instructions (either on the site or in the archive) that suggest I need
to do anything else. But when I try to run Amaya.exe, nothing happens.
(Watching in Task Manager shows that it runs for a few seconds and then
goes away.)

If it's any help: System is NT Workstation 4, service pack 3; hardware
is P/100, 40 MB RAM.
