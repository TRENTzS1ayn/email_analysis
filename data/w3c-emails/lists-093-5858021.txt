Do you try to start Amaya on a local page ?
To do so, please edit the file Thot/config/THOT.INI and add the name
of a local page in the line HOME_PAGE like
HOME_PAGE=c:\Thot\amaya\HOTLIST.HTML

In the current release, Amaya tries to fetch the initial page through the 
Net and if it meets problems with the Net, it crashes.
In next release there'll be a local welcome page.
