Well, you're right, of course, as far as HTML 3.2 is concerned. I should
have written

... font_size := n rather than font_size := n*k*default_font_size ...

where k is such that k*default_font_size corresponds to SIZE=1

However, the fact remains that I see 1pt text with SIZE=1 and 2pt with
SIZE=2. Perhaps there's a default style setting that I haven't
discovered.
