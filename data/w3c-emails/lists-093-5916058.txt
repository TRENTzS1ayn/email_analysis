Well, I had the wrong idea about FONT SIZE. But apparently Amaya is more
wrong, as I discuss below.

Personally I find the text there on FONT and BASEFONT somewhat unclear,
despite the examples. Perhaps this can be improved in 4.0 if these tags
survive.

Obviously this 'absolute font size' is not meant to be a font point
size, or it would have a range of 1-70  (say). So the issue is, how do
you compute the point size n of SIZE=m text? Presumably, you take the
point size N of Normal text and relate it to the BASEFONT value b, if
specified (default b=3 is hinted in the HTML3.2 ref):

 n :=  f( N, m, b)

eg,
n := N*m/b

or, for some k ~ 1/b,

n := N*(1+k*(m-b) )

What I see in Amaya 1.1a is n := m. This is different from other
browsers I use and makes HTML containing <FONT SIZE=m> with m=1,2
unreadable (and you may say, this is what they deserve for using a
stupid tag that breaks the HTML concept of tagging by intent rather than
presentation, and I would have agreed, except that the thing has been so
widely adopted).

Doesn't this work sensibly in the Unix versions?
