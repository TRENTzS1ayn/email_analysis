What I'm trying to do is set up an icon to preview pages in other browsers.
HoTMetal has an option to set up external browsers (they automatically find
Netscape and MSIE) to view pages you are working on.  You can add other
browsers to also use for previewing pages in progress; you simply tell the
programme which executable it should run.  Of sourse, I haven't seen any
option to define paramaters to pass to the programme it is calling, so I
don't know just how it is sending them.  The filename path doesn't have
spaces, so I don't expect that is the problem.
