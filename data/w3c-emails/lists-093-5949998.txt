Hi,

I have tested amaya-Windows95-1.1a with NT 4.0, i have aslo a problem
for exec amaya.exe

I'm trying to compile, but i have 4 little PBs:

1) the makefile of MSVC is very bad !  :-(
I had to change the paths of sources, dependecy, lib

2) cc printout error at the ligne 9 of dialogaip_f.h 
"extern void DebugBreak ( void );"
The signature used by winbase.h is 
WINBASEAPI VOID WINAPI DebugBreak( VOID );

3) the dialogapi.c (line 170) include "winerrdata.c", but i haven't
found winerrdata.c in thot-src-2.1.d and amaya-src-1.1.a 

4) i haven't found amaya.rc. 
This last problem has prevented me from going on my compilation.

Thanks for your help.

Laurent.
