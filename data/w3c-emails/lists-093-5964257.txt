I have installed the current beta release of Amaya on a
P90 48MB RAM WNT 4.0 SP3 box.

It started up OK allowing me to have a quick play.
I realize that a new beta is coming out on the 20th so I guess
I'm too late to influence it but the following may be of interest.

1 The weirdest bug is that I can't type in the letter w which
  is a wacky omission for a www tool. The letter u cannpt be typed
  and neither can full stop. All uppercase letters are fine but many
  punctuation characters are not and of these some seem to have control
  effects such as got ot start of line.
2 The start up configuration cannot be altered. I guess this is a pending
  feature. I am working off line with Amaya.
3 I'm not convinced by the "keep hitting return to burrow out of a
  structure" interface. I would rather have a seperate end structure 
  key press e.g. Shift-Return or Ctrl-]. This would work in the middle of
  a structure e.g add a list item between two others, Shift-return takes
  you to just past the end of the innermost enclosing structure.
5 I like the view structure window though I would work mainly in the
  presentation window (i.e. the one that shows how the structure may
  be presented. Does it have a name?)
4 I would like to suggest that the authors of Amaya take a look
  at a word processor called TechWriter or its sibling Easiwriter if they
  can find an owner of an Acorn computer who uses it. This is a structured
  word processor and they way it works and allows the user to navigate
  and select the document structure is very effective.
5 Could the documentation be made availabe as a zipped ps or pdf or html
  file tree? Or all three? Some problems and misunderstandings I have
  had would be helped if I had a paper manual at my side.

A very promising beginning. I look forward to the next Beta.

Mark.
