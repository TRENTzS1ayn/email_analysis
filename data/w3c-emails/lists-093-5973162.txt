Nasir - 
   Check your unzip program - if you use a 16-bit
(for Windows 3.1) unzip program on the AMAYA files
it unzips them but they don't work.  Even if you change 
the name after unzipping, it still doesn't work!

   Find the Win95 or WinNT version (32_bit) unzip
and it should work.  http://www.winzip.com is the 
site.


Ramzi - 
   I had the same problem: user error and old software.
It's working fairly well ... images aren't showing up,
but we are just using the structure and style sheet
features to fix a big set of files. That part is working well.
