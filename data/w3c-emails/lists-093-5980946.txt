I already mentioned that the actual release of source code
does not allow to compile correctly amaya on Windows platform.

There is ome stuff which is not yet ready on windows.

I agree that the makefile is not yet well done. The reason is
mentioned above.

DebugBreak is overloaded for Unix. At the present time, 
you have just to make MSVC ignore it using preprocessor
dierctives:

#ifndef _WINDOWS
extern void DebugBreak (void);
#endif

I'm surprized that this file does not exist in the tar file.
Anyway you will find it in the next release.
