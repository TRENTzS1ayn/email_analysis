Hi.  I just downloaded thot-src-2.1d.tar.gz and amaya-src-1.1a.tar.gz and
followed the instructions to unpack them.  When running ../configure I get
exactly the same problems as were reported by Brett Taylor on 22 Sep, namely
the mess starting with

configure: warning: Thot editor sources not found

..etc...with the end result being null Makefiles.

See http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-amaya/1997JulSep/0133.html
for the original report of the problem.  The last message on this thread
I could find was 0163.html, in which Daniel Veillard suggested:

I did this and the output of autoconf was identical to the original configure
script (thus, it is not going to solve the problem).

Any help would be greatly appreciated.
