Not bad for a beta.

Things that aren't working well that hinder using it:

  Tables squish the first cell so narrow that the text 
usually ends up in the second cell.  Even short words like
"Note" are hyphenated.  My tables are formatted with
Width="100%" as an attribute, and do extend across the
window.  It's just the first cell that is not displayed 
correctly.

Good things - 
  The views!  Love the views and the ability to jump 
from one to another.

Things I'd like it to have:
  an Undo command (Reload is OK, but that wipes out
all the changes and not just the last mistake)

  The ability to see and edit the code as well as the 
text and structure.  I sometimes need to see what the
code really is as well as what Amaya has parsed to figure out
what went wrong.
