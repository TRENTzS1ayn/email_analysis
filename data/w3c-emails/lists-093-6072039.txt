Hi lee,

Could you tell what exactly happen when you resize a page and what slide
bar
is concerned.

Yes I started working on that and this will be done for the next
release.

This bug is fixed. If you try the latest release of amaya on WINNT, you
will
see that all transparent backgrounds work fine. I modified the source
code
for Win 95 and now it works fine too. (transprency is not supported in
the
same way under winnt and win95).

I know that and this will be done too as soon as possible.
