Hi

I'm not sure whether this is a bug or a misconfiguration, but whichever
I'm not managing to correct it; which is a pity because Amaya (when it
works) is really nice and useful.

The problem is this: most times, when Amaya starts, the following keys on
the keyboard don't work at all:

<return>
<enter> on keypad
<delete>
<backspace>

The following behave very oddly:

numeral 2 shows as '@' (alpha)
numeral 7 shows as '{' (open curly bracket)
numeral 8 shows as '[' (open square bracket)
numeral 9 shows as ']' (close square bracket)
numeral 0 shows as '}' (close curly bracket)
<hyphen> shows as '\' (backslash), as does <underscore>
<equals> shows as '+' (plus)
<right curly bracket> shows as '~' (tilde) as does <right square bracket>

In addition the <shift> key doesn't work for any letter, but does work
for some symbols and numeral keys.

This is frustrating, but what makes it worse is that occasionally it
works perfectly. Two obvious potential causes were

/usr/local/Thot/config/XKeysymDBand
/usr/local/Thot/config/amaya.keyboard

I've tried removing both of these, but it hasn't helped; Amaya still
starts, and the keyboard still doesn't work.

My /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XKeysymDB is extremely similar to that which is
distributed with Netscape 3; the only patch I make to this is:

xmodmap -e 'keycode  22 = BackSpace'
