Hi!

(1) I am getting no graphics (transparent gifs or otherwise), no background
graphics.  Since I couldn't see any graphics this time, I couldn't check to
see whether the ALIGN (left, right) worked in  the IMG element.

(2) No wrapping with tables?  Amaya has a different concept of widths than
Netscape 3 and 4, and MSIE 3.2 browsers which I use for testing and
benchmarks.  Whether a percentage is used, or left out of the table, the
default (in other browsers) is absolute, i.e. no more than width of the
window.  The data that is too wide is wrapped or (for graphics) sometimes
layered.  Amaya pushes it off to the right of the viewing window.

(3) Slide bars - more specifically:  In the MSIE browser, the right hand
(vertical) slide bar is always there.  If the page does not extend below
the window, the slider is not available, but the slide bar is still there.
They don't have to adjust the window width between pages of varying
lengths.  Netscape does.  The Netscape browser decreases the window
(viewing area) width by the width of the corresponding slide bar when the
page is longer than the window.
     Dragging the slider.  When a slider is present, this indicates (to me)
there is more information off-screen.  There should be no slider (or slide
bar) if otherwise.  Enough said?  In all windows applications, browsers
included, where I have had the occasion, I've been able to position my
mouse pointer on the slider and, holding down the mouse clicker, move the
slider up and down (or right and left) to position the page in the window. 
This is great for very long pages where I want to "jump" to the bottom. 
The Amaya slide bar "gets lost" during this procedure.  When I let go of
the mouse button, the slider bounces up from the bottom of the slide bar
instead of staying there.

(4) Linking offline:  The link is coded <A HREF="page2.html">Page 2</A>. 
The amaya browser is browsing "page1.html".  Both current and target file
are located in C:\home local directory.  When you double click on the link,
the browser should concatenate the prefix information required, with the
link, and load the resulting local (offline) target file
(file://C|/home/page2.html).  The algorithm should also apply to upward
conversions, e.g., <A HREF="../index.html> parse as <file://C|/index.html>.
 

(5) Font sizes:  I am sure you have heard enough about this, but as far as
I know, here's the way it seems to work.  The html element <FONT SIZE=>
uses values from 1 to 7.  It is on a gradual scale not a percentage number.
 For example, if the current font size is 3 (seems like default) and you
change it to 2, the size is adjusted a fixed number of points (not a
percentage); say, from 12 point to 10 point.  The same thing with using a
"+" or "-".  If the current font size is 3 and you change it by -1, it goes
from 12 point to 10 point, for instance.  Is Amaya possibly confusing the
font element in HTML with the font properties in CSS1?

(6) On a good note, CSS seems to work okay as far as I went.

Yours,
Lee
