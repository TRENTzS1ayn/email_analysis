Just a  (virtually costless) suggestion
Could it be possible to save the last extension selected in the
OPENFILENAME dialog used to browse files on disk, or maybe to have html and
htm grouped together on the 'file extension' list box? It would make life
easier for us poor guys having to stick to .htm extensions for backward
compatibility with some old tools we use here.

Keep doin' well!
