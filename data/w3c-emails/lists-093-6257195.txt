William,

Don't reply to the spam message. That only generates much more traffic.
In many cases, the addresses they give are false ones, so you just waste your
time for nothing. Also, don't go to their web site as it will only give them
your email address.

We are currently working on a filtering solution to avoid this kind of
problems in the near future. In the meantime, each time we get a spam
mail, I add it to a banned email list.

Sorry for the inconvenients,

-Jose Kahan, on behalf of the W3C sysadmin team
