  Hi Paul,

>When building from source (amaya-src-1.1b.tar.gz,
>thot-src-2.1e.tar.gz, thoteditor-src-2.1e.tar.gz) on Redhat Linux 4.2
>(Intel), configure reports a warning that Java classes are not found

  the Amaya and Amaya-Java distribution are now separated,
the Amaya standard distribution doesn't ship the Java code
anymore. I am planning on making a new release real soon now.
It's mainly a matter of doing more documentation.
  I was waiting for Biss-AWT to be reintegrated in the Kaffe
distribution, but it seem it takes longer than expected.
  I guess that the amaya-1.1a source code can still be found
on Linux sunsite archives and these should have the java code.

  Sorry for the inconvenience,

Daniel
