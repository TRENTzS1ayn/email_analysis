World Wide Web Consurtum:

I am working on an embedded system that needs to make use of a HTML 
parser.  I downloaded you Amaya1.1b and have been working with it for 
some time now.  I have had some trouble just isolating the parser portion.
In you documentation you describe each portion of the browser as modular, 
suggesting that I could just take out the Parser module and use it for my 
embedded system.  It appears as though ParseHTML.c is the file 
containing most of the functionality for the parser but it is not 
modular.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Please e-mail any 
help that you could offer regarding just the use of the HTML parser to 
jgammon@umr.edu.

Thank You W3C,

Joshua Gammon
