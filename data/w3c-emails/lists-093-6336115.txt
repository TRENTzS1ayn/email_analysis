Hi Joshua,

If you want to use only the Amaya HTML parser, I suggest you to
start from the small application html2piv.
This application compiles the parser module of Amaya hmtl2thot.c
with the flag STANDALONE to only build a Thot document (no display
functions are connected to the parser in this case).
The Amaya parser checks the HTML syntax and connects a function to 
each element or attribute. In this application, the connected functions
create Thot components.
In fact the Amaya HTML parser is quite complex because we try to accept
and transform invalid structures.
