The Amaya 1.1c is a minor release that improves a set of Amaya
features, mainly in Windows (NT and 95) version.

The whole source code is available in a single tar file. Previously,
users had to download two tar files, one for Thot and another for Amaya.
Now there is only one tar file.
This release has also been precompiled for a number of Unix patforms and
Windows platforms.

The http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/New.html page gives information about 
new improvements. They concern:

 a) in Windows version:
    o 256 color mode,
    o background images and image transparency,
    o keyboard management,
    o opening files from text zones and toolbar management,
    o HTML forms,
    o links management in local files.

b) in both Unix and Windows versions:
    o CSS background  rule,
    o saving in ASCII format,
    o editing of hotzones in image maps (not available yet in Windows version),
    o the "Make Book" function,
    o the help in line,
    o other minor reported bugs are now fixed.

Regards
     Irene
