Dear Mikael,

You're right, the install procedure was wrong. I've changed the install in
the last 1.1c release.
Everything will be installed in the directory /usr/local/share/thot so you
will find binaries in /usr/local/share/thot/applis/bin
If you have any other suggestion for further releases, please contact us.

Regards
  Irene.
