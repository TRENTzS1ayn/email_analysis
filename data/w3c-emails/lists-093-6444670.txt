Dear Paul,

The configuration file is build for the whole set of applications developed 
under the
Thot library. The native Thot editor is one and 2 different versions of Amaya 
are part
of them. But in the current distributed tar file, only source of one 
application is
available: Amaya without Java support (the whole sources would be too big for
many people).
So, if you want to compile the current distribution re-start your 
configuration by:

../configure 
or
../configure --enable-plugin

For more information read http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Autoconf.html

If you are interested in Thot application see http://opera.inrialpes.fr/opera/t
hot/
Source code of this application is also free.
Regards
  Irene.
