I reported this same problem right after the first release of Amaya 1.1
for Linux-ELF.  I don't believe I ever received a response to my report.

I was running olwm on Linux 2.0.27.  The system simply ignored all
double-clicks, regardless of the location of the html document.  I
tried adjusting the mouse timing settings in olwm, with no effect.

I never fixed the problem with olwm.  I switched to the Lesstif clone of
mwm and Amaya worked ok.
