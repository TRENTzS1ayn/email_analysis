I get:

Compiling...
dialogapi.c
E:\src\Thot\Thotlib\Dialogue\dialogapi.c(177) : fatal error C1083:
Cannot open include file: 'winerrdata.c': No such file or directory
Error executing cl.exe.

LibThotEditor.lib - 1 error(s), 0 warning(s)

when building the LibThotEditor - And it seems I do not have the
file winerrdata.c on my computer (not even in the darkest side of 
my hard disk...) Is it just late at night (or early in the morning)
or there is a file missing ?
