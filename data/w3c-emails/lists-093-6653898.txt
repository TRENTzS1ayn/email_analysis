Hello Olly,

In our previous episode, Olly Betts said:

In its current state, Amaya doesn't interpret all of the HTTP headers
which describe the body, and in particular, the charset header. On the
other hand, Amaya interprets the charset when it's specified inside the
HTML document. We're currently upgrading our HTTP interface to improve
this.

What kind of platform are you  using? Amaya does send HTTP/1.1 requests.
Perhaps you're going thru a proxy?

That's right! This bug has been fixed up and will disappear in the next
release.

Thanks for the URL :) I'll use in my tests.
