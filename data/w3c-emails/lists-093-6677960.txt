Hi,

To compile Amaya on Windows NT/95, please get:
- libwww sources from: http://www.w3.org/Library/
- sources of amaya from: http://www.w3.org/Amaya
- the additional tools allowing to compil amaya on Windows NT/95 from:
   ftp://opera.inrialpes.fr/pub/sources/amaya/amaya-compil-1.1c.ZIP
   this file contains stuff missing in the source distribution.

both sources of amaya and amaya-compil-1.1c.ZIP must be in the same
directory.

Unzip amaya-src-1.1c.tar.gz
Unzip amaya-compil-1.1c.ZIP

libwww sources have to be in the thot directory.

At the present time, there is five different projects:
- libjpeg.mak
- zlib.mak
- libpng.mak
- LibThotEditor.mak
- amaya.mak

You have to build each of these projects (in the next distribution,
there will be
only one project).

If you want to build the Win95 version, you have to use projects in the
directory
thot\win95, else (for winnt) use projects in thot\winnt.

1. Build the libwww project,
2. Build the libjpeg project,
3. Build the zlib project,
4. Build the libpng project,
5. Build the LibThotEditor project,
6. Build the amaya project.

If you have any propblem doing that please dont hesitate to send me an
e-mail.

Regards.
Ramzi.
