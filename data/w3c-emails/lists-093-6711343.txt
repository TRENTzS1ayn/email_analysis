Hi David,

We recommand to unzip the binaries of amaya using winzip
(http://www.winzip.com).

The latest release of Amaya creates the directory C:\TEMP if this
latter doesn't exist.

Now the only problem you may have is the thot.ini file. It should 
look like the following:

[thot_lib]
THOTSYSSCH=$(THOTDIR)\amaya
DICOPAR=$(THOTDIR)\dicopar

[amaya.exe]
THOTSYSSCH=$(THOTDIR)\amaya
LANG=en_US
HOME_PAGE=http://kg9ae.dyn.ml.org

Check this file and try amaya again, it should work.
