Hi There,

I'm Alexis, and I downloaded Amaya. It sounds like a great
  project, especially if it soons supports Mathematical expressions.
  I'd really appreciate to use that. However, I have an Indy under
  IRIX 5.3 and I couldn't start Amaya. The following is the output
  that I've got in my console. Do you have any idea why this
  would happen?

IRIS 281% amaya
*** Not initialized
*** Fatal Error: X connexion refused

  Note: I tried to setup the THOT path and include the Amaya binary
  directory in my PATH variable, but that didn't make any difference...
  I also copied the code from THOT into a small of my X window code
  and it could open the display, the shell and more! So I'm not sure
  why your binary isn't working.

Any help to start would be appreciated. Thank you.
