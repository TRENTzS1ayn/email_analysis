Hi There,

I downloaded the newest version (1.1c) of Amaya today. It does
  the same thing than the previous version (1.1b):

IRIS 281% amaya
*** Not initialized
*** Fatal Error: X connexion refused

Now I thought I could simply compile and try to find out the
  bug that way (or at least pin point something out.) There is what
  happened to me:

  1. Missing files

Thot/amaya/*.GRMnone of these files exist

I would appreciate to know where these files are. I tried
  to compile with the amaya-src-1.1c.tar and amaya-SGI-1.1c.tar
  file decompressed and untared.

  2. Invalid #define (I know you fixed it, but the '_sgi' define
  doesn't exist by default!)

Thot/libjpeg/jconfig.h (line #27)

#ifndef _sgi/* needs to be 'sgi' or '__sgi' */

  3. Just for your information

You wrote the following in the README.amaya, and it
  sounds somewhat confusing to present tar.gz when you just
  spoke about a tar.Z (line #73-74):

If this is a tar.Z file:
uncompress -c amaya-system.tar.gz | tar xvf -
