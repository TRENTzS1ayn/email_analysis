Hello do you own a Digital Satellite Dish?  Would you like to 
receive all of your unsubscribed channels FREE?  We have "Test Cards" 
that will activate all of the channels on your DSS Receiver. 
It works just like a cable descrambler, but with some of our
cards you don't even have to subscribe at all.  If you are the proud
owner of a DSS or considering buying a system you would want to checkout
our Website.

We can SAVE you MONEY!  If you are a subscriber to DirecTV and USSB, this
site is a must see!!  If you know of friends that have a satellite dish 
retrieve the information and forward it to them.  

Thank you for your time.
