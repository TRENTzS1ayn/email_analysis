Hello,

I'm currently busy writing a server application which depends on
clients using http/put to supply documents.

Behind the scene there is a non traditional approach working which
will eventually hide files from the user interface (those are treated
to be an implementation detail).

Unfortuntly amaya writes the images before the actual document. This
seems to be ok at the first glance because the other way around (as
netscape does, writing the html first followed by the imgs) introduces
the chance to request non-existing documents.

Looking at my new system there are no files visible. Hence the html
page must be saved before the imgs because the imanges are assoziated
with th page and I need the page to store the reference.

   To a little more into the details: there is also a history
   associated with the page.  The way amaya saves the img either gets
   associated with the last page in sequence or for new pages (there
   os no reference to the picture) garbage collected.  It would be
   possible to keep all imgs accociated with the old document but this
   would be a hack.

Another less hard problem is amaya always complaining when a document
I try to save gets redirected by the server upon the next read.  I
need to do this in any case.

Would it be hard to change that (maybe configurable)?

Thanx
/jerry
