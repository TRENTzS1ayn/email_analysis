>The main purpose of Amaya is to serve as a testbed to experiment new
Web protocols and
formats, to test and demonstrate new features proposed for existing Web
standards.
>A  tool like Amaya must be able to change very fast,
taking into account the latest proposed extensions to Web protocols and
formats.
