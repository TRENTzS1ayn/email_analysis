Of course, we plan to have a fully  HTML4.0 compliant release.
There are many new things in HTML 4.0. So it'll take time to implement all
these new things. Some of them are already implemented in Amaya, such as
SPAN and OBJECT elements. ID, CLASS and LANG attributes are also currently
supported.
We plan to work on tables and internationalization aspects of HTML 4.0 during
next six months.

Right, but we need manpower to do that.
