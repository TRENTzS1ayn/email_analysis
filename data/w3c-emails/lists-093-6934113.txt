Is there a date at the horizone when the next version will be
released?  If this is later than the first half of jan98 it would be
quite a brake in my work, hence I would be interested in a patch.

Hm, meanwhile I'm no longer sure which one is the better way around.

As I said, I treat every document somewhat like a directory and all
those pictures like dir entries.  Having the document already in place
makes things easier at the first glance.

But after thinking twice about it I realized that I could associate
another idea with the reception of the document body: the document is
final at that moment.  Every submission of further content would then
be associated with the next version.

After implementing this policy I became quite happy with that idea.
The only draw back is that netscape (or whatever) users will have to
submit another request to close the document.

After all It remains merly a philosophical question.  But concerning
the question of compatibility it might be more important to behave all
the software same than better.

Anybody with ideas.
