The connection to W3C site was corrupted yesterday for everybody.
I think all is ok now and you can download the 1.2a Amaya version now.

Options and Makefiles are generated according to the current target 
architecture and current configure options. We need different subdirs to
store these files and to collect *.o, libraries and binaries.
I guess it's a good idea to collect all these generated files in the
same hierarchie.
We decided also to let user defines the target name he wants because it
is difficult to automatically generate a name aoccrding to the platform
and the cofigure options.
Asking the user to create subdir "obj" solves many problems and doesn't
complicate too much his life.
If sources are well downloaded and installed, all the rest is automatic.

I don't agree with you. If you need to create a link there was something
wrong in the previous step.

Yes, you're right. The current install supposes that you want to extend
the Amaya application. It's why libraries, str, tra, app, prs are also
installed. We should define a mini-install. Only amaya and print are
necessary in many cases.

The site should be accesible now, but I agree documentation is too poor.
