i am glad it wasn't just me they were blocking out!  is 1.2a worth
getting over the 1.2 i have?

i understand the variants, but why can't the makefile make the subdir
obj for you? it isn't hard for me to do (i do know the mkdir command :-)
but it is a trivial step that i didn't know about and i think it should
be automated in the built system.

i haven't explored building amaya with variants. i have created major
variant makefile systems so i know the problems. 

are you saying the obj subdir is my own name for my variant? so if i
wanted to configure/build another variant i would mkdir foo, cd there,
run ../configure with different options, etc? that make some more sense
but as we have agreed it is woefully undocumented. a simple INSTALL file
should be made stating this and put in the top dir of the
distribution. this is very critical i think for as more people build it,
this flaw will surface again. we generally expect an INSTALL/README file
to tell us how to build the basic system. and when i see configure, i
don't expect to do any unsusual things like this without an INSTALL file
in the source tree.

i will do a fresh extract and build (probably with 1.2a when i get
it). i will make a subdir obj, cd there and run ../configure. then i
will run make all from obj. i will let you know the results.

good idea. for us users/testers who want to install the binaries (and
whatever support files/libraries are needed) a proper make install
should be available. you should have make install do the regular install
(amaya and print) and make install-{all,dev} do the developers install
(all the binaries).

let's make it richer! as a major test platform and useful utility, the
docs are as important as the source!
