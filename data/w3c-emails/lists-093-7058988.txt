For us it was evident that you can build different binaries and install only
one. Don't forget that Amaya is an experimental tool. We are often adding
new extensions but some of them are not public available.

I'll do that for the next release.

Yes but you know that better documentation is done by users than by developers.
We're open to any suggestion to make it better.
