Hi,

I don't know if other people have experienced the same problem, but when
I use the menu item "File/Open_document" and get the file browser that 
allows me to pick a file from the local file system, the "Document
directories" list widget in the file browser dialog box doesn't show all
the subdirectories of the current directory. It seems that the end of the
list is truncated. I cannot tell whether it is because the last few 
subdirectories are not included in the widget, or whether it is because the
scrollbar is inadequately configured and doesn't allow me to scroll down
far enough to make the last subdirectories appear.

I have noticed this only when the list of subdirectories is rather long.
I experienced the problem with both Amaya 1.2 and 1.2a (solaris precompiled
binaries).

Peace,

Bertrand Ibrahim.
