Sorry to ask two questions that should already have been posted :

1. Under Windows95, I cannot browse with amaya directories which contain
a space. I guess it's a bug. I guess it has been identified. The question
is : when is it planned to be corrected ?

2. Where can I find the list of already identified and not yet corrected
bugs in amaya ?
