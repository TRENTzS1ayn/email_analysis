I have now compiled Amaya 1.2a on my Irix 6.2 system using 'cc', but had
2 small problems:

  1) configure still sets HAVE_STRINGS_H and HAVE_STRING_H. These are
incompatible and cause a compile error. The solution was to edit the
'config.h' files and comment out the following line:
/* #define HAVE_STRINGS_H 1 */

Can the configure script be changed so that only HAVE_STRING_H is used?

 2) in libjpeg/jconfig.h the line

#ifndef _sgi

should be

#ifndef __sgi

ie 2 underline caracters.

Otherwise the compilation with --enable-plugin worked well.
