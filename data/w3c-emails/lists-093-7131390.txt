I was trying to use Amaya and the CVS form in Jigedit 
on the page http://jigedit.w3.org:8080/jg/WWW/Protocols/HTTP-NG/Group/CVS/.

If the page isn't very wide, the form does not format properly
(in fact the column of radio buttons under Action was not visible) and
the buttons themselves not visible properly.  Whether it can otherwise
be used, is less than clear....
