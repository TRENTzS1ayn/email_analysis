Greetings.

I am not a member of this mailing list, but would like to bring to
the attention of whoever is concerned with such things that I have
just viewed some Web pages I recently authored for the Boston area
chapter of the Association for Internet Professionals (AIP) and am
dismayed to find that, though they are rendered somewhat reasonably
by both Netscape 4 and Internet Explorer 4 on both the Macintosh
and Windows platforms, they come out looking very strange using
Amaya.  I would like to write Web pages in a way that enables them
to be viewed properly under the widest set of conditions possible,
and I was looking forward to using Amaya itself for some authoring
tasks.  However, seeing what I am seeing makes me rather pessimistic
that such a thing will be possible.

For an example of what I mean, try viewing the home page of the site,
which is at "http://boston.us.association.org/" - though the text in
the main body of the page is rendered such that lines are filled to
the ends of lines, as I have specified using an external style sheet,
the margins I have specified in the style sheet are not being honored,
as they are in both Netscape and IE.  The banner at the top of the
page, which is supposed to be displayed as a single unit, has spacing
between each of the images, unlike what happens with either commercial
browser.  Likewise, the table at the bottom of the page comes out not
being displayed in the neat fashion that it is under both Netscape and
IE.  (I am using the 1.2 version of Amaya under Windows for my tests.)

If anyone can suggest a solution for these problems or would like more
information, please contact me by e-mail ("gtrujillo@association.org")
or phone (617-776-0121).

Thanks very much, in advance, for any help you might be able to provide.
Also, I would like to invite anyone who might be interested to attend
the AIP meeting this evening at MIT (select the "meetings" link from the
AIP page cited above for details).  Also, I would be interested in the
possibility of someone who is familiar with the work of the W3C being a
speaker for the organization, which meets monthly at MIT.

Best regards,

Gary Trujillo
