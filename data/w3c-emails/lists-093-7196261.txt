You can size the text with Amaya this is not a problem. However,
the Amaya home page is well displayed with Amaya and in right way.

How to modify text size with Amaya:

first edit a paragraph, then click within the paragraph and hit
escape key (this allows to select it).
Use the Style/Character Style Menu and modify what you want 
(size font, ...).

You can create a CSS rule on the paragraph tag and all your
paragraphs will be displayed in the same way than the modified
paragraph.

To create the CSS rule, select again the paragraph you've modified
and use the menu Style/Create Rule then confirm.
