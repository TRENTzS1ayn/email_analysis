This feature is available for Windows version since 1.2a release.
As explained in the entry "Configurating" in the menu "Help", the Windows
"User's preferences" style sheet should be located at Thot\amaya\amaya.css

For example, you can automatically magnify Web pages by creating this file 
with the following rule:

BODY { magnification : 2 }
