This concerns the http implementation. Amaya uses the libwww http 1.1 
implementation.
I think that the access speed depends on the server protocol level.
Do you know if this occurs with a specific server or if is it slow with all 
servers?

Frames are not part of the strict HTML 4.0 DTD. We're internally discussing 
whether 
we have to support them or not. WAI people doesn't agree with this feature.
