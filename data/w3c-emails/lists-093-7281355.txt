I'm having several problems with the Amaya 1.2a binary for Solaris 2.5.

    I cannot get it to print.  I've tried entering the appropriate
    string both into the "SetUp and print" dialog box and "THOTPRINTER=" 
    in ".thotrc" to no avail.  The command should be "lp -d hplj".
    I've tried it both with and without quotes around the string.

    If I double-click on the "Amaya Manual" link on the opening page and
    then on "Printing documents" on that page, I sometimes (usually) get:

HTTP-GW Internal Documentation

The HTTP-GW is part of the Trusted Information Systems Inc. firewall
toolkit and Gauntlet (TM) product.

No Server

You have accessed the HTTP-GW and the proxy has not been able to
        find any server information in your request and there is no default
        server configured to hand the request off to.

You may be able to get your firewall administrator to configure the
firewall to pass these requests off to a local HTTP server.


    If I follow the link provided by the firewall, it talks about...

When a request arrives at the proxy it looks for the server to
hand off the request to.  If it cannot find the server in the
request, it hands it off to the...  yadda, yadda, yadda.

    Whatever is going on here?


    If I go to http://www.w3c.org and then double-click on "Amaya", the
    entire page ends-up with a black background!  Makes it rather
    unreadable.

    If I run Amaya from a command line and observe what it spits out
    as it runs, I get things like:


**ERROR** opening http://www.w3c.org/


**ERROR** opening http://www.w3c.org/


**ERROR** opening http://www.w3c.org/

    This particular output resulted from a single attempt to go to
    http://www.w3c.org.  Which succeeded.


I have experienced none of these problems, or anything even remotely
like them, with any of the browsers (Netscape 2, 3 and 4; IE 2, 3, and
4; or HotJava 1.0 or 1.1) we have used here.

(Btw: I'm not on the mailing list--if it matters.)


Regards,
Jim
