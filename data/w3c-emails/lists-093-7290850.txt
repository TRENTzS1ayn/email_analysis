This message comes from your proxy or your firewall and not from Amaya.
Did you initialize the proxy using the environment variables (http_proxy) 
or the thot.ini file?

It seems you have a problem with your proxy setting. Try it again using
the correct URL:

http://www.w3.org/Amaya/

Why not? It's not hard to subscribe to it and it simplifies things for us.

Hope this helps,
