I tried this and received the following upon hitting the "print"
button:

    Command refused by the spooler "lpr - #1 -TAmayaPage.html 
        /tmp/Thot11008/Thot11008.ps"

If I start Amaya from a command line and do this, I observe:

    WARNING: cannot open file en-printdialogue
    sh: lpr: not found

So I selected "File -> Setup and print" and changed the "lpr" to
"lp -dhplj" (again, with no space), and received:

    Command refused by the spooler "lp -dhplj - #1 -TAmayaPage.html 
        /tmp/Thot11008/Thot11008.ps"

If I start Amaya from a command line and do this, I observe:

    WARNING: cannot open file en-printdialogue
    UX:lp: ERROR: Unrecognized option "-#".

Hmmm...  What is "-#" supposed to do?

(Btw: in normal use, "lp" doesn't care whether there's a space 
following the "-d" or not.  At least not here, it doesn't.)


Regards,
Jim
