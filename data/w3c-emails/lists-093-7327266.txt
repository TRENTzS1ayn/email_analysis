I tested some servers.
amaya accessed them a little quickly except one server.
but amaya did not accessed my math bbs properly well.
amaya accessed bbs and stopped and accessed and stopped.
that is, amaya  accessed bbs very slowly.
some case is that amaya accessed bbs for a little time and
stopped with a message "can't access server"
but IE4.0 accessed my bbs very quickly.
whY? Why?
Why amaya access my bbs very slowly?
how can i  check my using server's http version?
i don't  know.
my bbs's address is http://inhavision.inha.ac.kr/~s952011/wwwboard/index.cgi
please visit my math bbs and then you will understand my word.
give me a solution for this problem.
i want to use my math bbs with amaya quickly.
