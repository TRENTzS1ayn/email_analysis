Mystery solved.

Yes, this works.

I was having trouble having copied my disk to another (bigger) disk.

For reasons only Microsoft could understand, moving the disk caused
the shortcuts to move with them, so I was launching the version installed
on the old disk (and therefore was using a different Thot directory).
