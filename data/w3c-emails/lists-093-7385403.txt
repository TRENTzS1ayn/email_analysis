Hi Bob,

If you have at least 32 Mb RAM, then your problem is due to 
HOME environment variable. What you have to do is:

1. open a command prompt
2. type: set HOME=
3. start amaya not by clicking the amaya icon but by
   executing amaya from the command prompt.
  
suppose that you've installed Amaya in the directory C:\Program Files
C:\> set HOME=
C:\> cd Program Files\Thot\Windows\bin
C:\Program Files\Thot\Windows\bin> amaya


You can also create a batch file amaya.bat

@echo off
set HOME=
C:\Program Files\Thot\Windows\bin\amaya

Ramzi.
