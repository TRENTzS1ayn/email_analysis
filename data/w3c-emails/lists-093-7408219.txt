Hi,

I have tried to compile the html2thot.c with the follwing steps:

cd Thot
mkdir osf
../configure
cd osf/amaya
gmake html2piv

and I got the following error messages:

gmake[1]: Entering directory `/home/staff/bkho/Thot/osf/amaya'
gcc  -DSTANDALONE -I. -I.. -I../../thotlib/include -I../../amaya

I check the source, I find that these variables are declared only if
the program is complied withiout the flag STANDALONE. As I am
not familiar with the program, please advise me how to modifiy
the program.

Thank you in advacne for your help.

Regards,

Fiona
