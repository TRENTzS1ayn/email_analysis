When I untarred the OSF binary distribution right now, I found that most files
were not readable by group or world.  I don't think this is how you
want to make a binary distribution...

In any case, it seems to run on my new Alpha (running 4.0D). BTW, you are
welcome to an account on the system if you want it.  Dunno where
you are getting your binary bits these days for Digital UNIX.
