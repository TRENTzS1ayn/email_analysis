     I'm in a similar position (having a Alpha with RH 5.0) and not
being able to build cleanly.  I have seen comments (such as the
one below) about compatibility between OSF/1 (now Digital UNIX) and
Alpha Linux binaries.

     Is it possible that the Amaya OSF/1 binary was linked statically
or that a statically linked binary could easily be made available?

They will run if linked statically (with -non_cached flag). DEC Fortran
is still far superior than anything you can get on Linux/Alpha platform.
