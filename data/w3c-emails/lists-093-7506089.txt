With Amaya...

I've figured out that double clicking a checkbox icon will set it appropriately;
But on a CVS page, I want to press the "Perform Action" button....

A double click on the "Perform Action" button, gets me a "Save as" dialog
box, rather than invoking the form...  This isn't useful :-(.  Or is there
some other magic for invoking a form?

This is on Digital UNIX, with your latest binary distribution
