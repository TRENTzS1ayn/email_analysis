I have integrated you bug fix. Thanks

The release amaya-src-1.2a is a core release and doesn't include kaffe and 
java code.
Releases amaya-java-src are done by Daniel Veillard who is in charge to adapt 
the
java interface to each new core release.
Today amaya-src and amaya-java-src have 2 releases of difference and you have 
to use
release 1.1c if you need the Java interface. You cannot use amaya 1.2a C code 
with
amaya 1.1c Java code.

Yes. It's clear now.
