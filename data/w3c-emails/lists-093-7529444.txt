Let me go through what I did, again: (sorry I may have missed out some
important stuff earlier):
(1) I tried unzipping the amaya-java source and compiling, didn't work.
(2) I tried unzipping the amaya-src and compiling, didn't work.
(3) Some time later, I tried amaya-java again. Didn't work.
(4) Then I did make clean, and unzipped amaya-src into the *same*
    directory (Thot). Maybe that matters?
(5) I did ../configure without java. But the problem with the makefile
    seems to be in the source Makefile.in, as I said earlier. Didn't
    work.
(6) After I fixed the makefile, it compiled fine, runs ok most of the
    time.
(7) Then I tried reconfiguring (after a make clean), with java, it
    refuses to compile.
(8) I tried the make stages one by one, as described in autoconf.html, and
    it chokes on the make kaffe step.

Hope this is of help.

Rahul.
