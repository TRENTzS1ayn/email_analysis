I don't think that returns from the W3C HTML 4 validator are easy to use for a
tool like Amaya. Validators are built for human users. Amaya detects errors
but doesn't reject wrong documents. Documents generated from scratch by Amaya 
are 
obviously correct but if they already included errors when downloaded in 
Amaya, there
is no guarantee.
