HELLO.
i cannot configure amaya.
i followed method in "configuring amaya" in Help menu.
but amaya did not worked.
it is "Magnification" in the file amaya.css.
and i cannot configure "default color"
since i don't know what i submit in "BackgroundColor" for a color.
And i cannot edit help files in amaya. why?
i want to edit help files since i want to copy text from help file 
to some file.
