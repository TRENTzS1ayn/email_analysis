Yes you can put on your amaya.css file magnification instruction
like:
 BODY { magnification : 2 }

Pay attention, the amaya.css location defers on Unix and Windows
platforms:
 This file must be located in $HOME/.amaya.css on Unix
 This file must be located in Thot/amaya/amaya.css on Windows

In $HOME/.thotrc (on Unix) and Thot/config/thot.ini on Windows) you can 
fix default colors used by the application. These colors, of course, 
can be changed by CSS rules. "BackgroundColor=white" set to white the 
default background of each window. The value can be a color name or a
RGB (#FF00DD).

> And i cannot edit help files in amaya. why?

This is normal. These pages are displayed in read only mode, so you cannot 
delete
or insert text in these pages.

You can do that: you can copy a part of the help document by using the Copy
shortcut or selecting the Copy entry in Edit menu of another window.
Another solution is to download these help pages like simple documents. These 
pages
are ponited from Thot/doc/amaya/Manual.html.
