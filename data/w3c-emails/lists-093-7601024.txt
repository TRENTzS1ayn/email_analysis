  I started working on it, unfortunately some of the internal routines
of kaffe to acces classes and methods from the C code have changed,
so the port is non-trivial.

  I guess that yes ! Tim Wilkinson didn't provide a new classes.zip for
0.10 so nothing seems to have changed in the classes interfaces. Basically
code compiled with 0.10 should still work with the 0.92 version embedded
in amaya-java.

  I need to upgrade Amaya-java version, I guess that the Amaya team is
preparing a new release of the "standard" Amaya version, I will do my best
to ship an Amaya-Java version at the same time... But it requires quite
some coding !
