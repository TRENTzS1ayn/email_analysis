Hello,
I am quite pleased to have found in Amaya a WWW-browser that finally
supports MathML. But when I tried to position text around graphics,
which works with Netscape 3.0/4.0 and Internet-Explorer 4.0, Amaya 1.2a
will not do it correctly. The alignment is either ignored or incorrect.
I use <img src="URL" align=left|right>Text and as a test example the
pages by Stefan Muenz, http://www.teamone.de/selfaktuell/.

Is this a known problem? I did not see it mentioned in the mailing list
yet. According to the above cited document, the ALIGN= feature was added
in HTML 3.2 and I thought that this is fully supported by Amaya.

Regards,
Gerald
