If I carefully select a few rows (and make sure it is just rows),
I seem to be able to delete them, but then Amaya shows a performance
bug; it takes a while for Amaya to be able to format these tables (even
on a 433MHZ alpha), and there is a delay roughly the same as an initial
delay observed for each row deleted.
