Digital UNIX 4.0D.  Amaya 1.2a.

1) When I cut and paste, I'd like Amaya to preserve the structure of what I'm
cutting and pasting...

So, for example, I copy some bold face text, but amaya does not preserve
the bold face attributes.

Similarly, if I copy some text containing a hyperlink, I'd like the hyperlink
copied as well.

2) Often the structure view does not show the text of the structure as 
I'm editing.  I have to close the structure view and reopen the structure 
view to get a corrected view of the document structure.
