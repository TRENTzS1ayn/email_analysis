That depends on your current selection. If you just select the text Amaya 
doesn't
preserve the bold, but if you select the enclosing element (SPAN or B element) 
the
bold should be preserved.

What copy function did you use?
one uses the Thot buffer (Key: Ctrl c or entry in the menu Edit)
another uses the X buffer (Key: Copy)
The first one copies the link element, but the second one copy only the text.

Yes some updates are differed. You have to finish the insertion (by a clic, a 
menu call, etc.)
to see the updating in other views. That is not a bug, it's a feature to 
optimize reaction to
each inserted character.
