Hi,

most of the time I include in my documents images that are already available
on my HTTP server. Therefore, I usually want to deactivate the "Copy Images"
function associated with the File/Save command. To achieve this, I have to
remember to select the "File/Save as" command and click on the "Copy Images"
checkbox to de-select it. Otherwise, I end up with copies of my images in
every directory where I use Amaya to edit documents.

My question is the following: is there a way I can configure Amaya to have
by default the "Copy Images" checkbox de-selected?

Thanks,

Bertrand Ibrahim.
