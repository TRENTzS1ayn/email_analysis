It seems that cpp preprocessor is not in the PATH.
You can use the following shell script in conjuction with gcc, name it cpp, 
put it in the PATH
with 755 Unix rights:
#!/bin/sh
  exec `gcc --print-prog-name=cpp` $*

The ar step needs large set of memory. You certainly need to increase the swap 
on your box.
Try the command "swap -s" to check that.
It's possible to extend the swap by creating a large file (see the command 
"mkfile") and
adding that file as available swap space. I have added this kind of swap space 
(file /tahiti/swapon) on my solaris box.
In file "/etc/vfstab" I have:
/tahiti/swapon  -       -       swap    -       no      -

Hope this helps
  Irene.
