At first, I would like to mention that Amaya is a nice piece of
work. I mainly use it as HTML-editor, because it is guaranteed
to produce HTML-4 compilant code. Still I would like to report
some problems that I found during the past weeks. I am mainly
using version 1.2a on Windows NT 4.0. I checked the mail
archive, but I didn't find other reports with the same remarks.

* Proxy use on Windows NT4.0
  When I add the following line to THOT.INI:
HTTP_PROXY=http://........... (our proxy server)
  Amaya refuses to start. Without this line, Amaya
  works fine, only I cannot conect to sites outside the
  domain through the proxy server. With the earlier Amaya
  1.2 binary distribution for Windows NT this worked fine.

* '>' or '&gt;';
  Stand-alone '>' characters in text are left as-is when
  Amaya saves it to a file. Unfortunately Word 97 treats
  this as an invalid character when reading HTML. I
  suggest to follow the HTML 4.0 recommendation, as
  described in the file charset.html:
    Authors wishing to put the "<" character in text should use "&lt;"
    (ASCII decimal 60) to avoid possible confusion with the beginning
    of a tag (start tag open delimiter). Similarly, authors should use
    "&gt;" (ASCII decimal 62) in text instead of ">" to avoid problems
    with older user agents that incorrectly perceive this as the end of
    a tag (tag close delimiter) when it appears in quoted attribute
values. 
  Word 97 is not really 'old', but it has this bug as well. And
  even worse: it happens everywhere, not only in quoted attribute
  values. When does Microsoft learn................ :-(

* Form editing inside tables.
  When adding a form element (e.g. <input>) to a page, Amaya checks if
  this element is within a <form>. If not, Amaya adds the required
<form>
  tags automatically. But in the following example this goes wrong:
  <form ....>
  <table ...>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>cel 1
        </td>
      <tr>
    <tbody>
  </table>
  </form>
  When trying to place an <input> element into cel 1, a <form> tag pair
  is added as well. This is undesired because the page already has one.

* table border
  When loading a file containing <table>'s without the border attribute,
Amaya
  automatically changes this to <table border=1>. A document table which
  orriginally has no border suddenly has.

Looking forward to the next version of Amaya, in which those problems
are hopefully solved. Thanks for the great work.
