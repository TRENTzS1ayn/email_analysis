Just thought I'd share my experience getting amaya1.2a to compile and 
run under W95..

When building for MSVC++ 5.0, follow these instrs 
beyond what's described in 

http://www.w3c.org/Amaya/User/Win-Compiling.html

All these files must be grabbed from 


ftp://opera.inrialpes.fr/pub/sources/amaya:


amaya-compil-1_2a.ZIP
amaya-src-1.2a.tar

..Extract these into the top level ( i used /amaya)

Also, extract this into /amaya/thot/windows:

amaya-Makefile-1.2.ZIP

Add this to thot/amaya/amaya.h:

#define strncasecmp _strnicmp

make a 0 length file:

/amaya/Thot/thotlib/image/win_f.h

Things will compile, but not run (amaya process blocks
in GetMessage() in interface.c and never displays a window.
It needs things which are apparently included in the
*binary* Win32 distrib, so, you'll need that too:

amaya-1.2a.exe

Let it install into the default /Program Files/Thot/,
but then copy over its contents into the source tree:

/Program Files/Thot/Icons
    Windows
    amaya
    config
    dicopar
    doc
Move to:

/amaya/thot/


Now, you'll be able to start up the locally compiled
version of amaya.exe.

..c
