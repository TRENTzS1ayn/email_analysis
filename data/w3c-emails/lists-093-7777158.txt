Surf on over to
<http://www.microsoft.com/sitebuilder/columnists/xml051198.asp>.  Amaya will
slowly fetch the base page and most of its dozens of inlines.  But not all of
them.  Eventually you're left with a status line saying something like "5
outstanding requests" and it never makes any more progresss (well, at least not
until you run out of patience after a few minutes).  At least, that's what's
happening to me, right now.  FYI, I'm behind a firewall, and my .thotrc has a
HTTP_PROXY=... line.  And I'm not on the mailing list.

Thanks,
Mike
