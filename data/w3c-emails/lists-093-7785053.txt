These are on a Digital Alpha running Digital UNIX 4.0D; but I've had
the identical experiences on Win95.

When editing a password protected page, I get to type my password N times, 
once for the base page, and once for each included image. So for: 
http://jigedit.w3.org/jg/WWW/Protocols/HTTP/Forum/Reports/Overview.html 
I get to type my password 3 or 4 times...  Even worse, it asks each time
the page is visited, even when browsing in the same area.

Needless to say, this gets boring.

I've found that it would be very desirable to have a delete column
command for tables; trying to find the non-empty cell can be quite chalenging,
or emptying all cells in a column is likewise boring.  This is an
enhancement request, rather than a bug report.

I've also found that Amaya's display of tables with almost empty columns on the
right edge is buggy. The layout  if the table does not naturally fit on the
page has columns (including non-empty columns) off the edge of the screen.
This can make it a real challenge to try to find and delete the offending 
extra cells that are forcing the table to have unwanted columns. This 
is more than slightly annoying, making it very hard to make progress (I 
eventually got my window wide enough to succeed at a layout which included 
the offending columns, but this was very hard...).
