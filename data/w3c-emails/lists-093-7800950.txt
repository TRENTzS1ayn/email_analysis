When you delete a cell, if the column includes only empty cells, the column is
automatically deleted. This is exactly what you want to do with a "delete 
column".

Amaya only adds a new column when you add a new cell in a row. If your table 
has
empty columns it's because you have created them before.
Please pay attention when you're editing a table: a return create a new cell 
and you have
to use the -> key to move to the next empty cell.
I agree that in this particular case it would be useful to have an horizontal 
scroll to
delete extra columns.
