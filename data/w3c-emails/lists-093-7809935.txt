Yes, I understand....  The way the UI works is just fine.  But read on...

With the bug in the display code causing nearly empty columns to format 
off the edge of the screen (not even accessable via the scroll bar), it 
is VERY painful to deal with getting rid of these right hand empty columns.  
I have no major problems with the table UI as it stands; it is the formatting 
bug that drives me to total distraction, as a simple mistake ends up being 
very difficult indeed to undo, since the point at which you need to type 
is no longer visible on the screen.

So while it would be nice to have a delete column feature, this is down
in the noise.  The disaster is the formatting bug, which causes it
to be almost impossible to use the UI (in fact, the only recovery under
some circumstances seems to be in the structure view; there have been times
when I've not been able to get the window wide enough to ever get the
right hand columns back on the screen).

I recommend taking amaya for a test drive on my table from hell, and add
an extra right hand column.  You won't like the result.
