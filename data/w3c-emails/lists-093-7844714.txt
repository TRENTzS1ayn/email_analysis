I managed to compile Amaya 1.2a on Linux. The only extra
steps required were the installation of lestif, and making
"cpp" available in the path. Then I discovered that
the patch I posted earlier was not enough to fix the
problem I was having (with Word 97, actually). It is
a correct patch (as far as I know), but in a libwww
function which is apparently never used by Amaya.

Here is an additional patch (attached to this mail),
which completely fixes the problem. In "Text_SGML.inc",
I would like to see a line added for the '>' character.
In "html2thot.c" this character is present, but there
seems to be a bug in line 333 for the '<' character (the
ASCII code is 60, not 62).

With this fix, every '>' character which is not used
for tag closing is saved as "&gt;", as suggested by
the HTML 4.0 specification.

Is it possible that this patch will be evaluated for
inclusion in the next release of Amaya?

Another remark. The zlib, png and jpeg libraries
distributed with Amaya are very old. Are there
any plans to upgrade them? Compare:

          Amaya includes     Most recent version
zlib        0.95                1.1.2
png         0.88                1.0.1
jpeg        6                    6b

For zlib and jpeg upgrading should be easy. There are no
incompatible changes as far as I know. For png it is a
little bit more difficult because version 0.95 introduced
a new (and much better) API. But it would be fully worth
the effort. All those libraries are available as dll's
on Windows 95/NT, and as shared libraries on UNIX
(I have them for Windows and Linux).

Thanks in advance,
