This is not an Amaya bug but a Word bug.
Anyway, if you plan to change that in Amaya, the libwww is not the right
place to do it; Amaya doesn't use this part of libwww code.
If you accept to rebuild your Amaya version the right place is in the 
source file Thot/amaya/Text_SGML.inc which lists SGML encoding translations.
We, Amaya team, don't plan to integrate this patch because other Amaya users
could disagree with that.

  Irene.
