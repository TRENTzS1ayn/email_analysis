I use Apache, which is configured to use http/put.  Works well with
netscape and works also if no authentication is required.

BTW: there is another wierdness about the authentication: It comes up
with the authentication dialog multiple times (appearently for every
pic in the page, not sure about that number).

It's an apache 1.1.3.  Too old?

Thanks for the pointer. I was looking for a command line http put tool
for a long time.
