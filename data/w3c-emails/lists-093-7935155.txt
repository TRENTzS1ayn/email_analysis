Known problem in in the version of libwww that Amaya 1.2a uses.  You could
rebuild against a more recent libwww.

Yes; that is an HTTP/1.0 server.  There is no guarantee that a PUT on
an HTTP/1.0 server will ever work; it depends on exact details of the
network  connection and the client and server implementation.  The protocol
itself is broken, and so some servers and clients try to code around the
problem.  Netscape before Version 4 is completely broken with PUT....
(I presume you are using Netscape 4).  There is no way to reliably do
PUT with HTTP/1.0, though you can make it work "most" of the time, which
is what Navigator 4 is doing...

The protocol is fixed in HTTP/1.1 (Apache 1.2 or later; 1.3 just came 
out: I recommend you install this.

Yes, send kudo's to Henrik...
