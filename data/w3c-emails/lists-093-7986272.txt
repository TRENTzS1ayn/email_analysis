Hi,

I down-loaded the Amaya  & Thot source. I want to do install my 
X-Windows system. I got error at configuring time. 

Motif includes were not found
Thot and Amaya might not compile
Edit your Option file
Now start "make all" (GNU make preferably) to build the binaries

Here i am having motif include files /usr/X/include 

Have i to put both the sources in the same directory?. How to start?

Thanks in Advance
