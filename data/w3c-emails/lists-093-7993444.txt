Hi,

I'm away from my office but I can have a look at my mail from time to time.
The standard X-Windows cut/paste will be available in the next release.
Today you have to use F6 and F8 keys on Linux (Cut an Paste keys on solaris).

The browsing of URLs is a good idea but needs some developments.
Regards
Irene
