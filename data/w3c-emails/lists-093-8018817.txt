   I think the problem that Mr. Earl was having downloading Amaya was
   probably the one I had at first. The links on
   http://www.w3.org/Amaya are not marked very clearly - it is not
   readily apparent which link to click on to get to the download
   page.

In all fairness to the webmaster, I think the links are very visible.
I did not have any trouble finding the code when I downloaded 1.2a in
March.

The current version of the page (last updated June 7) says:

    Amaya 1.2a beta public release is now available in *source code* and
    *precompiled binary* forms.

where the emphasized phrases are links.  This is seems clear enough to me.
