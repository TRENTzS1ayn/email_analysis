   Well, I didn't associated "precompiled binary" with "download this browser".


Ah!  Now I understand.  We live in different worlds.  I myself would
not have thought of different terms.  You have a point.  Different
people live in very different universes.

Amaya people:  <timrivera@geocities.com> makes a good point.  People
like me (and, obviously, people like your webmaster) provide one
audience; you may want to provide text that is meaningful to a second
audience as well.  I am not good at providing advice on this since
your existing text suits me fine.
