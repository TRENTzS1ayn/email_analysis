Not that I *mean* to be rude, but...

One would rather expect that the Amaya developers are quite busy
enough, don't you agree?  And given that Amaya is clearly "advertised"
to be an experimental project with which to "play around" and develop
new Web technologies and techniques, don't you think that maybe it's
not too awful much to expect that folks who download it are at least
marginally aware of the terms used in computer technology?  This is not
meant to be a slam against either you or the person to whom you
responded, but more a reminder of what Amaya is purported to be.  At
least the last time I looked.

Amaya is not strictly a browser, btw.  It's an more an editor that 
happens to be able to function in a browser-like capacity.


Regards,
Jim
