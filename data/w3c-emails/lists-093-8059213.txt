I figured someone would say something like that. If I were a programmer,
I'm sure "precompiled binary" would make perfect sense to me. But I'm not.
I'm just a regular Web page builder, who happened to hear that Amaya
supposedly supports a good deal of HTML 4.0. That's what captured my
interest in the program.

You are most definitely correct. BTW, is it just me, or does Amaya display
graphics as if they were uploaded in ASCII format? Or does Amaya just
support the 216 browser-safe color palette?
