I hope I am not wasting your time with this one, but I have searched
for over a week looking for a solution to this problem before posting
here.

My system is an Amiga 4000/040 running Linux 2.0.33, XFree86 version
3.3.1.  I have sucessfully installed and am using Lesstif 0.81.

I have attempted to install amaya several times trying different
things with no avail.  I found that I have to make a couple
changes in order to get as far as I have.  I have to put a link
to the config file in my /var/tmp directory (that is where I
installed the source tree).  I also have to create links in the
/var/tmp/Thot/amaya directory to the grammar files in
/var/tmp/Thot/batch.  But the following is the problem that
blows me away.  I assume it is telling me that it can't find
HTML.STR, but it is in the /var/tmp/Thot/amaya directory, which
is where it is looking for it.

I "touch" the *.A and *.S files in that directory to rebuild that
file and still get the same results.

I am including the entire output of "make all" after touching the
*.A and *.S files.

I am pretty sure it is something stupid, but as I mentioned before,
I have attempted to solve this my other means before coming here.

Thanks,
Kenton Groombridge
