I think there was a problem when you downloaded the source tarfile or during
compiling process.
Normally you don't need to create any link, but you need to follow
carefully the autoconf instructions (see http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Autoconf.
html):

1) install source code in the /var/tmp/ directory if you want

2) make a target directory 
   cd /var/tmp/Thot
   mkdir obj
   cd obj
   ../configure

3) check Options file in directory obj

4) build everything in directory obj
   make all

Happy new year
  Irene.
