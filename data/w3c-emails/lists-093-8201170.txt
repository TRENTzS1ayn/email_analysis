  There is definitely a problem with configure scripts on BSD,
we already mentioned this in this list, see

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-amaya/1997OctDec/0028.html

for my previous answer to this kind of problem (basically try
to rebuild the configure script on your platform using the BSD
version of autoconf).
