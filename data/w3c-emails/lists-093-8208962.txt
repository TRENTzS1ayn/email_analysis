  I have just checked and the GRM files are definitely available
in the amaya-java-src-1.1c.tar.gz tarball.

  Without any output from the failing command issued by the make
process, it's quite difficult to understand what's really happening.
Which command, issued from which directory shows up the error ?
Could you check that the Makefile generated in the $object/batch
directory doesn't have any trivial flaw, that's where GRM dependencies
are needed. Also considering that the Amaya build is a multi step
process check for earlier errors.
