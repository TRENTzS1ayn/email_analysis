Hi ,

I have been browsing through Amaya code and LibthotEditor code. I am

not able to find the "Bitblk"/Bits manipulation functionality in Amaya

can anyone help.

1. I am trying to create Window using amaya Thot libraries and am interested

in dumping Bitmap of current amaya window to a file or memory.

2. Also will like to load any Bitmap file (e.g <fn>.bmp) file onto amaya.

We do have functions as "LoadImage" in libthot files.

Any suggestions/comments will be highly appreciated.

Thanks in Advance

Cheers !!!

Suhas
