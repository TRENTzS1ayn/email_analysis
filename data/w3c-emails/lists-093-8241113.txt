From Hassan <sultan@eig6.unige.ch>:

Hi,
Could you please tell me if there's a simple solution for
changing the double-click and single-click actions so that
following a link is activated by a single click.
Is a change in "void DoubleClick..." enough or are there
other problems ?

Thank you

Hassan
