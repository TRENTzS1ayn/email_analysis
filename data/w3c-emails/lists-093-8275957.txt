I recently downloaded amaya.
I REALLY like the overall concepts and goals.
Particularily browse/edit and "make book".

However, I find it insufficient for my use primarily because of the lack
of support for both scripting and frames.

Any idea as to when either or both of those HTML 4.0 features will make
their way into amaya???

Thanks
