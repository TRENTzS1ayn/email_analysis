There is no function in ThotLib allowing to 
load ".bmp" files. However you you can add
such functionality. The onlything to do is
to identify the bmp file and to use the
Windows API to load and display bitmaps.

1. Get the bits of the bitmap from the ".bmp" file,
2. Use one of the functions in Windows API To create
   a bitmap (CreateBitmap, CreateCompatibleBitmap, etc.)
   See WIN_MakeImage function in gifhandler.c file.
