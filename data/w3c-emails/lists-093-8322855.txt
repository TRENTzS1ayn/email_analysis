Dear Alonzo,

It seems you miss previous errors during the make process.
You need to have created a obj directory (you the choice for the name: linux,
solaris, xxx, obj etc.) as explained in http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Autoconf.h
tml
and you have to go into this directory to start:
../configure
Could you check that the obj/Options file is correct.
Amaya build is a multi step process, so you probably miss earlier errors.

  Irene.
