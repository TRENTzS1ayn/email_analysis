Hi,

I think it's not a good idea to move files and change Mahefiles.
.GRM files and  HTML.S are included in the source tar file. If they are not 
found,
you have downloaded a bad tar file (perhaps you forgot the bin indicator in ftp
process, perhaps you have had not enough space, etc.).
Before publishing tar files and information setting how to compile Amaya, we 
have
experimented the procedure.
Every time someone have had trouble building Amaya, it was due to a bad make or
sed tool.
Regards
  Irene.
