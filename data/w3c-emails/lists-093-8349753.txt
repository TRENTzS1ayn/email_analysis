Dear Amaya developers,

we (Euromath Support Center people from Bratislava) are interested in XML
implementation in Amaya. Would you be so kind and answer us following
questions:

1. Do you plan to implement full XML? That means implementation of (or
including of existing) XML document compiler and DTD compiler. Not only
implementation of particular XML applications (e.g. MathML).

2. Do you plan to extend Amaya by facility to use more fonts for display and
printing? Not only Times, Courier, Helvetica and Symbol, but all
(user-defined) appropriate fonts on server/machine?
This question is related also to CSS support.

3. XML assume to exploit ISO/IEC 10646 character set (with UTF-8/16 encoding)
for character references. Thus, multilingualism is supported by XML. Do you
plan to support this feature of XML? This also will need to define many
different keyboard mappings and to define virtual keyboards (for Latin 1,
Latin 2, Cyrillic, Math Symbols,...).

4. Can you give us a closer description of (proposed) XML implementation in
Amaya from technical point of view? E.g. how you want to parse DTD (into S
schema; resp. also T schema saving a document into DTD coincided XML form,
or not???), which features of XML will be implemented and which will not ...

5. What time horizon do you have for XML implementation in Amaya? What is
the current status of this work?


Answers to all above questions are VERY IMPORTANT for us!

We want to re-implement the Euromath System (SGML structural editor) into
the Thot Library and to extend the Thot Editor. We support SGML now, and XML
implementation placed into the "future" SW platform of Euromath is essential
for the re-implementation process.

There is of course also opportunity to extend features of Amaya and Thot
Library. Some work on XML implementation and other functional extensions of
Amaya can be done by our team. Of course, there is necessity to co-operate
with you. But we need to know, what to do and how - we need to plan our work.
That was the main reason for this e-mail.

Thank you in advance,

                                Radovan Cervenka.


P.S. I've used www-amaya@w3.org because I did not find another e-mail
contact on Amaya developer team. Is there any other, more appropriate?
