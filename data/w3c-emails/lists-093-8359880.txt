Hi amaya people,

I tested amaya 1.1c (amaya-solaris2-1.1c.tar.gz) on solaris 2.4 and the
following happend. I looked for a document where the supported version were
mentioned but could not find it.

wssft064:~ % uname -a
SunOS wssft064 5.4 Generic_101945-34 sun4m sparc
wssft064:~ % Thot/solaris2/bin/amaya
ld.so.1: Thot/solaris2/bin/amaya: fatal: relocation error: symbol not found: index: referenced in Thot/solaris2/bin/amaya
Killed

Testing on solaris 2.6 was ok.
