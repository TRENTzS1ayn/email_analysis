We plan to support specific XML DTDs like MathML and free XML documents
(the XML DTD is unknown). This is not a full XML implementation.

Yes. We have added in next future Amaya release the support for ISO Latin-2.

It's an important development. I don't know when the work will be
done, but of course we will start the job.

I can only describe our plan for next 6 months:
 - support of MathML and perhaps another interesting XML DTD (to be defined
   very soon). In these cases, S and P schemas will be hand-written.
 - definition of a generic S schema and its corresponding P schema
   to match unknown XML tags in existing documents.
 - creation of an XML parser which will allow us to build pieces of
   documents according to one of the three XML structure (MathML, XX and 
GENERIC).
 - a piece of code which will allow us to generate XML documents. I'm not
   sure we will use a T schema for that.

We don't have precise plan after the next 6 months. Many things can be
changed. For example, we hope that we will have a language to describe
XML element layout at that time.

This is a good news. We need expertise in fonts or symbols management or
DTD compilers.
