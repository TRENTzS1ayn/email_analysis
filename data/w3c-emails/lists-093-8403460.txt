If you use amaya-java version.
I'm not sure that there is an HTTP API. Please contact Yves.Lafon@w3.org
for that (He is the person in charge of Java HTTP classes used in Amaya).
But, I know that an API is available to manipulate HTML documents.

Only at start-up in C version. In amaya-java version, it'd be possible to 
change UI on the fly.

Yes, but only on Unix platforms (including Linux) at the moment.

I don't think.
