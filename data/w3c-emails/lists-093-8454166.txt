  In Amaya-Java it is possible to add on the fly some specific Java code which
will be triggered upon the occurent of some event. Check for example
  w3c/amaya/applets/DemoContent.java
in the Amaya-Java sources.

  I guess that the code triggering actions in the Thot library is scattered
in a large number of file, however the central dispatching point is in
  thotlib/dialogue/callback.c
There is no general dispatching of all events to some Java code since it
would probably be too slow (I didn't tried however).
