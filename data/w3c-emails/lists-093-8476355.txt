Hi.

I have downloaded the binary code and it can run it's executable.

But when I access pages with images and colours, somehow, the images are
distorted and doesn't look pretty and some texts are too small to be
read.Is there something wrong with the browser resolution or am I doing
it wrongly?

Please help

Thank you.


Norliza
