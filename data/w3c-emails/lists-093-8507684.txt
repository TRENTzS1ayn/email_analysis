I am having basically the same trouble with Win95 version.
When I attempt to launch Amaya nothing happens. I am
running 16-bit color 1024x768.

Also, is there anyone who has ported Amaya-Java to Win95
successfully? As it looks I'd have to run Linux to work with
this version, is this true? ...it would be great if someone had a
Symantec Cafe project defined for this thing! :-)

Regards,

Paul.
