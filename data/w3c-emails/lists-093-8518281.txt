  Basically, the problem with an Amaya-Java port to Windows is
to get a stable version of Kaffe for the Windows environment.
There is three way to attack the problem:

  - Do a direct port using MS developement environment, someone
    already tried (there were some messages in the kaffe mailing
    list, check http://rufus.w3.org/tools/Kaffe/messages/1368.html
    and related messages).

  - Do an indirect port using the CygWin32 Posix environment for
    Windows, note owever that embedding the library from Cygnus
    restrict the Copyright on the resulting binaries (CygWin32 is
    GPL, not LGPL). See 
       http://rufus.w3.org/tools/Kaffe/messages/1515.html
    for building Kaffe on Windows

  - Wait for a fully supported Kaffe on Windows

  I have tried the second one in the past but at that time Amaya on
Windows was enough of a mess to not attempt to complicate it further.

The other remaining tricky steps in getting Amaya-Java on Windows are:
  - integrating the Kaffe scheduling kernel and Windows events handling
    model. On Unix, the main Amaya application is launched as one of
    the Kaffe threads ...
  - changing the makefiles to produces the C <-> Java stubs, the code
    should be fairly portable, but the problem is to regenerate the
    stubs (problem similar to the regeneration of Amaya schemas on
    Windows platform).

  So it's definitely not easy, but it's certainly feasible, the problem
is lack of resources, I can't handle it, but I will for sure help people
really interested in doing the job !
