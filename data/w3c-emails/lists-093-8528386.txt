Hi ,

Need Help!!!

I am trying to identify certain key mapping for Amaya browser on
WindowsNT.
I know these mappings will be implemented in future releases.
Does anyone know where to start/how to go about providing Keymappings.

Example :

 cntl <key> C : Should close the browser ( call AmayaClose)

 <BACKSPACE> key : Should call "GotoPreviosHTML"

 <PageUP> key  : Should call "TtcPageUp"

 <Home> key     : Should load the Home Page in thot.ini file..

I will really appreciate any response .

Thanks in Advance

Suhas
