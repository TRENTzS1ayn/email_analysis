Hi ,

Does any one know the following Translation :


How does Amaya take care of Links in HTML documents.I looked at
html2thot.c
 at HTMLParse function and cannot figure out how "HREF" is handled and
how can I get the co-ordinates of HREF (i.e x,y,width,height) of the
link on Amaya Home page.

Any Suggestions.

Thanks in Advance

Suhas.
