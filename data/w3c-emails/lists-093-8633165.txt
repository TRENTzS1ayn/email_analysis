Great !

This file prints toolkit error messages. you can change it if you want.

From time to time we move functions from one module to another to avoid these 
imbrications.
Normally all modules "edit" (like EDITimage.c or HTMLedit.c) must containt 
only edit functions and
should be removed for a browser.

I don't know how to avoid that with Motif and Windows. But Amaya refuses to 
change
the document title when it receives the callback from Motif (on Return key).

It's a bug.

In files $HOME/.thotrc
ReadOnlyColor=Black

See NOTE 2

We need to add a Thot event to do that. It'll be available in a future 
version; not the next one
because it's too late (we plan to do the public release next week).
