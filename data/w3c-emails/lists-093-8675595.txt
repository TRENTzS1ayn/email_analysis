My modifications cause a problem which I don't know how to resolve:
It isn't possible anymore to write in the fields of a form.
And it isn't due to the pages being in Read-Only mode, because when I
remove the TtaSetDocumentAccessMode(doc,0), the problem is still here.
It isn't the double click --> simple click modification either.
So is there a relation between the form and the menus or anything like
that(some SetToggleItem and others had to be removed in the file init.c
in GetHTMLDocument because the menus didn't exist anymore) ?

Thanks for you help
