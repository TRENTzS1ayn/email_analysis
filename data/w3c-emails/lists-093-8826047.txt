Thanks for your comments.

Horizontal scrolling is considered as an extension for a future
release.

In that particular case, the anchor element <a name="bulverism"> is not
closed by a </a> tag.  Amaya considers that the anchor applies to all
following elements until it encounters another <a> tag that is properly
closed.

Another problem with anchors in the documents you mention is that they
often appear in an invalid context.  The HTML 4.0 DTD (http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/sgml/dtd.html), as well as 
previous HTML
DTDs, state that anchors are inline elements: they can only appear in
block elements such as paragraphs, headings, list items, etc.  In the
example below, the empty anchor named "how" should be placed within the
H3 element, not between that element and the previous UL.  When
properly placed, an empty anchor works correctly in Amaya.

To avoid any trouble, you may consider validating your pages.  See for
instance http://validator.w3.org/
