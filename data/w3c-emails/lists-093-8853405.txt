many thanks to all involved - the SGI binary now runs, For others though
I offer a word of advice:

libsocket.so is part of the eoe.sw.svr4net, which is not installed by
default - you will need to install this get amaya to run

Now: to a question about printing. I have edited Thot/config/thot.ini
to contain the following: (since SGI's use lp not lpr )

THOTPRINT=lp -c -dprintername -nnbex -trealname

However, the print command gived the error:
'lp -c -dprintername -nnbex -trealname -#1 -Tintro.html' as being an
invalid command (which it is). 

It looks as though the lpr commands are hardcoded somewhere - any
suggestions anyone ??
