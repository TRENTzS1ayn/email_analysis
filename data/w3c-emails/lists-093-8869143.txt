Hi,
The compilation and the execution of amaya under MS-Windows95 is OK, I am
glad!!


Could you tell me the entry point in the source of Amaya?
And I can't debug the source, I obtain the following message of Microsoft
developper Studio:
c:\users\thot\win95\bin\amaya.exe does not contain debugging onformation.
Could you help me?

Best regards 
siwar
