Hi Ramzi ,

I am building Amaya 1.2 on Windows NT .

I am able to compile/link Amaya.

1. I cannot bring up the executable

I copied *.PRS *.TRA etc files to $THOTDIR/amaya directory as you
mentioned earlier.

However the executable runs fine when run from the Binary source
enviornment (downloaded from web).

2. Keyboard functionality :

    In the binary version downloaded from web, Keyboard functionality
does not work

    and so is the case with newly generated executable.

Thanks in Advance
Suhas
