Hi,

[I'm *not* subscribed to the mailing list at the moment--I have too
 many projects already in the works.  I just wanted to take a quick
 look at Amaya to see what it was like.]

Environment:

    Amaya 1.2 binary distribution from ftp.w3.org 
    Sun Solaris 2.5.1 (with patches) on Sparc-20/712 
    TIS Gauntlet firewall

When browsing, attempting to access http://home.msen.com/~jimsun/
results in multiple error messages of the form:

    **ERROR** opening http://home.msen.com/~jimsun/<...>

The same for various specific pages at Jimsun.

Subsequent attempts to access other sites results in an error message
from the firewall to the effect that the HTTP-GW proxy server is unable
to "find any server information."  Quitting and restarting Amaya
"cures" the latter problem.  Visiting http://www.msen.com results in
the same thing.  And so does http://www.w3.org!  I bounced between
several other sites and did not experience this.  So it appears that
whatever Amaya doesn't like about some of these servers is causing it
"permanent" grief.

Ironically, the one site (Jimsun) has been validated with the w3c
validator, Web Site Garage, and CAST:Bobby.  I rather think it
shouldn't be giving Amaya trouble :-).

Various versions of Navigator, IE, and HotJava have no problems (at
least of *this* nature!) with any of these sites--from either side of 
the aforementioned firewall.

Sorry, I do not have time to debug this at this time.  Just thought
y'all might want to know that something's up, here.  (Tho I *will*
admit to curiosity as to what's happening--wish I had time to pursue it
:-(.)

Regards,
Jim
