Hello,

The AIX binary distribution does not seem to have the registry file or
.thotrc file.

Running the executable gets the following errors:

$ amaya               
exec(): 0509-036 Cannot load program amaya because of the following
errors:
        0509-023 Symbol XrmDestroyDatabase in ksh is not defined.
