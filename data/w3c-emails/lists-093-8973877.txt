I'm attempting to compile amaya on a machine running NetBSD 1.3. Configure
complains that it can't find Thot sources although they appear to be
present (I downloaded the file amaya-src-1.2.tar.gz, and the associated web
page claims that the Thot source tree is included. After the configuration
step, the Makefiles are all empty.  Any suggestions?
