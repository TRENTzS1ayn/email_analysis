  There is known problem with the configure script execution on some
BSD setup, this has been discussed before on this list. The problem
is probably related to sed(1), as explained previously:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-amaya/1997OctDec/0028.html

  Try to get GNU sed, remove the config.cache and rerun configure it
may solve the problem !
