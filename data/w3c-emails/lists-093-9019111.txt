Using latest Win95 version:  Editing in Body section works OK but edits
in "HEAD" section give weird results.

The alternate view is a very promising salvo in the war against
inaccessibility and I hope Irene and Daniel are exultant at the chance
to use this section of the amaya code as an example of what any decent
web authoring tool might contain for the benefit of authors trying to
find out what it's like to view their site in a text-only version.
