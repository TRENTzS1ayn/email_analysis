Did I miss something?  Amaya is being developed to be a
test bed for current and new technologies, correct?
In my tests, I wish to take an existing HTML and perhaps
enhance the page by adding a background image.  I would
wish it to be added to the body tag.  Amaya adds style sheet
code and does not put it in the body tag.  Not cool!  I don't
(in this test) want any statements added to the HTML other
than BACKGROUND="img.gif" . . . in the body tag.
