To:www-amaya@w3.org

has anyone worked out a way to IMPORT text files to amaya.

- I can't cut and past between X-windows
- Amaya won't let me open a non html file
- if i put '<html><pre>' at the start of the file i can maintain the
  formatting, but it is impossible to transform this pre-formatting
  back to <p> markups.

given that HTML is a 'markup language' and i have text that i want to
mark up, there theoretically is a solution.

anyone have any suggestions ??
