Just by loading the file. Amaya detects that is a text file.

By default the following keys are attached to CopyToClipboard:
- L6 (Copy key on left side of the Sun keyboards)
- F6

By default the following keys are attached to PasteFromClipboard:
- L8 (Paste key on left side of the Sun keyboards)
- F8

You can change these options by copying the Thot/config/amaya.keyboard file
into $HOME/amaya.keyboard and edit it (see Configuring Amaya in the help menu)

Did you try to select the PRE by using ESC key and select the entry Transform
in menu Special ?

Amaya is a structured editor and not a text editor. So you cannot edit markups
with but you have to use commands to change element types.
