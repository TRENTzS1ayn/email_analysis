Quick question: (please reply to self)

I was wondering if it were possible to use some part of the Amaya java library to JUST represent the layout of the HTML page.  I am looking for a data structure that takes in HTML and provides an interface to how the HTML should be layed out on a page.  For example, if I input a page with two images inside one row of a table, I want the data structure to be able to tell me that these two images are next to each other.  Is this possible with the Amaya library?
