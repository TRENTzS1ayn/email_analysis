Has this question been answered and I just missed it? I also modified amaya for DEC alpha and Solaris 2.6 to remove
the editing functions and to enable single-click selection. Everything works fine except I can no longer enter text into
forms anymore. Single clicking to select radio buttons, checkboxes and submit buttons all work fine, just the text
fields act like read only areas. Anyone have a guess?
