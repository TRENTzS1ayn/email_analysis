Hi,

I tried -and in the end succeeded- to compile Amaya 1.2 on a Sun SS10 running
Solaris 2.5.1.

Although /Gnu/bin is in the PATH variable before /usr/ccs/bin, I still need
to run 'make CC=gcc all' in order to get the stuff compiled with gcc instead
of cc (which fails, by the way).

Further, I had to add /usr/ccs/lib to the PATH variable in order for
cpp to be found.

Is this normal behavior?

Richard.
