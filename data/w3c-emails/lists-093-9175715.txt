Hi,

Information about how to build Amaya on Windows platforms is available
in the www-amaya mailing list archives.

TO BUILD AMAYA ON WINDOWS, YOU NEED TO DOWNLOAD ADDITIONAL
FILES FROM:
ftp://opera.inrialpes.fr/pub/sources/amaya/amaya-compil-1.2.ZIP

You have to put Amaya sources and amaya-compil-1.2.ZIP in the same
directory and then
unzip them.

If you are using MSVC++ 5.0 you can also download the new Makefiles
allowing to
build the whole application (one pass) :
ftp://opera.inrialpes.fr/pub/sources/amaya/amaya-Makefile-1.2.ZIP
instead of compiling each library and the amaya application.
