I did not have any problems getting amaya to run, however I thought I should
report a bug I noticed.

My copy of amaya is installed within the Program Files directory, and when
trying to load any html file from the amaya directory (such as the help files),
the location box always truncates the file url at the first space. 

I know spaces are not allowed in URL's in general, but I think that the file://
protocol needs to be treated seperately.
