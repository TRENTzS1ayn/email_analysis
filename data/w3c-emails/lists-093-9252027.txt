I am running a similar system and have experienced the same problem.  I am
running a Pentium 166 MHz with 64MB SDRAM, 7 GB disk space, 1 GB free, 24
bit color 1024x768, Windows version 4.01.970 (Win95 OSR 2.1 plus updates).
I can't view more than two or three pages without the system dying.  I start
at 80% free, dropping down to about 13% before the system grinds to a halt
and starts issuing Resource warnings.  It starts issuing an unending string
of error messages.  The only recovery is to hard reset the system.  I had
just noticed this several days ago, as I haven't used Amaya for a few
months.  I don't recall any problems when I first installed Amaya several
months before.  I used it for several hours one evening after installing.
The only major difference between now and then is the RAM.  I was running
32MB 70ns FPM, now I am running 64MB 12ns SDRAM.  The only other changes
relate to various peripherals that I have installed.
