Hi,

This problem is related to Win95 (it's not the case if you use Winnt).
I'm working on that.

Thank you for your bug report.

>bit color 1024x768, Windows version 4.01.970 (Win95 OSR 2.1 plus updates).
>I can't view more than two or three pages without the system dying.  I start

>The only major difference between now and then is the RAM.  I was running
