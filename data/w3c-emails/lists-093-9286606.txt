This is correct.

This is OK.

I see. You have to remove editing functions in the amaya.keyboard.
Remove lines:
<Key>Delete:    TtcDeleteSelection()
<Key>Return:    TtcCreateElement()
<Key>L6:        TtcCopyToClipboard()
<Key>L8:        TtcPasteFromClipboard()
<Key>F6:        TtcCopyToClipboard()
<Key>F8:        TtcPasteFromClipboard()
Ctrl <Key>Space:        TtcInsertChar("\240")
Ctrl <Key>d:    TtcDeleteSelection()
Ctrl <Key>w:    TtcCutSelection()
Ctrl <Key>y:    TtcPaste()

Of course, no.
