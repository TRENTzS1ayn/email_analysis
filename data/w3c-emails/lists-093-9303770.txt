     I have compiled and installed Amaya 1.2 on Solaris 2.5.1 using gcc 
     2.7.2.3.f.1 and am seeing a number of odd behaviors.  I'll stick to 
     just one for this post, to be sure this is the right place for this.
     
     I am having great difficulty editing the Title of an HTML page 
     (created from scratch by Amaya).  Once I get past the Motif annoyance 
     of having to have the cursor over the field I am trying to type in, I 
     can type in the Title field of the Formatted_view window, but the 
     changes do not show up in the Structure_view window, nor do they get 
     saved.  Currently, making the changes in the Structure_view window 
     works.  (I thought there was a period of time a few days ago where I 
     could only type one or two characters at a time, and then had to click 
     on the spot again before typing another character or two.)
     
     If this is a motif configuration issue - please just point me to the 
     right docs, or at least where to look for them :-( 
     
     Also - for the next release, could I suggest/request that some of the 
     associated docs (e.g., configuration) which are currently available as 
     web pages at w3c.org, be included in the distribution?  This might 
     save some frantic hunting.
     
     Thanks
