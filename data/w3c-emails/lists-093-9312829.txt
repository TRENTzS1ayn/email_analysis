Yes, you have reached the right forum for this kind of question.

When you have made some changes in the Title field of the Formatted_view,
just hit the return key to validate the changes.  This field works exactly
in the same way as the Address field, which is above: when the return key
is hit, Amaya takes into accound the edits you have made.

This is explained in the on-line documentation, in the last section of
