I know, it's annoying. But at the moment, you need to enter the text within 
the 
Motif form and finish by a Return. Without the Return Amaya doesn't receive
the new Title contents. It's why the new Title is not displayed in the

Yes, it is. The right doc is the "Motif Programmer's Reference".
If you solve the problem before us, please send us the patch.

A large part of it is available through the help menu.
What page do you suggest to add ?
