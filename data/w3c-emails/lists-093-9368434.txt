Just look at your source file and delete the stange </body> tag line 56.
Amaya will then display your page much better.  I don't know how
NN or IE interpret that tag, but when Amaya encounters it, it
considers that the document's body is closed and all the rest is
processed as if it would be the body of another page in the same
window...

You could also delete lines 67 to 73, which do not make sense and
can be disturbing for some browsers.

This page has some other errors. You could be interested in using
a validator to make sure that the pages you post on your Web site
are interpreted the same way by any browser.  Have a look at

   http://validator.w3.org

Hope it helps,

Vincent.
