To:www-amaya@w3.org

The verifier validator.w3.org for 4.0 strict requires

  ... HREF="prog.cgi?a=b&amp;b=c" ...

instead of

  ... HREF="prog.cgi?a=b&b=c" ...

However amaya doesn't undo &amp; and therefore can't
follow the first (required) form and can only handle
the second.


Is there a plan a foot to bring the verifier and the
amaya program into agreement on this issue?
