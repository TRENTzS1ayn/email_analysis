All your problems come from one mistake: you didn't create the target subtree 
to compile.
Please restart the process:
1) Install your source code tree
2) Create a subtree and launch the configure
cd Thot
mkdir obj
cd obj
../configure
make all

It seems that the Autoconf page was not clear, I've changed it.
Regards
  Irene.
