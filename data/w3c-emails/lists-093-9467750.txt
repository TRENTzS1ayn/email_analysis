We've done some progress concerning XML support in Amaya. We're experimenting
a 2D graphics XML DTD and we plan to demonstrate it at WWW'7 conference.
Concerning CSS1 we want to redo the work because we are not happy with the
current implementation. For XSL it's too early to say something interesting.
