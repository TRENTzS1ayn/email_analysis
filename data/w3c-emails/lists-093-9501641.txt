Hi, 

I'm able to build Amaya under NT and have it run under debug environment.
However, it crashed when using a proxy server. This is how it crashed:

call stack:
            HTTPCleanup -> HTNet_delete -> HTNet_executeAfterAll ->
            HTNetCall_executeAfter -> AHTLoadTerminate_handler

What happened is: "request" pointer has been freed at the call:

            HTTPCleanup -> HTNet_delete -> HTNet_executeAfterAll ->
            terminate_handle -> ProcessTerminateRequest(me) 

in the loop at HTNet.c:  HTNetCall_executeAfterAll:
         
         ...
         ret = (*pres->after)(request, response, pres->param, status)
         if(ret != HT_OK) break;
         ...
And the second call causes access violation.

Well, I think there must be some setup wrong on my build.

Anyone has quick answer ? 

Thanks !!
