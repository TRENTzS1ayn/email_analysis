Hi,

I have been very interested in Amaya since I discovered the "make book",
"table of content" and "numbered links" features. I teach various courses
and most of my course material is on-line. To give printouts to my 
students, I have been using until now the Unix version of Mosaic 2.7b5 
because it allowed to print Web documents with the URLs of embedded links
as footnotes. Unfortunately, Mosaic doesn't support HTML 3.2 or higher.

So, recently, I started using Amaya to print my course material and
discovered the following problems:

- in the print function, if a table doesn't fit completely on the same
  page, one part of the table will be on two pages, overlapping the footer
  of the current page and/or the header of the next page. For an example,
  see http://cuisung.unige.ch/prod/Link.orig.html for the HTML source and
  http://cuisung.unige.ch/prod/Link.orig.ps.gz for the resulting Postscrit.

  To work around this problem, I had to split each table into multiple
  one row tables, using the width attribute to force the same cell 
  width in each column of every one-row table.

- in the print function, when the "numbered links" option is
  activated, the table of links in the Postscript file is shifted
  far too much to the right, except for the first line, and sometimes a few
  other lines that are placed correctly. Strangely enough, the elements that
  are shifted too much to the right are actually all shifted by 442, which
  is the page width. The Postscript file mentioned above shows this problem
  on its third page.

  The only workaround I found was to actually edit the Postscript file
  manually, to substract 442 from the horizontal coordinates of most objects
  in the list of links :-(

Peace,

Bertrand Ibrahim.
