Hi Bertrand,

We are about to make a new release of Amaya.  Alas, it does not fix all
problems, but there are some significant improvements.  For instance
the following problem you experienced when printing links should be fixed:

> - in the print function, when the "numbered links" option is
>   activated, the table of links in the Postscript file is shifted
>   far too much to the right, except for the first line, and sometimes a few
>   other lines that are placed correctly. Strangely enough, the elements that
>   are shifted too much to the right are actually all shifted by 442, which
>   is the page width.

Best regards,

Vincent.
