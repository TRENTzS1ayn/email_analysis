Windows 95:

1) Selecting text using the mouse seems difficult....  Often I'll move 
the mouse while selecting text and the highlighted area is not updated 
(particularly if I move the mouse slowly), nor is the text selected.  
This makes it very hard to get the text you want reliably.

2) Double click on a word that is not a link should select that word. 

3) Double click on a word and moving the mouse selects a region by words.

4) I've come to like the shift/extend UI found in windows. (where
you hold the shift key down and can extend from the insertion point to
select text (either with the mouse or with the arrow keys).  This is often
very nice when you don't want to move your hands to the mouse, or want 
fine character by character control.

I just published my first issues list.

FYI, here's the report from the validator on the result from Amaya
