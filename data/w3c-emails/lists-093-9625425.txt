hello,

just fetched the new amaya version, but yesterdays problem was'nt
solved:-(

I have some URL's which are redirected. The following sequences
gives strange results with amaya (while working with netscape).

1) Request a url like http://host.domain.tld/something/?Clone

2) Answer:

HTTP/1.0 301 Moved permanetly
Location: /elsewhere/

3nescape) Correctly fetchs http://host.domain.tld/elsewhere/
          and displays it.

3amaya) displays http://host.domain.tld/something/?Clone/
        in the URL field and shows an empty document.

Any fix?

/Jerry

PS: Unfortunatly I can't give an URL to test against, because there's
a NT-hosted nameserver in the way which seems not to be able to handle
SOA-serials (I start to love M$ :-{=) And the next provider didn't
manage to change our nameserver to the new host.

If you want to test it anyway, ask your named to forward to
194.122.13.159 then you will be able to test it with
http://public.compot.com/WrapBit/
you'll be told to fetch .../?Clone URL's at many places from the app
docs.
