In HTML 3.2, the only valid values for valign are top, middle, and bottom
(http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html32#table)
baseline has been added in HTML 4.0 (http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/).
The current version of Amaya is not yet fully 4.0 compliant.
We plan to add more 4.0 features in the next release.

In HTML 3.2 the only valid values for shape are rect, circle, and poly
(not polygon). In HTML 4.0, default has been added, but polygon is still
invalid.  Just write poly instead.

I am surprised. Amaya does accept height for elements applet, img, object,
td and th.  In what case do you get this error message?

Thanks for your comments, Bertrand,

Vincent.
