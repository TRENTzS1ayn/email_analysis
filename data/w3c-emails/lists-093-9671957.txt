Actually, baseline had been introduced in HTML 3.0 already (I know 3.0
never made it beyond the draft stage). I must say that I hadn't noticed
baseline hadn't made it in 3.2, probably because most tools (browsers 
and WYSIWYG editors) supported it in spite of its absence in the 3.2 
specs.

Shame on me! "polygon" is indeed reminiscent of HTML 3.0. I was fooled by
AOLpress that generates these "shape = POLYGON" attribute values.

Shame on me once more. It's my mistake. I was using the Height attribute in
the table tag. I don't know where I got that from. I would hate to have been
using Nutscape extensions without realizing it.

Peace, and thanks for the prompt reply,
