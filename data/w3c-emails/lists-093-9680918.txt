Emacs and Netscape don't take the system key binding into account, but Amaya
yes.
Perhaps on your machine the Alt key send a Meta keycode.
The Meta key doesn't exist on PC keyboards and it's often mapped on the
Alt key.
See /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XF86Config file and other key bindings defined
by your current Window manager.
The Amaya keyboard binding is executed after all these other key bindings
and there is no guaranty that the defined bindings can be applied.
