   See /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XF86Config file and other key bindings defined
   by your current Window manager.

No success.  Neither Alt nor Meta work.  I uncommented the line in
`/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XF86Config' that says

    LeftAlt     Meta

without any effect.  That was the only line among all the Xresources,
xinit, etc files that seemed related.

Do you have any other suggestions -- in particular, do you have a
detailed suggestion of what I might put in a .Xresources file or in
some other file?

Thanks!
