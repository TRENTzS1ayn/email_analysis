Hi,

my problem is related to the "make book" facility in Amaya. To include
only a section of every "chapter" document, I had to define in each of
them a <div> section that had a specific ID, and have the links to these
"chapter" documents include an anchor with the ID. My problem is that
Nutscape doesn't know how to handle anchors defined as ID and therefore 
jumps to the end of my "chapter" documents, rather than at the beginning
of their <div> section.

To make it clearer, here is an example:

in document a.html, I have a line with:

  <a rel="chapter" href="b.html#main">bla bla</a>

and, in b.html I have:

  Some headers that shouldn't be included in printed book
  <div ID="main">
  main part of document
  ...
  </div>
  Some footers that shouldn't be included in printed book

With Nutscape, if I click in document a.html on the "bla bla" link, I
end up at the end of b.html because Nutscape doesn't find any
<a name="main"> anchor in b.html.

Does anybody know of any trick that I could use to avoid this problem
without having to re-edit my documents each time I want to generate
a book?

Thanks for your help,

Bertrand Ibrahim.
