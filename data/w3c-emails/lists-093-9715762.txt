You need to use 1.2a release instead of 1.2.
As I undestand, you first built Amaya with success (make all) and after
you tried to install it and the install failed.
Could you send us error messages.

Not poor, very complex. We need subdir "obj" to allow us to build different
versions of Amaya (with/without plugins, with/without java support, 
with/without MathML, etc.) and Thot applications for different platforms
in the same hierarchy.

True, "../thotlib" must exist. Amaya cannot be built if the thotlib is not 
built.
Are you sure, you successfully downloaded Amaya source files and you started
"make all" after "../configure" and before "make install".
Each time we deliver a new release, I experiment that the Amaya building
from source tar file works fine. Something is wrong in your machine.
I can try to help you if you send me more information.

  Irene.
