It's useful for Thot application users. They can print documents without

of the Thot editor.

You can download *-printdialogue from
ftp://opera.inrialpes.fr/pub/sources/amaya

At the moment, de-printdialogue is a copy of en-printdialogue. If you can 
translate
it we'll be very happy to integrate your new version.
