well, i got a build of 1.2 (thanx to this list) but now the install
fails. the build bug was that i had to make the dir obj, cd there and
then run ../configure and make from there. but make install in obj fails
with these errors. the cd ../thotlib is failing. i think the path
handling seems to be very poor in amaya building. why do you need the
subdir obj? all other builds using a configure work fine at the top
level. and does anyone check these path problems out on common systems
like solaris?

i really want to use amya to hack my html as it seems like a good
environment for that. it needs (IMHO) to be more stable in building and
related docs (INSTALL, etc.).


make[1]: Entering directory `/local/src/amaya/Thot/obj/amaya'
(cd ../thotlib ; make CC="gcc" CFLAGS="-g -O -Wall " libThotEditor)
/bin/sh: ../thotlib: does not exist
make[1]: *** [../thotlib/libThotEditor.a] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/local/src/amaya/Thot/obj/amaya'

email me as i am not subscribed to the list right now. as i use amaya i
will probably join it.

thanx,

uri
