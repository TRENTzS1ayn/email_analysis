Hi,
here's two small things I would consider bugs in amaya:

First it seems impossible to get a space after a MathML object. I put a
space there in amaya, saves the html file and when it's reloaded the space
is gone...

Second if I place a MathML object as the first thing in a paragraph it will
be placed in a paragraph of its own after reloading.

Is this realy the way things are supposed to work?
