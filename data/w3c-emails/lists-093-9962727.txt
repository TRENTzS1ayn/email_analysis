    The Amaya team is proud to announce the availability of the 1.3 release
    of Amaya editor/browser.

    This release includes major changes and fixes some bugs.
    The binary is available at:
            http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/BinDist.html

    The source is available at:
            http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/SourceDist.html

    This release includes:
       *  Print on Windows is now available.
       *  "Zoom In" and "Zoom Out" functions are now available.
       *  Amaya uses the standard clipboard. On Windows versions Copy/Paste
          takes the standard clipboard into account. On Unix versions, Copy
          form clip board and Paste form Clipboard are attached to the usual
          mouse buttons (Left and Middle). Consequently, selection extension
          is now performed by  the Shift + Left button of the mouse.
       *  The drag now generates an auto-scroll (not available on Windows).
       *  There is a new input method for Iso-Latin-1 characters. According to
          the following table one can obtain a '\143' by first pressing '~' 
then
          typing 'a'. To obtain a simple '~' you have to press '~' twice.
       *  Alt and Control keys are dedicated to shortcuts
       *  Matrices and tables (mtable) from MathML are supported.
       *  XML links (only simple links) are supported in MathML: any MathML
          element can have the two attributes  xml:link="simple"
          href="some/URL"
       *  Elements deprecated in HTML 4.0 can't be created with Amaya.
       *  The HTML parser replaces the obsolete elements LISTING, PLAINTEXT,
          XMP by PRE. * The following HTML 4.0 elements are available:   ABBR,
          ACRONYM, BDO, DEL, IFRAME, INS, OBJECT, PARAM, Q, SPAN,   TBODY,
          TFOOT, THEAD   (BDO does not change the writing direction on the
          screen)
       *  The following HTML 4.0 elements are available:   ABBR, ACRONYM, BDO,
          DEL, IFRAME, INS, OBJECT, PARAM, Q, SPAN,   TBODY, TFOOT, THEAD
          (BDO does not change the writing direction on the screen)   * The
          following HTML 4.0 attributes are available:   id, class, style,
          title, lang, dir, onclick (and all other events),   cite, datetime
       *  There is a new CSS parser. In that release, it's not possible to
          edit CSS files in Amaya but this will be available very soon.
       *  Tooltips are now available on Windows and are updated on Unix
          versions.
