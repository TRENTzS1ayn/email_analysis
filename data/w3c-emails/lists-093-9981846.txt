Hi all, Newbie Amaya user here

Well, the subject says it all.  this is a site under my control, so naturally
I'd like to "fix" whatever is giving Amaya a hard time.

Platform: NT4
Webserver: IIS4/ASP

I login, name/pswd, bang.  Amaya is gone from the desktop faster than a regular
closedown.

I have a virtual dir further down on same site that also needs authentication -
this works (but it seems the frames are not supported yet in Amaya?).

If an Amaya coder wants a temp login to test this I'm willing to do that if it
helps.

TIA

Russ Thomas
