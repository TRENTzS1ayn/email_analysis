All true, What i'd expect from Amaya (since it is an authoring editor) is that it
should accept about everything which looks like html (4) BUT it should clearly
state errors to this language.

I think Amaya acted as it should do: it was given faulty HTML and it was making
the best out of it. Only good HTML has expected behavoure, if parts are faulty,
rejecting the faulty bits is one of the things Amaya can do. You are right that
closing the 'accidently' not closed table is a better option, the user can remove
the (now empty) table by hand. Future implementations of Amaya can ask the user
what to do on these bugs if it is in editing mode but in browsing mode I'd like
an automated action.
