Verry nice, the switch between edit and browse mode. One question on it: Can
it be automatic?

I think of the nedt options:
If the file (on read) is readonly, switch to browse mode
If the file (on read) is writable, switch to edit mode


Files fetched with from internet should be regarded as 'readonly' by
default, except for given domains: in the thotrc file: "writable domains".
With respect to this, the domain ftp://user:passwd@host.domain/ is an other
domain as ftp://host.domain/.

Once the file is saved (with save as) it is a new (writable) file and a
switch to edit mode is expected accordingly.


Regards

Corne
