It's no problem to have it as it is, i just compared amaya with vi or nedit,
both ascii editors on unix. They switch to view mode on read-only files and
switch back to R/W mode after a 'save-as'. I just find this comfortable and
easy to use and therefore placed the request.

If Amaya has a statement on it, I'm only one user vote to change this.

Regards,

CB.
