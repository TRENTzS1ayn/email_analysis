[ Snip ]

This behaviour seems sensible to me, too; those who only use Amaya to edit
will find that the behaviour is exactly as it was before (always
read-write), whilst those that browse will gain the benefits of read-only
mode.

I have recently been thinking that I would like Amaya to change certain
factors of its behaviour when in read-only (browsing) mode.  For example,
following links and pressing buttons could be single-click actions instead
of double-clicks.  The toolbar could also change.  For example, the save
button could be replaced by a "home" button.  These features would make
Amaya more comfortable to use when browsing.  All of the functionality
could of course be activated or deactivated depending upon the user's
configuration.

I think that the automatic RO/RW switch would complement such features,
and that such a switch is acceptable.

Vote 2 :-)
