Hi, while trying to compile Amaya on my Redhat %.1 Linux box (i686) I
created a `linux' directory in the Thot directory, went into it, ran
./configure, and typed make all.  The following error was reported:

make[2]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/Thot/linux/tablelib'
make[1]: *** No rule to make target `../../amaya/HTML.S', needed by
`../../amaya/HTML.STR'.  Stop.
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/Thot/linux/amaya'
make: *** [amaya_prog] Error 2

Any help would be appreciated!

Ian.
