I guess it's important to react today and don't let MS or NS kill the Web.
With HTML, people applauded to have a universal and open format to exchange 
information. Maintaining and encouraging invalid HTML is a manner to come back
to proprietary solutions.
In theory all W3C members, including MS and NS, agree to increase the quality 
of
Web pages. In fact the future should be a XML version of HTML (Voyager) which 
will reject invalid documents.

Users are actors on the Web as well as tool providers. Interests of both
parties are not necessary the same. If users think that open formats are good 
for them, they have to defend their position.

That's true. Nevertheless I hope we can show that a free and open solution is 
viable and very helpful. There are countries and domains (education for 
example)
were people cannot or mustn't pay for commercial products.

Sometimes, it's necessary to maintain a minimum of contact with the reality :-(
