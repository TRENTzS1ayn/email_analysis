I would have to vote against such a mode sensitive behaviour (if we really 
have a vote) as changing from one to two clicks for link traversal. Consistant 
UI operation is very important from a usability point of view.

Automatic switching from r/w to view would be nice but hard for a user to 
manage in the long run I would think. I would perfer that the Amaya team 
concentrate on completing implementation of the core functions such as css1/2 
style sheets (my favorite) and all of html4.0.

I think Amaya is great so far and have starting using it extensively except 
for editing things that take too much time and trouble with a GUI.

Just my 2 cents. Hmmmm, what would that be in Euros? :)
