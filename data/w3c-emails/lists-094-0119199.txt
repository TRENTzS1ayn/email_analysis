I understand that such a UI thing is down to personal preference. 
Personally, I use IE quite a lot, and I like single-click browsing.  I
was not suggesting that the change of click-operation should be the only
one we support, or even the default.  I was just pointing out that this
kind of thing would be possible, and would (I believe) work better if
the mode switching was automatic.

I'm not sure I agree, but I am willing to differ on you here.  How
about we consider adding such functionality, but on a user configurable
basis?

Of course.  In my case however, I do not have the time (or the
knowledge) to add such core features.  However, small changes, as these
seem to be, are well within my range.  I am not suggesting that people
such as Irene or others spend time on such things whilst core
functionality is missing, but I may well be able to find the time for
these things.
