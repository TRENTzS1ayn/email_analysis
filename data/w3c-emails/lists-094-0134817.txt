I'm having various problems with a table that is too wide for the 
display. The immediate one is that Amaya refuses to scroll right to 
the edge of the table.

(There are other general formatting problems, like background colours 
extending outside the margin lines, and text input boxes overrunning 
by even more.  This is with font-size forced to make the table fit.)
