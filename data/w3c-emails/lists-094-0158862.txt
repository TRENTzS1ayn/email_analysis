How true. but where is the border between a mode and UI operation? I think
that's up to the design team. Users can always ask for change but it is
still up to the design team to accept or reject the change.

True again but there is a (growing) difference between creating/editing and
viewing/debugging. They are both required.

On this issue, I vote for changing the default window. Now it is the 'with
pictures' view. I'd like to change that to one of the other views like the
structure or the text only (alternate) view. While editing tables and other
sturctures, there is no need to update the other views while I'm editing
this.

Still 2 cents. The 1/100 part of an Euro is the Euro-Cent.
2 us-dollar cents round to 2 euro cents.
2 dutch-guilder cents round to 1 euro cent.
what other cents are there around the world?

What is the HTML definition of the EURO sign?
Like the Cent symbol is &#162; the pound is &#163; the yen is &#165;
