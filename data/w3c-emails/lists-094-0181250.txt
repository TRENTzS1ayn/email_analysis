OK, but make sure it is possible to invoke in a read-only mode.

As for competing with commercial browsers -- Amaya could
aim elsewhere so it would not directly compete, it would be 
filling a different niche.  What I mean is that the W3C have a Web
Accessibility Initiative
http://www.w3.org/WAI/References/Activity.html
so amaya COULD be an example of how browsers can be accessible
as well as how they should handle HTML4.0.  Hmm, now that would
be a political decision! :-)

I would change it to READ-ONLY mode, or only allow saving to a new
file.
