This makes sense to me.
Click -> erm (thinking sound)(select)
Click Click -> Yes (do something)

The other option is to support the three button mouse world
[select][menu][adjust]
Left mouse would activate a link
Middle mouse would pull up a menu in the context of a link
Right mouse can extend a selection or tick off options in a pop up menu
without dismissing it.
But this is probably too far from the Microsoft UI hegemony.
To digress. Most young people, in my experience,  don't know where the
concept of cut & paste comes from!
