There is an interesting discussion in the Amaya list about the browse and
the edit mode. It seems that small new developments could make Amaya more
useful. But we (Amaya team) want to concentrate our current effort towards
three important developments: Undo, CSS and Internationalization,
At the same time we continue to fix reported bugs as soon as possible.

We are currently preparing the opening of our CVS base. That should be the
occasion to have external contributors on other points like:
- the development of the browser mode
- the redesigning of our icons and the look of our dialogues
- the support of animate images
- etc.

Regards
     Irene
