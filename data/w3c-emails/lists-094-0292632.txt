I see your english is limited.
What language support do you need?
- Do you need Amaya to be able to create korean language pages?
I think that is already possible. There are English and French spelling
checkers since there is a spelling checker and there are english and french
word-lists. Provide it with a korean word-list to spellcheck korean.

- Do you need Amaya to have korean options, menus, messages and korean help?
I think that needs translation of all the messages in the source and
rebuilding. Since Amaya updates more than once a year, I don't think it is
worth doing.
