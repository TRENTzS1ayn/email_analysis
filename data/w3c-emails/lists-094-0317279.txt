True: Hangul? I was thinking that some azian countries use the latin
alphabet besides an own alphabet.

But that still leaves the question: needs Amaya to be translated or do you
need special aid in Amaya to create pages in your alphabet or languate. I
recognize some languages (arabic, chinese..) read and write in a differen
direction besides the different characters.

After all, I was just wondering, I don't know non european languages at all
and from the eropean only a few a little.
