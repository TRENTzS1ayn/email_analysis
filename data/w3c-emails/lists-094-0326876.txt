Good morning.

I am using a SPARC Solaris 2.6 system.  I downloaded the Binary
distribution of Amaya 1.4a today, but find I am unable to make use of it.
This is due to the fact that this version of Amaya has requirements for
versions of dynamic X libraries which do not appear to exist at our site.

If there are requirements for particular versions of X libraries would
it be possible to create the binary distribution with those particular
versions statically linked into the library?
