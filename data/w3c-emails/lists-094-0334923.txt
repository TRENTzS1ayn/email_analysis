I guess you got the wrong version: http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/BinDist.html
says: "Sparc Solaris 2.6 format amaya-solaris2.6-1.4a.tar.gz (about
2.030,000 bytes) gzipped tar file. In this version the Motif library is
statically linked because the standard distributed version doesn't work.
This library could be incompatible with your local X libraries"

Do you have this 2.6 version? or hte 2.5 version?

If you got the 2.6 version, I think you are in bad luck and have the
incompatible libraries. If you have a compiler with your system (best to
have gcc) get the source and build that one. If gcc and gmake are available,
it's verry easy to build amaya.
