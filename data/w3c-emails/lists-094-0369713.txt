    i saw amaya support several foreign langauge.
    i am korean.
    i want amaya support for korean language.
    please answer...

Hello There Nova,

I believe supporting Korean language is no matter since everything works
quite well, You can purchase bunch of unicode support option packs for your
unix platform systems, Otherwise invent yourself using your Hangul(Korean)
language knowledge. To just support pull down menus with Hangul language i
suggest modifying the source codes and libraries.

South Korea dude,
