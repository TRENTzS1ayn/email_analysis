You have to hit the Return/Enter key while you are in the Title field for
the title to be changed. (at least that's how I do it)

just a user. I am pretty sure that this is mentioned somewhere in the

  Amaya is very nice!
  
  Just a detail:
  
  Editing the field "Title" does not affect the file.
  
  Maybe this field should simply be set "read only"?
