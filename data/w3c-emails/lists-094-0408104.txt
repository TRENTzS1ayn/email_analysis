Hello,

We are making an application based on Thot.
We want to print some documents that are larger than one page's width,
and we would prefer that the lines won't be cut. That's why we want to
print the view on a matrix of sheets.

The following exemple needs 2*2 sheets to be printed.
 _____________
| **         |              |
| ***       |              |
|               |              |
| *********        |
|______ |______|
|               |              |
|               |              |
| *********        |
|               |              |

I've read all the documentation and mailing list archives I could find,
but I can't manage to do that.
So my questions are :
How can I do that? Is it possible?

If Thot isn't able to do that, are you planning to implement that
fonctionnality?

If not, do you think it possible to make a patch, and where, in the
code, should we work?

Hoping you can help me,
