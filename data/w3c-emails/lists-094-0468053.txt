Well, I had a play around, and it is indeed possible.

Go to the Structure view and select META from the Structure menu

You get prompted for name, and then content. So you can add pretty much
any kind of metadata you can think of.

Of course once you have added a META element it is pretty easy to edit it
in the Structure view.

But I couldn't find it in the documentation either (although I only had a
brief look, after I had figured it out)

  I think this is not mentioned in the docs ;-)
  
  Again:
  Amaya is fascinating useful for me.
