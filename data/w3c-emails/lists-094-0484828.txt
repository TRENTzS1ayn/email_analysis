(This is not a really great problem)

When I create two empty paragraphs in a row, and then delete one of them,
the other one also disappears and I am left without a cursor.

Example: I am editing a list item - text/LI/UL/BODY/HTML

I hit the return key 4 times. 
First time it creates a new Paragraph in the List Item. 
Second time it creates a new List Item in the list. 
Third time it creates a new paragraph in the BODY.
Fourth time it creates a second new paragraph in the BODY.

So I press backspace, to remove the redundant one. Both paragraphs are
removed, and the cursor vanishes.

Which is frustrating. I should train myself not to make the mistake, but I
haven't. It would be much more friendly if it simply let me remove the
second empty paragraph and placed me into the first.
