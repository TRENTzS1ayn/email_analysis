It's not so easy to do that. What I can suggest is to modify the x.P schema
and print the document in A4R instead of A4.

   To do that you have to change page width and page height in the x.P schema 
and
   and define the right options in file x.conf
   -------
   options
   pagesize:      A4
   orientation:   Landscape
   -------------

Regards
  Irene.
