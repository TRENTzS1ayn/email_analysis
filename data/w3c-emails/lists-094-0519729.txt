Hi,

it might be obvious, however, it seems that
the menu "special / make book" is not available when the
documentation has been loaded via the "help"-menu.
(which seems to be a feature)

so to make a book from the documentation
I had first to load the file via the
open dialogue ...

Maybe this could be mentioned in the docs ;-)

BTW:
"make book" is a very useful :-)
