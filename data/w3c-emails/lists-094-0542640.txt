I have just tried Amaya 1.3b, creating a test equation.

I find however  that  Netscape 4.5 does not display it correctly as your
program does. Instead I see things like &Sigma; and &Sum;
(Also my web authoring program Homesite 4)

I would therefore like to know 

1. Can I get Netscape or IE to display (locally) equations generated by
your program.

2. And if that's possible will folk be able to read the equations correctly
if I do upload them.

I checked the FAQ and could not see the answer.

I see that version 1.4a is now available. Is it worth me trying this ?

Thanks Ron
