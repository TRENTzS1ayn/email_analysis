Hi,

Windows usually uses a resource editor to build dialogs, 
one edit a dialog box in which one put textedit windows,
static text area, etc. All of this is built according to
a given font which is by default "small font". If you change
the font this make a trouble in the dialog boxes of course.

You can try to build dialogs in the source code without the
resource editor, however, the problem remains. When you 
define a window, you have to give its heigth and width.
unless you give a too big sizes, you will have the same problem.

Conclusion, it is very diffuclt (probabely be impossible) to deal 
with such a problem on Windows. This is why, most of strings are hard 
coded in dialogs on Windows :-(.
