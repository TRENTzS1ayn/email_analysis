We very much want to use your well-thought-out GUI in Amaya and in
trying to do so we ran into a problem.  To illustrate the problem, we
have put a simple little script at physnet.pa.msu.edu/two-forms.html .
Netscape handles it OK, giving updated times even if the same button is
pressed twice in succession.  Amaya updates the time only when the
buttons are pressed alternately.  In addition, the button value is
missing in Amaya's forms submission.  These are handled OK by
Navigator.  Any help you can provide would be greatly appreciated!
