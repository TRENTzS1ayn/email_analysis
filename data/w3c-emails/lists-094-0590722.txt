We very much want to use your well-thought-out GUI in Amaya and in
trying to do so we ran into a problem.  To illustrate
the problem, we have put a simple little script at
physnet2.pa.msu.edu/two-forms.html .  Netscape handles it OK, giving
updated times even if the same button is pressed twice in succession.
Amaya updates the time only when the buttons are
pressed alternately.  In addition, the button value is missing in
Amaya's forms submission.  These are handled OK by
Navigator.  Any help you can provide would be greatly appreciated!
