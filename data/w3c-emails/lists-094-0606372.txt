Hi,

just some points to maybe think over ... ;-)

+ in the menue help there is no entry "using amaya"
(the page you get when going up from the help-pages)

+ I'd be pleased if there were an entry in menue Help
which could be called "Amaya's Home" with a link to
the homepage with further information

+ the logos on the left top of the help-pages could be
linked to the w3c and the amaya-homepage



best wishes,
roland
