One problem seems to be with your script. You're using an nph script.
This type of script should not only send back the HTML reply, but also
the HTTP headers. Try to use a non nph script to see the difference.

I don't know if it's planned, but your ACTION element points to
http://physnet2,  rather than http://physnet2.pa.msu.edu.
This only means that people from outside your domain can't directly call
the script.

Could you tell me if it works better once you make those changes?

I'm able to make your form work against my apache 1.3.4, using the
printenv script included in the Apache dist.

Thanks,

-Jose
