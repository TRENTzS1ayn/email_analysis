Pete,

Thanks for your report.

I did some more testing with your script and found out that need to
alternate the two buttons in your form comes from a bug in Amaya.
I fixed it up. 

If you're compiling the Amaya source code yourself, I can mail you a patch.
Otherwise, I ask you to wait until the next release (planned for some time
next month).

Best regards,

-Jose
