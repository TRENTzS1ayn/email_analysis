I assume that "make book" creates a new document based upon the current
document's contents, rather than actually modifying the current document.
In this case, "make book" is a read-only operation, with respect to the
current document, and there is no reason for the "make book" operation not
to be available in the read-only mode.  (If it is not the case that a new
document is created with this operation, perhaps it should be so).

Perhaps also the "Edit" menu ought to have a "Toggle write status" option,
available at all times.

Ewan.
