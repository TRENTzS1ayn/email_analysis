I personally would prefer this.

BTW: It seems to be a little ;-) bug that (in help-files)
this button is NOT dimmed when
the button bar is set to display=yes:
1) Switching to "display button bar": Edit-Button is active (!), Page is locked
(as expected)
2) First click: Edit-Button stays active, Page is editable
3) Second click: Edit-Button gets dimmed, File is read-only

However, do you think this behaviour (help files are shown with or without
buttonbar etc.) should be configurable? Maybe with default = "help files are
shown
with button bars"?

I personally like systems where 500 (or more ;-) properties can (!) be
configured but (!)
the default behaviour is as the "average user" would expect it ;-)

Maybe some people will think this to be overkill ...

At this point I come to another question: In order not to flood this list
with wishes which do not conform to the "philosophy of Amaya", I'd be
happy to read such a concept before asking for new features.
Or have I missed it?

So I'd first suggest a section in the docs like ...#####
TITLE: Feedback
If you have suggestions concerning the documentation of Amaya, please send
the suggested text-snippets (or wishes/suggestions) to Charles McCathieNevile
<charles@amaya...>.
#####

Is this the way you like it? ;-)
