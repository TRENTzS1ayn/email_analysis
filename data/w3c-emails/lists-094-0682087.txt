Is this the attitude that is going to be taken in the future?  I think it
is very important that the W3C has a fully functional browser - this could
be used as a testbed for new technologies as well as an example of a
conforming implementation of existing ones.  Why should Amaya not be that
browser?

I understand that the core Amaya team was put together to work to produce
an authoring tool, and that they may well wish to continue along that
road.  I have no intention of dismantling or obstructing that work.
However, I see no reason that Amaya cannot be a good browser *as well*.

The intention to make public the Amaya CVS tree has been announced.  I saw
that as an opportunity for work to be done in areas that were not in the
brief, or not of interest to, those currently working on Amaya.  This
would allow development of the editor features to continue at full
pace whilst work was done elsewhere on Amaya.  I was intending to work on
browser features of Amaya.  However, if that is going to be against the
wishes of the core development team, obviously that is going to be
impossible.
