Hello,

I am very sorry that I have to send in such an unspecific report.  But 
I really can't tell why my copy of amaya does not fetch any documents
via http, while a lot of other browser do (netscape, lynx, arena,
wget) at th very same mahine wiht the very same pages.

What did I do? I retrieved amaya 1.4a , put it at my linux box and
compiled.  Everything works fine, except that I can't figure why all I 
can do is file access.

Tell me what I should look for and I will do.  Thanks

/Jerry
