Hello Jerry,

Are you using a proxy setup?

If yes, you'll need to configure Amaya to take into account your proxy.
See the configuration doc that comes with your Amaya release.

If this doesn't work yet, please email us the URL you're trying to 
access so that we can analyze the problem from here.

Thanks,

-Jose
