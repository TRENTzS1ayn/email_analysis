There appears to be a mismatch between version 1.4a of Amaya and version
2.1e of Thot.   The DeleteElement now takes a second argument, pDoc, but
Amaya code isn't passing that argument.

Should I not be trying to use these versions together, or is this just a
brief incompatibility that I happened to unluckily stumble upon.  Is this
obvious patch the right one?

Thanks,
Greg
