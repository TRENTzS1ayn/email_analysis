Having a fully configurable interface allows the possibility of producing
'profile' files - user interface collections which match various
conventions. Being able to select from the 'Windows' interface, for people
who are used to Windows applications, or the 'Amaya' Interface, for people
who are used to Amaya with the native User Interface, and have to work for
a day on a windows system, would be a really handy ability.

There are also some features of the user interface (such as selection)
which do not seem to be controllable from the keyboard. This would be a
very useful feature in general, and is crucial for Accessibility. If these
things were added to the list of configurable commands it would make a
good thing better. I know that at least some of this is already in the
plan, and I am eager to see the next release.
