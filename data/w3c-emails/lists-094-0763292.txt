jk> Hello Jerry, Are you using a proxy setup?

Hello Jose,

I do not using any proxies.  I'm actually a bit experienced concering
networks (with the exception of socks, which in turn is what is used
here); that why I said, I'm sorry to be that unspecific and now I'm
even more sorry not to have made that clear.

The thing is, that I try to work just at my own machine, that is
apache and amaya are at the very same machine.  As it is a laptop, the 
network is not always reachable - which I was suspecting o be the
reason at first.

What I tried was to access apache via localhost, the hostname without
domain (see network, it's not always resolvable) and via full
qualified host name. The log files do not show any connection
attempts, not even at tcp level let alone the apache.  To make sure
it's not just a matter of the resolver, I activated and deactivated
the dns server.  What I could not figure was, whether there is still
an option to be put into /etc/resolv.conf to tell use /etc/hosts and
dns in this or that sequence.  The docs don't have such an option - I
merly remember that there was one in the past - but things might
change and memory might cheat.

There is a second web server in the intranet.  Netscape et al can
reach it without any proxies or difficulties.  Amaya does not talk to
it either.

http://localhost/
http://gliep/
http://server.domain.intranet/

;-) guess there is no chance in any way.

Thanks
