This isn't directly related to the previous post but it reminded me of a 
problem related to Thot.

I don't remember where I first found a link to the Thot site but it doesn't 
seem to be from the Amaya pages. I see Thot mentioned in several places, but 
none of them are links. At a minimum, there should be a link to the Thot site 
from the Source pages and/or a local  copy that the Amaya team has used to 
build the current version of Amaya.
