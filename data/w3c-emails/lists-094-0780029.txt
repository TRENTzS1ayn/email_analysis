I'm having some problems printing documents with Amaya, since I updated my
version of Amaya to the 1.4a release, the printing option stop
working.....I can't understand what's happening.. all other programs print
correctly!
The status bar shows: "Links update: 99% has been done" and nothing more
happens.

Thanks
Jorge Coelho.
