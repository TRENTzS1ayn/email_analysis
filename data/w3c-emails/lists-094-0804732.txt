The Amaya distribution is complete as it is, so the Thot toolkit is distributed
with Amaya.

The pointer to Thot was removed just because people were confusing. 
However we are happy to let know that Amaya is the result of our previous 
research
activity at INRIA.
I will add in http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User page a link to Thot 
(http://www.inrialpes.fr/opera/Thot.en.html)

Regards
