Hi,

maybe a silly question ... (vers. 1.4a)

I cannot find the commad "Setup and Print" in the File menu:
**Docs: "Before executing that command, you may need to set some parameters
with the Setup and Print command from the File menu."

And I have no idea what the ...
**Docs: "The standard printer command is defined by the THOTPRINTER registry file
variable."
should look like.

Thanks for any hints!

Roland
