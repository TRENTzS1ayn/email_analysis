First off all, thanks for your fast answer.

Printing a document or making a book gives the same problem.... does
nothing.

The status bar stalls when appears: 
1. Links update: 99% has been done (when de document has links)
2. Links update: 0% has been done (when de document hasn't links)

I'm not able to print the first displayed page.

Yes, I'm working with Windows.
