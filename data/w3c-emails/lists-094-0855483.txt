Hi,

as I am having disk space problems on my C: partition, I tried to configure
Amaya (1.4a for Win'95) to create its cache in D:\amaya\cache. I added a
line in the thot.rc file to that effect, and indeed, Amaya created a 
libwww-cache subdirectory there.

However, each time I run Amaya, it creates a directory named c:\temp\amaya
with 10 empty subdirectories named 0 to 9. Is there a way I can avoid this
(seemingly) useless directory creation?

Thanks,

Bertrand Ibrahim

P.S. By the way, the horizontal scrolling of the structure window still
doesn't work :-(
