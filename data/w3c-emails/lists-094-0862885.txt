I have noticed that images tend to be oversize as compared to viewing them either 
with netscape or with xv on the same display. The height and width options on 
the img tag do adjust the size of the image but pieces of the image such as 
text still show distortions even though the size is adjusted to be indentical 
to the original as shown with xv.

Has anyone else noticed this? There is no mention in the FAQ. I have a 20inch 
display with a PowerStorm 4D40T graphics card. (This is a Digital system)
