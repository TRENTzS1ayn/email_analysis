You could also have checked the SGML DTD for HTML 4.0:

    http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/sgml/loosedtd.html

as both the DTD and the HTML.S file define the same structure.
You are right: a FRAMESET element cannot contain an H1 element as a child.

The only safe reference I know is the HTML 4.0 specification:

    http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/

In principle, you are right.  But Amaya has to cope with existing Web
pages, and, as you know, very few of them validate against the HTML DTD.
When designing Amaya, we were faced with a difficult choice:
(1) adopt a strict position and reject all invalid pages. Most users
    would be very disapointed not to be able to see mainy pages that
    other Web clients can display;
(2) accept invalid pages and let Amaya fix the most common bugs.

We took position (2) and decided that Amaya should try to fix bugs, but
without losing information.  If an element is not valid in a given context,
Amaya tries to change the structure locally to make that element valid,
but it doesn't delete the element or move it to a different place, which
could change its meaning. That's why the H1 element is kept in the FRAMESET.

Another important design decision that has been made for Amaya is that, even
if it accepts invalid documents, the structure and markup that it produces
is always valid. Obviously, only elements created or changed by Amaya itself
are concerned here. Some invalid parts of the original document may remain
when the document is saved.

W3C has also developed a validator that allows you to check documents.
Have a look at:

    http://validator.w3.org/

You could also  use HTML tidy to fix erroneous documents:

This is an example of these errors that Amaya tries to recover.  If the
structure of a table is wrong, Amaya can not edit it. For that reason, it
applies some tranformations that make the structure correct.

The issue is that a DTD or a .S file only specifies the structure of a
document class, not its semantics.  When you consider an invalid document,
there are often several ways to transform its structure to make it valid,
but each transformation may have a different impact on the document semantics.
The DTD of .S file does not allow you to choose the right transformation.
A specific piece of code is then needed.

See above.

Thanks for your support.
