I had downloaded a version of "amaya-window95-1_49.exe" from
http://www.w3.org. When I double-clicked on the downloaded, I got the
message:"this program is of incorrect size or corrupted. It is unusable.".
What  happened? My OS is not Window95, but Windows98. Could that be the
reason? Plse help.QBD
