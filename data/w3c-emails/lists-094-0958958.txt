 1- Are you sure that you run a Windows'95 version on Windows'95 or a
Windows NT
    version on Windows NT?

I'm using amaya for Windows 95 on Windows 98... 
 
2- Did Amaya display the first print dialogue box (table of contents,
links, 
 etc.)?
Yes.
 
 3- Did Amaya display the second print dialogue box (the standard windows
print 
 dialogue)?
Yes. 

 4- Could you check if there is a file c:\tmp\amaya\thotxxx.PIV?
 I checked, the file isn't there....
But, there are lots of dirs c:\temp\Thot-xxxxxx\Thot-xxxxx.PIV
Amaya "hangs" on "Links update: 99% has been done"


Thanks.
