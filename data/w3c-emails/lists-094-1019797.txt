You need to maintain a certain coherence between the HTML.S, HMTMP.P, HTMLT.T
HTML.A and the Amaya.
There is a document (http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-amaya-970220.html) which 
explains
the architecture of Amaya and can help if you want to make some change in 
Amaya.
The bug you reported is due to a call with typenum parameter=0.
I suspect that your html2thot.c file is inconsistent with your new version of 
HTML.S.
