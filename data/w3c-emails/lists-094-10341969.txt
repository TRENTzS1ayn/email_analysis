Perhaps I'm missing something obvious too ... I still can't see any
instructions as to how to uninstall from Windows95. I could run my
uninstaller of course, but the BinDist page clearly implies that there is
an uninstall mechanism/procedure that will preserve user preferences. My
present installation is 2.1 and I can't see anything in that version's
manual about uninstalling and there is nothing titled "UnIns*" in the
directories.

I appear to still have v1.4a left lying in \program Files\Thot too ... can
I safely dump everything in that directory tree?

regards,
Malcolm.
