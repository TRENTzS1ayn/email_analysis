Help!

I've tried installing various binary distributions of Amaya on  RH6.0
Linux - latest is the rpm of 2.4.1.
Amaya loads and displays the first page, but then disappears if I follow
an external link, claiming a broken pipe.  It sometimes loads part of
the external page, but it always bombs out.  I'm using an
MS proxyserver, but it seems to be OK, in that it asks for
authentication OK and supplies some of the page data at least.
I assume I've set something up incorrectly, but any pointers would be
gratefully received.  I've been through the list archives, and have
found a couple of similar queries, but no answers :-)

Thanks,

Stuart White
