You're right. We do need an Uninstall doc page. In the meantime, I modified
the text, trying to make it clearer:

NOTE: You MUST first uninstall any previous version of Amaya from your system 
before installing this one. To do so, use a tool in the Windows control panel 
tool which allows to "install/remove programs" (the exact name depends on your 
Windows versions... mine is in French!). This is a standard Windows tool.
You don't have to copy your Amaya user preferences as they won't be
affected by this operation.

Well, preferences are stored in that tree (see the Configuring Amaya doc
page). If you scratch it, you'll loose them. And there will be some traces
left in the Windows history of installed program.

We'll try to improve the doc. If anyone has time and inspiration to give
it a shot, feel free to do so.

Hope this helps you out Malcolm,

Cheers,
