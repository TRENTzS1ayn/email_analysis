Ah, yes, but only for v1.4a ... I see now where thot.rc is for 2.1, it's
in the Program Files\Amaya hierarchy as I had hoped.

Don't look at me 8-) ... I struggle to find time to (properly) read the
documentation that's already there!

Yes thanks, I think I have it sorted in my mind now. better do some
uninstalling and load up the current version ...

Malcolm.
