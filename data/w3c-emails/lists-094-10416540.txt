Thanks a lot Robert for the great job. We will take your suggestions into 
account
as soon as possible. Perhaps some other people will be interested by a OSF 
version
of Amaya.
If you have interesting patches don't hesitate to send them, but could you 
send in
the future technical messages to the mailing list www-amaya-dev instead of 
www-amaya?
That will make the live easier for many simple users.
  Irene.
