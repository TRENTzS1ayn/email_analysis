My page  http://users.ox.ac.uk/~malcolm/genuki/big/eng/OXF/
 has 4 icons across the head of the document.

Can anyone suggest why amaya only renders the transparency on the third
one? Netscape renders the transparency on all of them.

A little further down, the map gif not only has lost its transparency,
amaya has declined to honour the align="right"?

I'm aware that the document doesn't currently pass validation (so there's
no need to remind me 8-) but I don't think that explains either of the
above matters.

regards,
Malcolm.
