Hello,
  I have 2 questions:

1. In the alternate view, Amaya does not render the TABLE FRAME and RULES 
for tables, no matter whatever you set these attributes to. Is there a 
solution for this ? I tried to modify the HTMLP.P file, but i haven't been 
successful yet.

2. I have come to know that all the bug fixes for Amaya go into the CVS 
source control. I am using Win NT. We have a firewall that prevents ftp to 
other sites. Is there a way that it can be accessed thru http. If so, please 
send me information on how to access it.

Your help is greatly appreciated.

Thanks
arvind
