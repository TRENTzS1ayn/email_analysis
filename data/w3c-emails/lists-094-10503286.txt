Hi,

what is the difference between the "rel=subdocument" and "rel=Chapter"
when using the MakeBook command?

Why does MakeBook delete (i.e. skip in the output) the ENTIRE (!)
paragraph whenever this contains a reference to another Chapter? 
Wouldn't it make more sense to insert the corresponding material AFTER
that paragraph?  Sure, that makes things more difficult to read - but
else you can't have "rel=**" commands in longer paragraphs, as they
dissappear :-(

In the Windows (NT4.0) version, the MakeBook command becomes disabled
after using it - so you have to leave Amaya to try again.

Thanks for any help

Sebastian Horch
