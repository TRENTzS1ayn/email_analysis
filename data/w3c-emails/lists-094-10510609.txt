No difference.

The text around a reference is not exactly the same than the text that 
introduces
a section (the div that replace the previous reference). For that reason we 
decided
to remove the paragraph or the item that includes the link.

After a MakeBook, the document is set in the Read-Only mode. That protects
you against a Save on the original address. The MakeBook is disabled by the 
Read-Only mode and you have to change the document state (by clicking on the 
Edit botton) to allow a second MakeBook or any other editing.
