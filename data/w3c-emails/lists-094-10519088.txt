That's hit it right ... this PC isn't well endowed with video memory so I
run it 1024x768x16bit. When I switch it to 800x600x24bit Amaya renders
the transparency correctly.

Assuming there are lots of people out there running 1024x768 on a PC
without ill effects 8-) then it must the the 16bit colour that is causing
the problem. Hence my making this response to the list ... perhaps someone
else running 16bit colour on a PC can confirm or deny transparent GIFs are
rendered correctly.

Malcolm.
