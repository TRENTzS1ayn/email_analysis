Morning all,

I'm running at 1280x1024x16bpp on my machine... My documents use JPGs, not
GIFs, and when editing, (and actually any other time), the graphics are
no-shows. They're in the code, and they were visible, once upon a time. I'm
running Win95 w/ the latest Amaya sources from CVS, and the images are
created using MSImager (from Office 95).
I went to Weather.Com, and the colors are screwy with the images, and for
www.w3.org, I don't see the W3C logo at the very top of the screen.

TTFN...
Gary Klesczewski

That's hit it right ... this PC isn't well endowed with video memory so I
run it 1024x768x16bit. When I switch it to 800x600x24bit Amaya renders
the transparency correctly.

Assuming there are lots of people out there running 1024x768 on a PC
without ill effects 8-) then it must the the 16bit colour that is causing
the problem. Hence my making this response to the list ... perhaps someone
else running 16bit colour on a PC can confirm or deny transparent GIFs are
rendered correctly.
