Regardless of what Amaya is doing with it, this
is invalid and relies on browser error recovery
for unknown entities.  The correct version is:

<IMG HEIGHT="16" WIDTH="12"
SRC="/cgi-bin/general/counter.pl?from=books&amp;num=8&amp;roman=1">

Note that the HTML spec reccomends that CGI scripts which
are likely to be used with simulated forms URLs should
accept ; as equivalent to & to avoid the need for 
replacing the &s with entities.
