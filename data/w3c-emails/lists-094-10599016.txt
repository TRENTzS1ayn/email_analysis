The output from forms submission appears to be without the &amp; as is
the output from Amaya.  If I change the code to add the "&amp;", Amaya
removes it when it saves it and corrupts it the next time it opens it
anyway!

<img height="16" width="12"
src="/cgi-bin/general/counter.pl?from=books&num=4&roman=1">

The scripts are okay with the ";".  Amaya also seems to intermittently
remove comments!.  Its a pity as this seems to otherwise be a good HTML
editor, its the first I've played with that I've not given up with after
five minutes.
