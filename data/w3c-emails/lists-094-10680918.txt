I usually lurk on a list a bit before writing, but here goes.  

I'd love to install amaya on my linux box but I can only download about 12k of
any rpm using every ftp means at my disposal.  What is wrong here?
I even managed to ftp it to my isp but still can't get it from there to my home
box..

Yes I have checked the archives.
