Morning All,

I just updated my Amaya source library, and went to build it... I ran into
a problem in the building of the system. It appears to be missing a
function definition - "_CreateMathEntityDlgWindow"

I am building with MSVC++6.0 on a win95 box. The error that I see in the
build output window is as follows:
Mathedit.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol _CreateMathEntityDlgWindow

There is a reference to it in Mathedit.c that has no prototype:
d:\development\amaya\amaya\amaya\mathedit.c(2647) : warning C4013: 'CreateMathEntityDlgWindow' undefined; assuming extern returning int

If you would like a copy of the entire build output, just let me know.
