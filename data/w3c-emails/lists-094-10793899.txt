If you refer to the HTML specification, you will read:

  http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/appendix/notes.html#notes-line-breaks

  SGML (see [ISO8879], section 7.6.1) specifies that a line break
  immediately following a start tag must be ignored, as must a line
  break immediately before an end tag. This applies to all HTML
  elements without exception.

The line breaks added by Amaya should not change anything in the
way a bowser renders the table. IE and NN are wrong. Anyway, if
this is felt as an annoyance, we can remove these linebreaks in
the next release, as the HTML will still be valid.
