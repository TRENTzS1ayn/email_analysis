I agree that it is a bit of a religious argument. Personally I prefer
having the User interfacce consistent within the tool. (But then, I don't
use the 'read-only' feature, which is what the browse mode is.)

Exposing the function to the user would be nice for those who want to
split it. I am not sure if it is currently one of the functions which can
be configured - check the help page.

  Hi!
  Now there is the option to switch between editor and browse modes. The
  next logical step would be to allow a single click to enter a link in
  browse mode, just like the other browsers do. Or is there some reason
  not to do so?
