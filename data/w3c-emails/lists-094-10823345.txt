1. In the current version, Amaya uses only the Symbol font in addition to
   ISO-Latin1 fonts.  For this reason, a number of mathematical symbols
   can't be displayed properly.  They appear in the form of a question
   mark.  But, don't worry, if you save the document, the original entity
   is preserved.
   We are well aware of this limitation and will do our best to improve
   the situation in future releases.

2. I am not sure I understand your second point. If you are talking
   about the AltaVista search form, the issue is that this HTML
   page in completely screwed up.  If you submit it to an HTML validator,
   you will see a number of errors.  Amaya has some problems with
   such pages, and in this particular case, it misses the FORM tag
   (look at the Structure view: this tag is displayed in red, which means
   that it has not been interpreted), and the form can't work.  I have
   reported the error to people in charge of the server.
