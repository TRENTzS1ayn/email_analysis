That could be due to a temporary trouble on the net or a different timeout 
value.

This will be fixed in the next release. You can also fix it in the dialogue
file Amaya/config/en-amayamsg

This will be fixed in the next release. You can also fix it in your local
file Amaya/doc/amaya/Browsing.html

It seems you're probably using a proxy which is automatically configured
by Netscape, but not by Amaya. Could you check. See the menu 
Special->Preferences->Proxy
I had a look at your 2 images. On my version I have a different result.
I will use the page example to improve the table formatting in Amaya.

OK. I'll try to repeat the bug.
