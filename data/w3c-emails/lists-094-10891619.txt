But you still need Unicode encoded fonts.  The font that
covers the most useful maths characters on MS platforms is
Symbol, which is not Unicode encoded.  Windows NT 4 comes
with Lucida Sans Unicode, which does have Unicode encoded
maths symbols, but there is only that one font; it is far
from a complete Unicode font.

Presumably for marketing reasons, Windows 9x doesn't include
this font, although you might be able to get CJK fonts for the
           browsers
(LSU doesn't include CJK).

Office 2000 will reportedly include a nearly complete Unicode
font, but that is not being offered as a free upgrade, presumably
again for marketing reasons.

IE5 can only map fonts by language (really meaning source
character set) and has no obvious provision for assigning
a font for maths use (most maths symbols are probably currently
entered by abusing font selections to select the non-Unicode 
Symbol
