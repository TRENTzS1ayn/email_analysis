Hi. This may not be the forum for this but
I'd like to try anyway.  I'm trying to use
amaya 1.4a and what I'd like to do is set
up a row of buttons (.gif's) spaced evenly
across the page but after I insert the 
button images and the spaces to separate them,
re-loading the page eliminates the spaces 
between the images.

I thought I saw something on this some time
back, but I'm unable to find it now.  Any
suggestions to get this to work would be
appreciated, especially if there is a  better
way to do this.


thanks,
