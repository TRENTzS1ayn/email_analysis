Arial Unicode MS, which comes with Office 2000, includes a complete (I
believe) Unicode font. I assume that it's complete because it includes
polytonic Greek, and polytonic (i.e., ancient) Greek is not exactly a big
market (~10,000 worldwide at most).

The font you're talking about is probably the Palatino version of an
MS/Monotype Unicode font (I don't remember the exact name, but it is
Palatino something Unicode).

I would speculate that MS might add these Unicode fonts to some future
version of the web fonts pack at their typography site
(  http://www.microsoft.com/typography/   ), someday.  Maybe.
Who knows? Just in case, I check every couple of weeks.
