IE5/NT4 substitutes Symbol for the mathematical symbols and
therefore fails to display them all, unless you make 
Lucida Sans Unicode your standard font for the user defined
language and overide the encoding from UTF-8 to user defined
(other combinations may work).

Thai works, I don't know why.  Arabic work, possibly because
I have the arabic fonts.  Hebrew, Cyrillic and Greek seem to work.
The remainder fail, even though I have Simplified and Traditional
Chinese fonts that work if you select GB2312 or BIG5 encodings for
Chinese - forcing simplified chinese gets out your Japanese syllabic
stuff.

Netscape 4.5/NT 4 fails to get the Thai, Hebrew and Arabic and
requires
the character set to be manually set to UTF8.  If you manually 
select Lucida Sans Unicode as the Unicode font, you get the full set
of
maths symbols, but the default Unicode font is Times New Roman,
for which you only get a subset (the same as IE5, I think).
Selecting
a simplified Chinese font as your Unicode font, or configuring the
font for simplified chinese and selecting it as the character set,
gets the Japaneses syllabics.

On NT4, therefore, with a current IE and a recent NS, I'd say that
Unicode support was still rather broken.

Incidentally, http://home.att.net/~jameskass/ 
(Unicode Support in Your Browser) seems a useful resource in this
area, including pointers to various more or less complete Unicode
fonts, mainly shareware.
