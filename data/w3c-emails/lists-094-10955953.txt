Hello, 
 No, this is not a bug report! I just try to use Amaya as it is, and patiently
wait for a more stable version (or for something similar) to turn up.

I was just curious about the name "Amaya".  It sounds like greek mithology... 
Can anyone tell me  how did it pop up? I could not find any info about it in
the W3C website. 

Thanks. 
Jose
