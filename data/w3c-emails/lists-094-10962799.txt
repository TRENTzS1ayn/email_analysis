I wish this were also the case with numeric character references (NCRs).  If
you load a file containing, say, &#338; (an OE ligature), Amaya will nicely
determine that it cannot display that and display OE as a fallback instead.
That's OK, but when you save, you'll find that the file now contains "OE",
not your original &#338;.  Without even as much as a warning, I think this
is, hmmm, impolite and should be fixed.
