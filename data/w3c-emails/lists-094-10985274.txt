Hi Jose,

The initial name of our editor/browser was Tamaya. A tamaya is a tree from
New Mexico represented by the logo. We chose that name because I love that tree
and with a lot of imagination it could style the image a the Net.
Unfortunately we could longer use that name because it was already used by
a small French company. For that reason we dropped the first T and our
editor/browser is named Amaya.

> I was just curious about the name "Amaya".  It sounds like greek mithology...
