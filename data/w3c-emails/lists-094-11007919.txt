In fact, further investigation has shown that Amaya sees the outside world
if a numeric IP address is used, but does not connect to symbolic
addresses, even as named is running on the local machine, and netscape,
telnet, ssh, ftp all seem to have no problem resolving names. However,
Amaya is able to resolve "localhost". My installation of named is
several years old, and is configured as a caching/forwarding server. Any
ideas?

I am not using a proxy. However, if I run a proxy on the local host, and
enter it in Amaya's configuration, then it works fine, in particular the
DNS names get resolved (by the proxy I presume).

In fact, many of the files in Amaya/config contain spelling errors. I have
attached a diff-file that fixes those that I found. In particular I
thought is was funny, that according to one message in en-amayamsg
"These changes won't be effective until Amaya is retarted"

I found out that this is also true of the binary release 2.4 of Amaya
running under SunOS 5.6. However, the lines get messed up somewhat
differently.

This bug is also repeatable for the binary running under SunOS 5.6.
