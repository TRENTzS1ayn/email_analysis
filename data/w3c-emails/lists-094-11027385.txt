Uwe, 

The name resolution is done thru gethostbyname(), a standard a Unix 
system call (to be more precise, the code is in the 
libwww/Library/src/HTDNS.c file). 

There must be some kind of incompatible with your named, as we haven't
noticed this problem before, in a number of systems. 

What kind of system are you running (e.g., do a uname -a)?

I can eventually give you a small program that makes the request using
the libwww code and we can strace or truss it to find out where's the
problem. If you're using an Amaya that you compiled yourself, it'll
be even easier.

Thanks! We'll merge the messages. It's a bit harder than doing a CVS diff
because some of those files have evolved since the release. It'd be much
easier to have a database oriented system to handle translations and then
use it to generate the dialogue files... but we're not there yet :)

Right now, we'll make Amaya much smarter by changing that particular message :)

Thanks for all your help and tests!
