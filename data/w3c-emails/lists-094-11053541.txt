I use Amaya on Soalris for most HTML editing.

The table support has improved heaps in the last couple of releases.

It still crashes occasionally, but not often enough to identify what the
problem was to report it. It usually seems to be able to recover the file I
was editing when it crashed :-)

I really like the structure view so I understand what's really happening, and
the fact that Amaya won't let me generate illegal HTML.
