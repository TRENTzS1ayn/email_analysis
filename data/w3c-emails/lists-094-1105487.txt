There isn't a really good way to do this in HTML.

The trick that people use is to make a table, and use centred alignment in
each of the cells. The cells then auto-size in many browsers, which
provides even spacing. But using tables for layout in this way is not
realy what they were meant for, and can raise accessibility problems. (For
a fuller discussion see
http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WD-WAI-PAGEAUTH-19990226. My short version is
"don't use tables for layout". Which is actually listed as a checkpoint in
the guidelines.) An alternative would be to use display:float in a
stylesheet, but I haven't tried to do that in amaya yet, so I don't know
how you do it or whether it is implemented.

  Hi. This may not be the forum for this but
  I'd like to try anyway.  I'm trying to use
  amaya 1.4a and what I'd like to do is set
  up a row of buttons (.gif's) spaced evenly
  across the page but after I insert the 
  button images and the spaces to separate them,
  re-loading the page eliminates the spaces 
  between the images.
  
  I thought I saw something on this some time
  back, but I'm unable to find it now.  Any
  suggestions to get this to work would be
  appreciated, especially if there is a  better
  way to do this.
  
  
  thanks,
