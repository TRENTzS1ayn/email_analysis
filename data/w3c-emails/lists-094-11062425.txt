Your response is music to my ears, if you'll pardon the reference. 

You seem to be saying that using Amaya only for on-screen hypertext documentation is relatively stable right now? But there are problems with tables of content and printing?

If you would be so kind, please let me know the following:

1) Are you using Amaya or other products for the TOC and X indexing? 

2) Are you generally satisfied with the speed at which the product is maturing? Or does it just seem to be an academic exercise not intended for reliable use? (If it is the former, there should be some explicit declaration to that effect on the web site.)

3) Does anyone reading this post have other suggestions for printing XML documents created in Amaya?

4) Are some of these document production problems unique to XML files as opposed to HTML files?

Thank you very much,
