I,

I found a buggg in amaya 2.4 :
when i wanted to open a file, it starts in the default amaya home directory :
/usr/bin/...
Then i "clic" several times with the mouse to the ".." charater in order to go
to my home directory. 
After that, no directories appear int the field of amaya browser for opening
file. Finalyy, to open my file, i have nno others solutions that to fill the
complete path of my html file to get it opened.

Conclusion, even if the filter is "*", no directories appears in the dialog
window for openingg a html file.
This happens a lot of times.
Otherwise, i suppose that i can modifed amaya's preferences (the menu) for
initialize the dfault directory at starting.

Thanks you for your soft that i oftenm use.


Benji.
