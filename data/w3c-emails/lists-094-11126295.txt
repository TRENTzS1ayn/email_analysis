Hi,

I think that amaya 2.4 supports HTML4.0 and with HTML4.0 we can use the
property DIR that is used to define the direction of the text either
LTR(Left to Right) or RTL(Right to Left) but I found that amaya 2.4 doesn't
support this property! Dos anyone know how use the DIR or any other way to
change the direction in amaya 2.4 but without using right justify.

Regards,
