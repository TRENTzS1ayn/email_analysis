Hi all,

Wondering if anybody out there has built Amaya on NT from the CVS base recently 
- and wants to share the binaries!

I'm really trying to do some more bug testing, and my current binary (2.4) is a 
bit old for that. If anybody has a recent NT binary and wouldn't mind helping, 
I'd be most gratefull!

Thanks
Yan
