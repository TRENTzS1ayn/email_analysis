That's surprising. Normally it works but I try to understand what occured
when you met the problem.

I suspect the document where you wanted to paste was not in Read-Only mode?
Possible eroros:
- the Cut buffer was reset when you went to the other document.
- the Edit->Paste command was disabled by error in the target document.
If you are able to reproduce the bug, could you check these two points.
