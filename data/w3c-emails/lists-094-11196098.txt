I can reproduce the bug anytime! The paste command isn't disabled and I'm in 
edit mode of course. I cut (or copy) from document A, then go into document B, 
paste, and nothing happends.

I have just checked, and it only happends if I try and copy more than one 
element. If I copy just a few words, it works OK.

Thanks
Yan
