Hello Henry,

In our previous episode, Henry Meyerding said:

It should go in the Amaya/dicopar subdirectory. If you're using Windows,
the Amaya directory is two levels above the directory where the executable
file is.

I'm not sure if you have a dicopar directory. Could you verify it and
reply back to the list so that we can fix it in the next release? In the
meantime, if the directory doesn't exist, just make a new one :)

Thanks,

-Jose
