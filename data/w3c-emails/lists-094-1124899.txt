The Win95 version of 1.4a has a serious bug
with the implementation of character style
underline.  Although text looks fine on
screen, when it is saved, instead of being
saved as the full tagging, only the

style="text-decoration: underline"

is saved, with no start or end tagging.
So instead of being marked up html, the
style is simply more text.

I've seen lots of traffic about the Win95
inability to print bug, but haven't seen
any other mentions of this problem.

Is anybody working on this?  Does the problem
also exist in the WinNT version?  And if not,
is there any way the NT version could run on
a Win95 workstation?
