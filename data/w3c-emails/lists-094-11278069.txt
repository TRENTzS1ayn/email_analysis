Any version released is supposed to run on any Win 32 platform.
Nevertheless
we noticed that if Amaya is built on Windows NT some problems may happen 
and vice versa.

The NT version of Amaya is built on 4.0 version and it is not guaranteed
that it will work fine on WINNT 3.51. You can try it and tell us about
that.

Irene is right, Win 95 version will work better on NT 3.51 than
NT 4.0 version.
