while cleaning up my hard drive I noticed I have version 2.1 ,2.2, & 2.4  I
think I have 2.1 installed (version 1 (build 272 ) comes up while you start
the program,

which brings me to the question will the next versions run faster it appears
you really need a pentium to run 2.1 as things run a bit slow (and painful)
