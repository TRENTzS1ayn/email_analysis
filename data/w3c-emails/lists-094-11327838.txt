<layer...> never was in HTML; it is a Netscapism.

Whilst I don't guarantee that Amaya handles all of these,
the correct way to do fonts is with style sheets, preferably
by applying them to an appropriate inline element, such as EM,
but, if there is no suitable element, by using the neutral 
inline element, SPAN.

The correct way of doing layer is by using absolute (or 
fixed) positioning with style sheets.  NB Netscape only
allows this on DIV, whereas any block (and possibly inline)
element should accept it.

Amaya is primarily an authoring tool for the strict version
of HTML 4, although it does have concessions to some common
usage.
