I have a problem with Amaya 2.4 on Solaris 2.6: 

The characters ???, ??? (a, o with ring or dots over them) are always 
GENERATED in their uppercased form, although Amaya displays them right when
browsing a document generated by some other editor.

It works fine with Amaya 2.4 on Linux RedHat 6.0.
The problem seems to be the same as for Amaya 0.8a, as quoted below.

Is there a workaround for me as a user?
