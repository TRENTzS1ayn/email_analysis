Hi John,

Our plan is to release the next public version end of March.

We made the most important changes we planned to do for the new
public release but the debugging is not completely finish and new
minor changes are also planned.
Today we'll deliver an intermediate release 2.5 for people who want 
help us to test it on Linux, Solaris2 and Windows NT/95.
I will send a message as soon as binaries can be downloaded.
  Irene.
