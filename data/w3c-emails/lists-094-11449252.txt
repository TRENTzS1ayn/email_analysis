Hi,

We just uploaded a pre-release version of Amaya (codename Amaya 2.5).

Since Amaya 2.4, the code has been thru extensive modifications due to the 
introduction of Unicode and UTF document handling and the introduction of
a new box model for the formatter.
The following release of Amaya 2.5 are available for people who want help us 
test this new version.
The Windows version is very fragile today. The Unix ones are quite stable.
To get an idea of the new features, have a look at the project's changelog:
