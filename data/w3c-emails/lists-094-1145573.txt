Amaya does not support VML, and there is no plan to support VML,
which is a proprietary format.  As far as 2D vector graphics
is concerned, we are much more interested in SVG:

But I should add that we don't have currently the resources
needed to implement SVG.  If anyone on this list is
interested...
