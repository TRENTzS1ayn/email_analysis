Would you please supply more detail about any quirks in the Windows version?
The changelog doesn't address this. 

Version 2.4 crashes easily under Win95, so I'd be willing to help test 2.5
if I knew what pitfalls to avoid. Would like to make an informed decision
whether to replace 2.4 with this version, before going through the uninstall
/ reinstall process. 

Thanks for this pre-release: some of the bug fixes sound useful, so I'll
definitely install under Linux.
