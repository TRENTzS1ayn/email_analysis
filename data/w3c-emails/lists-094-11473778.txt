My first attempt at "Make Book" gave the following:
--- Warning box - Title: Microsoft Visual C++ Debug Library -----
Debug assertion Failed!!
Program: \amayapath\amaya.exe
file: dbgheap.c
Line: 1017

Expression: _BLOCK_TYPE_IS_VALID(pHead->nBlockUse)
------

Upon further testing, it seems to happen when make book has to recurse into 
more than one document level, ie: Doc1 includes Doc2 which includes Doc3. I 
tried making book from Doc2, and it works fine. Doc1 and Doc2 are in directory 
m:\itatram, while doc3 is in m:\itatram\sands\.

There is a set of pages at http://jascha.ram.ac.uk/itatram/test1.html that 
demonstrate the problem. 


Second problem, the cache seems to be wrong after install: I installed in 
h:\program files\Amaya2.5\ and the cache was pointing to c:\program 
files\amaya\libwww-cache 
Amaya complained, I changed the setting, and and went OK afterwards.

Hope you can fix it. Let me know if you want me to test any further.

Bye
y.
