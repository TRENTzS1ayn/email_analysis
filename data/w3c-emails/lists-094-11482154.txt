Hi!

There are some problems with characters on a german keyboard (under
Windows 98 and under Linux). Im using Amaya 2.4.

1) Umlaute like "?" ("&auml;"), "?" ("&ouml;"), "?" ("&uuml;") are
handled correctly. But if I type their HTMl-equivalents (e.g. "&auml;")
Amaya converts them into the latin-1 characters (e.g. "?") after saving
and reloading.

2) I can use the HTML-equivalents only in the source code window because
otherwise the character "&" is converted into "&amp;". How can I avoid
this?

3) I can't reach any characters that are composed with the key "Alt Gr".
These characters are "@", "\","~", "{","[","]","}","|". I have tried to
modify the keyboard configuration files, but without success. All other
programms work fine (under Windows 98 and Linux), especially Emacs. By
the way,  with Amaya 1.0b Beta (under Linux) I don't have these
problems.

I know that there have been some messages concerning this subject; but
none really helped me.

Thank you for your help!
Wolfgang
