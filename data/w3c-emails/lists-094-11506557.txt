I tried the following URI in the location/open file input box of the
following browsers.  It worked in all of them except Amaya 2.4; those which
preferred another form (HotJava and MSIE) automatically translated it.

file:///D:/Web/html/index.htm

Platform: Win98

MSIE 5.0
Mozilla 5 Milestone 9 release
Netscape 4.70
Netscape 3.0
HotJava
Lynx 2.8.2
NCSA Mosaic 3.0

I would suggest that the preferred behavior for Amaya 2.4 (where the URI
failed) would be to behave as MSIE, to automatically convert a file URI to a
Windows pathname under the Windows environment.  Note that I wasn't able to
get Mozilla to accept a standard pathname without the file:/// protocol
(obviously the older Netscapes didn't); this, too, I'd call an undesirable
behavior.
