Problem fixed.

By default Amaya stores the cache at c:\temp\amaya\libwww-cache. This
address doesn't depend on the location where the application is installed.
It uses a different location when that location is defined in the User 
configuration file thot.rc (see in Help->Configuring Amaya about the
User configuration file).

Of course yes.
