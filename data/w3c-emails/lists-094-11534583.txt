it does look weird, but I think it is a kludge, since a colon in
that position would be taken as an indication for a port number
("P:" represents the "machine", in that syntax. Does anybody
remember VM/CMS in 1985 or so?)

file:///D:/Web/html/index.htm may be more correct, but it 
still looks funny because of the three slashes.
