You're welcome, Jose -

My old local pages used "|" in place of of ":" because that was the required
de facto standard, for the reason Maurizio mentioned. Current browsers seem
to accept the colon, so while support for the vertical line would be
convenient, I could update my old stuff if strict "file:" support were added
to Amaya. 

A looser standard would also accept the slashes going in either direction,
and would allow either 2 or 3 slashes following "file:".

Thanks to everyone who responded, especially to Patrick for the testing!

Marc
