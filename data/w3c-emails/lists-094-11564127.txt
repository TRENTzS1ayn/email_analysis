RFC 1738 has been updated by RFC 2396 but unfortunately neither have a
very practical definition of file: URIs (and file: is kind of strange in
the first place). Personally I like file:/D:/foo instead of file:///D:/foo
as is in fact unambiguous (and legal) and I think supported by most
clients.

There are a couple of functions in libwww that might do what you want, see
section "Conversion between URLs and Local File Names" in

    http://www.w3.org/Library/src/HTWWWStr.html
