I just installed Amaya 2.5pre on Linux-Mandrake 7.0. I notice that the bug
that had kept me from using 2.4 is fixed (structure view hangs when text
cursor is moved to bottom of screen). Thanks.

I am surprised, however, that there is no obvious way I can bookmark like
Lynx and Netscape allow. I think that functionality would make Amaya much
easier to use for bringing in source material from scattered sites from
time to time. Will we see bookmarking soon?

Thanks.
