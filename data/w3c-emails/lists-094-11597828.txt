I use my lynx bookmarks page as my Amaya home page, and when I want to add
something I just open it up and make a new link from it. It would be nice if
it did that automatically, but it is not really such a hassle fr me.

  I just installed Amaya 2.5pre on Linux-Mandrake 7.0. I notice that the bug

  I am surprised, however, that there is no obvious way I can bookmark like
  Lynx and Netscape allow. I think that functionality would make Amaya much
  easier to use for bringing in source material from scattered sites from
  time to time. Will we see bookmarking soon?
  
  Thanks.
