Hi,

Since I have a Voodoo 3 2000 video board, Amaya does not run
any more on my Windows 98 PC. If I use the 9x version, I only
have an illegal access message as soon as I click the icon. If I use the NT
version I get the Amaya window and immediatly a "GPF in module 3DFX16V3.drv".
This appens with all versions of Amaya, including the pre 2.5. All other 
programs work fine. I have already seen this kind of behaviour with another
board (ATI), with another HTML editor (WebExpert) and Windows NT. We had to
wait for a new version of the video driver to get things fixed.

With Linux (Redhat 6.0), on the same machine, I can not have the images
displayed properly with Amaya, they look like the scrambled screen of a TV
pay channel when you do not have a proper decoder. All other programs (Gimp,
the whole KDE stuff, Star Office, Netscape Communicator, ...) display
images correctly.

By the way, pre 2.5 I still has the no-vowels-in-dialog-boxes bug and the
right-Alt-key-has-no-effect-on-azerty-keybord bug, as with previous
versions but not on all boxes (Redhat 5.4 and 6.0 do not work, Mandrake 6.x
works fine). In any case xev properly recognizes vowels and Alt Gr (as
ModeShift). All other programs honor vowels and Alt Gr. The main problem
is that I can not get the circumflex accent: a real pain in French.

Cheers,
