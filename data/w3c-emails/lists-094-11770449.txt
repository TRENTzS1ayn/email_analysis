It just now stopped when moving the text cursor downwards. It had most of
the file to go yet. It's one of the Amaya Doc files that came with 2.5pre.

Did anyone bother checking to see if little things like scrolling work
right before putting 2.4 and now 2.5pre out? Don't people, when they write
things like Amaya, try it out and make use of it? Then didn't those
developing Amaya stumble over these broken things like the scrolling and
fix them? But 2.4 was broken (structure view hung during trivial
scrolling) and now 2.5pre, too, just broken differently, but just as
broke. 

All that work on MathML, etc., but the scrolling is still broke, rendering
the whole Amaya environment useless, MathML included, for several months
now.  I have _never_ been able to use Amaya. And I've been trying since
1.3. 

P.S. If you don't like this rant, I've got more, and not by choice.
