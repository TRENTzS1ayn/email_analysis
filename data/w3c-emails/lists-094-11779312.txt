Not easy. I'm glad some bugs were fixed, but not all is well yet. Patient
still sick.

After playing around with Amaya 2.5pre I gather a Web server did not get
set up when I installed this Mandrake 7.0. So, when trying to access my ~
directory I get "Could not load ...", or:  "The requested URL could not be
retrieved".

http://~

That is just one way I tried it. Does Amaya know about file systems
and such without needing Apache or something to coach it?

I really like your approach, if it can work. Let's get it to work.  If we
can't, without needing a local Web server running all the time, then, yes,
Amaya will have to be made file system aware, like mc. (mc. Now, there's a
browser for ya'. Not so good at rendering markup though. But it's got a
wonderful builtin editor!) 

Thanks.
