I notice that Amaya saves a local copy of my work sometimes
when it crashes. But sometimes, the nature of the crash
doesn't seem to give Amaya the chance; for example, sometimes
it hangs (i.e. goes into an infinite loop) rather than
crashing.

How about having it do that local auto-save every 10 seconds
or so, crash or no crash? That way, even if it goes into
an infinite loop and I have to kill it without giving
it a chance to save, I won't lose my work.
