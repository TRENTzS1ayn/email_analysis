Even the original Mosaic will support server side scripting providing 
the right level of HTML is generated.  The fact that you ask suggests 
that you don't understand server side scripting.  (Actually, even the 
line mode browser would support it!)  The down side to server side 
scripting is that it tends to be uncacheable, although it can be made 
cacheable.

I don't know of any non-big-2 browser that supports client side 
scripting.  Remember Amaya is not trying to compete with the big 2.  
The down sides to client side scripting are that it is not pure HTML 
and the big 2 object models don't even agree with each other.
