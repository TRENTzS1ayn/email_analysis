The windows version of Amaya doesn't access directly the video card.
It uses the standard Win32 API.

As long as we don't have this kind of video card it's difficult for us to fix
this problem. Perhaps someone working on this platform can have a look at the 
code
(Amaya/thotlib/image/picture.c) and could understand what is wrong?

Someone promised to work on this problem in January. Since then I received to 
news
from Him. If nothing happens by the end of March, I'll spend a week on it.
