Some more toying with this has identified two bugs that make it very
_difficult_, not "easy":

1. 2.5pre does not seem to honor or recognize the "~" (tilde) when used in
a local host goto. Example: /~ or whatever/any variation that is suppose
to work. The "~" does work for remote hosts. Example: http://xxx.yyy/~zzz
.

2. 2.5pre does not goto a directory, only to a file. Example: something
like /home/user1234/hotlinks.html works. /home/user1234/ (or /~user1234/) 
don't work.

I hope these have easy fixes.

All was done with ...LINUX-ELF... on Linux-Mandrake 7.0.
