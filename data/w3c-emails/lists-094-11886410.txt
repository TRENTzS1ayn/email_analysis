Besides the usual releases and pre-releases, could you have automated
daily CVS snapshots? Then, when a mention is made on this list of a bug
being fixed in, or feature added to, the CVS we can try it soon without
having to deal with CVS, or wait a few months.

A running CVS change log and bug/feature list would then be useful, too.

Another approach is a Web UI to CVS. I don't know much about that, though.

Thank you.
