I think, and you can tell from my email address that I am nothing to do
with this project except as a user. that we are supposed to surmise that
there are only a few people working on this project, and they cannot do
everything.  Certainly they cannot do everything in the short timescales
that people want between releases.  It really is a very few people, but I
don't have the figures.

I don't know about "flood", but presumably accurate reports that can
pinpoint the error would be as welcome as mine was.
