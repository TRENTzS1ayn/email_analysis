There is a web interface to CVS. It includes a changelog and a diff
mechanism. I don't know if it automatically tells you what has changed
throughout the tree or if you have to inspect directory by directory though.

  A running CVS change log and bug/feature list would then be useful, too.
  
  Another approach is a Web UI to CVS. I don't know much about that, though.
  
  Thank you.
