I would appreciate it if this were possible.  I would like to try out
the CVS version which has the fix for the bug I reported, but I feel
that I cannot allocate the time to learning CVS, which is a flexible,
and therefore compliecated, system.  Ftp or http access would suit me.
I know that to make the CVS versions as easy to install as the releases
would be extra work, but I think this would give you more people able
to offer you relevant bug reports and, possibly, fixes.

I applaud this constructive suggestion.
