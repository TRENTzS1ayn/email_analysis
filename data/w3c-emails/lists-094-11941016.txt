If you want to change completely your Amaya parameters (language, colors and 
default
font sizes) you have to restart the application. But if you just want to zoom

you have a command in the menu Views that proceeds it immediately. 
Perhaps that feature is not available in Midnight Commander and that changes 
too your
habits.
