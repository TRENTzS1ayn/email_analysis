The following was the first response to my rant in 2.5pre: 
Irrecoverable.... I thought it excellent and asked John if I might post
it. It does help in determining the truth of the state of maturity of
Amaya on other prominent platforms, despite occasional remarks indicating
otherwise.

Nice to know there's another non-coder out there similarily situated.

And, it's true: we often don't get what we don't pay for. For those of us
of limited means, however, it is nice that publicly available tools like
Amaya are there, just like sidewalks, elevators and libraries.
