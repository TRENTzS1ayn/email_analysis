This is good, but for those of us unfamiliar with CVS it would be
excellent if if were possible to automate the construction of a
release (in the usual format) from the CVS base.  Then one need not
have CVS to use it.  I am unfamiliar with CVS, so I don't know how
easy this is.  Of course, "Everything is possible for the man who
doesn't have to do it himself"! :-)
