This is my personal statement. Let me clarify again that I am not part of
the Amaya team - my work at W3C is on accessibility. I just use Amaya
because I like it, and try to help people use it where I think I have
something to contribute.

The potential accessibility problems are caused by doing certain specific
things with tables - for more details refer to the URI I gave (below). In
practise, using a table to neatly display a row of images or short text
links does not usually cause problems, although the new W3C styles have
stopped using tables in this way.

In an ideal world I would recommend that Amaya not use this either. But it
is not of crucial importance, and is a use pattern which should disappear
as the implementation of style sheets is improved. So I am happy that the
Amaya team puts its energy into doing more important things.

  Then, Why is it used in the Amaya startup page? Or is this your personal
  statement?

  It is done (with text buttons, but that's no problem) in the Amaya startup
  page! See the blue line at the bottom.
  file:${AMAYAHOME}/thot/amaya/AmayaPage.html, I could not find the page on
  http://www.w3.org/.
