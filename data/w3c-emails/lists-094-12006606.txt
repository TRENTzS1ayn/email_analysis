Ok, there are probably good reasons (code complexity, for one) reasons for
this, but, the real problem is not having it be obvious (I know, this is
why I thought it was a bug and lost time on it) that Apply does not always
mean "Instantly".

So, how about grouping those parameters that require an Amaya restart all
together in a neat little box with a little note saying, like, any changes
will take effect the next time Amaya is started up? 

It would still be nice for them to take effect instantly, but, if not, a
little note about that would be really nice right there in the chooser
box. 

Thank you.
