  I already do snapshots of other softwares present in the W3C CVS tree
(namely libwww and libxml). However Amaya is quite a bit larger, it's not
much the size taken by a checkout on the server but rather be sure that
all the relevant files are actually on CVS and maybe avoiding the auto
generated ones.
  So technically generating a tar file from a CVS checkout on a regular
basis isn't hard, but making sure taht this checkout is useful is. Would
you candidate to report problems if I generate such a periodic checkout ?
