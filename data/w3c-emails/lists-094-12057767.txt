  Ok generating such a tar is a no-brainer, but there is no guarantee
associated. Remember too that you will need Motif (or a decent motif clone
I don't know how far lesstif is usable with Amaya) to compile it on Unices.
It's also a rather large tar, some of the stuff can certainly be avoided,
if so send me the file names I will exclude them from the archive build:

   ftp://ftp.w3.org/pub/amaya/amaya-snapshot.tar.gz

It will be regenerated once a day around 0:40 EST
Basically all the compilation requirements applies:

  Source only, sorry but a compiled version would be far to hard
to automate.

<actually>
there were tools for that developped in the mozilla project
I can't remember the name, but I don't feel like instlling this on
one of the W3C servers. VA Research even just proposed suc a service
for open source projects, check slashdot last week articles if you're
interested.
