The main reasons that could generate an infinite loops is a cycle in the 
structure chaining. If the cycling code doesn't call from time to time the
event handler (which is very often the case), the program never goes out
the infinite loop and cannot be stopped except by a kill.
The infinite loop is the more terrific problem in a program.
