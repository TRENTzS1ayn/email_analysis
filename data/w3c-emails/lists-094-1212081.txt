Hi,

We have made an application based on Thot library. We would like to port
it on Windows.
We are using the library and the Makefile from Amaya's distribution to
compile it.

The application is running, but there are no windows : We can't show the
main window, which allows us to open some files. This is the same window
as the first window we show in ThotEditor. (We can show this window in
the Linux version).

The question is : How can we get this window to be shown?

In general, has Thot's porting on Windows been made specifically for
Amaya, or is it available for any other application based on the Thot
library?

Is there some documentation about Thot's porting on Windows? (I have
read the page http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Win-Compiling.html)

Thank's for your answer.

Eric
