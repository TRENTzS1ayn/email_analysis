CTRL-UP and CTRL-DN scroll up and dowm but don't move the current selection.
UP and DN move the selection then scroll if necessary. The bug occurs in the
part of the code that checks if the scroll is necessary or not.
As Amaya works on partial formatted document, it believes that it's the end 
or the top of the document and doesn't scroll.
I know exactly where the bug occurs. I just need time to fix it.
Thanks for the bug analysis
