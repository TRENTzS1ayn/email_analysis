Thanks, Daniel -

Today's snapshot is around 14Mb, versus 4Mb for the source tarball in the
same directory (amaya-src-2.4.tgz). Does this sound correct, or might there
be a -lot- of extraneous files included?

Also, I noticed that the 2.5pre files are being distributed via http at a
different location:

http://www.w3.org/Amaya/Distribution/

Is there a reason for the different but overlapping content of these ftp and
http sites, or would it be practical to synchronize them?
