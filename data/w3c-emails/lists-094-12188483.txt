The script that generates the standard source tarfile is available on the CVS 
base
Amaya/batch/tarSourcesAmaya.
Daniel, I suggest you use it. It will make the tar smaller.

I checked also the public CVS base and saw that it includes some obsolete 
files which
were removed form the original CVS base.
This could explain part of the 10 Mb difference and is very annoying for 
people who
check out the Amaya code from the public CVS base.
I guess there is a problem in the process which updates the public CVS base.

It's not a real policy. The W3C http site is easily accessible for the whole 
W3C team,
but it's not the case of the W3C ftp site.
