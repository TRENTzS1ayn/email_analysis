I was trying to change:
        <li>9th: <a
         
href="http://www.w3.org/XML/Group/2000/02/xml-schema-ftf.html">3-4
          Feb 2000 in Berkeley, </a>
          <ul>
            <li><a
           
href="2000/02/xml-schema-ftf-2000-02-minutes">minutes</a></li>
          </ul>
to:
        <li>9th: <a
         
href="http://www.w3.org/XML/Group/2000/02/xml-schema-ftf.html">3-4
          Feb 2000 in Berkeley, </a>
          <a
            href="2000/02/xml-schema-ftf-2000-02-minutes">minutes</a>

by selecting the <a>minutes</a>, cutting it, and pasting it
after "Berkeley, ".

One surprise: when I cut <a>minutes</a>, the enclosing <li> and <ul>
go away. That seems odd... Amaya doesn't prevent me from creating
a <ul> with a <li> with nothing inside, so I don't know why it
gets rid of ul and li just because I cut the contents of the li.

Then when I paste after "Berkeley, ", they come back! So the ul
and li seemed to go in the cut buffer! Strange!

So I went into the show-source view, selected <a>minutes</a>, and then
hit down arrow in the structures window. The normal view went nutso,
scrolling and redisplaying, and finally locking into (what appears to
be)
an infinite loop.
