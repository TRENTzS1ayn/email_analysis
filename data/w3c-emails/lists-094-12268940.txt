Dan,

The simplest way to achieve the result you expect is to
put the caret at the beginning of "minutes" and press
the BackSpace key. One single keystroke and you are done!

Obviously Amaya should also allow you to do it the way you
tried, without looping indefinitely. It should not either
delete more than what you selected.  I am sure Irene will
look into this quickly.

Vincent.
