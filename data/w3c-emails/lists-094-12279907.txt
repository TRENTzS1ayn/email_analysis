This may have been asked long since - but is syntax highlighting planned
for the source code view in future releases of Amaya?

The main reason I *like* highlighting is that it eases eyestrain and
makes editing easier - at least for me.

I am new to Amaya but am falling further in love with it each evening. The
structure view, in particular, has no equal.
