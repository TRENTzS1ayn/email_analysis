There is no *correct* way of displaying overlapping
elements (you mean't elements, not tags), as they
represent a syntax error in HTML.

(SGML based tools are likely to close the I on seeing
the </STRONG> and delete the </I>, but this is undefined
error recovery behaviour.  Tag soup parsers are likely to
treat the </STRONG> as though it were </I></STRONG><I>, although,
internally they would maintain two independent flags for bold and
italic and not go through the intermediate everything off state.

If Amaya were to wish to render them like the popular tag soup
browsers, it would need to really transform them into the close,
close, open sequence.)

<STRONG>Hello, <I>I'm </I>doing fine</STRONG>

Nested tags should display according to the style sheet.
