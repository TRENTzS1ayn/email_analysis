Using the Solaris 2.6 version of Amaya 2.4. When I have CAPS LOCK on I get
everything in caps except numbers and punctuation keys. However,  using the
shift key in combination with the CAPS LOCK produces no output at all. The
problem is when someone wants to use CAPS LOCK to type a whole paragraph, but
then try to use parentheses in the paragraph, they have to turn off CAPS LOCK
first. Is there a fix for this, maybe via xmodmap? I tried playing with xmodmap
but had no luck.

Thanks,
