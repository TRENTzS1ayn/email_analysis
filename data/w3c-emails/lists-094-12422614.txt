For lack of automatic saving, we can provide the possibility to 
make a temporary save of the file, at the user request. This will be 
particularly useful when you want to work on a remote file.

The file would be saved in the local temporary space of the user
and would be removed when the file would be normally unloaded, after a 
save or not.
After a crash Amaya would get:
- the saved version (as it works today)
- if there is no saved version, the last saved temporary version
- in other case the file located at the given URI.

  Irene.
