Trying to build yesterday afternoon's cvs tarfile I ran out of disk 
space.  I cleared out some stuff, then got a few things built then:
ranlib ../../libz.a

I cannot find a file to give you an identifier for which snapshot it 
was that I picked up.  I have done the pre-configure setup for libwww
as described on the web.   It would be nice to have a rough idea of
how much disk space this thing should take to build, though I know
this will vary across platforms....
