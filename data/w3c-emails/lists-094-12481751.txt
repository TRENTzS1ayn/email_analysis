Hello Hugh,

Thanks for your report. Already I see that a bug is that the libwww
that was put in the tar file wasn't checked out from CVS using the
Amaya tag. 

Besides making the tar file a bit bigger, you're also missing three files
which I have changed on the libwww/amaya tree, but not yet committed to
the public libwww one, as I'm still testing them.

I'll continue looking at the problem as I think that something else
is missing and I'll mail the results to the list later on (or more likely,
tomorrow morning :).

-Jose
