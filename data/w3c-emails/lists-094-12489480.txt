Evening All,

I just pulled up Amaya for the first time in a while, and went to create a
new HTML file. I noticed something that was a little odd, though. I seem to
recall a text box where the user can enter a title for the page (In the
WYSIWYG view), but that does not seem to be there now.

I am running Amaya as extracted from CVS Today (21 Mar) at 8:30 AM EST,
built on Win95, using Visual C++ v6.0 SP3.0

I'll check it again tomorrow morning to be sure, and I'll let you know.
My only question is, do I need to flush out the source tree and
recheckout/configure/build?

Thanks in advance...
Gary Klesczewski
