This happens because while trying a HTTP/1.x request it got back a 0.9 r
esponse without headers. Trying to deal with it would therefore be "hack
ing it up". I don't know why a server would send that unless it is broke
n.

You can of course set the protocol version in the HTHost object if you w
ant to change it, see

What happened to doing your homework ;)
