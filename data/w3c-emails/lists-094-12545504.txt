I guess it's a problem within the internal Amaya code. It seems that there is
a set of screens that generates this kind of trouble.
It will be helpful for us to access this material and see what is wrong in the 
code.
Could you give the characteristics of your screen: the screen depth? number of 
colors?
  Irene.
