Just a quick note to let you know I have successfully compiled Amaya on an
Amiga 1200 running NetBSD (m68k-cbm-netbsd1.3) - the machine uses a
Motorola 68060 processor with 32MB memory.

No substantial problems were encountered (once I realised I was using BSD
Make rather than GNU Make :-) although one file did need a #define
changing - sorry I have mislaid the note I made of the file name, it did
already have a define in place for __FreeBSD__ which needed modifying to
say __FreeBSD__ or __NetBSD__

I will be subscribing to the mailing list and keeping up to date with
future developments.
