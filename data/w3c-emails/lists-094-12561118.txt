Hello Matthias,

In our previous episode, Matthias N?ckles said:

Amaya doesn't support Javascript. Unfortunately, our development team
is quite small and we don't have enough spare work force to work on this
aspect. 

Our CVS base is public and if someone is interested in working on integrating
Javascript, s/he can count on us for technical advice.

Best greetings,

-Jose
