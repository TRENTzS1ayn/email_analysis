Hello

This is a rather trivial remark but I did think that the ``fruit tree''
icon for amaya was a little on the grey side. So I have (not
brilliantly) coloured in the gif file. I am attaching it so that you can
use it if you want.

I also have a sliightly smaller .png version which I use for the
launcher icon on my GNOME task bar. I could do other file types/sizes if
you want them.

Thanks for a great piece of software.

Dan
