Hi,

It's not a fruit tree but a flower tree. Nevertheless we agree it was a little
insipid and we adopt your new colored tree with the new 3.0 release.
What we also would like to change is to make smaller and colored icons that 
appears
in the math palette and the future graphics palette. All these icons are in 
the xpm
format and located in the source tree within the directory Amaya/amaya/xpm

Thanks
  Irene.
