Been going thro' the doc came with the latest Amaya (1.4a) but still not
sure how one can build Amaya with the plugin and java support for win95
(the mentioned way to config seems to apply for Unix only)...

Also, any plans to distribute the Amaya src with native VC++ dsw and dsp??
VC6 just wrap up the available .mak into another makefile which makes it
very difficult to see the entire structure and making further changes etc.
