Hello Karl-Michael,

Thanks for your report. Your analysis is correct.

First some context.  When following a URL, Amaya always verifies that 
this URL is not shown in another window. If this is the case, Amaya just
raises that window, rather than downloading the same page again. 
As Amaya is an editor, it's important not to open the same document twice
on two windows, to avoid confusing the user.

The problem comes from the function that verifies if the URL is already loaded
(init.c:IsDocumentLoaded ()), systematically adds a '/' to the URL we're
trying to check. If you remove this concatenation, then your problem
disappears.

Why is this concatenation added? We think it was done for trying to save
an extra request to the server. In principle, this is OK, but it shouldn't
add the '/' char, Furthermore, the check should also happen after loading
a URL, to take into account eventual URL rewrites on the server side.

We made some experiments without the '/' contactenation and with the
second check. Things seem to work better, but a bit more of work is
needed, to avoid opening the same document in two windows.

Because of the deadline for this release, we weren't able to fix up the
'/' problem in time, so we decided to leave it as it is. We'll continue 
working on it so that this is solved for the next release.

Thanks for your patience,

-Jose
