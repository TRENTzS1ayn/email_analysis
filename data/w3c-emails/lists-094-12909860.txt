Is there some reason that within the Windows Amaya 3.2
    package, the menu language is not consistent with
    Windows standards.......  for example:

[1] shortcut keys are given in lower instead of upper case
  
[2] the + sign is not there 

for example Print   Alt+P  is standard nomenclature
                  Print   Alt p   is Amaya .....

Also since there is no such thing as a return key on 
   standard keyboards   the shortcut for br element 
  should be  Ctrl+Enter  !!!!
