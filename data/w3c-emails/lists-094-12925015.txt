A lot of good work has been done in this version.
Many of the color issues that i had with 3.1 have been cleared up.
There are still display problems of course and I include a list
of observations... these were made in a windows 95 environment
with 256 color / 640 x 480 screen  -----  as well as on a 
win 98 800x600 , tru color machine ......   your mileage may vary!!

An issue that is still a problem is that Amaya uses a pallette that
gives poor colors on a 256 color screen .... two examples are the 
rendering of the yellow sidebar on w3.org and the signon html 
Welcome to Amaya page background.

Things that need looking at first though are div align="center"
not working, table borders, and floating images.....
all are display oriented difficulties....
