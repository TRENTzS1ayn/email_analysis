The scroll bar action for jump one screen is not correct in the
    source view window....
If the original display is 640x480 the click to move a page 
    misses lines when it shows new material.
If the original display is 800x600, the click doesnt lose lines
but the correct action is to leave one line from the old screen
on the new one for continuity .....  ie if the scroll was downtext
the original last line would be top line of new display.....  this
isnt happening !!!   i suspect that the scrolling routine is
 not taking into account the actual size of the window .....
resizing  window  may produce even more dramatic (tramatic)
 effects....
