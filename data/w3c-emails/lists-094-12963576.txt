The W3C help page says that "Links are usually displayed in blue (or underlined
on monochrome displays)." I'm running Amaya on a remote Linux host with a color
graphics card and let it display on my monchrome SUN monitor. Of course, links
are not displayed underlined, and on a monochrome display, blue looks almost
identical to black. After some fiddling around with the color settings, a found
DarkGrey2 an acceptible color for text, so I can distinguish normal text from
links.

It would be a good idea to let the user decide whether links are displayed
in blue or underlined (or in any other color).
