  I dunno what you are doing wrong, if any. For some reason the 
shared libray loader either don't find libXm.so.1 or can't load it,
see the man page of ldconfig for more informations.
  
Here is what I suggest:

    - Install the PPC version of OpenMotif:
  http://rpmfind.net/linux/RPM/linuxPPC/contrib/software/Libraries/X11/openmotif-2.1.30-1.ppc.html
      You may have to remove lesstif first to avoid file conflicts ...
      rpm -i ftp://rpmfind.net/linux/linuxPPC/contrib/software/Libraries/X11/openmotif-2.1.30-1.ppc.rpm

    - grab the latests amaya sources RPM
      ftp://rpmfind.net/pub/amaya/amaya-3.2-1.src.rpm

    - then as root, try a rebuild:
      rpm --rebuild amaya-3.2-1.src.rpm

    - if this works that generates an amaya-3.2-1.ppc.rpm
      install it

    - if the amaya binary produced works, either upload it to
      linux PPC contrib site or send me a mail so I get it to
      install it at ftp://rpmfind.net/pub/amaya/
