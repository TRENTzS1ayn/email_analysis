Another behaviour of Amaya that I find really annoying is that when it finishes
loading a page into a window, this window puts itself in the foreground, i.e.
rotates up to the top of the window hierarchy (I'm running under Unix/X11).
This should be subject to the choice of the user in some configuration menu.

Thanks,

Karl-Michael
