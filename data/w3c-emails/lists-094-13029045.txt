I agree the standard values are not well adapted to small screens
but is it reasonable to manage multi-views on small screen when you
know that Windows pops up the view that receives the focus?

the formatted view receives the focus, so you source view is hidden 
by the formatted view.

This is because the source view is not really a view. It uses the position 
and the dimension of the structure view. So you should change the values
of the structure view.

We don't plan to spend time for improving the current strategy.

I'm not sure it should be

These tables fix constraints which are unsolvable.

This lets Amaya display the same document in source mode and formatted
mode.

That appears with invalid HTML.

Amaya generates the ISO-latin code but no entity.

Windows is limited in that domain and we need a lot of shortcuts.
If we can use Shift an no-Shift we will have twice shortcuts.
