Usually I have several applications running at the same time. So while Amaya
is taking some time to load a page, I am typing input into another application.
Then suddendly, Amaya pops up in the foreground and my typed characters go into
the Amaya window instead into the other application where they should go. This
is very annoying. What's the problem with making another menu entry to configure
whether Amaya should go in the foreground when finished loading or not? I want
to focus my attention to Amaya when I decide that it's time to do so, not when
Amaya decides that I should pay attention to it.
