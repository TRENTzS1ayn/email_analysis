I think this popup feature is annoying as well.  Who is in charge in this
situation, the user or the computer?  If my manager asks me for some kind
of report I will provide it, but I won't interrupt his meeting to give it
to him, unless he tells me to.  If the browser is not on the top of the
window stack it is because the user doesn't want it there right now.
