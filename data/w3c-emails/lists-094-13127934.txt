The page http://www.w3.org/History displays a problem
within Amaya that can be fixed in several ways.
It is a list of files with icons to spiffy the display.  It is a 
common type of screen seen in ftp work as well.
The difficulty is that the icon size is slightly larger than
what Amaya makes as an assumption for the default size.
This causes page redraws that exhibits itself as a fast
flicker on Pentiums.  However on a slower machine such as
a 486 it looks very ugly  and especially on longer pages !!!
Now for the fix (pick either a] or b] as appropropriate.
[a] choose a slightly larger default assumption that will cover
    most of these repeated icon displays.  Obviously not every
    situation can be handled but it appears other browsers are
    using a default that works.
[b] choose not to support older hardware but DOCUMENT this
    design choice on the website documentation page.  It can
    be a page of caveats that state things like:
   Designed for Pentiums -- 486/386 will run but expect slow
   renderings of some screens
   Designed for 16 bit color or better -- 256 color mode can be
   used but some colors are dithered.
   Transparent GIFS are not incorporated -- reason ???     etc. etc.
The group is rightly putting its efforts into some worthwhile 
  features that demonstrate the thrust of w3.org towards operable
 standards.  But potential users should be made wary of  design
  decisions that may annoy or prevent them from working with 
  Amaya.
