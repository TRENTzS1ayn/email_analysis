This help menu item places the user in a window where they
have no address entry box or any way of knowing what the address
is of the page they are viewing ....   this is unfortunate in two
respects ....
[a] they cant file this in memory for browsing straight to page.
[b] the page that is currently pointed at is not the root of all 
     Amaya info.
A suggested repair is to both point this item to www.w3.org/Amaya
so all info on amaya can be accessed and  provide a status bar
  notation of the page one is on!
