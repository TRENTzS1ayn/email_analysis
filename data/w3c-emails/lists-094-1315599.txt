Hi,

I use Amaya for most of my HTML editing.

Recently, I wanted to create an "infinity symbol". I discovered that the SGML
markup entity for the symbol is &infin; (I think I found this on the Unicode
Web site (http://www.unicode.org/)). I couldn't work out how to enter unusual
entities in Amaya, so I resorted to inserting it with Emacs to see if it would
render correctly. It renders correctly in Amaya and MSIE 4.0, but not Netscape
4.5 or HotJava 1.1.5.

However, now I get to my bug report:

After editing the file containing &infin; in Amaya 1.4a on Solaris, the file
is saved with the Yen symbol (? - ISO8859-1 code 0xA5, Unicode 0x00A5) instead
of my hand-edited entity reference which should be unicode 0x221E, Symbol font
code 0xA5.

The same thing has happened with other SGML entities I have tried which are
not in ISO8859-1 (eg &alefsym; turn into ?).

Thanks,
  Scott Davis
