This is a very good start on a Table of Contents and lead off
document for the docs folder.  There are spots where it could be
improved though.

Four files in the docs folder are not referenced by manual.html and
could be easily included.
1] HTML.html is referenced by the doc creating.html and could be
    mentioned as a subheading in manual.html
2] Transform.html is referenced by changing.html and could be 
    mentioned as a subheading in manual.html
3] Registry.html is not referenced.  A pointer to it would be
   appropriate  in config.html and a mention in manual.htm
4] CSS.html is not referenced.  pointers from manual and an
    associated doc are needed.
