I have discovered a peculiarity of using css text-decoration on
 anchor elements when done in conjunction with an authoring
 technique used by Amaya documentors .........
a { text-decoration: underline}    
  affects a  href="foobar"  elements as anticipated.
  but it also underlines a name="dingus"  as well.
  this looks very peculiar when reviewing help documentation
  as  the doc authors  use  
  <a name="xyz">the starting title</a>  quite often......

Could someone check if this interpretation of the css action
is mandated ---- it sure is not a desireable side effect and 
should be shut off unless the specification makes it required.

If that is true then the doc writers should revise their labeling
technique to   <a name="foobar"></a> Opening line   .....
