this file has a date of 1997 and needs to be edited.
for example it states there are two files called thot.ini
   and .thotrc  .... neither of these exist on my win98 version

but i do have win-thot.rc in /amaya/config    and
    thot.rc in my /users/john   folder ...... 

and still looking for a good spot in configue.html to reference it
