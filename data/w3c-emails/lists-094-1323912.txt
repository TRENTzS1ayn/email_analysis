Hi,

When using "Make Book", it is very easy to edit the output (eg to remove extra
headers and footers), and click the save button before realising that this is
an aggregate document which should not be saved, as that overwrites the
original Table of Contents page.

Would it be possible for the "Make Book" function to rename the "current"
document, so that if the user clicks save, the book document gets saved to
docBook.html instead of overwriting the doc.html that it was dericed from?

Thanks,
  Scott Davis
