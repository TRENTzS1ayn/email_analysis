How does Amaya handle the POST method in a <form> with a relative URL?
For example, go to http://arxiv.org/format/cs/0007009
The first three forms on this page (for creating PostScript and PDF) have a
GET method while the last form (DVI) has a POST method with
action="/dvi/cs/0007009". Amaya cannot load this file. Is this a bug in Amaya
or should the method be GET rather than POST?
