Hello Kyle,

It seems that the multikey feature is enabled in your copy of Amaya. 
Multikey is useful when you want to type letters with accents. For example,
you would type "'" then "e" to have a e' (imagine that that is really
an acute e).

Go to the Special/Preferences/General menu and turn off the Enable
multi-key option. If this option is already turned off, then it's a
different kind of error!
