Hello Karl-Michael,

In our previous episode, Karl-Michael Schneider said:

The HTML in that page is OK. What can be discussed is using a POST for getting
the file, as it's not justified in this case.

I tested it and it works for me (under Linux). The relative URLs are well 
solved in all the above cases.

Note that the DVI file is in fact a .tar.gz file, as noted in the download
page. However, the file that is returned doesn't say so (0007009 is the
file name). I renamed it to test.tgz, and I was then able to make a
tar -xzf and read the dvi file.

Did you try to change the filename when Amaya proposes you to download it?
