Hi,

This is the list of things we did when we built Amaya on SGI platforms

1) adding the option  -fsigned-char. I guess the Amaya configure already does 
that

2) when Makefiles were generated by configure we removed in SGI/amaya/Makefile 
   SGI/thotlib/Makefile the linking options
   " -lnsl -lsocket"
   because that libraries doen't exist on this platform.

I hope that helps
