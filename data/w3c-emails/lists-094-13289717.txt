Three short notes on css in Amaya:

[1] A:Link  allows chosing the colors for link  but not the 
     text-decoration style. I am trying to underline!
    This is the same for other pseudo classes visited and active.

[2] Text decoration styles under, over, and thru  work on 
   other elements such as Span and Strong but BLINK does not.
   Even though blink is distasteful to many, it is in the CSS1 spec
   so it should work. 

[3] I cant find a place in the browser that lets my 
     Amaya.css override the css on the webpage.
    This is necessary for accessibility.
