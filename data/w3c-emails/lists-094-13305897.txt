Karl has been a great help.  he submitted his
settings which underlined hyperlinks well. 
and mine didn't ... after a bit of experimenting
 I resolved the difficulty to 
 A:LINK { text-decoration:underline}  DOES NOT WORK
 a:link {text-decoration:underline} WORKS!

THE CSS1 SPECIFICATION IS VERY CLEAR in that
 pseudo classes are case - insensitive ..... 
this is a glitch to be resolved ... [sweatband off!]
