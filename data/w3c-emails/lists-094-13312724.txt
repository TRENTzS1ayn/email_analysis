Perhaps the unix environment is different but Windows
users expect their settings to be retained when the program
closes..... for example I have to toggle the EDITOR MODE off
each time i run Amaya.  The action should remember that
i toggled it off .... then when I, the user, chooses to select
editor mode, it is enabled..... it is a philosophical thing about
who should be in control,  the user or the program designer !!!
