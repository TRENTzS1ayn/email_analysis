You can insert the set of entities with the greek palette provided by the Math
button.
The only problem is that in 1.4a version Amaya generates a span around the 
entity.
We're fixing this bug in the next release, but today you have to remove this 
span
by hand.

I tested that on the 1.4a version and it worked well: &infin; remains &infin; 
after
a save.
