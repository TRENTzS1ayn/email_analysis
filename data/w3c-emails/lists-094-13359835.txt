Hi,

It seems like there is a problem with the automatic recovery mechanism in
Amaya (v3.2 binary for Solaris 2). I opened a document of mine, did some
changes, saved to disk, then tried some modifications that crashed Amaya.
When I re-started Amaya, I got a dialogue box saying:

  Your previous session failed. Do you want to reload your backup document?

I accepted the reload, but instead of the document I had open at the time of 
the crash, I got the default page that Amaya is configured to open on startup.

If it is of interest, I was doing the following when Amaya crashed:

- I selected a whole table row (using the ESC key twice)
- I copied it (Ctrl C) into the paste buffer
- I placed the insertion point at the end of the row after which I wanted to 
  insert the paste buffer
- I pasted the paste buffer (Ctrl Y), which caused Amaya to crash with a 
  "Thot irrecoverable error"

I was not able to produce the error a second time.

By the way, the File/Open_document... dialogue box still doesn't display all
the directories in the Solaris 2 version; the list of subdirectories is 
truncated. This might be a Motif-related problem, though, as the same 
directory shows just fine on the Win98 version.

Peace,

Bertrand Ibrahim.
