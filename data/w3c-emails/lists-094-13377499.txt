Just tried to view the page
 http://home.netscape.com/browsers/future/gecko.html
it is a massive jumble of gibberish
if i save the file to local directory (but no images)
  it is perfectly readable
i tried to unselect the download images option to simulate 
     this on line but the on line pages still displayed images
     and jumble continued  ...   
[1] does the selector for download images function
[2] what causes jumble on the page ???
