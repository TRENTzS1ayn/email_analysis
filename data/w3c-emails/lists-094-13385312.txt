Using the version of Amaya that I pulled
out of CVS this moring (July 10, 2000),
I was able to view this page properly. 

Until a resized Amaya's window a couple
of times; it then indeed became jibberish. 

I hit the "reload" button and the page
was fixed; but when I resized Amaya's
window again, the page was messed up
again. 

This page 
(http://home.netscape.com/browsers/future/gecko.html )
does not seem to have any HTML errors in it. 

At certain times, Amaya seems to want to render 
the second un-numbered list right on top of the 
first one. 

As far as I know, there is no way to disable
inline images.
