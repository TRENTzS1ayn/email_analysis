It seems that detected the previous crash but the temporary file was not saved
successfully. As it cannot read the saved file, it displays the Home page.

I tried to do the same experiment but like you I was not able to reproduce the 
bug.

We use a system function for getting the list of files and directories and the
bug is in that function which stop the list as soon as it meets a link.
We need to use a different function but as we plan to move to GTK, we didn't
invest time in this change.
