I have noticed that the address dialog  needs the http:
part to find a page.... This seems to be consistant with
  Amaya goals to train one to use correct syntax.....
However there is an inconsistancy in that one can 
access files on a local disk with a simple
  \fred\file.htm
One should be required to add the file: component !
If any default is to be allowed ( and i am not sure that any
    should) ,  it should be consistant with all other browsers
 which assume http:  if no service indicated ......
This would allow users to transfer skills from one application
to another -- a highly desireable goal in these days of 
information overload and endless new apps....
