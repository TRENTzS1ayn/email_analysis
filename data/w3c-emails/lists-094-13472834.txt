[DJW:]  Please no.  One of the reasons for bad HTML
is that browsers render it as users expect.  tidy is
designed to be used server side to take drafts, e.g. 
from broken authoring tools, and convert them into valid
HTML.  If everyone has tools that make bad HTML viewable,
there is no incentive to serve good HTML in the first place,
and every incentive to exploit every new, undocumented, browser
feature.

If you use Amaya as an editor, and its fixup of the page 
is unacceptable, it would seem reasonable to run something
like tidy separately.  However, why are you not authoring in
Amaya in the first place?
