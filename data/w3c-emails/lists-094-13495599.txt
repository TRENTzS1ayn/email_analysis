Hi Karl,

Your submit button doesn't provide an attribute name which is mandatory and 
should
be sent to the server.
I suspect that your server in the first three forms doesn't take care about 
the parameter.
It's why the result is OK.
I suggest you to set the attribute name instead of the attribute value.
