Hello,

Amaya 3.2 is ignoring the alignment attribute for the image tag.  I've seen
reports for this bug in the archives dating back as far as June 30, 1997 and
as recently as April 16, 1999 with v1.4a.  Has this problem been deemed
unimportant and therefore a very low priority?  With all due respect, IMHO,
as long as basic rendering errors like this occur, I don't understand how
Amaya can have much value.

respectfully,
Steve Antonio
