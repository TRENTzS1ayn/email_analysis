It's not a bug, as it is not an attribute in HTML 4.0[1]
strict, which is what Amaya claims to implement.

There are precedents for Amaya tolerating transitional
features and even broken HTML, but its a policy decsion
for the developers as to the extent that they stray 
outside their brief.

Amaya should definitely not be capable of inserting
an align attribute.

If it fails to honour equivalent alignment information
specified using styles, you have grounds for complaining.
