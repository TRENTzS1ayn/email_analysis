[DJW:]  The result is undefined for both strict and
transitional versions of HTML 4.01; there is no 
height attribute for tables.  The problem with height
and tables is that it frustrates incremental rendering,
whereas width can facilitate it.  width is allowed, even
in the strict DTD.

[DJW:]  
If one makes the assumption that height maps to
the style sheet attribute of the same name, this is
probably wrong.  Actually, HTML 4.01 transitional requires
images to be scaled if a height attribute is specified.  
CSS2 permits, but doesn't require (may) scaling based on 
width, but says nothing about height (replaced elements, like
IMG, only).  (Allowing scaling for width only may be an oversight,
but is quite likely to be because of concerns about incremental
rendering, in cases where the replaced objects height is not
known early.)

Although an interaction between overflow from a style sheet and
and height from an attribute is probably a grey area, I would
tend to say that this handling of image is broken.

[DJW:]  CSS2 basically says that it depends on the setting
of height and overflow CSS properties.  height defaults
to auto and overflow to visible.

min-height and max-height also affect the result.
