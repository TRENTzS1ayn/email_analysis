One of the annoying things that occurs in Amaya is
the screen scrolling function.
Using page down or clicking on the large move zone of
the scroll bar does move the page down but in a 
fashion peculiar to Amaya.  It doesn't retain one
or two lines for continuity.  For example, if first display
shows lines 1 - 20, the next will show  21 to 40.
most other editors and browsers would show 
20 - 39  on second  or even 19 -38. 
This leaves viewer with some sense of continuity.
No, it isnt a bug but a creature comfort that keeps
me going back to TextPad to create my pages 
 followed by a pass through tidy.
The only browser i have found that simulates Amaya
action on this is HotJava ;-] ;-]
