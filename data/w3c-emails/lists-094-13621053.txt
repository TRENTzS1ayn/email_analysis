Aaah, that's a bit trickier. It requires finding that it is amaya, finding
out what is wrong, and then finding the time to write some code to fix it.
The Amaya team are small, dedicated, and very overstretched. I think they
generally do a pretty good job of responding, although they are not able to
solve every problem immediately.

  Now, how about somebody responding so promptly to the situations where it's
  amaya that's broken.
