Yes, there are - I recall seeing them somewhere. But I don't recall where.

  Hi,
  
  when I was browsing through directories Amaya for Win95 created on my
  system, I've found in the config directory some files with names en-*, fr-*,
  and de-*. I would like to create similar files cz-* with translation to the
  Czech language. Are there any guidelines how to do it?
