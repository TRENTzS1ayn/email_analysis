Hi,

Do anyone know when Amaya will include some more CSS2 functionality? I
especially miss the part automatic counters and numbering (section 12.5
in the CSS2 spec.)

Instead of using this silly "section numbering" feature inside Amaya, I
think that a much cleaner solution would be to simply using CSS2
instead. Here is an exceprt from the spec. that inserts a section number
before h1 and h2 titles, just to illustrate what I mean

H1:before {
  content: "Chapter " counter(chapter) ". ";
  counter-increment: chapter;  /* Add 1 to chapter */
  counter-reset: section;      /* Set section to 0 */
}

H2:before {
  content: counter(chapter) "." counter(section) " ";
  counter-increment: section;
}


Cheers
