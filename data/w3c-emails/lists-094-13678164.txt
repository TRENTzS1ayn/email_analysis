For the page at
http://www.carbonecho.com/html/amayaCrash.html

This page has errors. What does <P="CENTER"> mean?
Anyway, neither this nor the extra </TR> on line
193 should cause Amaya to crash or enter an
infinite loop. Unfortunately, that is what happens. 

Using GDB under Linux-ELF, I was able to determine 
that Amaya recurses very deeply while processing
this page. 

I stopped the backtrace listing at around 1400
frames (function-calls). 

Amaya seems to repeat the following sequence
of function calls:

CheckRowHeights()
AttachAttrWithValue()
AbstractImageUpdated()
ChangeConcreteImage()
ComputeEnclosing()
HeightPack()
ChangeDefaultHeight()
ResizeHeight()
UpdateCellHeight()

When I remove the extra </TR>, Amaya can 
display the page without going into the
infinite loop. 

I'm using Linux; however, under Windows such a
deep recursion is likely to use all of the 
available stack space and cause a GPF. 

For the page at
http://www.carbonecho.com/html/amayaCrash.html

I fixed the <P="CENTER"> tags by hand, and I
used HTML Tidy to fix up the page as much as
possible. Even so, Amaya doesn't render this
page properly.
