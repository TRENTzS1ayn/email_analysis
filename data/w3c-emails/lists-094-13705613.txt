Hi,

yes, I am! Btw, 3.2.1  behaves the same way. The wwwoffle proxy seems to work
partially, on entering http://localhost:8080 it shows its welcome page and
cache indexes, but activating links to cached pages by (double-) clicking them
doesn'work (page could not be read.).  Still it doesn't work on remote urls.

Greetings, 
Matthias
