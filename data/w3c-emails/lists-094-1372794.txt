I prefer the original proposal of renaming the file resulting from"Make book".
Saving the resulting file with a different name is usefull, for example for reading
or printing with another browser. For the moment, I use IE5 to print because it is
the only browser I could find that manages CSS page-break.

Editing the resulting file if is indeed not a good idea, so switching to Read-only
could also be done, providing that it is possible to save the renamed file.
