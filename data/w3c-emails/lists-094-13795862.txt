Ah -- i just loaded the page directly from Amaya and it
displayed images readily.....
But i went back to my website 
clicked on dorothyl page
then clicked on index for edie
then on author edie.....   and the page would not display 
images --- it seems that things are stacking up somewhere
and causing a problem.... 
try the sequence 
1] http://www.cgocable.net/~jrussel/home.htm
2] click on dorothyl link
3] click on indexer  d-f or whichever has e in it
4] click on link to edie ......
does it display images ok??
using win 98 and binary
