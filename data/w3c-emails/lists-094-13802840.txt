i found the trouble ... there was a redirection
of the page from my site and that redirection
either introduced a timing problem  or some 
other quirkyness  that may be an Amaya
problem or not but is best left alone.  Other 
more important issues exist and i have removed
the difficulty by shortcutting the redirection.....
