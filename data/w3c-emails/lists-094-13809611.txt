using my own page as a reference
http://www.cgocable.net/~jrussel/home.htm
each time i move to dorothyl and select 
the indexer d-g  
1] first time it jumps to end of list
2] if i move back to top of page and select again
   it moves to correct spot at top of d to g group.
3] repeated jumps work until i move off page
4] returning to page, first jump to d-g  is to wrong spot
    but thereafter works ok... 
it seems like an initialization difficulty !!
