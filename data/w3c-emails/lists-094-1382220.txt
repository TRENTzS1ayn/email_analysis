Thanks, I hadn't found this. It helps, but I still think there is a bug. I am
using Amaya 1.4a on Solaris 2.6.

I am not getting this effect on Solaris. I have now tried the following:
  New Document
  click on math button (Maths pallette opens)
  click on Greek button from Math pallette (Greek alphabet window opens)
  Click the following buttons: infinity, clubs, diamonds, hearts, spades
  cancel Greek alphabet window
  Done on math Pallette
  click save button

The complete file resulting is attached. The relevent part is
<body lang="Symbol">
<p>
?????</p>
</body>
Clicking reload, typing some ordinary text, saving and reloading that ended up
with the whole file displayed in Greek.

Other experiments created a <span lang="Symbol">?????</span>

This is not creating the entity references, it is changing the display
character set, and may demonstrate why the save is misbehaving for the
entities that are being interpreted on reading.
The file I expected would look like (this is handcrafted)
<html>
<head>
<title>test 1</title>
</head>
<body>
&infin;&clubs;&diams;&hearts;&spades;
</body>
</html>

After loading into Amaya, adding a space, and clicking save, I get
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN"
   "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html>
<head>
<title>test 1</title>
</head>
<body>

????? 
</body>
</html>

Amaya seems to be recognising the entities correctly, and translating them to
the right character codes in the Symbol font, but the writing out is not doing
the translation back to entities, but simply keeping that character code.

Thanks,
  Scott
