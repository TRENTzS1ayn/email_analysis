Dear Sir,


Will you please help me getting the detail architechture of both the Amaya
and Thot?
Yes I have your supplied one with the source archieve but to follow your
huge codes, I failed to track all. Now Please if you 
have any Top Level Modular Architecture/ Diagram, Document level
Architecture/Diagram, and some other documentation 
regarding the design and coding of Amaya, I would be very glad. Even if you
have any documentation which describes which module is doing what please
send me asap.

I'm a Software Engineer and have completed my M.Sc. in computer science.
I'm using Amaya for a long days in my Redhat linux PC. I've compiled my own
binary for amaya. But now I want to contribute Amaya and want to customize
my Amaya. 

So please help me getting information.

My mail address : zulker@bdonline.com    
                            or 
                           zulker9@yahoo.com

Thanking you,

Zulker
