Dear Group,

>From browsing the archives, this question seems to come up once a year or
so.  I guess it's my turn!

1)  Will Amaya be available for the Apple Macintosh PPC?

1a) Has anyone tried the Unix version of Amaya on an OS X system?  (FYI, OS
X is Apple's (latest and actually shipping) next generation operating
system.  It has an Unix kernel.)

1b) I know just enough C (but precious little C++) to be dangerously naive,
but couldn't the source code be recompiled for the Mac using Metrowerks (or
whatever) relatively easily?  I am sure that this is a non-trivial
endeavor -- with source code in excess of 4 MB (compressed)!  Still, one of
the main features of C is its portability...

2)  Speaking of portability, why isn't Amaya written with Java?

Thanks very much for your time.

If you respond, please do so directly to me (as well as on the list).

Sincerely,
Bruce Bailey
Baltimore, Maryland
