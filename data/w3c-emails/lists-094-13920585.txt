hi.  I just tried my html-4.01-validated pages and Amaya still has trouble
with them:

a)  http://homepage.mac.com/marek_lugowski/

    pretty spectacular failure.  let me know what you think is tripping
    up Amaya.  I think it is tables within tables.

b)  http://www.enteract.com/~asgp/chapbook.html

    a simple table with text before and after.  Amaya used to render the
    entire page but now stops short of finishing.  If the view is exploded
    to full-screen, it renders it correctly (on my 1600x1200 monitor);
    shrinking it back makes it not render it.  This is both using pageDown
    and scrollbar

c)  http://www.enteract.com/~asgp/agnieszka.html

    of course it renders it funny, jumping rapidly for each item loaded,
    but that's not the point.  paints black bands from one pixel to
    tens of pixels wide when the scrollbar is grabbed and dragged down.
    Does not happen on the way up.  I am wondering if it is the wallpaper
    which is faking it out.

All this on NT 4.0 Service Pack 5 256 meg ram, Voodoo 770D video card,
Pentium III 550, on campus at Northwestern (switched ethernet).  

These are definitely Amaya artifacts.  I have not been able to reproduce
them in other browsers.  All the pages are also optimized for Lynx 2.8.3.
