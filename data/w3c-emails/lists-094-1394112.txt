Partial Apology:

The bug report below was written based on the version of Amaya I have had
installed for several months, which reports itself as Version 1.4a (downloaded
as a binary).

Today, I have downloaded and built the sources for Amaya 1.4a, and the
entities work mostly as expected (ie not according to my bug report).

The &Dagger; and &dagger; entities both get mapped to &lowast; and &euro; gets
mapped to &isin; and ligatures seem to be getting mapped to the two component
letters, but I can live with these. All the other entities I have tried are
preserved properly.

My main concern seems to be fixed by building from the source code, so there
must be some difference between the binary and source distributions.

Thanks for your time,
  Scott Davis
