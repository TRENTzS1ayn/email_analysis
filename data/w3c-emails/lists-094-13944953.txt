Hello Bruce,

In our previous episode, Bruce Bailey said:

The answer is the same as before. We don't have enough manpower in the
Amaya team to start porting Amaya to a new platform. If this happens, it
must take place as an external contribution. Of course, we can share our
expertise if someone is interested in this project.

If it supports gcc, X11,  and the auto tools family, it'd be possible to
compile it. There's an Amaya version for Linux/PPC out there.

Same answer as above :)

Mostly because of problems of portability and performance. The language
choice was made at the beginning of the project.
