In the Amaya CVS repository, there used to
be the files
        Amaya/doc/amaya/Overview.html
        Amaya/doc/amaya/AmayaArchi.html

Since these files contained valueable information
about Amaya's architecture, I hope that they are
put back soon.

Fortunately, if you do use CVS, you don't have to
wait until they are replaced.

To get copies of these files at the time they
were deleted, you can use the following commands
(under UNIX):

$ cd Amaya/doc/amaya
$ cvs update -p -r 1.27 Overview.html > OverviewCopy.html
$ cvs update -p -r 1.6 AmayaArchi.html > AmayaArchiCopy.html

Or I could just send you a copy of the files.
