Hello David,

In our previous episode, Hollingworth David-dholli01 said:

This is weird, as we all here compile Amaya regularly under Solaris. What
were the kind of problems you had before? Normally, you should have been able
to compile it "out of the box" by just making a:

cd ~/Amaya (where you have the source code).
mkdir obj (or solaris2 or whatever you want, it's not important)
cd obj
../configure
make

The error you report isn't significant, as in my Solaris box I also have
XErrorDB instead of XtErrorDB. It may be that your configure didn't find it?
