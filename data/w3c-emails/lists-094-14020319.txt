hi,

I've just found out about a couple of bugs in the latest 3.2 release of 
Amaya. First off is the CSS property "background-color" that is not 
taken into account on the Windows version. Also the colour 
rendering on a "border" CSS property is not correct, as you could 
see on the amaya index page (light green instead of light pink). The 
corners of the frame drawn with the "border" property are not 
presented properly and have gaps on the extremities. All of this for 
the Windows version, fine with the Linux one.

But the major bug I found out is when creating polygon areas for 
maps. When you choose Types > Areas > Polygon, the image on 
which the map will be applied is covered by a filled layer on top of 
it. It makes the drawing of the area pretty tough, although the 
opaque layer disappears once the object is drawn and the change 
of its coordinates is feasible with the Crt+button thingy. But if you 
try on another area then after, the previous areas are covered by 
the image (even with the "Show Area" function on) for "Circle" and 
"Rectange", or by the same opaque layer for "Polygon". This latter 
bug was not present in the 3.1 release as far as I know and it is 
present in both the Windows and Linux release.
