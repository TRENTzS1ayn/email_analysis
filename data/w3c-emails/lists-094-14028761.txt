I have a page when viewed in Amaya 3.2 using Windows 95 the image bleeds
lines of colour to the right of the image. To see this for yourself see the
image of my screen at
http://www.adelaide.net.au/~sims/ambad.gif and the page that is being
displayed at http://www.adelaide.net.au/~sims/jafa/ Setting windows to
different colour depths/resolution has no effect (even safe mode)

The BODY part of the style sheet is:

BODY { background:white ; color:rgb(0%,0%,25%);
        background-image:url(jlogo.gif);
        background-repeat: no-repeat;
        background-position: top left;
        background-attachment: fixed;
        font-family: Arial, Helvetcia, sans-serif;
        margin:6em; }

As soon as the image is offscreen the defects disappear. Placing another
window in front of the
Amaya window and then removing it will clean up the screen if the image is
not covered. If the image is covered it will produce varying amounts of
black lines to the right of the image and also to a lesser extent below the
image. Removing the "background-attachment: fixed" section works better but
there
are still some black lines to the right of the image.
