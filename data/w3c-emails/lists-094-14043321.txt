I finally found a page where Amaya renders the material
better than MSIE.   Although Amaya doesnt handle image
float yet , at least it displays the sidebar for the following
The msie error is in not respecting a width setting in a
 table where a nested table has no settings.... 
     something for the team to laugh at competitors over :-] ;-]

check out  http://www.boutell.com/openfaq/browsers/
at observe sidebar -- if you can.
other browsers such as netscape and hotjava have no 
difficulty as the page is fairly standard style .
