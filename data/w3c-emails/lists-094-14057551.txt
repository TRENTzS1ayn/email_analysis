I hope someone can contact me directly to help on
a problem i have with a specific page and  trying
to view it with my browser accessibility feature
   pointed at my own stylesheet.
it has to do with text made blue with <font color="blue">.
but my stylesheet is quiet about colors  
and the text becomes invisible .....
if i remove my stylesheet, everything is viewable
if someone knows how things are supposed to 
work with accessibility sheets (unfortunately not 
   implemented yet in amaya) could they please
write ve3ll@rac.ca
