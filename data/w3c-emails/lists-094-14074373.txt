Yes, it is deprecated, but I think John's problem is with applying his own
stylesheet to someone else's page so that he can read it.  I told John off
list that I suspect one reason for deprecating the <font> tag was because
its settings could not be overridden with CSS - is that true?  And thus
someone with an accessibility concern cannot make the page readable . . .
