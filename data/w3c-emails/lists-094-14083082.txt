If it is the radio station names that you're having problems with, using your style sheet and IE5.5, I got not white text, but blue text that was well to the right of the page (~pixel 2000! ).  Removing all the text indent styles resolved this problem.  I'd guess that your problem involves a problem with a conflict between the margins set by your stylesheet and the table widths, or simply poor handling of CSS margins in IE5.5.  

I will note as well that the page has a number of HTML errors that might be contributing to the problem.
