My two adventures with MSIE browser yesterday
both involved using a relative text-indent on paragraphs
which MSIE screws up when inside tables.
Some browsers also base em measure on last used
font size rather than pending font size which makes
any indentation after titles awkwardly large.
My recommendation is to avoid relative sizes in
stylesheets altogether until browsers adapt to
standards (and at least defacto ones for grey areas)
Still Amaya did well and improves weekly.
MS rests on laurals and monopoly status......
