Hello
I had the same problem using Amaya V3.2.1 (Linux) on a screen
with a TrueColor visual of depth 24. There seems to be an error
in thotlib/image/gifhandler.c, procedure MakeImage.  The case where
depth is 24 and the ximage also has 24 bits per pixel ist not handled
correctly, instead, 32 bits per pixel are always sent. This gives the "stripe
effect". I made a hack there, just skipping the unnecessary byte and it
worked fine.

Walter
