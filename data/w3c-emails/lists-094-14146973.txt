Greetings,
this may not be the best place to report this, but I am unable to
compile 
Amaya out of today's CVS sources.
The tarball of 3.2.1 compiles by the book.

What breaks in the CVS case is the libwww/configure script for some
reason.
This is the case with both the Amaya related revision and the latest
on-its-own
revision of libwww the script brakes while trying to set up md5.

autoheader and autoconf are unhappy at the bootstrapping of libwww
autoconf 2.13 suggests a bug in autoconf.

I'm on a i686 with Slackware 7 (Linux)

have fun
B.
