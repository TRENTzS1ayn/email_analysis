Hallo there (whoever you might be),

I'd be most grateful for a suggestion.  I've downlowaded Amaya (for which many thanks), but I find that on clicking on the VIEW options (source, structure, etc) I do not get any of the windows listed in the manual.  I have reinstalled and indeed have downloaded again but to no avail.  I imagine there is probably something simple I have overlooked, but I'd be grateful if someone could point me in the right direction.

Regards and thanks,
