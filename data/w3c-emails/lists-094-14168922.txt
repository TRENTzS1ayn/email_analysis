I just tried it myself today from scratch and it works ok. It may be that
the snapshot was generated when I was updating some of the config files.

How do you work with the snapshots? Do you erase the previous one each time
or just untar it in the same tree?

If you still are experiencing problems, can you mail a copy of the error
messages that are being shown as well as the commands you tried?

Thanks,

-Jose
