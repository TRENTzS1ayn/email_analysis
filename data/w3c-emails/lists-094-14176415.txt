Hello Toby,

>
>     I have been trying to download Amaya for Windows NT, but the files I downl
oaded both via http and ftp reported themselves corrupted when I tried to instal
l them.

I just download and installed Amaya in a WinNT box without problems.
Except that my IE exploded at the end of the download... I'm not sure
if this is related.

I suppose you got your Amaya from ftp.w3.org/pub/amaya or from the URLs
given from the home page.

I selected the save file option and then executed it after downloading it.
It installed Amaya without problems.

Does anyone else have a similar problem?
