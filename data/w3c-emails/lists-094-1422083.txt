It's very easy to create an interface for a new language provided that it could
be displayed by an existing ISO-latin font.
The section "Dialogue Language" in Configuring Amaya explains how to process.
Normally you have just to copy the en-* into cz-* and translate words.
Amaya interface will change a lot in the next release, so I suggest you to just
experiment the process and do the real work on the next release.
