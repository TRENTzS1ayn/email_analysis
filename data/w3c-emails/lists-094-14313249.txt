After a local save the page was OK and I guess I found the origin of the trouble:
due to a lot of elements <center> and <font> and perhaps a bug in the parser, Amaya tries to put in lines tables and doesn't generate the right line spacing.
I'll try to fix the formatter bug and the parser bug as soon as possible.
Nevertheless this HTML page is invalid.
