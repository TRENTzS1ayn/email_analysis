We tested some Math edition on Windows and Unix and didn't have this problem.
Do you remember the scenario that caused that trouble.

The Amaya dialogue seems clear:

I guess it's an empty element which is rendered just to be selected by the end 
user.

Do you know a program that is not able to read files generated by Amaya?
All Windows editors I tested are able to read files generated by Amaya.

When Amaya cannot access a special character it renders as a '?'.

I guess this problem is fixed now.

This implies the analyze of the contents of the mathematical expression.
