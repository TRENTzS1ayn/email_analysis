I cannot access this page

I guess it's due to a trouble with the http connection. It always renders it 
correctly (I tested different sizes of the window) on my Windows and Unix 
versions.

Each time it receives a new image Amaya reformats and redisplays the page.

This is a specific bug of the Windows version. I don't know why from time to 
time the background image is not repainted correctly.
