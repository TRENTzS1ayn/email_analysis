Hi,

We registered that there is an error in the procedure that displays background 
images
on Windows platforms.

> I have a page when viewed in Amaya 3.2 using Windows 95 the image bleeds
> lines of colour to the right of the image. To see this for yourself see the
> image of my screen at
> http://www.adelaide.net.au/~sims/ambad.gif and the page that is being
> displayed at http://www.adelaide.net.au/~sims/jafa/ Setting windows to
> different colour depths/resolution has no effect (even safe mode)
> 
> The BODY part of the style sheet is:
> 
> BODY { background:white ; color:rgb(0%,0%,25%);
>         background-image:url(jlogo.gif);
>         background-repeat: no-repeat;
>         background-position: top left;
>         background-attachment: fixed;
>         font-family: Arial, Helvetcia, sans-serif;
>         margin:6em; }
> 
> As soon as the image is offscreen the defects disappear. Placing another
> window in front of the
> Amaya window and then removing it will clean up the screen if the image is
> not covered. If the image is covered it will produce varying amounts of
> black lines to the right of the image and also to a lesser extent below the
> image. Removing the "background-attachment: fixed" section works better but
> there
> are still some black lines to the right of the image.
