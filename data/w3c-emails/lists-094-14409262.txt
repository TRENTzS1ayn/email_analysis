Hi Ralf,

I guess your linker is using the libjpeg provided by the system instead of the 
version
compiled with amaya.
There are two solutions: either compiling amaya with the includes provided by 
the system (I never tested that on that platform) or forcing the link with the 
local library.

Have you try to create a link in the directory obj/amaya
ln -s ../libjpeg.a
I'm not sure it works but it is worth testing it.

You can also replace the -ljpeg by a ../libjpeg.a
