Hi,

I defined new Amaya profiles by modifying the distribution file:
amaya.profiles. I found this feature very useful. 

There is just a little problem with the cascading submenus. For example :
in the "Types" menu there is a cascading menu "Heading". In my profile
definition I deleted all the &CreateHeadingX. But the cascading menu
"Heading" still appears with nothing in it. It's the same behaviour for all
cascading sub-menu. 
Is it possible to make them disappear as the other menu items?

Thanks.
Best regards,
Catherine.
