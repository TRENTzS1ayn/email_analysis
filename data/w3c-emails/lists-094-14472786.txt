I created a style sheet that validates just fine and
results in the sort of page display I would expect
using IE. But when I display pages with this style
sheet in Amaya (on Win 98) it is substitutes a gigantic 
font for the 10pt font that is supposed to be there.
See

and

Is the problem my style sheet (if so where's the
problem)? Or is the problem Amaya?
