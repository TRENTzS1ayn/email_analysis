Dear W3C:

  I'm writing about what I feel to be incorrect in Amaya's resolution of 
relative URIs. In my opinion an anchor with an href of '?query_string' at 
the location of http://whatever.website.ext/program should resolve to form 
the address http://whatever.website.ext/program?query_string (just as a link 
to '#fragment' would refer to http://whatever.website.ext/program#fragment.

  Recently I was able to try Amaya for a short period of time on a Windows 
computer and noticed this. (My usual platform is Mac) Current IE versions do 
perform in this way.

  Sincerely,
  Joseph Myers

  P.S.

  I must say that praise is in order for W3C's standards activity. I believe 
that it is an integral part of the Internet's progress. Way to go!
