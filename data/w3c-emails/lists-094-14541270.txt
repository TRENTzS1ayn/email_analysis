[DJW:]  
French uses the HTML and Microsoft US default 
character encodings (ISO 8859/1 and CP 1252 
respectively), so specifying the French language
really ought not to change the character set, even
if it is the typical misuse of CP 1252 for documents
that are perfectly compatible with the HTML default
character set.

[DJW:]  For HTML compatibility, I would therefore 
say that Amaya should be defaulting ISO 8859/1,
not UTF-8/16. It should not be overriding CP 1252
even if lang is set to fr.  It should not assume
UTF-8/16 when it doesn't know the language.

If the document is actually served as HTML, 8859/1
is the default, and not all browsers understand
http-equiv, which is really a hack for dealing with 
servers that can't be properly configured, so, whilst
Amaya is an [X]HTML tool, it should default to 8859/1.

Also, in HTML, lang is supposed to be orthogonal, to
encoding, so it can, at best, be used as hint to the
encoding for newly created documents.
