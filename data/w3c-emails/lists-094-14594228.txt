There is no default charset in HTML. From the HTML 4.01 spec [1]:

   'Therefore, user agents must not assume any default
    value for the "charset" parameter.'

You must have been thinking of the HTTP default charset.

Bad idea, Amaya doesn't know if the document will be served by HTTP or
otherwise, so it cannot assume this default.  It should always add a
<meta... charset=> (as well as an XML encoding declaration if XHTML).
