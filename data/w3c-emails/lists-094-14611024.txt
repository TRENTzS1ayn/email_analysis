Catherine,

You are right. This is a bug.
In the current version, the XML parser ignores the charset indicated
in the xml declaration. This will be fixed, but this version can still
generate the right encoding at saving time if it is indicated in the
meta http-equiv element. In your example, change the second meta
element to:

   <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=iso-8859-1" />

I guess you are working locally, because if the server sends the
document with a charset indicated in the HTPP header, you should not
have this problem.

Vincent.

P.S.: Thanks for the nice poem.
