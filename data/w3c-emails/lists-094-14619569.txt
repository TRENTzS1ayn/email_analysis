[DJW:]  I said served as text/html, which implies
the use of an HTTP server and text/html content-type.

[DJW:]  That's not the same thing.  No encoding means
UTF-8 or UTF-16.  Amaya should store documents as 
ISO 8859/1 unless told otherwise, as that is what most
users will expect; i.e. it should default to storing in
that encoding, not the XML default.  XML then requires 
that the charset be included in the the PI and XHTML 
suggests/requires its inclusion in the http-equiv hack.

What apparently is happening is that it is defaulting to
UTF-8, although I suspect it only works correctly if the
display also uses UTF-8.  E.g. if I type GBP (currency
symbols) the resulting document displays correctly in
a simple text editor in CP 1252 (ISO 8859/1 superset), but
the XML encoding says that it should be interpreted as
UTF, which wouldn't correctly display.

It's therefore either defaulting to 8859/1 or to the local
GUI display encoding, not to the one it claims to be using.
