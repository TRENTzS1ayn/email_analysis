I,

I'm still suprised that in V3.1 of Amaya, the Link Attribute function doesn't
call a file browser where we can put such an www adress or a HMML, JPG... file
name !

Actually, we have to write all the path and file name in the menu entry.
Could something con be done ?


Thanks to Amaya team,

        Benji.
