Dear friends:

Using the latest Amaya 3.2.1 in Linux Mandrake 7.1.

Hopefully, an easy question from a newbie who is learning how to use
Amaya.

1) When I create a new document in SINGLE SPACE format and then
save it as HTML (foo.html), the document produced is in DOUBLE SPACE.

For instance, here are the first four lines of a Shakespeare sonnet
typed in Amaya:


When in despair with fortune and men's eyes,

I all alone between my outcast state,

And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries

And look upon myself and curse my fate.


This was created as a brand new file test1.html in Amaya. And it is in
double space. I don't mind poetry in this format but what about prose?
How do I make the HTML single-space?

By the way, I've encountered the exact same problem with StarOffice 5.2
(the latest version).

Any suggestions would be much appreciated as to how correct this.

2) On a different note, just wondering why the default font is so TINY.
I can barely read it. 

What am I doing wrong, please?

Thanks so much.

Benjamin

P. S. Amaya is quite incredible. It will take me quite a while to learn
how to use it.
