I tried to add a background image to a page I was editing - a very small
page with no graphics on it yet, and I had just saved some style changes
(which did save properly, by the way).  Simply selecting this command from
the menu crashed Amaya. When I restarted Amaya, it could not reach the page
I was editing - Amaya gave me the error message I would expect to see from a
404 error - but I was able to reach the page from other browsers.  I tried
restarting Amaya again, same problem.  I haven't tried rebooting yet.

I'm using Win98 SE with a PIII 700 & 256 MB ram, 32bit graphics, &c.

Sorry if this has already been reported.
