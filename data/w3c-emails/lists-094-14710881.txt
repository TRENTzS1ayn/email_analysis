I guess you created new paragraphs instead of new lines.
When you hit Enter Amaya creates a new paragraph. If you whish to create
a new line <BR> you have to hit Ctrl+Enter.

The default font size is 12 points but the result depends on the screen size.
I suggest you force a local "Font Zoom "in Special/Preferences/General (value 
1 or 2)
