Benji,

Are you aware that if the target of the link is open in an Amaya window, you
can just click on that window? This means that most of the time you don't have
to type a full URL if you are editing related documents, as you have the
target open as well.

You can choose a particular spot within the target document if you turn on
"Show Targets" in the View menu.

Cheers,
  Scott
