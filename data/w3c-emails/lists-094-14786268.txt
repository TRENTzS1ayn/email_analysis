We never said that Amaya cope with all existing Web pages, but it
does with a large number.

Amaya doesn't loose document contents.

Our thinking is to use an XML parser for XHTML documents and to
provide a profile XHTML where each HTML and XHTML document is parsed
with an XML parser. The work is already started.
We let you or other one connects tidy to Amaya.
