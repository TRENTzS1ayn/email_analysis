I'd like to alert Amaya users about this annoying bug.

Scenario where it occurs:
- you open the source view and edit it
- you close this view and Amaya suggests you to save current changes
- you cancel the closing operation
- then you save the source view.
Due to the bug, Amaya crashes during the saving.

Consequences:
Your changes are lost and if you are editing a local file the file contents is 
lost.

How to avoid:
- either don't cancel the closing operation
- close the view: changes are lost but not your local file

How to repair if it occurs:
There is a copy of the original file in the temporay Amaya directory
AmayaTemp/i/docname (where is is 1, or 2, etc.)

Of course the bug is now fixed.
Sorry for the inconvenience
-- 
     Irene.
