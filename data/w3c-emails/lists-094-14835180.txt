That's not fine for making link towards a picture (not insert picture) : I still
                           ----------------------
have to type all the path and name of the picture.
                 

Moreover, when I work in a html file, I don't want to be forced to open the
other one in order to make links, especially if it's an external link
the web and you aren't connected all during the day.

That's the reason I sent you a mail 10 days ago.


Thanks for all, Benji.
