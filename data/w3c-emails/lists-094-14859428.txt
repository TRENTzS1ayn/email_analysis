Hello,

Amaya seems to answer a need I have for a
documentation tool.  The combined editor-browser
feature is extreamly usfull for writing working notes
that can incorporate web based data.

Several questions.  Amaya fails to display properly
many of the 'popular' netsites.  I understand that
Javascript is not part of Amaya.  There seems to be
other issues however, perhaps in highly nested table
structures.  How can I tell if a problem is
non-standard code in the site, or a rendering error in
Amaya?  Do I always assume the error in the site code?

Second question.  Cut and paste between amaya windows
seems eratic.  SOme times it works, sometimes it
doesn't.  I am using Linux RH6.2 and KDE.
