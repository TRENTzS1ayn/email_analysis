I've compiled up Amaya 3.2.1 on Red Hat and I can't get it to print.


I've tried tracing the problem, and found that it's expecting to see a
file
with a PIV extension whatever that is.

It seems that this file is just not getting built.

I tried following the source to see what's going on, but the comments
are all
in French, and my French is a bit rusty these days.

Does anyone know what's going on?
