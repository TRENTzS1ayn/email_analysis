In the current version, Amaya build the list of classes that are already used 
in the document. In fact it should list classes used in the document and 
classes defined by a CSS rule.
We plan to change that in the next release.

> BTW: Is there any interest of in having libwww and amaya ported to java?

It's a huge work and I don't think it worths doing that.
