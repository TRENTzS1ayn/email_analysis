As I see difference on the same amaya with different windowmanagers, I
should say it is a problem in the windowmanager!

Those with problems, can you change some of the windowmanagers click
options? Check your windowmanager manual for the options to change single,
double and tripple click timeouts and offsets.

On the other hand, Is it Amaya that interprets the double click from
multiple single clicks or does amaya accept a 'double click' event? That can
also be a source for the problem.

Sorry, I don't know details but those are the things I think of.
