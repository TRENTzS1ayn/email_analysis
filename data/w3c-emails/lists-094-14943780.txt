I have just installed the latest version of amaya. v3.2.1. Works very well
editing and browsing. When I try to save the file I have edited it pops up a
window saying "failed to save to and the URL". If I check the file on the
server by refreshing, it has actually saved the file. It does not send the
added images at this point as well. If I select "save as" and give the file
another name it saves the file and images without a problem. If I now select
"save as" and give the name of an existing file it asks me to confirm
overwrite but gives the same error saving. I can save to the local disk
without a problem.
I am using the browser on Windows98 2nd edition. The server is personal web
server on Windows NT workstation with service pack 4.
Is there something I am doing incorrectly or is this possibly a bug.
Thanks again
Rory.
