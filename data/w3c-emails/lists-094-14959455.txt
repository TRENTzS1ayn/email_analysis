An Amaya-like html editor/browser, written in Java, sounds like an interesting project. Edward's idea of porting libwww might be a useful exercise, but to reproduce Amaya's user interface, a fresh code base might be more efficient for several reasons:

First, Amaya's architecture is complex, including layers such as Thot and some intermediate languages. Some of this may duplicate functionality already present in the Java language and libraries. So we might glean some Amaya design details from its source code, rather than planning a straight port.

Second, the w3c Amaya team have considered Java and concluded that it would be inappropriate for Amaya. Their reasons have been posted here a few times, and are available via a search for "Java" in the archives of both Amaya mailing lists (www-amaya and www-amaya-dev). 

One caveat is whether any Java-based browser can offer adequate performance? Java 1.3 is reputedly much improved in client-side speed, so we might test the latest versions of Jazilla (a Java port of Netscape's Mozilla), and Sun's own HotJava browser, to check real-world performance. 

I'd be interested in designing an initial proof-of-concept demo in Java, targeting key Amaya features such as integrated editor/browser, and multiple views. As an initial shortcut to porting libwww, I'd propose to write JNI wrapper functions for testing access from Java. 

Any comments from the Amaya team, or from other interested developers?
