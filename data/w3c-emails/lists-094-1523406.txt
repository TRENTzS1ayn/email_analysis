I second this suggestion. (I was concerned at first that <right-click>
might act as in an xterm, to extend text-blocking, but it seems that
<right-click> is currently inactive in Amaya and the only way to block
text is by dragging with the left button).

So AFL's suggestion should work fine so long as <right-click> is
recognised.

Yes please!

Ted.
