Hi,

Amaya consequently deadlocks during printing when my document contains
the following style attribute:

<h2 style="page-break-before: always;">The Title</h2>

If I remove the style attribute, printing works fine again. So this
definetly seems like a bug to me. Have any of you experienced this
problem too? I hope it gets fixed soon.....

Thanks
Lars Fastrup
