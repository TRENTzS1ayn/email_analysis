Hello,

I'm having some problems changing links in Amaya version 3.2.1 on
windows NT.  I'm using Amaya together with jigsaw to allow a team of
people to read and maintain documents on the internal intranet.  I was
writing some instructions and had the following html page:

******start page *********

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
    "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<head>
  <title>No title</title>
  <meta name="GENERATOR" content="amaya V3.2.1" />
  <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html" />
</head>

<body>
<h2><a name="Editing1" id="Editing">Editing Instructions</a></h2>

<p></p>

<p>In order to avoid loosing updates when two people edit files at the
same
time please use the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Amaya/">Amaya web browser

</a>(available on <a
href="file:////Vega/share/software/Internet/amaya/amaya-WindowsNT-3.2.1.exe">\\Vega\share\software\Internet\amaya\amaya-WindowsNT-3.2.1.exe</a>)

and point the browser at:</p>

<p><a href="test">http://nwtrain03:8001/cbsgroup/index.html</a></p>

<p></p>
</body>
</html>

******end page ************

Now, the last link was pointing at test.  I
* opened the page in Amaya
* clicked into the link
* clicked the link icon
* with the pointy hand clicked the link
* the attribute box came up
* I changed "test" to "http://nbdpt01:8001/amwal/New.html"
* pressed the confirm button
* pressed the save icon
* Amaya reported that it has successfully saved the document
* I opened the doc in a text editor and no change had been made to the
href value
* I refreshed the page in Amaya and the link hadn't been changed.

I think this is a bug.  You can get round it using the "show links" view
and editing there.

Cheers,

Dave.
