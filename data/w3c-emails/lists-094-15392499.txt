Which is the right thing to do.

Please don't!  It ain't broke, don't fix it.

Entities (and NCRs) are useful for 1) inputting characters not accessible
from the keyboard and 2) expressing characters not representable in the
document encoding.  Neither is the case here, so no change is necessary or
advisable.  The document's character encoding is meant to express the
document's characters, please (continue to) use it.

It would be nice, though, if Amaya could display a distinctive glyph for
NBSP when in editing mode, like MS-Word does for instance.  This is
irrespective of what it exports to disk.
