When entering two enter keys consecutive at the end of
text in an HTMLScript object in the Structure View
the keys do not display correctly. The second enter
key moves forward as a tab key instead going to
another line. After that enter some text, the text now
is rendered correctly. However when deleting some
characters by hitting backspace key then text now is
not display correctly. 
Also if you have the following script

  <!--
  function MyFunction()
  {
     document.form1.focus()
  }
and place the caret at the end of the line
,document.form1.focus(), hit backspace key several
time the bottom part( } ) is disappeared.
Any help would be appreciated.
Phuong
