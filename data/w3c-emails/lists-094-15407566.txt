Hello everyone,
 Since I did not get any sufficient help on the link errors
 that I mailed earlier I removed them by commenting those functions
 that were causeing the problem..

  Now there's another big one..After generating the exe I am
  not able to execute it for reasons unknown..
 But one thing..the size of the exe that I have generated and
 that which I got from w3c has a difference of 4KB..

 If anyone can please help me as I am struck here for
 more than a week..

regards
azeem
