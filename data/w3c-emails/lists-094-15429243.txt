I think there may be two problems. One is configuring the file mappings, so
that files ending in .php are treated as HTML files, and the other is the way
that PHP itself works, using XML Processing instructions do escape the php
code. I don't think that Amaya allows you to edit that easily.

Cheers

  Do you mean viewing them as HTML files for editing them? While browsing
  them, the server should send back text/html.
