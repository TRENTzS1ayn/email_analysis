Hello,

i've downloaded amaya-3.2.1-1.i386.rpm and succesfully installed.

But there is the .../Amaya/config/amaya.profile     missing
(according to help i think it should be there)

Is there any way to customize
Keyboard shortcuts   1. in form input fields
                     2. in input fields such as Open or in preferences...

A little bug:

amaya draws buttons about two letters shorter than their label
(it becomes correct, when i zoom in and out)

Can i enable gif animating?

Thanks a lot

Filip
