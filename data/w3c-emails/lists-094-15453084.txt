  Hello,

  I can't run Amaya and in the mailing archive I've read
that it's because of a bug in old 3dfx drivers. But the
newest drivers I found on the web (somewhere on
3dfxgamers.com) are the ones I've already had. So, does
anybody know about drivers for STB Velocity 100/200 card
without that bug?

  Thank you. Ondrej Kucera, Czech Republic
