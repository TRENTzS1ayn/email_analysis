Hello Filip,

Thanks for your message.

Oops. I'll signal this to Daniel.

You can download it from our cvs server:

http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/~checkout~/Amaya/config/amaya.profiles?rev=1.21&only_with_tag=Amaya-3-2-1

I suppose you're talking about the Amaya menus here (rather than HTML forms).

There's already some good support for these shortcuts, using the F10 key
to select the menus, then the arrow keys. The Help/Configuring document
gives some info on how to make your own shortcuts too.

Are you referring to HTML forms or the Amaya menus?

No, we don't support animated gifs in Amaya.

BTW, if you feel like it, it's possible to translate the Amaya dialogues
into different languages, without needing to compile the application.
We already have Spanish, French, Italian, English, German, and an old
turk translation.
