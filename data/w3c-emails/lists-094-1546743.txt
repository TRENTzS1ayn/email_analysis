It's not a Amaya problem, but a X problem. You can check in the code, the 
Amaya
role is limited to react at each X event. If your window manager keeps events
or your X server omits to send them, Amaya cannot work fine.
That was confirmed by people who mentioned double-click problems and explained 
that Amaya worked fine as soon as they changed their window manager.

I guess you didn't follow instructions to build Amaya.
You didn't create the target directory obj and you didn't go into this 
directory
to start ../configure.

We're considering the possibility to navigate with simple-clicks in the next 
Amaya
release.
