Hello,

I was hoping that Amaya could demonstrate for me the use of XML Namespaces.
Amaya v3.2.1 declares that it supports the HTML and MathML namepaces yet
from my experience it doesn't.  For example if I declare the namespace
'html' such as...

<html xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">       

and then prefix my html as <html:b>Some Bold Text</html:b>  it doesn't work.

Also if I add a namespace for MathML as well such as...

<html xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-MathML/">

Amaya will render any MathML tag regardless of the namespace used.  For
example
<m:math> will work as will <x:math>

So where is the support for namespaces?  If I was to paraphrase Amaya
namespace support I'd say HTML must be the default namespace and all
prefixes on MathML tags are ignored.  Is this namespace support?

Does anyone have a better explaination?

Thanks in Advance,
Justin
