This is a known bug of the last release that has been fixed in the
current version. The XML parser is now fully namespace aware and
allows you to define and use the prefixes you want.

If you want to benefit from this improvement now, just check the
latest version from the CVS base. Otherwise, you won't have to wait
for too long as a new release is scheduled for the next 2 weeks or so.

By the way, the namespace URI you use for MathML is wrong. The URI for
the MathML namespace is:

    http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML
