You're right the current Amaya version supports only ISO-latin languages.
The internationalization work is still in progress.

A part of the work is already done but our task force is limited and we
don't progress as quickly as we wished.
If you want to contribute to that development, let we know. The Amaya source 
code is available from our CVS public base (see information in 
http://www.w3.org/Aamaya/User/cvs.html).
