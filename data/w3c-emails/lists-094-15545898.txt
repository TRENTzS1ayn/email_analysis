Hi, 

I downloaded Amaya version V3.2.1 from your web site and tried to use it
to view a simple XML file listed below

<?xml-stylesheet type="text/css" href="style.css"?><document>
<body>
This is a body test with external cascade style sheet.
</body>
</document>

AND

the style sheet file style.css is located under the same directory of
the XML file, 

style.css contents:
body {display:block}

However, Amaya will display the original contents of the XML file. Could
you tell me what I am missing here in order to view XML files. 

Thank you,
