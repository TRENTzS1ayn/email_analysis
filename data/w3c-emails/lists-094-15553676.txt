What's missing? Full support of generic XML in Amaya.

The current version only supports some XML languages, namely
XHTML, MathML, XLink, and, in the next release, a subset of SVG.

There are plans for supporting generic XML, i.e. documents using
namespaces that Amaya is not aware of. But this won't be in the
next release.
