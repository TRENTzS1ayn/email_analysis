If by "the tool for the new standards" you are referring to the new IE5.5
XML parser, the beta of the MS XML parser version 3.0 (which they are
claiming is 100% compliant with XSLT/Xpath, though I've had problems with
Xpath predicates) is available at

http://msdn.microsoft.com/xml/general/msxmlprev.asp

You also have to download the xmlinst.exe utility and readme file (linked
there), and read the installation instructions in that readme very carefully
and thoroughly (basically, after you install MSXML3 and xmlinst, you have to
run from the command line 'xmlinst msxml3' - but don't quote me on that; if
you don't run xmlinst, you're stuck with "side by side" support of XSLT and
of the earlier Microsoft variant thereof) or you'll end up having to
reinstall IE5.5 and having an all-around bad day.

Mozilla/Netscape 6 will have a third-party plugin (MITRE), Transformiix, to
do XSLT transforms; since Mozilla hasn't promised XSLT for this version (Moz
1/NS 6), don't count on much - see the readme at
http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/extensions/transformiix/docs/readme.ht
ml .

Mozilla is also working on MathML.
