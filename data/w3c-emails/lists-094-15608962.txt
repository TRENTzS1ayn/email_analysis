Hello Meg,

We don't have yet a feature to call external applications from within
Amaya. So it's not possible to do what you want to do.

The pluging support we previously had was obsolete, so we decided to remove
it while waiting for a volunteer to upgrade it. The code is still available,
but not compiled anymore.
