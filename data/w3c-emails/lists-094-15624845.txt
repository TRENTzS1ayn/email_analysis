Meg,

Are you opening a local file or one on a server? If the latter, can you give
me the URL? If the server isn't sending a correct MIME type, that may be
causing problems. Otherwise, it's an Amaya bug.

We've time to fix this bug (if it is one) just before the forthcoming Amaya 
release (ETA: around next week).

In our previous episode, Halter, Meg said:
