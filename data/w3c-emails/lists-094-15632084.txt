I selected some text, chose "create or change link"
from the menu, which brought up a URL attribute
dialog.

Then I selected a URL using the right-mouse menu
in Netscape, and middle-clicked in the URL attribute
dialog, in an attempt to paste the address.

Nothing happened.

I can type in the URL attribute dialog, but I can't
paste into it.

This happens every once in a while.

Has anybody else seen this problem?

I'm using amaya v3.2.1 11 July 2000
(ARGH! that text is in the "about amaya"
dialog, but I can't select/copy it.)
