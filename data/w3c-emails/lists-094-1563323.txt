Several of us report that Amaya isn't working properly under Sun's window
manager.  Is this a problem in all installations?  or is there someone out
there who is happily double-clicking and following links while running
Amaya with olwm?  Do other apps running under olwm fail to recognize
double clicks?

I thought that Sun was a major factor, so I'm a little surprised the Amaya
developers aren't more concerned about Amaya's reported problem working
with olwm.

Incidentally, the Amaya revisions I used prior to my Nov, 1997 report
(pre-1.3, revisions, I think) did a fine job following links.
