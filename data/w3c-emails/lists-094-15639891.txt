Hello,

I am trying to use Amaya (version 3.2.1 on Windows 98) to demonstrate
the use of XLink for annotating texts. Granted that it only supports
simple links but does that imply no support for XPointer as well? I also
tried the example XLink materials from Zvon with no success. Could
someone post a succesful simple XLink (that addresses less than a whole
document, and with the attributes "embeds" and  "onLoad") for Amaya? (I
have actually produced the files with older XLink syntax as static
documents using the knit utility from the LT XML tool set. I would
prefer to use current syntax and a browser if possible.)

Many thanks!

Patrick
