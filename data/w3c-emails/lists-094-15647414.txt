The button link does the same.

The first thing Amaya is waiting for is to click on a target (another document,
an anchor with an attribute name, or an element with an attribute ID).
If the clicked position is not a target, Amaya displays the dialog box.
It's a standard MOTIF dialogue and on my Linux or Solaris stations it works
normally with the left button and the middle button of the mouse).

Sorry but MOTIF doesn't allow you to copy a constant string.
Why you don't test the pre-release 3.9?
