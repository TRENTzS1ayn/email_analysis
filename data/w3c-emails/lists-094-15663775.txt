I have two questions
a) Is it possible to set a new color and not just the default 152 color
palette that tht thot editor allows.
I know it is possible because of the extended palette feature that the
style sheet approach allows custom colors

b) Changes mad to the stylesheet are not immediately apparent in the
editor except if one does a reload of the document. Any way of making
the changes visible as soon as the change is made in the stylesheet
