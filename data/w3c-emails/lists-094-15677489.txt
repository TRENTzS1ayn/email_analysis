I've been using Amaya for quite some time, and with the election in the US 
coming up, I have especially been using it to format my radio station's 
election pages.

I have found myself using the "view source" feature quite a bit, and was 
wondering if and when a simple hot key sequence might be designated for 
this and other features in future releases of Amaya?

Thanks,
