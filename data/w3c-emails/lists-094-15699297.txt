Kyle,

the Linux version of Amaya has hot keys for nearly all functions (I have to
do some work on a few things like graphics soon). But there are fewer keys
available in Windows (and no sequences - the linux version uses a two key
sequence a lot).

You can write your own shortcuts for particular features - see the help pages
on shortcuts and configuring amaya - reasonably easily (except in Windows
remember that sequences won't work).

cheers

  I have found myself using the "view source" feature quite a bit, and was 
  wondering if and when a simple hot key sequence might be designated for 
  this and other features in future releases of Amaya?
