Hi Everyone,
Maybe this is a bit early for these discussions, but what the hey:
In the esteemed opions of this lists members, would it be possible to adapt
Amaya for the Semantic Web, e.g. to create SDF documents [1]? This would
make an Amaya variant the first SW, WYSIWYG editor. It may seem a bit
complicated, but it's not really, once you get into it. Really, we use a
subset of HTML, using minimalistic tags (about 15-25), and then fill it with
our own semantic content, based on pre-authored rules (regex etc.). Can
anyone help (&/or provide discussion)?

[1] SDF - Semantic Document Framework:
The essence of SDF is this:-
1. Provide a backbone namespce for SDF that uses (HTML) display tags.
2. Fill this framework with your own, Schema described content, dynamic and
logical (using RDF/XML Schemas/RDF Schemas)
     a. Dynamic becuase you make it up: generate on the fly
     b. Logical because to work it would require logic rules

An SDF editor would have to eventually be able to this:
[[[
Then, if it hadn't already been recognized by the editor, you'd tell it that
the quote was about the weather, and it would automatically link to your
namespace, then you'd select the important parts: date, temp and location,
and tell the editor what they are: (except your editor alrady recognizes
them because it has alrady consulted your namespace, and searched the SW for
key phrases, highlighted them, and maked them up accordingly).
]]] or use a rule based mechanism for doing so.

The goals of SDF are:
1. Produce a fully Semantic document medium, based on current XML related UI
technologies, that can be easily converted using XSLT into RDF.
2. Produce a framework for extending and subsetting this medium, so that it
may be fully machine processable, as well as being a human readable output.
3. Make the framework technology independent, so that when RDF/XML etc. are
past their sell by dates, the method still remains.
