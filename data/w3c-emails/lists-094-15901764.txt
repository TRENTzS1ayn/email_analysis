[DJW:]  The black boxes are almost certainly line feeds,
i.e. Unix style newline characters.  Carriage returns (i.e.
Mac style newlines) would produce the same effect on notepad.
notepad requires Microsoft style newlines (carriage return 
followed by line feed).

pfe32 will handle Unix style text files under Windows.
