It works if you add it in the xml declaration:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?>

The encoding must be known before starting the parsing. It's why 
Amaya says that there is no defined encoding when the information is given by a
tag META.
We're now adding code that looks for meta elements to get the encoding before
starting the parsing.
In the next release your declaration:
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset="iso-8859-1" />
should work
