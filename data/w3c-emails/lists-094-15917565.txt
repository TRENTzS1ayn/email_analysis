Hi,

I noticed a weird behaviour with Amaya (3.1 and 4.0) and Red Hat 7 : double clicking links would not work any more. Fortunately Alt-Return works. Tweaking the double-click delay had no effect. Both versions of the software run fine on other Linux "brands" or with the previous Red Hat version (6.2). Did any one notice the same problem ? Could it have to do with their switch to XFree 4 ?

Best regards,

Serge Torres
