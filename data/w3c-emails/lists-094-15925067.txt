Both versions of the software run fine on other Linux "brands" or with the previous Red Hat version (6.2). Did any one notice the same problem ? Could it have to do with their switch to XFree 4 ?

We didn't experiment with that configuration. Could you investigate more for 
us.
The function that manages Xevents is FrameCallback in 
Amaya/thotlib/dialogue/appli.c

Nevertheless I guess you are able to follow links with simple clicks when you 
change
the preference in Special/Preferences/General.
