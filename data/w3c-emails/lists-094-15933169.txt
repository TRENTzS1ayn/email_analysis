Both versions of the software run fine on other Linux "brands" or with the previous Red Hat version (6.2). Did any one notice the same problem ? Could it have to do with their switch to XFree 4 ?

  Hum, I'm still on a Redhat-6.2 based environement but upgraded XFree86
to version 4 for xinerama support. I didn't get the problem with
amaya 3.2 nor with 4.0.
~ -> rpm -q amaya
amaya-4.0-1
~ -> rpm -q XFree86
XFree86-4.0-0.4
~ -> 
  But I didn't tried on a real RH7 environment.
