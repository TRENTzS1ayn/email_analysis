After a little more experimenting, it turns out that printing single pages
works fine. The fail seems to be when I try to print after making a book.

Hi --

I just loaded Amaya 4 under Win NT 4. When I try to print the manual out,
the print job just disappears. Sometimes Amaya ends up hanging (can't make
the Amaya window active), though the task manager claims that it's
"running". Am I missing something here, folks?
