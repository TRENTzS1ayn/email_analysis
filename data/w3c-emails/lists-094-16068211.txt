A browser missing from the above list, and which appears to
implement object entirely consistently, and as intended by
the specification is icab (www.icab.de).  I have always
been very impressed by this browser, and regard it,
along with Amaya, as the  "carrier" of the specifications.
iCab has the advantage that it implements  Java and the
Netscape plugin API, and so can be tested with
"chemical" objects.

I might also add that  the MacOS platform is missing from
comment above (iCab is MacOS only!).

By the way,  and  apologies for veering somewhat off subject,
I find few search engines currently do anything like a sensible
job with <object>.  We have engineered  htdig to do this.

I agree however that the implementation of <object> is
logically difficult. <object> can be nested. How does one
ensure that the contents of each  <object> layer  are semantically
the SAME? One cannot in general of course, and  I
suppose that is one reason that  XML is really viewed as replacing
this aspect of  HTML.
