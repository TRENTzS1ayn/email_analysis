Hi,

I want to install Amaya on a read-only network drive, to make it accessible 
to a bunch of users. The problem is that, when started, Amaya tries to create
a user preference file in AMAYA-INSTALL-DIR\users\username. But 
AMAYA-INSTALL-DIR is read-only, the file creation fails and Amaya exits.

With our LAN setting, drive K: corresponds to the user's private disk space on
a (Samba) file server. Is there a way I can install or configure Amaya to have 
it create the user preference file on the K: drive rather than in the default
location?

I checked the documentation, in particular the configuration section, but
didn't find an answer to my question. I saw the note mentioning the Amaya
user directory (Windows platform only) and saying that the user cannot change
the location of that directory. Does it mean that Amaya cannot be installed
on a shared read-only network drive?

Would it be possible to first install Amaya on K:, then move all the files to
the read-only network drive?

Thanks for your help,

Bertrand Ibrahim.
