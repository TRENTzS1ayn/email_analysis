Hello,

I just installed amaya-4.0 on my linux system, which is suse 6.4, kernel
2.2.14 and
kde 1.1.2.
I first installed the binary version amaya-LINUX-ELF-4.0.tgz and after
that
the source version amaya-src-4.0.tgz, which I compiled first with
lesstif and then with GTK, always following the instructions on the web
page, getting a binary running superficially without problems.
But there is one important thing, that didn't work, that is following a
link by double-clicking on it. I tried to gather some information about
this on the web, and in the archive of this mailing list, but was only
able to find out, that it depends on the windowmanager, and does not
appear with e.g. fvwm. Is there a bug fix now in existence ?

yours sincerely

J. B?hm
