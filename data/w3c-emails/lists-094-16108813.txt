Hi!

I have a question regarding ActiveX Controls. Is it possible to embed them
in a HTML-dokument an show it in Amaya. I?ve read somewhere that Amaya has
support for the Object tag, but it doesn?t seem to work. I?ve also read that
Amaya?s Plug-In support has been deactivated. Is this right and if so, where
can I get hold of the code for this? Is it somewhere in the source code for
Amaya which can be downloaded?
