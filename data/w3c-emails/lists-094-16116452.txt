It's not possible to do so today.

The problem we had is that there's no such concept as a home directory
under Windows. Under Winows NT and Unix, it's easy to know where to store
the user's preference. Under Windows 9x, we got a strong encouragement to
store them anywhere but not in the registry. 

We compared with Netscape and saw that it used it's installation directory.
We do something similar in Amaya.

A possiblity would be to have a variable in the thot registry
(/Amaya/config/thot.rc) that you could use to give the home directory.
If that variable is defined, it'll override the default value.

Does this make sense to you?

I'm not sure if we'll have time to fix this up soon, but I'll add it to the
wish list.
