Every time I try to use Amaya 4.0, which I downloaded for Windows 95, I'm
apt to get an error message saying that the (Amaya provided) profile doesn't
allow me to view that page. The latest file I tried to view is your own
Activity Page: http://www.w3.org/Amaya/Activity.html

Do you have a fix for this? Or are there instructions for creating or
modifying profile files so I can fix this problem?

This browser has potential to be a useful tool, but the way it works now, I
can't recommend it to anyone else as a browser, let alone as an editing
tool.
