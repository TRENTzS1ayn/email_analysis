Hi

I have been using Amaya on a couple of machines for a while now.
It seems a powerful and capable tool but I have a question about
the way links are edited.

I have had a lot of trouble with Amaya trying to verify links
which may not be valid at the time of editing, but are later
valid when the document is published.

For example Amaya completely refused to put in an absolute file
URL, pointing to a directory
file:/some/stuff/here/
(instead it converted to a relative link by prepending ../../../../,
which is incorrect because the file was being edited in a location 
completely different to its intended location when published)

Also it refused to put a relative link to a cgi script:
/cgi-bin/username/thing.cgi
(instead it prepended 'file:///' to what I had entered)

I hope this feedback helps and you have the time to comment,

Cheers

-Cam
