The platform is Windows.
The Help/ShortCuts does don describe AltGr as a legal modifier.
Just to play around I tried to put this in the amaya.kb file:

<Key>F1: TtcInsertChar('a')

Then I restarted Amaya but no 'a' apear when I type F1.
What is the command to insert a character?

This is not a matter of unicode support. If I remeber correct the HTML
standard specifies 7 bit ascii using escape sequences like "&aeling;" for
special characters. When typing '?' I think Amaya should insert a "&aeling;"
in the HTML code.
