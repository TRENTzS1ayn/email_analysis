Hello

I was sad because I didn't find any HTML extension to use equations and formulas
in a Web doc. Then I found Amaya :-)

I downloaded it and installed in my Linux System but I think there are some
issues to be improved:

 1. The browser displays no directory when root directory is reached.
 2. When printing button is pressed the only action allowed is "Confirm". No
cancel is possible because no Cancel button is found and the button for killing
the window doesn't run.
 3. User cannot choose the printer to use when more than one is available.

I hope this e-mail be useful to improve Amaya.

Thanx
