Hello Bertand,

In our previous episode, Bertrand.Ibrahim@cui.unige.ch said:

Thanks for the URL. I was able to reproduce an error condition. The
Make book function is written to work synchronously. However, the images
of the documents were always being requested asynchronously. In some cases,
it was possible to get back the images after the document context was
destroyed. This could explain your crash. This bug is now fixed.

There's a second bug as the images are not being shown in the resulting
make book. We're working on this problem and hope to fix it soon.

btw, it's a nice tutorial :)
