You do not remember correctly.  HTML specifies any character encoding
compatible with Unicode.  Amaya at present supports only one, ISO 8859-1,
and does the right thing when you type '?' : it inserts an ISO 8859-1 '?'
character.

"&aeling;" and such are crutches to be used when your keyboard does not
support the characters you need.  There is absolutely no requirement in HTML
to use them and many cases in practice where they hurt or complicate things
(though of course simple display of an HTML page is not one of those cases).
