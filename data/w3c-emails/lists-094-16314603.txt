   Hello.  Thanks for the advise. 
Sorry that I didn't read the web page precisely.

  And I am also found another problem with compiling HTMLedit.c.
It failed with the messages something like:

in function 'UpdateAtom':
   HTMLedit.c:   2720: called object is not a function.

The problematic line is:
  win = XtWindow (XtParent( XtParent (XtParent (frame))));

#    The build succeeded & and the binary displayed the
# W3C site pretty well when I commented out the line.

This happened with both Amaya 3.2.1 & Amaya 4.0. 

  I use NetBSD-1.5beta (i386) and lesstif, and I have 
little experience in X Window programming.

I hope I am not asking a silly question again.
