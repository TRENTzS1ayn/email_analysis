The first command also exists, but it is normally only available in the
structure view.

You would have to add the structures menu to the foramtted view. This is
probably a reasonable idea anyway, although it becomes a question of how to
make it work. Maybe like the annotations interface, where adding content is
done by opening a dialogue...

  The second command already exists in Amaya. You have to select the englobing
  element and to use the "transform" command (Edit menu).
