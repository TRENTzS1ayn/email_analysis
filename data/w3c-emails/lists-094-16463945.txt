Dear All,

I am a newbie in using Amaya and I have a very simple question to ask.

All I wanted to do is to generate a few web doc with maths eqn in them
and post them on my Cocoon enabled server. I have no difficulty in
generating a .xml file, but where is the associated DTD and CSS files
??  I could not use my browser to dispaly without these files, would
anybody be able to tell me how to obtain these files generated by Amaya
?

regards
michael lim
