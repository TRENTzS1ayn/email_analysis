Hi, I was trying to compile Amaya 4.1 from the oficial tarball and I found that I couldn't because prs was dumping core.
I'm using glibc-2.2, linux kernel-2.4.0test11 and gcc-2.95.2.

Here's the info that gdb gives me:
Core was generated by `/tmp/Amaya/amaya/../bin/prs -DMATHML -DGRAPHML -DANNOTATIONS -DXML_DTD -DXML_NS'.
Program terminated with signal 11, Segmentation fault.

Configure was ran with '--prefix=/opt' arguments. I'm providing the generated config.h as an attachment.

Is there anything else I can do to help?

Thanks in advance,
