Hello Paul,

In our previous episode, Paul Gartside said:

Are you planning to do content negotiation on the server side, sending either
MathML or graphics in response?

This can be done with the Accept HTTP header. The CC/PP work should
be more complete, but it is still under progress (and not supported in 
Amaya).

Not now. It just sends an Accept header that says "I accept everything."
I'm not sure right now if we should include the MIME types for MathML and
SVG. The value of these  types are still under discussion.

I'm afraid the best solution for the moment comes to that.
