Hi,

Are you sure you proceeded as explained in the page
 http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Autoconf.html

You need to create an object subdirectory and launch ../configure in that 
subdirectory.
Many other checks are suggested in that page when a problem raises.
Let me know if after these checks the problem persists.
