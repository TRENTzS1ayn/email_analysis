Yes, exactly.

Ok, thanks for that.

Hmm... `I accept everything' is somewhat ambiguous. `Everything' changes
with time (new formats appear). I rather suspect both Netscape 4.x and
IE5.x say `I accept everything', although neither do MathML or SVG... An
explicit declaration of what is accepted would be more useful.

Anyway, thanks again!

Paul.
