Hello.

I am a programmer who is developing applications
for teachers. And I have a few brief questions.

Who actually uses Amaya? Is the target end-user 
mathematicians or scientists?

Why isn't Netscape and Microsoft integrating MathML
into there browsers?

Thank you for fielding these questions.
