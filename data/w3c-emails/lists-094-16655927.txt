The problem is not with the space in the alt attribute, but with the
border attribute in the previous line: all attribute values must be
quoted, including this "0".

If the document is XHTML, just add an XML declaration at the very
beginning (1st line, before the DOCTYPE), for instance:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?>

It's an empty table cell. Amaya being first of all an editor, it
allows you to enter the content of those cells by displaying a small
grey box. These cells are not in the source code. They are added by
the editor in case you would like to complete the table. I guess that
when Amaya is in browser mode, those empty cells should not show up.
That's probably something to be fixed.
