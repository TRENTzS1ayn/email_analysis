Vincent, I would not like tidy in the receive chain since I change 
Amaya output. I do not want Amaya changing what I did without telling
me. Not all valid outputs are possible with Amaya. Netscape changes
the file without telling you. The file starts out valid and netscape
ruins it. 
Regards, Jim FitzSimons
