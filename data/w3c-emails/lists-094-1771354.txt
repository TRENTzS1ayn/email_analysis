Amaya seems to build OK, now that I have lesstif (www.lesstif.org).
However, on running it I get:
 ./bin/amaya
./bin/amaya: error in loading shared libraries
libXm.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

I did not seem to get any warning at configuration time that this
might happen.

Thank you,
Hugh
