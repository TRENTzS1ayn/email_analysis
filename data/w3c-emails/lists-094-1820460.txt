Yes, this is an error in our page Manual.html. When we set the background color
we have to set the foreground color too.
I'll change for next versions.

I have a solaris box too but I have no problem with that URL.
Could you start Amaya on a debuger just to let us know where it crashs).

Yes there is a cache that you can purge (see the menu Special).

Tooltips use the foreground color, but you cannot change the yellow
color. That is a bug.

Right, we still plan to add it.
