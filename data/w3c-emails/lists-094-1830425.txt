How?  I could not see anything about command line options...
Let me know how to give you enough info and I will. Thanks.

Thanks for noting it.  Which foreground colour -- the X one or
the Amaya (menus/fonts/etc) one?  If it is the X one then

Ideally one would like to configure these within Amaya, I think.
