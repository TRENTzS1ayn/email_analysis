There are still memory leaks, which seem related to using images and to 
using the structure view.

One outstanding bug which was also in 2.0a involves using images with 
tables. Given this:

Table|TR|TD|IMG src=blah.gif...
     |  |  |
     |  |TD|

the following are true, and shouldn't be:

* Select the IMG in structure view or document view, without also
  selecting the TD, and cut, and it takes the TD as well.
* Cut or copy, and if you paste you get a TD with the IMG.
* Select the image and hit left or right arrow, and you get the
  previous or next cell instead of an insertion point to the left or
  right of the image inside its cell, in structire or document view.

What should happen instead:
* Select the IMG in structure view or document view, without also
  selecting the TD, and cut, and it takes just the IMG.
* Cut or copy, and if you paste you get just the IMG.
* Select the image and hit left or right arrow, and you get the
  insertion point to the left or right of the image inside its cell.


Please make these bug fixes for 2.2, and hunt down the remaining memory 
leaks.
