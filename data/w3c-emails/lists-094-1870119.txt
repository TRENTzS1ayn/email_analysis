Our goal is to automatically generate the file Options when it doesn't exist 
and
let the user change options he wants to change.
All these changes are never overridden by a new configure. Configure overrides 
the
file Options.orig that you can compare with your file Options.
Otherwise you can remove the file Options before launching the configure.
