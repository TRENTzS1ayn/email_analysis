The text could be displayed but in white color on a white background.
Could you open the structure view or try to select anywhere
in the document. If there is a selection display at the window buttom,
you can try to force the foreground color: you go up to the body element by
hitting the Esc key and force the foreground black color in the Style->Color.

I guess it's just a problem of color.
