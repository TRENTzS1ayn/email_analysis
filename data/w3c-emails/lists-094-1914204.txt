Greetings, 

The archive contains a message
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-amaya/1999AprJun/0082.html
which refers to this problem, in versions of Amaya up to 2.0
inclusive.

I am disappointed to find that version 2.1, now released, still
contains the bug described there.

I recently got involved elsewhere in a discussion of this issue, i.e
when forming an HREF to a URL that contains an ampersand, the need to
represent the ampersand as &amp; .  In general, omitting to do so will
result in failure of HTML syntax validation (on the grounds of an
undefined entity), as I'm sure is well known.  But after writing &amp;
the HREF no longer works correctly in Amaya.  The "other side" in the
argument took the view that Amaya was the W3C's "reference browser",
and that it therefore represented the standard of correctness, and
they therefore concluded that the syntax validator must be wrong.

This kind of experience is very unfortunate for someone who usually
tries to defend the W3C's published specifications.

best regards
