Surely, in a URL an ampersand is escaped as %26 ?

&amp; is the escape in html and the (quoted) string value in an href isn't
html. Does it need to be escaped in the URL? - I haven't checked the rules
but don't the quotes protect it from the (html) "&" escape mechanism?

 ... but maybe I missed something obvious and am talking rubbish 8-)
