I think actually it is a problem with SGML, and its use of &xyz; as entity
specifier, being in conflict with the original URL specifications.  Given
that these things were created quite a long time ago (in web terms), I
don't think anyone is really to blame.  AFAIK, SGML came first, and so the 
real culprits are either those who chose to make HTML an SGML document,
or those who decided that '&' should be reserved in URLs.  These were
hardly disasterous decisions ;-).

It's a shame, admittedly, but there is always going to be a few awkward
cases when you try to mix escaping / delimiting styles - there are only so
many characters on the keyboard, after all ;-)
