%26 and &amp; mean different things.  %26 is an &
in a form keyword or value, whereas &amp; is a
delimiter between form keyword value pairs, and 
considered reserved in the non-query part of a
URL.

The need to escape & with &amp; is a consquence
of HTML being an instance of SGML and has always
been true since forms were introduced.

One could argue that & was a bad choice as field
delimiter, but the designers of HTML forms 
probably didn't expect form type URLs referencing
banner adverts, etc., to get hard coded.
