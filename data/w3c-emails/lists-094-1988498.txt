It's been like this since HTML2.0, indeed the above text seems to have
been copied verbatim from RFC1866 (see the end of section 8.2.1).

Using %26 would seem to be a clear indication for the ampersand to be
included as part of the value text, rather than being treated as a
delimiter of the NAME=VALUE pair in the query string.

If you can't rely on browsers implementing the advertised
specification, then you'd be in the situation that we're currently in.
But changing the specification does not seem to be an appropriate
response to a bug in one browser - which admittedly a few other
browsers also had some years ago, but which they have now corrected
in accordance with the, stable, published specification.

The idea is that a script would accept both, thereby allowing the use
of either.

Is it really appropriate to discuss the design of HTML on a browser
list?  I'm responding briefly because the issue has been raised, but I
suspect this part of the discussion ought to be moved elsewhere.  The
only issue as far as Amaya is concerned seems to be that it is not
conforming to the published HTML spec, and that this is particularly
embarrassing to those of us who try to stand up for conformance to the
W3C's specifications.
