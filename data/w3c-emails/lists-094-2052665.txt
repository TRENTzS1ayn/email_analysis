Irene... your ISP even blocks mail to postmaster which is an absolute no-no. 
You have a stern word with them and tell everyone else you know that uses 
that crummy, incompetently-run ISP. Make the assholes shape up.


To list: Apologies for the off-topic posting, but if you check earlier 
message, you'll see why I cannot send it directly to Irene.
