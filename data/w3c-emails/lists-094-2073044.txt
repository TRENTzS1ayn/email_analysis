We never experimented the building of Amaya without editing functions,
but it should work. You need to remove a large majority of functions
declared in EDITOR.A (all menu entries disabled by the browser mode).
Normally functions located within EDITORactions.c, HTMLedit.c, EDITimage.c,
HTMLpresentation.c, HTMLbook.c could be removed.
