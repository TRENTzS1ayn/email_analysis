Amaya *is* an editor with some browsing capabilities, not
a browser with some editing capabilities!

If you want to browse valid, well written, pure HTML, I'd 
suggest Lynx.  If you want to browse real life broken HTML
with shockwave/javascript/vbscript/java/frames without fallback
text,....., I'd suggest IE5, although if
you are not on Windows or Solaris, maybe
Netscape 4, upgrading to NS5 as soon as it is realeased.
