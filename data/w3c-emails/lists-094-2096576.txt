I guess you're assuming that, in this case, the '&' will be part of a file 
or directory name, not a field separator in the <searchpart>. Indeed, if you 
look at RFC 1738, section 5 (BNF for specific URL schemes), you find:

  fileurl        = "file://" [ host | "localhost" ] "/" fpath

and

  fpath          = fsegment *[ "/" fsegment ]
  fsegment       = *[ uchar | "?" | ":" | "@" | "&" | "=" ]

In addition, section 3.10, describing the file URL scheme, says:

 "A file URL takes the form:

    file://<host>/<path>

  ...   <path> is a hierarchical
   directory path of the form <directory>/<directory>/.../<name>."

I interpret this as meaning that a file URL can contain unreserved characters
or escaped characters or any of '?', ':', '@', '&' and '='. All these 
characters will be considered as part of a directory name or a file name.

This is of course only my opinion. Peace,

Bertrand Ibrahim.
