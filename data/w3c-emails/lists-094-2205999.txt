If <U> is depreciated then how does one underline?  If CSS1 allows
text-decoration:underline; then the font dialog box should allow bold and
underline since that is the same as CSS1
font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;  Even thought <U> has been
depreciated that doesn't mean you cannot underline.  In CSS1 underline,
overline, blink and line-through are exclusive, IMHO that's a deficiency
with CSS1 however, in the font dialog box I should be allowed to choose a
font-family, font-style, font-variant, font-weight, font-size along with any
text-decoration value.

The font dialog box will be changed too and it will be possible to mix 
font-weight (bold),
font-style (italic) and text-decoration (line-through).
As you know <U>...</U> is depreciated, so we don't plan to allow both 
underline and line-though.
