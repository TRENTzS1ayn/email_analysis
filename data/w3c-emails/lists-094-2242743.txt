Dear Subscribers,

I am trying to run Amaya on SGI Indigo2 (with Irix 6.2, latest recommended
patches). I downloaded lates binaries, but when tried to run them the
following error occured:

14150:./amaya: rld: Error: unresolvable symbol in ./amaya: __new_tcgetattr
14150:./amaya: rld: Error: unresolvable symbol in ./amaya: __new_tcsetattr
14150:./amaya: rld: Error: unresolvable symbol in ./amaya: __new_cfgetispeed
14150:./amaya: rld: Error: unresolvable symbol in ./amaya: __new_cfsetispeed
14150:./amaya: rld: Error: unresolvable symbol in ./amaya: __new_cfsetospeed
14150:./amaya: rld: Error: unresolvable symbol in ./amaya: __new_cfgetospeed
14150:./amaya: rld: Error: unresolvable symbol in ./amaya: __libc_attr
14150:./amaya: rld: Fatal Error: this executable has unresolvable symbols

BTW: I am not able to compile it as well. On the beginning compilation
goes really fine, but then I have:

Does anybody have any suggestions or remarks?

Thank you,

Bartek
