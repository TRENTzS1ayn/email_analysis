Hello,

I'm loosly following the amaya development.  I like the very idea much
and use it, just to get a feeling how future editors might look alike.
The last version I checked out was some 1.4, which was pretty good.
Now someone installed the 2.0 version, which tries to make me crazy:

* we use CVS; there is a field $Id which is supposed to be kept at one
line.  I old days we could achive that by formating the source, now we
get it screwed.

* some ppl don't want to use amaya (and I, personaly, consider it
close to crime to force somebody to use a certain editor).

Unfortunalty amaya preserves the structure, but has it's own idea of
indenting the code even while it doesn't care about.  Why?  This could
be left to those who actualy care.

This total rewrite function is the second threat to CVS and finaly
able to trigger the "rm -rf Amaya" command.

* worst: I edited a web page, which documents some sgml tags.  The
file I opened with amaya read "... <code>&lt;para&gt;</code>...".
The I deleted a (different) line saved the file and now the sequence
read "...<code><para></code>..."
