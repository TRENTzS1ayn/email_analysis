I successfully compiled amaya-2.1 on my linux system (libc5,XFree).
However, it would not properly display the www.altavista.com page.
Specifically, the search entry line was not correct.

I also tried to compile amaya with --enable-plugin.  It failed because
the file "editplugin.c" tries to include the file "app.h", but that
file does not exist in the include directory.  There is a file called
"application.h" there but substituting "application.h" for "app.h" did
not work either.

Thank you for your efforts.
