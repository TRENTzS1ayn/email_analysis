Hello,

The Altavista home page has many HTML errors, one of which confuses
the Amaya parser as to where is the end of the form. You can check
them out with http://validator.w3.org/.

Unfortunately, you're right. It's been over one year since we last
touched/tested the plugin code.  We need to upgrade it so that it conforms 
to the current state of the Amaya code.
