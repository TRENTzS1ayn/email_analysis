I'm not sure that I understood your problem. First, a comment, we (the Amaya
team) haven't yet tested Amaya under Solaris 7, so I can't say it it's 
bin compatible with Solaris 2.6 or if it runs right out of the box.

Are you able to launch Amaya and see the browser window on your
screen, but not able to browse anything?
Or are you unable to browse local files?
Or are you unable to create new files?

You should have a dir ~/.amaya (where ~ == your home dir). Could you
mail me the file ~/.amaya/thot.rc when you answer my message?

Thanks,

-Jose
