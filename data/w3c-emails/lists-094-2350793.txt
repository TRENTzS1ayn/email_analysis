   code from the public CVS base at dev.w3.org

Hello,

Philippe, thanks for the bug report and sorry for the delay in the 
answer. 

Some files in the dev.w3.org Amaya/batch directory were corrupted. There
was also a problem with a prematurarely committed file (Amaya/amaya/init.c) 
which I also fixed.  After fixing those files, I was able to compile Amaya 
again.

I'm waiting for the automatic CVS base mirroring process to kick in to
see if there are other problems. I'll post another message to the list
to confirm that things are back to normal.
