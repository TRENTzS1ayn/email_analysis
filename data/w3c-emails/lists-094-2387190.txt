just downloaded amaya and trying to configure
after running several other browsers since Web started
have noted several glitches in documentation and how amaya
does some common things
[1] setting home page
amaya requires FULL url including http:// this is fair but
the on-line help could have been more HELPful by noting this.
This retired teacher knows that EXAMPLES help in readability.
Perhaps reviewing the on-line help and adding examples to topics
will help others as well.
[2] Color settings
Using the dialog box --- will it respect all named colors
will it accept hex codings, or decimal coding alternates.
The help page is silent on this and once again exampleS would 
make it clear.
And the named colors i picked didnt even come close to rendering
correctly -- my favorite is 'wheat' which is easy on the eyes
but try it in Amaya --- a dithered blue ugh!
Using the pallet -- and quite an unusual one it is instead of
the one seen in most programs --- may be a unix thing though
i am much more familiar with windows and this one may be necessary
for cross platform --- its a shame cuz it severely restricts one's
choice.
The selected colors did not display when the apply button was 
pressed... i had to exit Amaya and restart it to see effect.
This does not foster experimentation does it.  Apply should
apply immediately....
I loaded Amaya to experiment with MathMl so i expect i will
be happier with it as there is no standard of comparison
ie no competition....  but on standard user expected features
there seems a ways to go ... and the documentation is about
right for the price paid :-) :-)
