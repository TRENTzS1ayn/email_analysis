And a little grumble about the web page that
promotes the www-amaya list.
To subscribe one has to manually reenter material
that is typed onm the page.
Has anybody heard of hotlinks :-0 :-0
by the inclusion of something like
<a href="mailto:www-amaya-request@w3.org?Subject=subscribe www-amaya">
Subscribe to the www-amaya mailing list</a>
there would be no need to retype things that should not
need retyping!!!!!!!
