most browsers have a way of viewing unrendered source code.
this is handy for analysing programming techniques for neat layouts....
or finding a bug in file spec so that i can mail a suggestion to author.

i cant find any way of doing this in amaya --- found the view alternate
but it gave a lynx-like rendering... is there a non rendered view posible.
and the alternate views and link view etc opened windows that were way
off the screen.  Shouldnt these windows be opened somewhere on the
screen in a tiled effect and then let the user posn to taste ....  the default
seems structured for a big display  but surely there is a way to determine
the actual environment and shifting the window appropriately.  i even had
difficulty trying to grab the movement bar to pull it over
