no mention is made of the view targets or view maps options
for completeness these should be referenced as they are on the
views menu ---- and what target is is not necessarily intuitive ---
i checkmarked this thinking i would get the lower feedback panel to
show any url of a hotzone that i had cursed over .... but nope
it didnt do that !!!   so some help info is needed
