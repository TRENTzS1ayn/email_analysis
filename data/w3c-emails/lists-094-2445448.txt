To set the default colours use a style sheet. on unix it goes in your
$HOME/.amaya directory - on windows the directory is listed in the
preferences dialogue (I think).

Then you want amaya.css in that direcxtory, and in that file you want

A:visited { color: #abc ; font-style: italic }
(or whatever takes your fancy). That should probably be part of the
distribution though.
