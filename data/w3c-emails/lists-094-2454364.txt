The structure view contains the source (except for a couple of odd things,
like language of the page, charset, and generator metadata).

I agree that it would be handy if new views appeared a bit more centrally on
the screen (although in Gnome that is controlled by the window manager not
the program).

  i cant find any way of doing this in amaya --- found the view alternate
  but it gave a lynx-like rendering... is there a non rendered view posible.
  and the alternate views and link view etc opened windows that were way
  off the screen.  Shouldnt these windows be opened somewhere on the
  screen in a tiled effect and then let the user posn to taste ....  the default
  seems structured for a big display  but surely there is a way to determine
  the actual environment and shifting the window appropriately.  i even had
  difficulty trying to grab the movement bar to pull it over
