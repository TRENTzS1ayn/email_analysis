I noted that some settings are done ala commercial browsers
with pull down menus and config or ini files   and that some are done
through amaya.css style sheet [thanks Charles].  This seems
unnecessarily complex.  Either :
[1] do it like others with menus/dialog boxes et config files
or
[2] use Aamaya.css as much as possible
Personally, i would vote for number 2.  It would strengthen the 
philosophy of isolating form from content/function.  It would
educate one to the power of style sheets.  And it would allow
removing unnecessary chrome from the machine.  The color
pallette and several dialog boxes would be made redundant and
could be removed.  And changing the settings would be through
the css editor. A reread Amaya.css would be needed to enact on
changed settings. 

if option one is the desired path then:
[1] the color dialog boxes would have to have input areas for links , vlinks,
and alinks
[2] the pallette would have to be altered for more choice and how to set
 links
[3] the method of applying color changes would have to change to do 
things instantaneously
[4] better documentation of color picking (can one use names, RGBhex
or decimal settings ?format?

with inits through css, documentation can be about style sheets which
really is the way to travel.
