A standard is really needed here and could be promoted by w3.

[1] If there are only 216 'safe' colors then these should be the
    preferred ones and visually consistant across platforms and
    browsers.
[2] Whats with the geeky references anyways and all those color pickers
     If each of the 216 'safe' colors were associated with the 'named colors'
     and their visual rendoring keyed to the iso color standard then one
     could finally trust in his color choice (personally i like white on white
     :-)  ).  And the settings would be human readable -- that is why ascii
     format was chosen wasnt it.
Just a thought -- I have lived with the fact that there are few standards in
 the computing world and even when they exist, they are flaunted --
have you ever found an entire web site that doesnt kick out some errors
when tidy is used......
