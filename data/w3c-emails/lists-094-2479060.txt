Noted that all docs are in html and open source.
This explains why you dont use the normal compiled help format
that is most likely highly platform dependent.
The files are html but EVERY ONE runs up warnings when filtered
thru tidy.exe 
[1] I am going to clean em up so they meet html 4 transitional spec
[2] I will add examples and fill out in places I am familiar with

Who do I bounce my changes back to for vetting ???
It will take a couple of days and a few cups of coffee but I 
would like to know that someone will accept and do diffs to see
if changes are appropriate....
