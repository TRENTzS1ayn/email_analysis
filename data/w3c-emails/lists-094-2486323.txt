am busy cleaning up syntax to pass verifier....
but noticed peculiar thing with icons at page top

right side ones work ok   but cant get left side ones
to go anywhere .... if the files are viewed from netscape
the links activate  but the leftmost icon (the w3 symbol)
will not display ---  what format is it --- i cant get it to 
display using standard image viewers and it doesnt have
an extension to give a clue ?????
