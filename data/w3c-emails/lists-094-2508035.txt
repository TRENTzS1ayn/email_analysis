I am pretty sure that the '?Subject=' syntax is not valid HTML, although
some browsers support this.  However, you could have an autoresponder
attached to www-amaya-subscribe@w3.org, and www-amaya-unsubscribe@w3.org,
which some listserv lists are now doing. This would allow proper
mailto URLs to be used for this sort of thing.
