This sounds strange. We validate our files thru Amaya and Amaya should
generate correct HTML, unless there's a bug (or unless we generated
them with an old Amaya :) ).

For example, I just took the Configure.html file and ran it thru
the HTML validator (validator.w3.org). It comes out OK, no errors.

Maybe your tidy.exe is old? Or there's a bug elsewhere.

That sounds like a good idea and we appreciate your help. Try running the
documents first thru the validator service, so that we can find out
where are the bugs (in Amaya, tidy, in the validator, ...)

Each page in the doc is signed with a name and a mailto: url :)
Mail it back to that person when they are ready.

Your time won't be wasted and your proposed changes will be carefully 
reviewed, and either accepted or refused with an explanation :)
