John Rooker suggested turning off the NumLock.

Sounded strange to me, but, well, I tried it. Works.
Started Amaya. A dialog box asked for a file name. Trying to enter text
with NumLock left on: nothing. Turned NumLock off: all text enters fine.

Thanks, John, for the hint. I'm used to text console. Just got X working

some learning. Why does NumLock have to be off? It's not obvious to me.
