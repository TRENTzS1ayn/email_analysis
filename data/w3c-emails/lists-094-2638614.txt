When using the Amaya editor, there are instances when
using the down arrow while on the last displayable line of text
does not scroll the text space.  Most often it works ok 
but sometimes it doesn't and i can't see a pattern yet to
help the codesmiths ...... but i can detect that a glitch exists
--this is small potatoes for those pushing the edge of xml and
java but for us doc creators it is important!
