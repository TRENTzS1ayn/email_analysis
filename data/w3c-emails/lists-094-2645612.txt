Hi,

I'm just back from vacation.

The problem with the NumLock comes from the Motif library and is not under our
control. I guess the key NumLock could be interpreted by Motif as a key 
modifier
and so could generate invalid characters.
We're just exploring the possibility to replace Motif by GTK. If any person has
already developed a GTK application, please let us know. That could help.

Regards
  Irene.
