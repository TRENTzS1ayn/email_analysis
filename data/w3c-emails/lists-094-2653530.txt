I seems that there are now too different Irix versions.
Perhaps the missing library is located in another place on your SGI.

That problem comes from the configure. The configure generates HAVE_STRING_H 
and
HAVE_STRINGS_H. That doesn't cause any problem except on SGI platforms.
I don't know how to solve that problem in an elegant way, but I can suggest you
a quick method. After the configure, you can edit the generated file config.h
and invalid the #define HAVE_STRINGS_H.

- #define HAVE_STRINGS_H 1
+ /*#define HAVE_STRINGS_H 1*/
