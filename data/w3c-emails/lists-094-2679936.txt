There are times when it is really useful - most of the time I am copying
linnks from other pages somewhere on the web and am very happy that the URIs 
are maintained to point to the same place. At other times when it is a real
problem. It would be best if it could be toggled somewhere, and if we could
put a button on the button-bar that reflected the state that would be good
too. I don't know if that works though - I think the button bar is read at
initialisation and then can't be changed...

  Amaya tries to generate relative paths as often as possible.
  If it doesn't it could be due to an existing base element in the document
  (check the head in the structure view) or the fact that you are editing
  some pages as local files and others as through the server.
  If you are in the later case, you have to choose either to edit all pages
  as local pages or to edit through the server. That needs to install the PUT
  (a script is provided, see http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/put.html).
  All the W3C team uses Amaya to publish directly on the http://www.w3.org 
  server.
