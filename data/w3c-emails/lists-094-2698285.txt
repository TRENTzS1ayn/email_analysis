Ok. All editing is done "locally" on our server. Let's give an example.

The homepage is at d:\www

I copy a part from a page at d:\www\Presse\index.html with href=../Bullet.gif

if I paste that image to a page at d:\www\test.html it's correctly resolved to href=Bullet.gif 

but if I paste it to a page at d:\www\Files\index.html it is resolved to d:\www\Bullet.gif which is wrong and dangerous, because it only works internally.

Nothing is posted directly to www.derago.com because we currently only have a dial up connection to the web. So because our whole page is maintained with Amaya we have to check daily if there is d:\www anywhere on our page.
