That's true. The thotlib re-implements the X function XLookupString because 
the standard
one is buggy sometimes. Normally it's supported because the -l takes the first 
occurrence
in libThotEditor.a and doesn't try to load the libX11.a occurrence.
Nevertheless if you have trouble with it you can easily remove the use of the 
libThotEditor.a
occurrence by a patch in the file Amaya/amaya/EDITOR.A:

In the USES section of that file you can remove ", Lookup"
and restart the building of Amaya.
Let me know if it works
