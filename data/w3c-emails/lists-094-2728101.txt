We're considering that problem, but it's not so easy to maintain original
spaces. When Amaya parses the source file it generates a tree structure
conform with the HTML DTD and the user edits that tree structure.
When Amaya saves the new version of the document, the source is generated 
from the tree structure. To maintain original spaces we should store them 
somewhere in the tree structure.

I tested that and the result was "... <code>&lt;para></code>..."
because Amaya forgot that the original ">" was the noted as an entity.
Perhaps the solution should be to let the user choose the output form
"ISO notation" or "entity notation".
