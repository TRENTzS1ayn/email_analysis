I guess the problem comes from a buggy libXm.so. Could you check the location
of that library (execute "ldd" on the amaya binary).
You can try to replace the standard library by that delivered in the tar file 
by
executing
"setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $HOME/Amaya/solaris2.6:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
before starting amaya
