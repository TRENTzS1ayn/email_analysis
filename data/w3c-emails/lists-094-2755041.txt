Hi John,

We completely agree with you. The documentation is incomplete, sometimes
unclear and needs more examples.
Our problem is that first, we have limited resources and second, developers
are not the best peoples able to write documentation.
We will be very happy to have contributors to the Amaya documentation.
We're ready to add their name as Amaya contributors.

Yes.

This is not normal. It should react immediatly.
Could you give us a specific scenario where the error occurs.
