Many web authors make poor colour choices.
Some of these make pages unreadable to colour-impaired
viewers. Several browsers allow an override setting to be
configured by the viewer.  DOES AMAYA ALLOW THE 
VIEWER TO OVERRIDE SETTING MADE INSIDE THE
HTML DOCUMENTS
Being slightly blue/green impaired myself, I view this as 
an important accessibility feature that all browsers,
including Amaya should include.
