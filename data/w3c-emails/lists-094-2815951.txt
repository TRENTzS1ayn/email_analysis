I am attempting to write code snippets as examples of
using style sheet codes. To wit how to include in file...
so i thought that i could use
<pre>
<script>   my example of how script container is used
</script> 
</pre>
of course it doesnt work as <pre> doesn't shut off tag
interpretation --- after RTFM i note pre allows certain
tags for formatting purposes.  Fair enough. Wrong choice
of tags  so i then tried <SAMP>  for sample code 
but it didnt work nor did <CODE>.  Is there no tag that
shuts off all interpretation until its closer is hit.....
I am now stuck with the rather crude character attribute
for lt and gt method.  Surely there is a better technique ???
