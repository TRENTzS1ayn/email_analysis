You can get a gzip for windows from:
http://www.gzip.org/
and for other platforms, and you can get the source there too.
However the FAQ on that page says that Winzip does include gzip
so this may not be the problem.  Assuming you did do the transfer
in binary mode rather than ASCII then I cannot help further, so 
will leave this to the Amaya Team.
