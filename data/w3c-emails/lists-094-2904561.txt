The remote web server machine, which may be owned by the
content provider or even on the content provider's premises.

Because it is not transmitted in the HTTP request (at least
for HTTP/1.0), as the destination server already knows its
own name (actually some sorts of virtual server require this
information, but it is sent separately from the URL, e.g.:

GET /xxxxxx HTTP/1.1
Host: www.sihope.com

but only relatively recent clients and servers use and 
understand Host headers.
