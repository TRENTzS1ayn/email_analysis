whien i use winzip 7.0 to try to unzip sources
i get a message saying
"please enter the full name of file within
amaya-src-2_1_tar.gz 
and it defaults to
amaya-src-2_1_tar.
trying the default unzips into a 22 meg block
but doesnt break it down any further
and i am in the blind as to what other step to follow
or what name to have given at the name it stage ...
it seems that this is quite awkward compared to .zip programs
which simply prompt for a directory (with appropriate
one like program files\amaya\src as a default and
then just unpackages each little file where it should go
if someone has done it with tar.gz format successfully 
to a windows 95 system  then perhaps they can offer
notes up on the download site ....
