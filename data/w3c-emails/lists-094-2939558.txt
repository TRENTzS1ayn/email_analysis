There is a second step required here.

the .gz extension refers to the fact that a file (amaya-src-2_1_tar) has been
compressed using the gzip algorithm, which Winzip understands. in fact that
file itself is an archive format (a "tar file" or "tarball" in common unix
parlance) which has been generateed in a similar manner to a winzip
collection of files. I believe that Winzip will allow you to extract the
files from the tarball in a seperate step (in Unix systems it is a one step
process), in much the way you have described below.

  trying the default unzips into a 22 meg block

  it seems that this is quite awkward compared to .zip programs
  which simply prompt for a directory (with appropriate
  one like program files\amaya\src as a default and
  then just unpackages each little file where it should go
  if someone has done it with tar.gz format successfully 
  to a windows 95 system  then perhaps they can offer
  notes up on the download site ....
