I had previously viewed a page from my own site.
After editting the file and uploading to my isp, i
started amaya to view results.   
But amaya did not refresh  just used the cache copy!
I suspect the refresh test was
        if  ispfiledate_time > cacheversiondate_time  then update
while it should be 
       if   ispfiledate_time <> cacheversiondate_time then update

this is a subtle difference that only affects those with
strange time settings  but surely updates should occur 
whenever a DIFFERENCE occurs !
