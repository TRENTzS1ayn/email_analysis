this is covered on the gzip faq page I mentioned before I think.
Anyway, if you cannot persuade Winzip to read this then you
can get Gnu Tar (described at:
http://www.gnu.org/software/tar/tar.html 
Available from:
ftp://ftp.cs.ubc.ca/mirror2/gnu/tar/
nearest to you)
This can unpack the whole thing in one step
tar -zxvf filename.tar.gz
but it is best to do
tar -ztvf filename.tar.gz
first to make sure that things will be be created where you
want. t means table of contents.
.tgz == .tar.gz by the way.
