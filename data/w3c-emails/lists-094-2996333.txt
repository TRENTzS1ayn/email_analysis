Because Expires is the exception rather than the
rule in HTTP 1.0, most caches need to do a > rather
than an equality date, because they typically do
(last_modified + 0.2 * ( date - last_modified)) as
their estimate of the expiry date.  Any HTTP 1.0 server
with a wild time will not work well with CERN or Squid
caches and probably most others.

HTTP 1.1 replaces Expires with Cache-Control: max-age.
This is relative to the Date header value and can only
meaningfully be tested with inequality tests.

I assume that Amaya uses If-Modified-Since requests to
actually check for updates, and therefore it is the
Server (or public proxy) that does the comparison.  
The one thing to beware
of is that the I-M-S values should be the value from the
L-M-S header on the original page, not the Date header and
certainly not the clients idea of the time it received the
page.
