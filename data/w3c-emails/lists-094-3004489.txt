You need to have a server that supports the PUT method.
In that case the "Save" or "SaveAs" commands should work with an URL
http://host/path/filename
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ a little more "precise", but still vague.

And, first, Open doesn't yet work with exact path. It returns "404 Not
Found", remember? Do some servers not support the GET method either?
-------------------------

New development:
I telnetted to my ISP. Started Lynx. Pressed "g".
Entered: http://localhost/usr/home/....html.
Got: 404 Not Found.
Changed "http" to "file": file is displayed correctly.

So even from my ISP's machine, with a different browser, I get the same
error.

I called my ISP. The tech is looking into what the precise format is that
the http GET requires for specifying the precise path.

Does the Amaya team know what precise format http GET expects so it _will_
find the file? Is it documented in an RFC or such?

Or is there a different problem here? Or what?
