ok -- i read this is that there is a valid reason that it is done
the way it is and works for 99.99% or more of users.
i should really be getting my isp guys to work on the problem
as it is really the server that is at fault.
i also noticed that sometimes two uploads with ftp would signal
that current is older than that at remote (which it isnt) so
other programs are responding to same error ---
will redirect this problem to isp   
thanks for rapid response !!!
