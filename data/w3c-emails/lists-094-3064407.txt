Preference -- Color menu features desired:

[1] It would be innovative if a checkbox switch was provided stating
'These Colors Override Document'.  This would allow user to continue
using their personal color/style settings as determined by the dialog
box or amaya.css rather than deferring to the choices on the selected
document.  This is an ACCESSIBILITY featured that would make it more
convenient for those with color-impaired vision.  To be consistent,
font size / style settings should also be retained when this switch
is checked (or separate checkbox).  If user wants h1 to be 20 pt high
then that should occur even if document sets it at lawyer sized 8pt.

[2] Color preference settings is obviously in a state of evolution.
Some preferences are set from the menu (foreground/background) and
stored in one file while others (link, vlink, alink) must be set
within the Amaya.css stylesheet. Also the palette choosing method
is absent in UNIX and a limited subset in Windows. 
    One way to enhance is to add color choices on the palette and
what is set in the menus to include the link, vlink, and alink colors.
This brings up a problem with palette choices as only left and right
clicks are selections currently.  It can be solved by having display
boxes on the dialog boxes for a swatch of the currently selected color.
Then drag-and-drop technique could be used to pull a color from the
palette to the appropriate choice zone.  This also increases feedback
on current settings where selected swatch would change with entered
color name or hex.  Bad names would be identified by no change in color
and user expecting #0000FF  to be yellow (arf!) would know immediately
to consult his chart, color picker or crystal ball again.

    An alternative route and one that would be more consistent with
Amaya philosophy would be to make all color settings through the style
sheet.  Remove the palette completely.  Leave in the ability to set
foreground or background but save data in Amaya.css (or temporary
while application is running is a possibility).  Removing the palette
makes the browser leaner and programmer can use his own favorite color
picker. This avoids unix/windows  dependent coding as well.
