[1] when cursor plaaced over a hypertext link, the status bar 
could display the link information such as the URL that would be
used......

[2] when one uses the backup arrow to retreat from a lclicked link
the user should be returned to the spot on the previous page that
he departed from.... it is not pleasant to be returned to the top of
 a loooong  page if one was three quarters of the way through it.
