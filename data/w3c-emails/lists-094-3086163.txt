I have a bunch of html that i wish to assemble in one document.
There is no Insert option on the File menu to do this  and my
attempts to cut from one document in another program and 
paste into Amaya failed -- i suspect it only cuts/pastes locally
The ability to Insert a File  or Paste from the Windows buffer
is important feature included in most Windows compliant software
Could these features be added for those that have lots of 
merging and cutting going on.......
