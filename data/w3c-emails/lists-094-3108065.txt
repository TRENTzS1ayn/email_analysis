Yes. This is an error in the libXm.so delivered with solaris 2.6.
To solve that problem I suggest you to try the included version of libXm 
delivered with the binary 2.6 instead of the standard one.
To do that, you have to download somewhere the amaya-solaris2.6-2.1.tar.gz
(see http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/BinDist.html) and change the path in the file
