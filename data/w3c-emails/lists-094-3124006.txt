Hello,
Have there been any reports of troubles installing on Windows NT?  The 95 installation works fine on 95, but I keep getting an app error on _INS0432_MP.exe with the NT installation.  I have downloaded the file more than once and checked  the archives, but there seems to be no mention of this.
Any ideas?
