Hi,

After typing (inserting) text at the beginning of existing text, the tree
debug dump via TtaListAbstractTree does not appear to have these characters.
However all views render the inserted text properly. This does not occur
when text is inserted in the middle or end of existing text. 

1. Is there a call to synchronize the debug dump tree? (probably commit the
insert?!)
2. Is it strange that the views have the updates while the internal tree
doesn't?!

Thanks for any help!
