Yes they can - in fact the original legitimate use of -- --
was in DTD to comment out examples of the constructs being
defined.

However it is not particularly safe, as some browsers parse
SGML comments incorrectly.

Also the comments are unsafe because they use strings of 
hyphens.  Each -- toggles comment status on and off, so you
have to be very careful to get the right number (also an
area where many browsers don't obey the rules).

And the screen shots should have been GIF or PNG; this is a
case where JPEG produces larger files and the JPEG artefacts
can be a real problem.

NB HTML is not a page description language; you shouldn't be
surprised if some browsers even speak your page and shouldn't
expect exactly the same format; use PDF if you want precise 
formatting.
