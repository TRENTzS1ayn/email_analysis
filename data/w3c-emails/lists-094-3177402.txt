All views render the inserted text only if the insert has been committed.
Views don't share anything else than the internal tree.
The commit is done as soon as you change the selection or you display a
menu.
Are you sure you read the right file or the right version of that file?
I checked that on my version of Amaya (compiled with 
AMAYA_OPTIONS=-DAMAYA_DEBUG)
and the dump includes the inserted text.
