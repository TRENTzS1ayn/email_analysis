Yes, we have.
 
I guess you are selecting the link by dragging it with the mouse.
So, you just select a character string: look at the status line, at the
bottom of the window. It probably says "Text\...".
 
Actually, what you want to copy is not that text, but the anchor element
that contains that text. Travel the structure a bit up, until the anchor
element (A) is selected. Use the F2 key (Windows) or the Esc key (Unix)
to that purpose. The status line or the structure view help you to make
sure you select an A element. Then copy and paste.
 
It's quite fast: you don't need to drag over the whole text. Click anywhere
within the anchor and hit F2 or Esc. That's it.
 
Depending on the structure of your bookmark.html document you may even
handle everything at once, by selecting the right part of the source
document.
 
Hope it helps,
 
Vincent.
