Hi,

I've tried to compile Amaya2.1 on the platform:

- SCO ODT 5.04
- GNU-Compiler gcc 2.7.2.3 (FreeSoftwareFoundation)
- GNU Make (ver 3.76.1)

and I've run into the following problems:


1) when compiling the thotlib/base/compilmsg.o 
I got the message

gcc '-DCPP="'"gcc -E -x c"'"' -O2 -W  -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I.. -I../../batch/f
-I../../thotlib/include -
I../../thotlib/internals/var -I../../thotlib/internals/h
-I../../thotlib/internals/f -I../../schemas
 -I../../schemasOPERA -I../../libjpeg -I../../libpng -I../../libpng/zlib
-c ../../batch/../thotlib
/base/compilmsg.c -o ../thotlib/base/compilmsg.o
gcc: language c" not recognized
../../batch/../thotlib/base/compilmsg.c:0: unterminated string or character
constant
../../batch/../thotlib/base/compilmsg.c:0: possible real start of
unterminated constant
gmake[1]: *** [../thotlib/base/compilmsg.o] Error 1

... seems to be the same problem as reported by Hummert Andree, 27 Jul 1999

In addition, I've found out that this must be a problem with the
GNU-Compiler; 
it don't accept 'blanc separated defines' passed by the -D option (as it is
used in the above command-line).
 
--> I've found a "work around" (surely not an ofiicial solution):

*delete the -DCPP=... in Amaya/obj/batch/Makefile

and, instead of that, include a 

*#define CPP "gcc -E -x c "
in the header Amaya/thotlib/internals/h/compilmsg.h

--> O.k. 
--> let's move to the next problem ...


2) When compiling the libwww/Library/src/HTZip.c

I got the message:

gcc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I../../../../../libwww/Library/src -I../..
-I/usr/local/include -I../../../
../../libwww/modules/md5 -I../../../../../libwww/modules/expat/xmlparse
-DW3C_ICONS=\"/usr/local/sha
re/w3c-libwww\" -O2 -W -Wp,-MD,.deps/HTZip.pp -c
../../../../../libwww/Library/src/HTZip.c -o HTZip.
o
../../../../../libwww/Library/src/HTZip.c:23: zlib.h: No such file or
directory
gmake[3]: *** [HTZip.lo] Error 1
gmake[3]: Leaving directory `/home/amaya2_1/Amaya/obj/libwww/Library/src'

---> which seems to be an error in the Amaja-distibution.

I've found the following "work around":
 
*the missing header could be found in Amaya/libpng/zlib/
*so I've extended the Include-Path in 
Amaya/obj/libwww/Library/src/Makefile 
by 
Amaya/libpng/zlib 


... which is also not an official solution, but:
... finally (with this work around) amaja has been built.


My questions:

Can you help me with these problems ?
Do you have an idea to avoid the problems ?
