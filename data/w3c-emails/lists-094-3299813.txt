Hello Veren,

Amaya is a testbed editor/browser, that's why you can edit pages with it.
For the moment, you can desactivate the editing mode by clicking on the
pencil icon, on the button bar. We're currently working on a profiles
feature for Amaya, which will allow the user to reorganize Amaya GUI in 
an easy way.  We'll have a profile for browse-only mode and it'll remove
all the buttons and menu items that concern edition. Note that this is only
a run-time rejuggling of the Amaya GUI. The whole functionality will still
be in the binary. This feature will be available on the next Amaya release.

I'll happen (thru the profiles menu). We don't have any plans
for the moment to modify the makefile and the code to be able to compile
a lighter Amaya "browse-only" binary. As the source code is available,
feel free to peek a look and eventually make a contribution :)

Regards,
