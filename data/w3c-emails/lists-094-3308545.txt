Hi,

Some basic set elements such as SPAN, SUB, SUP, etc., insert an ancestor
(ADDRESS?) when they're inserted on a new empty document. In
CreateNewElement, it appears CanInsertBySplitting returns FALSE on current
element (type 27) at the insertion point, and ListRuleOfElem subsequently
returns ADDRESS as a possible ancestor where the element is inserted as a
child under. As far as I know, the standard does not require presence of
ADDRESS (or other ancestor -- well, it has to be inside BODY obviously)
before inserting SPAN, SUB, SUP, etc.

Is this a bug? If so, what is the suggested code fix?

Thanks!
-An
