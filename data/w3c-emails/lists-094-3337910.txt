Oops, I meant BODY, not BASE. :)

I've dug deeper into this...

It appears that inserting a pseudo paragraph fixes this problem (if it is
indeed one). Then the next question is, is this a correct fix? Will it be
safe to universally insert a pseudo paragraph before SPAN, etc., or just in
the case where it follows the BASE element? I'm thinking maybe in some case
where it is illegal to insert SPAN, inserting the pseudo paragraph may
become a backdoor.

On another note, inserting this pseudo paragraph also allows you to type
text right after inserting an image after BASE! Is this valid HTML structure
or is the behavior of such code undefined by the spec?  If it's valid then
inserting the pseudo paragraph appears to fix this other problem.

Thanks for any feedback!

Hi,

Some basic set elements such as SPAN, SUB, SUP, etc., insert an ancestor
(ADDRESS?) when they're inserted on a new empty document. In
CreateNewElement, it appears CanInsertBySplitting returns FALSE on current
element (type 27) at the insertion point, and ListRuleOfElem subsequently
returns ADDRESS as a possible ancestor where the element is inserted as a
child under. As far as I know, the standard does not require presence of
ADDRESS (or other ancestor -- well, it has to be inside BODY obviously)
before inserting SPAN, SUB, SUP, etc.

Is this a bug? If so, what is the suggested code fix?

Thanks!
-An
