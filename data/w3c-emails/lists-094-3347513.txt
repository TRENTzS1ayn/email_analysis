Hi Ly,

SPAN, SUP, SUB, etc. elements are in-line elements and Amaya needs a block
element to format them in line. When they are not put into a paragraph Amaya
is waiting for a pseudo block level (the pseudo paragraph). The pseudo paragrah
is automatically generated by our HTML parser and is never exported.
