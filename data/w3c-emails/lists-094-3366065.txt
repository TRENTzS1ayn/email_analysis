Amaya maintainers,

There a number of problems with the source.

1/ Why do you recommend to do "gmake all"??? If you have configured
   the project so as to build only some modules, that does not seem
   a good idea.
2/ The "gmake" command stops before finishing, even though there is
   no error; it has to be restarted. There are also lots of messages
   about this or that file having "modification time in the future",
   which, taken at face value, is ridiculous.
3/ The Makefile in libwww/Library/src is missing a reference to the
   zlib include dir in INCLUDES; without it HTZip.c will not compile
4/ pluginlib/editplugin.c tries to include a non-existant app.h
   That one has me stumped: like I said, there is _no_ app.h in the
   entire amaya source tree
5/ The error archive URL (http://opera.inrialpes.fr/amaya/messages/)
   is dead.

Your advice re. 4/ would be appreciated.

Thanks,

Olivier Lefevre
