I am truly sorry for the inappropriate message sent yesterday regarding
enhancing Amaya with Networds.  This is the first mailing list I've
joined and am obviously inexperienced! I thought because the group was
described as the place to introduce new enhancements, that  it would be
the appropriate place to bring up the subject.  I can see I was wrong.

Please except my apologies.
