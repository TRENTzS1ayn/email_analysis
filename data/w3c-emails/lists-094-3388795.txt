I'll leave the other questions to the Amaya team.

This problem has nothing to do with Amaya, but with your computer.
Are any of the files you are compiling on an NFS mount?  If so, then
the clock of your machine (where gmake is running) is out of synch
with the clock on the NFS server (which put the timestamp on the
files).  If it is complaining about a file you just edited, you can
"touch" the file - which should timestamp it with your clock, instead
of the NFS server's clock.
