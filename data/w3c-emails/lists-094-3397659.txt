Hi Irene,

I quickly tested importing an existing doc and it indeed inserts a pseudo p
before SPAN and IMG. But the GUI incorrectly (?) inserts an ADDRESS block
element  when I insert a SPAN/SUP/SUB, etc. And it doesn't insert any block
element when I insert an IMG. I am testing with 2.0a.

Oh, how to tell if the parent of insertion point is a pseudo block
level-type of element? 

Thanks for your help...
-An

Hi Ly,

SPAN, SUP, SUB, etc. elements are in-line elements and Amaya needs a block
element to format them in line. When they are not put into a paragraph Amaya
is waiting for a pseudo block level (the pseudo paragraph). The pseudo
paragrah
is automatically generated by our HTML parser and is never exported.
