We want to be sure that comilers are generated at the first time.
Otherwise "make" or "gmake" is enough.

That is due to a problem of with your file system.

The zlib is used both by hte libpng and the libwww. We have only one
instance which is located in the sub-directory Amaya/libpng/zlib
The Amaya Makefile should get zlib information from the right place.

That is a bug in the current distribution. Due to problems on Windows
platforms (Windows is not cas sensitive) we changed that file name
to appstruct.h and we forgot to update the include in the file
editplugin.c
