The attached gif shows that mathml is apparently completely broken in the
latest Amaya release, whereas version 1.3 seemed to work tolerably.

I downloaded amaya-2.1-2.i386.rpm from 
http://rpmfind.net/linux/RPM/amaya.html
and installed it on my RH6.0 linux system.
 That is the version that is broken.

Anyone had similar experience?
