my environment is windows 95 / amaya 2
internet connect through network ( cable modem )

on monday sep 6 our isp went down and service lights on modem off

i tried to do something that is quite normal in netscape 
ie. start my connection,  hit the stopsign and work off line 
accessing my own stuff on local disk.........

but when i tried this with amaya  -- there was no way of breaking out
all i got was the hourglass and no ability to pull down any menus
even help  or even to size the window.........
and of course no stopsign to click on even if the clicks worked
I SEE TWO PROBLEMS HERE ... no multi-tasking  and no abort 
download option.
after my isp came up i searched all the menus and could not find
any 'interrupt current transfer' type of option.........
next time i guess i could modify ini file to point at local disk  before 
starting program   but i see this as a big hole in browser capability!!

has anyone else encountered this   or
wanted to break a download because of net traffic conditions ......
