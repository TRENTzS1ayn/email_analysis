Amaya has a Stop button feature. However, when trying to resolve a
name (e.g., for converting www.w3.org to an IP address), we have
to make a blocking system call. There's no way to get back the hand
until that system call returns. I think that this is what happened to you.
This is a known problem, not related to Amaya, and also exists under Unix.

For all the other network tasks, we have an network-based event loop
(only does something when there's some activity), and which allows for
non-blocking network requests.

There's a new GNU project for having a non-blocking name resolver call.
It's still on an early stage (ver. 0.01), but it looks promising and it'll
solve this problem. 

Cheers,

-Jose
