Can you be more precise and tell us which menu entry is giving you
troubles (Home Page, Menu Font Size, ...) and what you were trying to do?
Also, could you report on which OS you're using (Unix, Windows) and
which Amaya version (click on the Help/About Amaya to get that info).

All menu items and dialogues exist both in French and English. To activate
the language, you need to type "fr" in the 
General/Preferences/Dialogue Language entry. Then, you have to quit Amaya
and launch it again (this change isn't immediate).
