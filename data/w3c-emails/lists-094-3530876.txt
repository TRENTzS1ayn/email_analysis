" Amaya has a Stop button feature. However, when trying to resolve a
" name (e.g., for converting www.w3.org to an IP address), we have
" to make a blocking system call. There's no way to get back the hand
" until that system call returns. I think that this is what happened to you.
" This is a known problem, not related to Amaya, and also exists under Unix.

As a stopgap measure, why don't you add a timer, so that after a generous
waiting a nice SIGALRM is generated and operation can happily go on?
