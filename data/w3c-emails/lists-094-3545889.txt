if a style sheet  happens to miss on the background
setting  for example    background : gris
in amaya i get a solid black background.........
in explorer it just says lets go with the default setting of
the browser
explorer is much kinder and i think amaya could be programmed
to fall back on the default setting rather than black --------
(((of course a user in a funky mood could choose black  but that
is another story )))
