HTML editors, and browsers used to verify pages,
should never apply error recovery, except that an
editor may apply error recovery by correcting the 
source.

One of the reasons for the fact that most web pages
are invalid HTML is that people validate them with 
browsers which attempt error recovery, so they end up
designing for the error recovery behaviour, not to the
specification.
