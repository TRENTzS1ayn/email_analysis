My understanding is that Amaya is an EDITOR with 
browsing capabilities and it's primary aim is to 
be a tool for generating valid HTML, not as a 
competitor for commercial browsers.

This is a question of words, I think.  But most
people creating a page with Front Page, will view
it with Internet Explorer, rather than putting it
onto the web there and then.  It is that viewing
with IE that constitutes their validation of the
page - i.e. they are validating that it works with
their favourite browser.  They may also "validate"
with Netscape to get about 90% coverage of users.
