I am trying to become familiar with Math capabilities of
Amaya so I set outto write the quadratic equation.....
How do I stick in a plus/minus sign ..... it isnt on the
math toolbar and there is no general one for doing
character entities....  searched help for sticking in
char entity but couldnt find ...... most of course are 
handled by foreign character assignments but what 
abt the plus/minus
