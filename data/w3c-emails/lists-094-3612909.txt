Sometimes it's enlightening (and a bit scary) to take a file saved in .HTM
format out of MS Office 2000 apps like Word or Excel and to drop it into a
validating syntax-directed editor.  Though I'm still learning my way around
SGML/HTML/XML validation, it appears to me that when they save as HTML,
these apps are not "expecting" Validating by anything other than themselves
or web browsers.
Cheers, Dan

It Sounds like those people don't really know what Validation is then.
