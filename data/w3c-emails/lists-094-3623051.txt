These people mean upwards of 99% (finger in the air, but
I'm reasonably confident) of web content creators.  In 
my experience it is very rare for even blue-chip companies'
web sites to pass a proper validation (my own won't, but
I have little influence on the marketing people).

Let's take some companies at random:

http://www.intel.com/ - Failed
http://www.ford.com/ - Failed
http://www.altavista.com/ - Failed (this was the only one I've 
                            checked before)
http://www.ups.com - one error - looks like they did validate it
                     once!
http://www.amazon.com - Failed
http://www.whitehouse.gov - Failed
http://www.apple.com - Failed
http://www.w3.org - Passed, as expected.
http://www.websitegarage.com - Failed - and this claims to be
                              a validator
http://www.sco.com - Failed

All the failures are more serious than a missing DOCTYPE or
missing ALTs, except for UPS.

NB a common argument I here is that there is no advantage in
conforming to the DTD if your page works with IE4/5 and NS 4.x.
