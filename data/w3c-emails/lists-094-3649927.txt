My site was made with Amaya and it still doesn't pass completely due to missing
ALT tags in an image map  (Amaya made sure to request alt tags on the normal
images, but nothing for the individual links in the map - or so the
validator's message appears to me).  So there is *some* error tolerance in
Amaya, at least. :)
