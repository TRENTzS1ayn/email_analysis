For a lot of users, missing ALT is the single most critical problem in being
able to use a website. That is why it is required by the DTD, and is one
example of why validating to the DTD is as important as working with
browsers.

Another argument is 280 million mobile phones. At Christmas time almost none
were web-capable. (Actually that is not quite true - there a re a large
number of people who use the web by telephone through gateway services).
Early this year about a quarter of a million were. The figure is expected to
reach 100 million some time in the next two or three years (depends on who
you ask), and these devices use a wide range of software, with the only
common features being that it isn't either IE or Netscape.

Another is accessibility to people with disabilities - in many countries this
is a legal requirement for large content providers (in the US for government
and government funded providers. In Australia for people who offer services,
including but not limited to sales, recreation, education, ...) and often
people are usng things other than NS/IE for access. (Hence the work that is
being done to make Amaya itself more accessible, and do things like require
ALTs in images/image map areas...

  All the failures are more serious than a missing DOCTYPE or

  NB a common argument I here is that there is no advantage in
  conforming to the DTD if your page works with IE4/5 and NS 4.x.
