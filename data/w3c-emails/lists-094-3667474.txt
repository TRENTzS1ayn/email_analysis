Actually I agree, in part because I sometimes use Lynx,
however missing ALT is probably the most common HTML error
and accounted for most of the validation errors, so I wanted
to point out that the failed pages didn't just fail on
that point.

Requiring it in the DTD, unfortunately, doesn't solve the
problem as it is easy to shut up a validator by using
alt="", if you are energetic, or leaving it as 
alt="silly-picture.gif (100MB)".  Even people who actually
key something in rarely think about why it's really there.
