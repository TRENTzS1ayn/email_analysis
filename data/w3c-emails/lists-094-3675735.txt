Right. I use Lynx most of the time - it's fast. I use Amaya if I am editing
stuff, which I do for a fair number of hours a day, and I use some other
browser if I need to deal with tag-soup masquerading as HTML.

Since accessibility is my job, I am encouraged by the fact that the sue of
ALT is actually a lot better than it was two years ago, although I agree that
there are still too many people who don't see the value of it. And too many
tools that make it difficult to use it well. (I would appreciate feedback on
the image help page of Amaya, which deals with using alt as part of the
process. But I don't know how many people read documentation...)

  Actually I agree, in part because I sometimes use Lynx,
  however missing ALT is probably the most common HTML error
  and accounted for most of the validation errors, so I wanted
  to point out that the failed pages didn't just fail on
  that point.
  
  Requiring it in the DTD, unfortunately, doesn't solve the
  problem as it is easy to shut up a validator by using
  alt="", if you are energetic, or leaving it as 
  alt="silly-picture.gif (100MB)".  Even people who actually
  key something in rarely think about why it's really there.
