I don't think I entirely agree on this.  I've seen a fair portion of sites that
*do* use ALT and still make no sense using Lynx.  It doesn't help when the
image's ALT tag says "image".  I don't think there's really a way to validate
making sure the tags are actually useful for navigation without having a human
do it.

(That's why I like Amaya's text view option.  I don't even have to whip out
Lynx to check and see if my page makes sense in a text-based broswer.)

I'm guessing that Amaya pre-2.1 (or possibly even 2.1 - I've edited some of my
pages with it, though most were originally created in 2.0) *doesn't* require
ALT tags in image maps?  That's the only part my Amaya-created pages fail on
the validator.
