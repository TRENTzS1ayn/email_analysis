Correct - validating to the DTD can be a necessary step, but is usually
insufficient (and the rest is often difficult to test automagically.) In fact
conformance to the specification implies more than simple syntax validity -
for example, HTML 4.0 says that the use of tables for layout is deprecated,
but it can be done in a way which is syntactically correct.

And also correct that pre 2.1 Amaya allowed AREAs without alt text. They are
now mandatory (another example of Amaya demonstrating accessibility in
authoring tools ;-)

  I don't think I entirely agree on this.  I've seen a fair portion of sites that
  *do* use ALT and still make no sense using Lynx.  It doesn't help when the
  image's ALT tag says "image".  I don't think there's really a way to validate
  making sure the tags are actually useful for navigation without having a human
  do it.
  
  (That's why I like Amaya's text view option.  I don't even have to whip out
  Lynx to check and see if my page makes sense in a text-based broswer.)

  I'm guessing that Amaya pre-2.1 (or possibly even 2.1 - I've edited some of my
  pages with it, though most were originally created in 2.0) *doesn't* require
  ALT tags in image maps?  That's the only part my Amaya-created pages fail on
  the validator.
