Hi,

The language of the document could be different from the dialog language.
I often edit a French document with a English dialogue. It's why the dialog
doesn't manage the keyboard in a consistent way.
You have to switch the "Enable multi-key" in Preferences->General to be able
to insert French characters with an English keyboard ('e will generate ?).

  Irene.
