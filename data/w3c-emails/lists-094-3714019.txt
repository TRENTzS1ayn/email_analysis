Click on the Math button (the rightmost button on the button bar).
You get the Math tool bar.  Click on the last button (it's labelled
alpha beta gamma) and you'll get a palette with all characters
from the Symbol font. The plus/minus sign is available there.
Just click it, and it will be inserted at the current position
in your equation.

Vincent.
