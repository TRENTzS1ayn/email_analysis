strange things under a midnight sun

when a background is set to 'silver' or #C0C0C0
within an html document, it is rendered correctly.

when the preferences -- color -- background is set to 
#C0C0C0 it comes out as blue with flecks.

when the preferences -- color -- background is set to 
silver it comes out as pink with flecks.

this is with a 256 (640x480) color pallette set as display
so the display is cabable of displaying the color but 
somehow the amaya interface for setting preferences is
not quite correct .......
