This is a known bug. I hope it gets fixed soon - it can be a real problem.

The only workaround I have is to make my window more than one screen wide -
which is not very good either. (I use linux, which allows me to have a
virtual desktop that is several screens across, but i believe windows will
let you make a window larger tha the screen size and move it back and forth
across the screen)

  Previous messages mention this issue, but the answer seems to be missing.
  
  Is this a known bug, and are there any workarounds?
  
  Thanks.
