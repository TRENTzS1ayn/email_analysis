Hello:
I am trying to use Amaya with a server that expects comments of the form
<!-- Comment -->.  Presently the server properly responds to the HEAD
request and then Amaya responds with a PUT containing the entire page
including the edits. The server is willing to accept the "PUT" edits but
since it actively renders some of the page itself it has its own idea about
where the editable "body"  begins and ends.  It uses  <!-- Start --> and
<!-- End --> to mark the part it will accept as a user edit.  It is designed
to grab that part and it renders the page by rendering its own part together
with the new edits.  The problem is that Amaya is mangling the comments so
they can't be scanned reliabily.  This can be seen in the structure view and
it can be seen in the PUT request that the server is getting.  Is this a
known bug?  Is there a better thing the server should be doing?

Thank you,

Joe Whitesell
