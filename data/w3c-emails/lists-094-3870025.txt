Fix the server, or send the suppliers a copy of the 
SGML standard!  It is grossly abusing what is already
a hack.

HTML comments are really null SGML directives with embedded
SGML comments.  This is a real example of comments in a non-null
directive (this is also why <!------> won't work):

<!ATTLIST BODY
     %attrs;                       -- %coreattrs, %i18n, %events --
     onload %Script; #IMPLIED      -- the document has been loaded --
     onunload %Script; #IMPLIED    -- the document has been removed --

Although I think the server is misunderstanding SGML, it doesn't
mean that the Amaya team intended to break their particular hack.
