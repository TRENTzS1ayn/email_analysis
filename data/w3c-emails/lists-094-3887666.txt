As Charles noted, this is a known bug and it's on the to do list of
the development team.
The problem has already been fixed for plain text documents.  Try to
download a CSS style sheet, an XML document, or any plain text file:
the source code is displayed in a window with a functional horizontal
scroll bar.

So, some progress has been made. More to come.

Vincent.
