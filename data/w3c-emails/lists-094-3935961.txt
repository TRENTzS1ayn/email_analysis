Hi,

During the course of editing a document, one text element may be split into
multiple text elements. For example, when you insert other elements in the
middle of it. When the inserted elements are deleted, some split text
elements are still split, although they can be collapsed back into one text
element. This sometimes leads to confusion especially when editing in the
struct view.

Is there already a clean-up function that can go through the tree and fix
it? If not, what is the suggest way to do it (walk sibling elements while
it's text and collect them all into 1 text element?).

Thanks for your help!

An
