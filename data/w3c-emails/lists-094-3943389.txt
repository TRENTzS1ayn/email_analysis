Thanks, Vincent (and Charles) -

You mentioned a "to do list of the development team." Can users search that
list before (re-)reporting suspected bugs here?  I've found a couple of
other anomalies.

I did verify that the scrollbar works with plain text files. Since Amaya is
open source, would the team be willing to coordinate with users who wish to
contribute bug fixes?
