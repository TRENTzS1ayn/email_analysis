The "to do list" is a W3C internal list and can be unreadable for common users.
Too very technical points are noted there.
In fact the Amaya team takes inputs form the www-amaya@w3.org archive and W3C 
team
requests to build that "to do list".
Our real problem is a lack of manpower to satisfy all these wishes.

Of course yes. We're ready to answer any technical question by e-mail, but
it's also possible to visit us to discuss a specific point.
If you plan to make a bug fix or any Amaya extension, please contact us.
