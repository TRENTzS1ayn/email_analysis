Hi,

maybe my question looks silly, but I'm have the very little experience
with X Window.

My question is: why Amaya refuses to pass 8-bit characters? I wanna use
russian letters (using KOI8-R encoding), but Amaysa seems just
ignoring them... Is there a way to avoid this limitation?


OS: FreeBSD 3.3-RC
X Window: 3.3.5
Amaya: Release 2.1

And (don't know if this message important in this case) Amaya (after
the very start) also says:

"Unable to install full Iso-Latin-1 : 80 of 98 key"
