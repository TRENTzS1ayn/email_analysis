The document http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-amaya-970220.html explains how Amaya
works.

The file Amaya/amaya/HTML.S describes the internal structure of HTML documents.
That files includes a large set of comments.
The file Amaya/amaya/HTMLP.P describes default presentation rules applied to 
each
elements.

You can also compile Amaya with the debug option and dump at any time current
internal structures in clear.
For that you have to set the following line in the file Options:
AMAYA_OPTIONS=-DAMAYA_DEBUG

After that, each time you select Help->AboutAmaya Amaya will generates 3 files:
- tree.debug which dumps the document Abstract Tree
- view.debug which dumps the document Abstract Picture (what presentation 
rules are
  applied to each displayed elements)
- boxes.debug which dumps displayed boxes.

Regards
  Irene.
