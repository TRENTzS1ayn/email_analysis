8em is quite big (about an inch in the font I'm using now).

BODY    { background: url(/wrm/images/paper.gif) #ffe0e0; }  /* abs
URL cos NS is broken */

This was preceded by:

BODY       { background-color: #ffe0e0;
             color: black;
             font-family: "Times New Roman", serif;
             text-align: center;
             }

which sets the foreground colour; they were separate to allow a fall
back if
the URL didn't take.
