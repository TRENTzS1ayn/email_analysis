By definition an em is the width of the letter m.
Normally one assumes that this is measured on the
normal text font used (either determined by the browser
user or defined by the page designer with their font settings)

Amaya apparently uses the size of the letter m as it occurs in
the current <h1> sizing.  Is this issue clear in the specification
or is it up to browser interpretation.  it really should be a well defined item
as a margin setting will become a common feature of stylesheets
i am trying to use it for those nice pages that have left side decoration
