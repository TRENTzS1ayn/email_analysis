This is what the CSS2 spec says.  Unfortunately you
don't say what element you are setting the size on.
(The sample style sheet uses the browser default as
the reference for all sizes.)

The 'em' unit is equal to the computed value of the 'font-size' property of
the
element on which it is used. The exception is when 'em' occurs in the value
of
the 'font-size' property itself, in which case it refers to the font size of
the parent
element. It may be used for vertical or horizontal measurement. (This unit
is also
sometimes called the quad-width in typographic texts.)
