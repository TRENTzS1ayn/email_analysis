here is the file i am testing on
margin and paragraph are using em measures
but they appear to be using width determined by h1 size
and this continues even when i drop the heading entirely.
my thought would be that they should use the size of
the text in the paragraph itself, not what preceeds it....
so calc of width done at wrong point ???  but i could be wrong
and i find it inconsistant with other browsers... thus my
question as to whether the spec is tight enuff
