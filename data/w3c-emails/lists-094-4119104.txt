WHAT IN THE HECK DID YOU DO TO MY HARD DRIVE????!!!!!!

I downloaded and installed Amaya 2.1 from your web site. After
installing it, I discovered it was not something that I wanted to
use. I uninstalled it using the add/remove programs prompt.

After it was uninstalled, I discovered there was still the folder
left, with a sub folder under it. No matter what I do I cannot delete
this folder. From the DOS prompt, this folder is named with the ascii
(?) smiley face (white border and features, not the reverse...I don't
have an ascii chart handy or I'd give you the codes.)

Under W95, this directory appears as a solid line in Explorer. When
attempting to delete this file, Explorer tells me the specified path
of the subfolder is invalid. The same happens if I try to rename it.

Under DOS, I tried Norton NCD for DOS. Just deleting the directory
under NCD doesn't work. It tells me the directory is not empty.

Using Norton's Delete Tree command brings up a dialog box saying it
is deleting the tree, and shows *15* smiley face subdirectories
(where it runs out of space in the box), and locks up.

The DOS RD command will not remove the Amaya directory, because it
says the directory is not empty. I have no idea how to switch to the
"smiley face" from the DOS prompt.

Using the DOS deltree command seems to work, and it says it deleted
the Amaya directory and its subs. but a check of the tree, shows it
is still there.

No matter what I do, the damn thing is still there!!!

HOW DO I GET RID OF THIS DAMN THING???!!!! (yes, I know, CAPS implies
YELLING.) I am totally  confused by this one.

Thank you for your time and prompt reply.
