Amaya has some bugs in the way it renders HTML, and tables is an area where
this is obvious. However by and large it renders according to the
specifications - which gives results that are different from many versions of
Explorer or Netscape.

As for solutions, there are several approaches. One is to submit code patches
to fix the bugs. An easier approach is to ensure your code is correct (Amaya
will help with this), and until the bugs are fixed used a second browser for
viewing.

Note that the use of tables for page layout is explicitly deprecated in HTML
4.0 - I would encourage you to use CSS positioning where possible.

You will also find that Amaya is very handy for doing thins like making style
rules - you could select one of your styled links, create a rule, and not
ahve to worry about styling any more of them - leaner cleaner code with no
performance hit (I don't know of any stylesheet-capable browser taht cannot
link to an external stylesheet).

  Hi, all I just joined the list and have a problem with Amaya.
  
  My business website looks perfectly fine in either IE5 or Netscape but as
  soon as I load it up in Amaya it all goes screwy. Spacing between cells of
  a table are completly out of control, <p> and <br> tags are intermitently
  ignored, and a few other problems. Amaya did find for me a minor problem of
     <font> text here <p></font>   and those I fixed locally, haven't
  uploaded that fix yet, but Amaya still incorectly displays the page. I've
  tried both the Windows version (98) and Linux versions, and neither shows
  things properly.
  
  Here's url to my site for any one who wants to see what I'm talking about:

  Any help solving this would be great. Thanks
