Thanks all who answered, I'm still relativly new at making web pages and
dodn't know what that main line at the top of the document means. I'm glad
to have found out what I did wrong :) just didn't search around enough.

Now one more question, CSS is Cascading Style Sheets right? If so, IE5 and
Netscape 4.xx don't currently handle that properly right?

The idea with the way I was designing the pages was with some sort of
backwards compatability with older browsers, and also I just don't know
right now how to do Style Sheets of any kind. :) Obviously from the results
of the W3C Validator I failed in that direction too. :)

So we'll see how things go, and thanks again.
