If you only installed and uninstalled Amaya, I guess you have trouble
with Installshield.

Otherwise, could you give us:
- the complete path where Amaya was installed
- the complete path of the directory you cannot delete
- your login name, because Amaya uses that login name to save user's
  preferences.
