I have installed version 2.1 in WIN 95 SR2 4.00.950B.
I can access the program, and most of the features,
including accessing local files.

However, when I attempt to access files on the web,
by typing in addresses nothing happens.

When I click on links within the default page (linked to
various w3c sites)I get only the DOCTYPE line at the
top of the file.

Both Netscape and IE work with my current Windows and
DUN settings. (I am connecting at 56k over a dial-up line and
56k Lucent Win-modem)

I downloaded the amaya-Windows95-2_1.exe file, are
there files needed that are not included in this distribution?

Are there configuration settings in Windows or Amaya that
I have missed?
