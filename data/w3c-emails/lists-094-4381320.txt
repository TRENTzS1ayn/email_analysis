MAP is allowed to have block content in HTML 4.0, and I am wondering wht
needs to be changed to make it work in Amaya

I guess that the HTML.S needs change. Now it has MAP as 

  LIST Of (AREA)

and that should be AREA, Block

And the types menu needs to have Map as an option - but it looks like there
are a few things I need to do to allow a MAP that is not associated with an
image.

(This is an accessibility requirement in particular)

Any help?would be greatly appreciated
