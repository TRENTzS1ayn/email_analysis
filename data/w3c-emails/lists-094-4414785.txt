for a standard to be accepted:
[1] any ambiguity in the specification should be clarified by the
     defining committee. Future specifications should include the 
     clarification.
[2] organizations that state that they are accepting and complying
     with the standard should be coerced by the defining committee 
     to either truly comply or stop advertising compliance.
i have a small example in my test area (check navbar) of my homepage
that illustrates a property that is interpreted differently by amaya and
netscape --- which is correct (i hope netscape) and should not the other
be informed of non-compliance.  the property reads something like
   BODY { background: URL("ivy.gif") white }
netscape does both, uses the parchment and sets the general backgrnd
to  white....... amaya does the parchment but leaves the color at the
browser default..... [you can see why i prefer netscape]  
1] what is specification when two valid arguments exist
2] which browser is non-complient
3] any way of getting them to comply
am in process of getting iexplore to see their take  and will reverse args
to see what happens on each browser .....  
but i thought the whole point was to get to the level where code would 
be interpreted relatively the same on all browsers......
3.2 methodology was actually more consistant here....
