back to my problem with em size
my test page (test.htm) at my site
found easily with test area slot on navbar
using a parchment with an ivy border and margin-left: 3em
ie 4.72 puts text well into ivy
amaya 2.1 touches the ivy just a bit
netscape 4.7 places text well away from ivy

maybe the standard should be pdf   :-)  :-)  :-)
that way everyone would see almost the same !!!
try it out and chortle at your results
