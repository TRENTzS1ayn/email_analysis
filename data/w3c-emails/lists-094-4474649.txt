Compilation of Amaya under RedHat Linux 6.0 appears to fail in the
unicode section. I'm obviously doing something wrong, but don't know
what it is.

The attached tar.gz file contains four files that give further
information.
They were generated by the commands below, both of which were done as
root from the Amaya/obj directory.

   ../configure 1> configure.txt 2> configure.err
   make all 1> make_all.txt 2> make_all.err

My version of /usr/bin/cpp is as follows:

   #!/bin/sh
   exec `gcc --print-prog-name=cpp` $@

which does an exec of:

   /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-redhat-linux/egcs-2.91.66/cpp
