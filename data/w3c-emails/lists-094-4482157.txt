The Thotlib is able to manage structured graphics, like an arrow from the 
rectangle
A to the rectangle B.

-----            -----
| A |----------->| B |
-----            -----

The shape or the arrow is "->".
If the formatting displays the rectangle A on the left of the rectangle B, the 
Thotlib is able to automatically invert the real shape to maintain the 
relation
form A to B.

-----          -----
| B |<---------| A |
-----          -----

The AbRealShape is used to implement that functionality.
I'm not sure it's clear.

  Irene.
