I'm trying to compile Amaya using VC++ 6.0 and I'm getting the error:
    
    Build process aborted because of errors

When I load the file "Windows\amaya\amaya.mkf" the window remains empty and if I then try to build it I get the error mentioned above. 

Is there something I missed?  Also, is there a log file which logs errors or other events that occur?

Thanks in advance for your help,
