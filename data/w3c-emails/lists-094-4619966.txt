I agree with you. There are two suggested fixes:
1) Set the page in the read-only mode as soon as the user selects within a
   form input element and reset the previous mode when he/she leaves.

2) Define a specific "Thot exception" which prohibits the moving to another
   element on a backspace command and set that exception to form input 
elements.

I would try to implement the second one.

The DTD says that the <p> is not absolutely required, but it's cleaner to 
generate
it.
