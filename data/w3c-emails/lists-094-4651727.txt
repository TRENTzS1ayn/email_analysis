Good Afternoon Paul,
I thought that this was the announcement list.  I was just added to this list.  The description from the W3C site it says that, the www-amaya@w3.org mailing list is:
 " This mailing list is for discussion about general issues of Amaya, the W3C testbed client. This is the official forum where we announce new Amaya releases. It's also a place for submitting bug reports, for proposing enhancements to Amaya, and for discussing installation and configuration problems. "
So, Paul it would seem that you are in the official announcement forum. Or am I mistaken?  
Hope everyone has a Great Weekend!  :)
