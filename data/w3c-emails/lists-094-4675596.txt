Of late, there has been a large amount of discussion regarding the
development and compiling of Amaya. Not that I'm complaining, but none of
which is terribly useful for me. I suppose you could 'argue' that this is
covered within "installation and configuration problems".

I brought it up as a suggestion, and Irene refined that suggestion by
saying that there could be another list created for announcements and bug
reports. (Which I think would be terrific, by the way). I'm not insistant
though, since I'm not sure how much demand for something like that would
be. :)
