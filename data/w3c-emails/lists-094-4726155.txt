Help.

I've tried several times to get Amaya to work on Win98. I've downloaded
several different versions, installed same, and still my system crashed
every time I try to use it. I think it's a memory problem, but I can't be
sure.

Can anyone help me out here? I'd really like to try Amaya out, but I don't
yet have access to a Unix box.

Thanks.
