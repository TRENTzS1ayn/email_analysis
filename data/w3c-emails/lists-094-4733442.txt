The smal piece of HTML code included in your message displays correctly
in Amaya.  I just checked.  I suspect that something is wrong elsewhere
in your file.  The first letter of a paragraph may disappear in Amaya
when that paragraph is within a block-level element.  Could you check?

To check your HTML file, you can consider validating it with:

    http://validator.w3.org/

Blockquote is definitely in HTML 4. So, if you also have troubles with
blockquote, it may be because you use these tags in a wrong context.
Again, validating the document may help.

Vincent.
