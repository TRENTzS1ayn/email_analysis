It is good to hear that Amaya will be getting
a new version soon.  I hope that severl things
in the user interfaced are fixed for the Windows 9x
version.  These bugs are:

1] checking for video color capabilitiies and 
   choosing a better pallette when 256 color mode.

2] checking for video size and positioning windows
   inside the frame -- windows that open to right
   side are off edge when small screen in effect.
   Examples are 'alternate' view and 'structure'.
   The geometry manager needs tweeking here.

3] Attach horizontal scroll bar funtions so wide
   text screens can be scrolled.  This occurs 
   when vieing preformated blocks or .txt files

4] The style instruction background needs to be
   fixed. For example:
   BODY { background: URL("ivy.gif") white }
   uses the background file only.
   BODY { background: white URL("ivy.gif") }
   also uses only the background file.
   To be consistant with netscape/explorer interpretation
   both file and color should be used.
   Or you could specify it as first valid one is
   used...  either way Amaya is busted here.

And hopefully more work is also being done on the 
help files to ease the new users into Amaya.
Documentation is detailed for advanced users but
is awkward for new people.
