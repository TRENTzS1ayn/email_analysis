nope -- if the gif is created as a transparent object
then it can be used as a watermark, parchment, or in
the case of ivy.gif as a border..... the color part
would then determine the working area ....
for example ivy.gif could be used with a light blue
background on some pages and a white background
on others ... i use color backdrops to determine 
area of website one is in ......
