I'm not sure that is fixed in the next release.

The preference dialogue allows you to change the size of all windows
by just opening them, resize them and call preference->geometry menu
to register current sizes.
For the position you must edit the file Amaya/amaya/HTML.conf

This is in the plan of the future release (at the end of the year).

That should be fixed.

I agree with you. Everybody is welcome to contribute in that effort.
