The Amaya 2.2 release is now available for both Unix and Windows platforms.

  Binaries (Solaris, AIX, Linux, Windows NT/95/98) are available at:
            http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/BinDist.html

  Source is available at:
            http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/SourceDist.html

  A FAQ is available at http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/FAQ.html

This release may not include all that you wished. There are many things we 
would like to do, fix and experiment but we're only three people.
Hint, hint volunteers are welcome :-)

We spent many efforts for adding new features like the synchronized Source 
view
that you can edit, the support of CSS in the Amaya printing, a mechanism of 
templates
and the possibility to customize the application with profiles.
Editing functions are improved and we have a long list of fixed bugs.
This release includes many changes due to the preparation of the Unicode and 
GTK
version.
