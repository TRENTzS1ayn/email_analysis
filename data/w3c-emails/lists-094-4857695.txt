I have a collection of HTML files, some of which can be combined into
larger files with the Amaya "make book" command.

Currently I'm delivering book files that Amaya users can create the
larger book files from. However, I have users who use other browsers,
and I'd like to give them the large files pre-built.

Complication: I have neither web nor X access to the machine that does
the distribution builds, just CVS and text-only SSH.

Is there a way to do the book-building as a batch process on the CVS
server? I can get Amaya installed there if need be.

I could build the books on my machine and check them into CVS pre-built,
but that means doing a book rebuild every time a component changes, then
uploading a large doc to CVS.
