Hi,

executing the pre-compiled binary extracted from amaya-RS6000-2.2.tar.gz
under AIX 4.1.4 I got the following errors (a similar error with version
2.0 was caused by use of X11R6 instead of - old - X11R5 that comes with
AIX 4.1.4):

  0509-023 Symbol XtStrin in sh is not defined.
  0509-023 Symbol XtShell in sh is not defined.
  0509-023 Symbol coreWid in sh is not defined.
  0509-023 Symbol XtCvtSt in sh is not defined.
  (... many similar unresolved symbol errors deleted)
  0509-023 Symbol XwcText in sh is not define
  0509-026 System error: Cannot run a file that does not have a valid form

If the use of X11R6 is done knowingly it should be mentioned somewhere in
the AIX binary distribution or in the announcement (I hope I haven't
overseen it). 

Thanks for Amaya

Jens
