Just tried the 2.2 Solaris Binary.

It seems to be working well, better than before.  I have not tested it
exhaustively.

It will be nice when horizontal scrolling works, but I understand that was
not an intention of this release.

The colours on the text pop-ups for the button-bar (the stop, back,
forward.... buttons) are still coming up as cream on yellow for me.  I can
see no way to override this.  Maybe one could configure these buttons to
come up as text buttons like the others, later in the development of
Amaya?

One more thing I would like, and that is that an installation procedure,
should follow the normal conventions for putting the binaries into the
standard place -- in Gnu-ish parlance ${PREFIX}/bin. (/usr/local is
suggested for PREFIX.) I don't know if this can be fixed by symlinks, or
whether relative paths built into the binary will not work with that.

Thank you,
Hugh
