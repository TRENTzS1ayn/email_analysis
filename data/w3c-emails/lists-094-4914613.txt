Hi,

Before the usual (and legitimate) rush of "this_is_buggy and miss_this_feature" start, as after every new relase, I just wanted to thank and congratulate the Amaya team.

My preliminary tests on Windows 98 with release 2.2 showed big improvements in many aspects. I keep the "does_not_work_so_good" for another day.

Cheers,

Serge Torres
