Jean Raymond,

I asked on the libwww list and I haven't got any definitive answer yet.
I removed the fclose SOCKSfclose  definition in the wwwsys.h file
and was able to build a working Amaya/socks version.

Alas, I don't have any SOCKS server to test it. I was able to browse
out, though.

My guess is that SOCKSfclose was defined in socks4 and then obsoletted in
socks5.

Hope this helps you,

-Jose
