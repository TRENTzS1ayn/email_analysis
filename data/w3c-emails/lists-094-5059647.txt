I was indeed using a proxy, even though I could have direct access too.

This is exactly what I did. In the Preferences/Proxy dialog box, I indicated
the name of the proxy server (proxy.unige.ch) and the local domain name for 
which the proxy shouldn't be used (.unige.ch). I also tried to indicate the
port on which the proxy was reachable (proxy.unige.ch:3128), but that didn't
work either. I should probably point out that I was trying to reach the 
HTTP server that runs on my own workstation (cuisung.unige.ch).

As soon as I erased the proxy information, the access to my server worked ok.

I am using plain manual proxy config. I just checked it and it works.
So, I think the problem is not with our proxy, but with my configuring
Amaya to use it.

Peace,

Bertrand.
