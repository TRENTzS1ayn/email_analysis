Yes, the proxy configuration mechanism is quite misleading. I'll try to
simplify it for the next version.

You have to declare your proxy as follows:

http://proxy.unige.ch:3128

My guess is that you forgot to add the "http://" string.

You can also avoid using a proxy to access your local server using the
Proxy Menu/No proxy.. entry, and setting it up as:

cuisung.unige.ch

No need to put http://  in this case.

Thanks for the report and followup :)
