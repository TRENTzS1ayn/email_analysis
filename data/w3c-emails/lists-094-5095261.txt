It seems that the resource leak problem has not been fixed, under
Windows 98 at least. After viewing HTML source my PCs resources dropped
to almost zero instantly. Closing the program, when able to, restored
the resources to 60-70% level.

Was this not noticed by anyone in a previous release or is it a bug that
was thought to have been fixed but hasn't?

Sorry, but as a serious piece of software Amaya 2.2 is, for me anyway,
useless and unusable.
