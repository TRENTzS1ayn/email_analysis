I just downloaded Amaya 2.2 for my Linux box at home.   And I did so
also for my Solaris 2.5 workstation at work, though so far I've only
tested that from home, i.e. with my Linux box being the X11 server.

My problem is that on both platforms I can't activate links.  I have
tried double-clicking both quickly and slowly, editor/browser mode and
browser-only mode, etc., but nothing seems to work.  I am trying it on
existing HTML files, whose links are well-tested.

I assume/hope there is some very trivial thing I've overlooked.  Any
suggestions would be much appreciated.
