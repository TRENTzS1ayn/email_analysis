Hi,

I have a document with some table cells containing vertical text, that is,
a sequence of characters with <br> in between each character. For some cells,
Amaya (2.2 for solaris 2.5) displays all the characters on top of each other,
while for other cells, the text appears correctly.

I tried the same document with Amaya 2.2 for Win98, and I get a slightly 
different effect, but not on the same cells: only the first character of the 
cell is displayed.

In both cases, the structure view is correct, i.e. it shows all the characters
with BR elements in between.

By the way, how do I produce a non-breakable space (&nbsp;) with amaya? I
checked the documentation, in particular on "creating elements", but couldn't
find anything about that.

Thanks,

Bertrand Ibrahim.
