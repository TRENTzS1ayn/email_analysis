Short answer:

You should be able to get it with Ctrl-Space already.

Long answer:

You need to execute the function TtcInsertChar("\240") to get an &nbsp;

The easiest way to do this in practice is put the following line into your
amaya.kb file:

Ctrl <Key>Sapce:   TtcInsertChar("\240")

(This line is in the default files in the CVS distribution - I don't remember
if it is in the release versions)

then restart amaya. Ctrl-Space will now make &nbsp;s

  Hi,
  
  I have a document with some table cells containing vertical text, that is,
  a sequence of characters with <br> in between each character. For some cells,
  Amaya (2.2 for solaris 2.5) displays all the characters on top of each other,
  while for other cells, the text appears correctly.
  
  I tried the same document with Amaya 2.2 for Win98, and I get a slightly 
  different effect, but not on the same cells: only the first character of the 
  cell is displayed.
  
  In both cases, the structure view is correct, i.e. it shows all the characters
  with BR elements in between.
  
  By the way, how do I produce a non-breakable space (&nbsp;) with amaya? I
  checked the documentation, in particular on "creating elements", but couldn't
  find anything about that.
  
  Thanks,
  
  Bertrand Ibrahim.
