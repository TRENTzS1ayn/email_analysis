Windows versions and Unix versions share the same code there. That could occur
when there is no explicit cast in a procedure call.
Could you send us a simple example that shows these bugs on Unix and Windows

To obtain a non-breakable space (&nbsp;) with Amaya you have to hit the Control
key with the Space key.
I add this information in the Help page Creating element.
