Hi,

it has already happened to me twice, but I am unable to figure out what
caused it. I have a document with a table and many <col class="..."> tags
(currently the <col> tags are at the beginning of the <tbody> section).
After making some modifications to the table, typically adding some rows
and saving the document, I end up with an HTML file where all the 
'<col class="...">' tags have been replaced with 'class="..."', that is,
the tags themselves have disappeared, but the class attributes have remained.

However, what Amaya displays doesn't give me any hint of what happened (I 
don't see the 'class="..."' strings displayed in the document view). It
is only when I check the document with a regular browser that I see all
this class="..." garbage just above the table. What I did until now was
to use a regular text editor to put the <col> tags back and then reload the
document in Amaya. Is there anything I can do, once I notice the phenomenon,
to help figure out what caused it?

It is just a guess, but I am assuming the problem could be caused by a bug
in the HTML code generator that produces HTML code from the syntactic tree
of the document, unless it is because the <col> tags are not correctly
represented in the syntactic tree. By the way, the structure view displays
something very strange around the <col> tags (see gif image in attachment).

This is with Amaya 2.2 for Solaris 2.5, and the document in which it happened
can be found at http://cuisung.unige.ch/garbage/991109.html

Peace,

Bertrand Ibrahim
