That is a small bug. We omitted to give a zero sized height to <col> elements 
in
the P schema.

HTML 3.2 tables are already complex to support, HTML 4. are twice more complex.
What is done in the current Amaya releases is the parsing and the editing of 
HTML 4 tables, but not all the rendering. As we have a limited manpower, we try
to manage the urgency. We can take time to work on HTML 4 tables but we didn't
receive requests for that until now.

According to the DTD declaration
<!ELEMENT TABLE - -
     (CAPTION?, (COL*|COLGROUP*), THEAD?, TFOOT?, TBODY+)>

<col> and <colgroup> tags cannot be children of <thead>, <tbody> or <tfoot>
and must appear before the <thead>, <tbody> or <tfoot>.
