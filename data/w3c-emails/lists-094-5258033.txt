Hello,

I'm looking at Amaya's compiled documentation (in printed form) - I compiled it 
with the Make book command. There seems to be a problem with the xrefs indexing 
on page numbers. For ex. on the very first page the "Make Book" looks like: 
"Make Book (page 1)" - which is wrong, as the linked entry is "Assembling large 
document collections", which in fact appears on page 23 in my printout.

The electronic version works OK, as does the printed TOC.

I'm using Amaya 2.2, on NT4 SP3 (Intel). 

Is this a known problem? Or am I missing something?

Congratulations for a very neat tool. 

Yan.

PS - I got some pretty strange results from the Search tool. (crash, wrong 
search results, ...)
