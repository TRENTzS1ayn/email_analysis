Hi,

I'am having a problem with Amaya on Windows 98. After some time of use, the other open applications can not display correctly anymore. At first, I thought it was problem with Nestcape Navigator, since I constantly use it in conjunction with Amaya. But it turns out that these trouble happen with every thing, even the explorer itself : changed fonts, mangled buttons in elevators, desappearing button in tool bars and finally the applications can not do simple op?rations as printing.

I think the problem comes from the way Amaya deals with graphic ressources. I'm not specialist in Windows programming, but I recall that you have to release very quickly any graphic ressources (contexts) you use as the memory allocated to them is rather scarce. My guess is that Amaya grabbs ressources it never releases. Another clue is that the probleme is less severe with NT. NT is know to be more robust in this area: it has not the same memory limitation. A last clue is given by the fact that everything comes in order again when I close Amaya: at this moment, it releases all the ressources it has grabbed.

I'm sorry I can not give more precision as to which particular actions cause the problem. I can only say that it takes time to happen when you simply type text. It happens faster when I play around with tables and <BR>. I hope this helps anyway.

Cheers,

Serge Torres
