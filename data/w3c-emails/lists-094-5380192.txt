Hi all,

I'm compiling a rather large document with the help of Amaya, using the Make 
Book feature.

Because of the number of documents and the general structure of the document, I 
was hoping to use a three level directory structure:

--dir 1 -
        |-file1a (subdocument file 1b)
        |-file1b (subdocument file 2a1, 2a2, etc...)
        |-...
        |
        +--dir 2a-
        |        |-file2a1 (subdocument 3a1, 3a2, ...)
        |        |-file2a2 (subdocument 3b1, 3b2, ...)
        |        |-..
        |        |
        |        +--dir 3a-
        |        |        |-file3a1
        |        |        |-file3a2
        |        |        |-...
        |        |
        |        +--dir 3b-
        |                 |-file3b1
        |                 |-file3b2
        |                 |-...
        |
        +--...

The problem apears in files at level 2 - which don't include files at level 3.
After "making book", the links in files at level 2 show a bogus path (href 
attribute), that looks like /dir2/dir2/dir3/file. I have had cases where it 
does: /dir2/dir2/dir2/dir2/file
Having now tried switching things around, I found linking files on two levels 
work, but as soon as you add a 3rd level, problem appears.

Is this a known bug? Can somebody else reproduce it?

Many thanks for reading so far!

Bye
Yan
