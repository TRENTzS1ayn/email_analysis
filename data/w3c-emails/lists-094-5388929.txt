Hi, 

More news on this. I'm still trying to get it to work, and I've tried a couple of things.

I was going to details what I've been through so far, but instead I'm now wondering if the 
Make Book command is supposed to work recursively?

 I seems that no matter what I try, I end up with some strange behaviour when I reach the 
2nd or 3rd level of recursion. What I do with directories just makes it worse, but even in 
a single directory, it's not working properly.

Can somebody shed some light in this?

Thanks 
Yan
