Some general questions:
- Any chance of a GPL version of Amaya? A good way to attract developers.
- Does anyone use Amaya as their browser? I tried some complex sites and
Amaya wasn't happy.
- I noticed there aren't too many keyboard shortcuts. Is Amaya meant to
follow User Agent and Authoring Tool guidelines?
Thanks,
Aaron
