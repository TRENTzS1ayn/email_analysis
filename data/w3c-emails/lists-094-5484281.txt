i don't know where to send a bug report, so i'll send it here.

SYSTEM:
PC pentium 166 with 24mo RAM - french keyboard
Red Hat Linux ver 5.2 (default kernel)
XFree86  with FVWM 1.2 as a window manager.

PROBLEM:
the horizontal scroll bar don't work. it's present but it always behaves
like the document is entirely  apparent: it fulls the hole space so i
can't scroll.
the vertical scroll bar works well.

this pb was present in Amaya ver. 2.1 . and it has not been corrected in
ver. 2.2. so i think it's inherent to my system configuration. so maybe
i can correct it by changing my config.
thank you.
