Hello!
I have a problem with my portuguese (103 keys) keyboard wich I am not
able to solve. If anyone can help me I would appreciate it very much.
My keyboard is standard in Portugal, with keys specific for my
language (cedilla, accute and grave, etc.), and is well configured both in
Linux console and in X-Windows. It works with dead-keys and the "signed"
characters, such as "?", are construted with " ' "(accute) followed by "e".
However in Amaya, with Multi-key support enabled, a most peculiar thing
happens:
- when I am editing the Address/Title section or any of the input
windows from the menu, everything works fine and as expected;
- when I am editing the main window  I cannot access two keys: one
with the grave and accute symbols and the other with the circumflex and tilde
symbols! The pressing of those keys is completely ignored by Amaya. (I can
circunvent the problem with accute letters by pressing apostrophe and then the
letter, but that does not work for graves, because I cannot find the grave key!)

I tried fiddling with configuration files (including X-Windows') and
with the Amaya source code (there are a couple of places, in the thotlib
directory, where I could, apparently, disable the key handling by the thotlib
and make the program use the XLib keyboard handling), but my efforts were not
successful.

My guess is that Amaya (sometimes) expects a standard US 101-key
keyboard. But I cannot convince it to expect a 103-key portuguese keyboard,
instead.
Any help would be appreciated.
Regards
Jose

PS: I was unable to find info about this specific issue in this list archives
of 1999.
