This is not valid HTML. If you look at the DTD, you will see that an H2 
element can only have an "inline" content, while the HR element is a
block element and can thus not be included where only inline content is
allowed. The appropriate portions of the HTML 4 DTD are:

<!ENTITY % heading "H1|H2|H3|H4|H5|H6">
<!ELEMENT (%heading;)  - - (%inline;)* -- heading -->

<!ENTITY % block
  "P | %heading; | %list; | %preformatted; | DL | DIV | NOSCRIPT |
  BLOCKQUOTE | FORM | HR | TABLE | FIELDSET | ADDRESS">

The first two lines say that headings H1 to H6 can only have inline content
and the rest says that HR (like some other elements) is a block element.

Note: I had asked this same question some time ago and it is Vincent Quint
who pointed out my mistake.

Peace,
