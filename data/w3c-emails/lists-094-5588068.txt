This might be a common known problem, and I'm also not sure this
is the
right list for it (I'm no subscriber)

Last week I found out that Amaya 2.2 under windows NT could not
connect
to any website anymore.
Today I found the reason: Windows NT service pack 6.
I upgraded to servicepack 6a and I am a happy Amaya user again.

Sorry if it's a faq.
