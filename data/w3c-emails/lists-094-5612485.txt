"cz" is not a valid language, so Amaya used Iso-Latin-1 charset and it
seemed OK for you.

With the 2.3 release you should display "cs" documents on Linux platforms
provided that you have fonts available to display Iso-Latin-2.
As Ramzi explained we're working on a real internationalized version of Amaya.
