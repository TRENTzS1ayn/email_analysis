This is a new problem. The temporary solution is to uninstall 2.2 before
installing 2.3. Otherwise some files from 2.2 are being used with 2.3
and this causes the problem.

See this Amaya as a one-day pre-release. We didn't make yet an
official announcement. Tomorrow we'll prepare a new one. I just fixed 
some problems that John Russel reported on cache and tmpdirs that have spaces.

I encourage you and other people who have downloaded it already, and are
willing to, to test it and report back to us. We'll try to fix any remaining
bugs tomorrow and do the official release.

Thanks and we apologize for the confusion this non-announced release could
make.
