Thanks, that did it!

Now that I've uninstalled 2.2 and installed 2.3 (on a different computer),
it displays pages that were originally created in Amaya well.

The only problems I've noticed so far have been a tendency to skip an entry
or two on the history list when using the back and forward buttons, a
recurrence of a "cannot make a connection to the server" message and
consequent failure to load a few long pages on one particular server
(possibly anomalous), poor rendering of the position of table elements on
pages that I'm quite sure aren't valid HTML anyway, and a dislike of long
urls like this one - but only when they occur in a link, not when typed into
the location bar (sorry about the wrap):


<html>
<body>
<a
href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/morphindex?&lookup=%29abde%2Flukt
a&display=Latin+transliteration&lang=Greek&corpus=2.0&formentry=1&embed=2">A
bdelukta</a> <br>
</body>
</html>

http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/morphindex?&lookup=%29abde%2Flukta&disp
lay=Latin+transliteration&lang=Greek&corpus=2.0&formentry=1&embed=2

If you do pull up that particular page or the Boston.com homepage (obvious
URL), you'll see what I mean. Is this a standardization issue: are these
lookup urls longer than a prescribed maximum in one of the W3C standards?

Finally, it does crash a little bit, but the crashes don't seem to be
reproducible, so they're probably not bug-related. Hope some of this is
helpful.  Again, this is Win98 with (in this case) a Pentium 2.

No problem.  I figured it was semi-official and that I'd missed the
announcement on the list. You've (plural) been alluding to it all week, so .
