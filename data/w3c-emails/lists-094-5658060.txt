The Amaya 2.4 release is now available for both Unix and Windows platforms.

  Binaries (Solaris, AIX, Linux, Windows NT/95/98) are available at:
            http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/BinDist.html

  Source is available at:
            http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/SourceDist.html

We spent many efforts for improving existing Amaya features and making the
application more robust. Editing and User Interface are improved and it's
now possible to scroll horizontally documents with large images or tables.

Thanks to Roberto Bagnara there is now an Italian version of Amaya (Unix
platforms only). In  addition to the English and French spell-checking
dictionaries, Dutch, German, Italian, Spanish, and Swedish dictionaries 
are now also available. We are not able to evaluate the quality of these
dictionaries, but we hope they can help.
Comments are welcome.

The page http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Autoconf.html describes how to 
build our first GTK prototype from the source distribution.

For more details please read the page

Thanks for those among you who tested the 2.3 pre-release.
     Irene
