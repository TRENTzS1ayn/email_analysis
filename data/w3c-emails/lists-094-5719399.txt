I saw the following structure in http://www.indigo.ie/egt/ :

<HTML>
<A NAME="Top">
<HEAD><!-- usual TITLE and HTTP-EQUIV=Content-Type --></HEAD>
<BODY>
<IMG SRC="header.gif"><BR>
<H1>Index</H1>
<IMG SRC="somebullet.gif"><A HREF="some.url">Label</A>
<!-- More stuff -->
</BODY>
</HTML>

(unless this was the result of some garbling by proxies along the way).
It's godawful HTML, but still it would be nice it Amaya could handle
this sort of thing as gracefully as possible.

What Amaya currently parses this into is somewhat surprising.
As far as I can make it from the structure view (which is garbled:
a bug), it's something like:

<BODY>
  <A NAME="Top">
    <IMG SRC="header.gif"><BR>
  </A>
  <H1><A NAME="Top">Index</A></H1>
  <A NAME="Top">
    <IMG SRC="somebullet.gif">
    <A NAME="Top" HREF="some.url">Label</A>
    <!-- More stuff until the next HR element -->
  </A>
  <!-- More stuff with plenty of A NAME="Top" -->
</BODY>

And in the formatted view there is a line break just after the "L" in "Label".
Yes, in the middle of a word: that's what alerted me to it all.

Can anyone reproduce this? (I haven't tried with a binary Amaya distribution.)
Fix the various bugs involved?
