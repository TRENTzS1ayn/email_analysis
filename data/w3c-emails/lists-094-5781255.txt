Hi,

Amaya detects that the anchor <A NAME="Top"> is misplaced. That's true,
but I agree the result is surprising. In fact Amaya tries to apply the 
same fix as it does for misplaced <font> elements.
What are you expecting: Amaya ignore the invalid anchor? Amaya creates an
empty anchor as the first element of the body? what else?

There is no rule to interpret invalid HTML. I guess the best is to have
a well formed document.
