I would love to be able to use FTP methods, and be able to write a document
to a mailto: address (even if it only handed it to a gateway program).

It seems (just thinking about it) that it would be fairly easy to use the
libwww FTP functions to implement FTP support. I am not sure about mailto,
and haven't thought about being able to actually read mail yet.
