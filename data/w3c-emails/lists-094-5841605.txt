Hi,

On Windows 9x, as noted Ctrl-Retrun does not produce a line break but,
oddly, Alt-Ctrl-Return does (at least on my AZERTY french keyboard) without
any modification to the amaya.kb file. But no joy for the non break space:
Ctrl space will not make it any more nor Alt-Ctrl space, tough it appear in
the amaya.bk too.

Anyone has a clue on how to type a nbsp until next release ?

Cheers,
