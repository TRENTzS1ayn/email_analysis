I agree that it is a more useful way to spend the very limited resources of
the Amaya team to deal with well-formed HTML than to work out how to provide
recovery for rubbish that looks like HTML.

  Right.  As you may have noticed, Amaya tries to fix *some* *common* HTML
  errors.  A common error is a character level element such as font that
  encloses several block elements such as paragraphs, headings, lists, etc.
  In that regard, anchors are currently handled in the same way as font
  elements, just because they belong to the same category: character
  level elements.  Obvioulsy, that's wrong and Amaya should make a special
  case for anchors.

  That'ss exactly what will be done for the next release.

  Don't blame Amaya for not recovering properly from an error.  Blame the
  producer of this garbled pseudo-HTML file first.  It's much easier to
  produce valid HTML by simply following the specification than trying to
  recover from a virtually infinite number of undocumented situations.
  
  Anyway, we have learned from that new case, and Amaya will now handle
  it properly, but I am sure someone else will report another strange
  HTML error soon, and we will have to cope with it.  That's an endless
  effort and we prefer to spend our limited resources to develop new
  features, rather than trying to fix all possible HTML errors.
  
  > 3) I know I ought to look this up in the spec, but is it legal for several anchors to be given the same NAME attribute value? Isn't NAME like ID, in that the values are meant to be unique across a document?
  
  No, it's not legal.  It will be fixed in the next release.
