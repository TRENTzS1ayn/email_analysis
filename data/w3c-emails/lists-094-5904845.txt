I found out why the primary colors ?rendered? ok
on MarkUp/Guide/style.html
they were cribbed by using image files instead of
using either the 'named' color or rgb code.
   haha jokes on me.
and even these dont work if viewed with net 3.0 
  green, teal, olive, and maroon look black .....
but i still wonder at amaya rendering 256 vs tru color.
