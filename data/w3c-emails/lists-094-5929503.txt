while trying to help with the tables problem 
found by our swedish associate .....
i noticed that  an html format file 
called links   is viewable while on line
but not off line where a file extension is
needed (at least in windows 95 version)
appending a .htm made it viewable
why is there an inconsistancy online/offline.

after clearing many html spec problems
the tables still appear overlaid --- suspect
'float' problem
