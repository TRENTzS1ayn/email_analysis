Is Amaya now capable of handling any XML document? Or is Amaya limited to
just the XHTML and MathML subsets? 

I need a browser, to run under Linux, with XML capabilities comparable to
those of MS Internet Explorer. The added ability to edit would be wonderful.

If full XML support is not yet present in Amaya, is  it planned for the near
future? If not, is a comparable editor/browser available from w3c (or
anywhere) for XML?
