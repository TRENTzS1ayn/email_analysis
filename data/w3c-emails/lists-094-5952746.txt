Hi,

I did not notice the change in encoding until Vincent Quint pointed it out.
But does it mean we should add a charset attribute in the meta that holds
the http-equiv, as adviced by HTML 4 RFC (5.2.2 : "... Therefore, user
agents must not assume any default value for the "charset" parameter
...").? Amaya does not do it automatically, at least, on "old" (pre
encoding switch) documents.

Cheers,
