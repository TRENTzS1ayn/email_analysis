Hello,

I installed the german dictonary - it didn't work.
After trying several things, I found out, that it doesn't see the
lang-attribute in the html tag. When I moved it to the body tag it
worked. - The language it checks for should be displayed.

When I use the cursor-keys to move through the document, Amaya often
hangs for a while, espescially when moving across big pictures - these keys 
shouldn't be buffered. (I have a slow machine!)

The usage of pseudocolor-displays is terrible. 
(Did I write usage? I meant missusage.)

Amaya hangs on http://www.bol.de/.

CU
Andreas
