I've recently upgraded to Amaya version 2.4 for Linux. It hasn't crashed
yet, like the previous version. Thanks!
However,the images i insert in a web page show up as vertical lines. When i
save the
page and open it in another browser the image shows fine. I had the same
problem withthe previous version also.
Can anyone make a suggestion as to why this occurs?

thanks,
