Hi,

Hope this gets through (I'm exprimenting in Gnus).

Anyone else experiencing problems entering characters into a 
document when num lock is on?

Try this: Start a new doc. Enter some text. Make sure that NUM LOCK 
is OFF. Select the text and click the link button. Enter some random
text. No problems.

Now.

Do the same with NUM LOCK ON.
I, at least, get rubbish characters.
Extremely irritating.

M.
