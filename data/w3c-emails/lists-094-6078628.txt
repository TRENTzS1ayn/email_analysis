Hi,

I'm currently trying to build Amaya source version 2.4 using Windows 98 SE
with Visual C++ 5.0.  Using the workspace file (Compilers.dsw), and building
the executable, I first get the error that in Compilers.rc resource.h cannot
be found.  I redirected the file to the correct location of resource.h and
upon rebuilding, the next error in the file is :

Compilers.rc (66): error RC2104 : undefined keyword or key name: COMP_OPEN

and it breaks there.  I'm not sure if it would break for the next thing
COMP_COMPILE but I don't see that defined anywhere either.

Is there a fix to this?

Thanks,
David
