When I open an HTML document, Amaya removes
all all instances of small letter thorn.

This letter has the Unicode value of U+00FE.

I can use the small thorn within Amaya and the documents are
saved correctly but when I open them again all the small thorns
have been removed.

Can somebody help me out?
