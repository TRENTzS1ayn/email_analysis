  after wrestling with your sources for a few hours, i finally managed
to make it compile.  all through the compilation i was expecting the
thing to segfault in the end, and of course it did, thanks for wasting
my time

  and lastly, i should kick myself for even giving you a chance, given
that i saw the words "style sheets" and HTML 4.0 and
X-fill-in-your-favorite-information-overload-architechture

  you know why nobody in their right mind uses style sheets or
CVS or automake?  well, because all these things are designed to
make life more complicated, and frankly there are still a few of
us left that prefer to make life easier for ourselves, after all,
that's what these machines were supposed to do in the first place,
they're not there to create work for its own sake, or to give
snobs computer jargon with witch they can discriminate others.

  i don't know why i'm writing this to you, perhaps in retaliation
for wasting my time.  i'm sure you'll read over this, understand it,
and promply block it out of your mind, because you're too far along
in your psychosis to turn back now, but what the hell, i gave it
a try.
