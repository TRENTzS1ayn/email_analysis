If you'd rather have your web pages look like they were printed out on a
teletype out of some misbegotten nostalgia, by all means, don't use CSS or
HTML 4.  Get out your Rainbow and hack a CP/M port of Lynx together, there
should still be some 300 Baud modems out there at yard sales.*

NOBODY in their right mind uses CSS or CVS or automake? How 20th century.
Rather, NOBODY in their right mind as their first response to encountering a
problem with a program launches a tirade at the developers; those in their
right mind describe the problem to the developers and hope they (collective;
referent: user and developers) can together isolate it and fix it.

*The point being that if everyone had stuck with Rainbows and Apple IIs
there would be no web.  Nothing against Lynx, a very handy program; and you
certainly couldn't get Mosaic to work on a Rainbow
