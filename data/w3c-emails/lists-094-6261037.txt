Uh, you might have avoided this by downloading the binary version.
 
If you think stylesheets are designed to make life more 
complicated, you only demonstrate that you have no idea what 
stylesheets are.
 
I suggest you hang around w3.org and you might learn something 
about stylesheets and similar information overload technologies.
 
Thanks -
