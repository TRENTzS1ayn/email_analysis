Hi,

I just posted a message some time ago about a weird behaviour of Linux
versions of Amaya:
no dialog box would accept vowels (!?!), while other letters were OK. 
I thought it was somehow related to the versions of Linux: wrong !

In fact, I had another problem, that I posted about too: Amaya would not
honor the the Alt Gr
key on my French keyboard. I could not have, among other things, the
circumflex accent and I missed it badly. As a work around I added the
following lines to my amaya.keyboard:
Ctrl <Key>g , <Key>a: TtcInsertChar("\342")
Ctrl <Key>g , <Key>e: TtcInsertChar("\352")
... for all the vowels !

where 342 is the octal code of a circumflex, 352 is the octal code of e
circumflex, etc...
I picked up Ctrl <Key>g because it just seemed to be available.

This worked fine for typing accented characters but then I lost the ability
type vowels in dialog boxes. I did not immediately make the connection
between the two facts, it happened by accident.

I have, at least, been able to reproduce this "behaviour" with the latest
(3.0) version of Amaya on my office's Mandrake 6.1 box and I'll try it at
home tonight on other versions of Linux.

I'm looking for another solution for my circumflexed vowels (and other gone
and cherished characters as ~{[|\]}@). In fact having Alt Gr back in
business is my secret wish ;-). If I find a work around that does not
cripple another part of the application, I'll let you know.

Cheers
