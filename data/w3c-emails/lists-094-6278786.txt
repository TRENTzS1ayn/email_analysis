Hi,

I just downloaded the latest version of amaya, 3.0, and I run 
into some problems when I try to compile it.  The machine is a DEC
Alpha running OSF4.0.  

After I unpack it on my home directory, I create a dec directory 
under Amaya.  And from there, I run the command "../configure."  It 
prints out a bunch of "checking" stuff and it seems to be alright because 
the last line tells me to go ahead and run "make all..."  And when I do 
that, I get this error message:

Make: Cannot open .depends.  Stop.
*** Exit 1
Stop.
*** Exit 1
Stop.                                                           

It looks like there is no ".depend" anywhere and when I try to run
"make depend," it does't work either!  Do you know what has happened here?
(And if you need, I can send you the output of "../configure.")

Thanks.
