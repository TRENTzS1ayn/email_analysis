Okay, now we've countered extremity with extremity.  Let's try for a
little perspective, shall we?

While I don't encounter much of a problem with HTML4, I don't use CSS
much currently, because of the problems I've encountered with
cross-platform compatibility and accessibility concerns.  Until differing
browsers handle CSS similarly, I tend to avoid it.  If you don't, good on
you.  My coding needs and user base may be very different from yours.

As to Lynx and 300 bps modems:  While 300bps is overkill (underkill?),
it's easy to forget that Lynx is still widely used (I use it frequently on
my Linux box, when I want quick information and don't care about
graphics), and given the increase in 'web-enabled' cellphones, PDAs, &c.,
non-graphical compatibility (including 'graceful degridation')is an issue
that should be taken more seriously by web developers.

I work frequently with users who are blind and visually impaired.  Many,
many pages that they run into either crash or confuse their text-to-speech
programs / dynamic braille displays so badly that they're unreadable.
OTOH, Lynx-compatible pages are generally far less of a problem for them.

(Yes, O'Rourke, I know you didn't mean to slam Lynx.)

This issue is increasingly important as more and more blind and visually
impaired users are discovering the internet (especially the WWW and 
e-commerce) as ways to increase their independence.  The W3C has released
accessibility recommendations which address both 'web-enabled'
non-graphical compatibility and accessibility for the blind / visually
impaired, but I don't see their recommendations being adopted much.

Oh, and there'd still be a WWW if everyone were still running on Apple
II's and Rainbows.  It simply wouldn't be graphical.  While it might not
be as popular, it certainly would still exist.  It was a good method for
presenting information even before the "Here's a photo of me so you can
see what I look like in RL" craze that lead to the graphical explosion
Mosaic ushered in.

Er...  Last I looked, even in the IT industry slamming products and / or
attitudes because they were just over three months old was a bit
premature.

Now _that_ is a sentiment I can (mostly) agree with.  While I understand
why compiling the source rather than the binaries would be preferrable,
and can certainly sympathize with the frustration involved in a downloaded
source that simply will *not* compile when one had expected it'd be an
easy job, posting tirades like the message starting this thread is not
only unadvisable and incindiary, but foolish as well.

Of course, it could've been a troll.... <g.>

(See above.)

[Original tirade snipped. Bandwidth may no longer be at a premium, but
once was more than enough.]
