I'm getting artifacts on pages with gif images, usually some kind of noise
(bars).  They are transitory, in that they disappear and reappear elsewhere
when I scroll down - they tend to appear over whitespace.  Haven't tried to
reproduce or break down yet.

Pages with a META REFRESH tag seem not to be working; is it possible this is
a bug, or is there something I don't know about support for them?
