Just to add to this posting, it also causes amaya to stop responding
when I view the file online. Also Amaya still appears to have major
problems with complex table like that one, virtually all the other pages
at my sight have work great, but they use simpler tables.

As a side note I plan to redesign that page in the near future, but you
might still want to look into that problem and the rendering of complex
tables for the people making pages with weird table layouts.

Keep up the great work all.
