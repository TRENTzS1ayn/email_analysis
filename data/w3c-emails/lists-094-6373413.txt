Michael is not quite as far along as "Dix" but echoes the sentiment !
I learn lots from these exchanges - now I want to know where to find
"bradbury's  topstyle editor ..."
I, too, am trying to write pages for an audience with a wide variety of 
browsers - and like very much the idea of being able to use AMAYA
as a major tool to also keep the pages accessible for the visually 
impaired.   And maybe one of these days WE will be able to contribute 
s.t. that others will be able to learn from ( including our mistakes !)

Thanks, Irene & all - this is a great list !
