Hugh, this document contains lots of MATHML.
Amaya supports the subset of MATHML this
document contains. Look at the errors. You
will find they are all MATHML. This document
was generated by TtM which produces good
HTML. The only errors will be MATHML which
the W3C validator does not know about.
Regards, Jim FitzSimons
