My mistake: when I saw there were so many I didn't look any further to see
what they were. Still, it seemed rather large.  I would suggest that, if
possible, a smaller document be derived from it to replicate the error.  
The Amaya team is very small, and I'm sure they would welcome a small test
case.

Anyway, I apologise for shooting from the hip.  Many times
people have used invalid docs as justification for some feature
to be added, so sorry for tarring you with that particular brush.
