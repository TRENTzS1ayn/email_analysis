On attempting to install the Amaya 3.0 on Sun Sparc Solaris 2.5.1, which I
reported on earlier today I got:

gmake[2]: Nothing to be done for `all'.
gmake[2]: Leaving directory
`/home/hgs/Amaya/Amaya/Sun-Sparc-Solaris-2.5.1/libjpeg'
../install-sh -c -m 755 ../bin/amaya /usr/local/Amaya/applis/bin
gmake[1]: ../install-sh: Command not found
gmake[1]: *** [install] Error 127
gmake[1]: Leaving directory
`/home/hgs/Amaya/Amaya/Sun-Sparc-Solaris-2.5.1/amaya'

this was broken before, IIRC. This seems to stem from Options
which has 

INSTALL = ../install-sh -c

as does Options.orig, but all the other variables in that section have
absolute paths (except ln, ranlib, and gcc, which have no path specified).  
I cannot understand the "magic" in configure that handles paths with .. in
them, so I cannot fix this for you. All the options seem to be derived in
the same way looking at Options.in:

MV      = @MV@
RM      = @RM@ -f
LN_S    = @LN_S@
MKDIR   = @MKDIR@
ECHO    = @ECHO@
AR      = @AR@ rc
RANLIB  = @RANLIB@
DIFF    = @DIFF@
INSTALL = @INSTALL@

so I really don't know what is going on here.

But at least I know to change the path in Options to an absolute path
in my build directory.
