Having *installed* amaya I can now see this.

You may wish to know that when I click on a character in the main view,
the structure view scrolls to a position such that the cursor is just
visible in it, but the text on which the cursor lies is mostly off the
display.  The cursor is at the bottom or the top of the display when this
occurs.  I suggest that it should be (roughly) centered if possible.
The horizontal scrolling on the structure view is about right in regard to 
this.

If you try to replicate this behaviour, you will need to remember that
I use large print.

Thank you,
