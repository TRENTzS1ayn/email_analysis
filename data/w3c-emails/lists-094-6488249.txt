When I am using Amaya as a browser, there are a few things I would find
helpful. I have not delved into the code, so don't know how difficult 
they would be.

The mouse pointer could change when over a link.
    this would give some visible indication for those documents whose
    stylesheets declare the colour of links to be the foreground colour.

The tag window could display the url of a link when the mouse is on it.
    This behaviour would be similar to Netscape.  It would allow someone
    browsing to see where a link went without having to click on it. This
    need not break the display of tag information when an item is clicked.

Go back more than one doc.
    It would be nice if there were a menu associated with the go back or
    forward buttons.  This too is a Netscapism.

Accesskey (if supported)
    I have defined some accesskey tags for some of the links on my home
    page but cannot see how to make use of them.  Thee seems to be no
    visible information saying they exist.  I can see them in the
    structure view.

Overriding of style sheets/colours
    It would be nice to be able to override things that another site has
    set, so I can change the colours etc.  The Style menu is disabled
    when not editing.


I realise this is a large body of work, so I appreciate that with a small
team it is difficult to meet everyone's expectations, never mind their
wishes!  So I hope these suggestions will be taken in the constructive
way they are intended.

Thank you,
