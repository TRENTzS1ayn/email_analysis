[DJW:]  My understanding is that Amaya is primarily
an editor, not a browser; as such I don't think it
should make it too easy to mis-design pages in this
way.  If the design is really that bad that you can't
guess the links, the authors deserve not to get your
business, but you can still find the links in the
structure view.  (Voting with ones feet has become
rather topical in UK politics!)

[DJW:]  I don't know whether there is already support
for this, but I believe it is a presumption of CSS
that the browser should, conceptually, have a user
style sheet associated with it, and that !important
rules can be used to override the document style
sheet.  I say conceptually, as the style sheet might
only be accessible by menus, not by loading a CSS
document.
