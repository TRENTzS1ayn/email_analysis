Agreed, but I don't think this would break anything.

Also agreed: this should be dicouraged in pages Amaya creates,
but sometimes people browse other's pages with it.  This feature
would also be useful on images which are links, of course.

Shame to miss out on an otherwise excellent site though. Netscape
used my colour settings so I didn't have thit problem till using Amaya
as a browser for the site.  It picked up the style sheet from there, I 
suppose, which "broke" this for me.

I could not find it, but have not explored CSS really, yet.

Not sure if rules will cover my cases: Eg intelligent selection of
contrasting colours is non-trivial when one has to juggle unvisited links,
visited links, background colour, foreground text colour and (possibly
partially transparent) images, and get them all to "agree".
