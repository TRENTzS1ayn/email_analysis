Sorry, Jim, this document contains HTML errors.
I just checked the very beginning of

    http://www.neta.com/~cherry/mathml/reporth.html

and the W3C validator (http://validator.w3.org/)
reported 13 errors in the first 63 lines (see below).

There are also some MathML errors.  I was not able to
check everything, but the expression starting line 3704,
for instance, is wrong:

   <center><math><mrow>
   <mtable align="left"><mtr><mtd columnalign="left">
   <mtr><mtd columnalign="right" columnspan="3">

The <mtr> tag starting the line above is not allowed in
this context. It is allowed only as a child of a <mtable>,
not as a child of a <mtd>.

All 

I would not say that TtM produces good HTML (or good MathML).

Vincent.
