Got a general protection fault (GPF) on Amaya Startup on Win 98.  I saw no 
Amaya screen at all... just got an immeediate GPF.  This was my first 
attempt to run Amaya after installing it.  There was no previous Amaya on 
the system.  More details below.

Windows being what it is, the crash also messed up at least one other 
program... Eudora hung on startup after this GPF, but fortunately a reboot 
solved it.

Good luck on the fix.  I'm really looking forward to trying this.  Please 
email me direct with any questions since I'm not on the amaya list yet.
