I have just downloaded (by FTP) the amaya-RS6000-3.0.tgz file and
performed the uncompress (using gunzip utility) and tar (with xvf
attributes)
and the expected directories and files were created. However, when I go to 
.../Amaya/RS6000/bin/ to execute amaya, I get a series of error messages.

This list or error messages start with:
"Cannot load program ./amaya because of the following errors:"
Symbol X._._._._ in amaya is not defined
...
The list ends with:
"System error: Cannot run a file that does not have a valid form."

Needless to say, I am unable to run amaya at all. The operating system is
AIX 4.3.2. Does anyone have information that would help me correct this
problem?
