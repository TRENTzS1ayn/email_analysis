Hi,

I downloaded the source to amaya 3.0 and I wonder why
you have libjpeg libpng and zlib in there.
I think people should get these sepreately, like in rpms.
Then they can save space by linking dynamically, not statically.

I tried dynamic linking on my system and it seems to work fine.
It reduced the executable by 180k from 2800k

Thanks.
