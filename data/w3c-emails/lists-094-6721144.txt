It's mainly due to versions compatibility: there is a serious risk with
shared libraries.
Another reason is the fact that we wanted to deliver only one source tar file.
Of course these libraries are already available on some platforms, lie yours,
but it's not always the case.
We can process differently in the future, but we need to adapt the Makefile.in
so it compiles and uses the local libraries when they are installed within the
local directories Amaya/libjpeg and Amaya/libpng. I've no time to work on that
for the moment. As soon as someone gives the patch we will change the 
distribution.
