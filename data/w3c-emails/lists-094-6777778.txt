I believe this was discussed some time ago but is still not fixed in 3.0.

In my page http://www.adelaide.net.au/~sims/jafa/index.html I have the line

<img
src="http://www.adelaide.net.au/cgi-bin/Count23.cgi?df=sims.dat&amp;dd=B&amp
;cache=F&amp;expires=43200&amp;frgb=0bffff"

but after editing with Amaya it becomes

<img
src="http://www.adelaide.net.au/cgi-bin/Count23.cgi?df=sims.dat&dd=B&cache=F
&expires=43200&frgb=0bffff"

I need the &amp; to remain intact to pass the validator test at
http://validator.w3.org/ so that the URI conforms to section 5.3.2 of the
HTML 4.0 recommendation:

"Authors should use "&amp;" (ASCII decimal 38) instead of "&" to avoid
confusion with the beginning of a character reference (entity reference open
delimiter). Authors should also use "&amp;" in attribute values since
character references are allowed within CDATA attribute values."
