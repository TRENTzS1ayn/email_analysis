If a form consists of only a submit button,
Amaya 3.1 doesn't send the form. Instead it responsds
with something like this:

Cannot load:
http://localhost:8080/cgi-bin/foodlist.tcl

To make the form useable for Amaya, one has to put
at least one more item in the form. A hidden field
will do. 

This is a separate bug from the "HTTP Redirect"
problem.
