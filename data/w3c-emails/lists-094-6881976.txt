No it should not.  Status 301 and 302 redirects 
are supposed to be issued with the same method as
the original request.  Broken behaviour in some
browsers resulted in a lot or content authors who
didn't read the specs using 302 to redirect to 
a confirmation page.  As such redirects to GET were
clearly needed, status 303 was added to cover them,
in an early draft of HTTP 1.1 (if you just return
Location:, but no Status: in a CGI script, you get
a 302 redirect, or an internal redirect).

Because of the existence of broken browsers, status
307 redirects were added in later drafts of HTTP 1.1.
This means the same as 302, for conforming browsers, but
makes it clear that you don't want the browser to 
assume that you were expecting broken 302 behaviour.

If your application requires reliable redirect from POST
to GET, it must return a 303 status.  Because of
the misimplementations, using 302 for a POST is unsafe,
although you should use it for GET.
