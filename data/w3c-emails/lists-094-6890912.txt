Oops. I was wrong then. Perhaps Yahoo! Mail was
designed to work with Netscape's misinterpretation
of the standard. 

Couldn't Amaya have an option that the user could
set to emulate this misbehavior? 

It might be named something like this:
"Emulate broken redirects."

Although the behavior is wrong, it would give users
a chance to visit broken websites.
