Dear Amaya developers,

I just installed 3.1 on my Linux (slackware-7) box with Brazilian
keyboard. I'm glad to know that compose methods improved a lot but
the deadkeys, i.e., accents that work without the compose key, still
don't work on Amaya 3.1. Amaya seems to ignore them completely,
regardless of the special>preferences>general>enable multi-key
selection.

compose key works fine, as well as multi-key, *with wrong keys!*.

Os Brazilian/Portuguese keyboard we have different keys for apostrophe
(') and acute accent. the latter is a deadkey. hitting apostrophe+a
results '?', but dead-acute+a results 'a' without accent. The normal
behaviour (e.g. in vi editor) is apostrophe+a -> "'a" (two characters)
and dead-acute+a -> '?' (a single accented letter).

By the way, the deadkeys work fine in dialogue boxes.

D.Nunes, from Brazil, still editing with vi, marking and pasting on
Amaya...
