The use of Alt-Gr depends on the current installation. Some Linux distributions
use that key for generating some frequently used letters with diacritics like
? in French (see a French keaboard).

I personally have a QWERTY (uk) keyboard and I use the Atl-Gr as a mutli key.
I have a configuration file in my HOME directory .Xmodmap that contains:
keycode 22 = BackSpace
keycode 187 = Delete
keycode 113 = Multi_key
