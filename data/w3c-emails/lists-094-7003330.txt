Dear Sir,
I have downloaded the Amaya source code
on a PC (Win 95), but when I try to gunzip and
untar the file (gzip, and tar commands
available for DOS), all my file names are
truncated ( A DOS limitation as it can
not deal with file names longer than
8 characters).
Is it possible for you to zip the entire 2
directories (Amaya, and libwww) into a
single zip file? I highly recommend
using Norton utilities to perform the
task. The size of the zip file is very
comparable against the tar+gzip file.

Regards,
T. Khajepoor
