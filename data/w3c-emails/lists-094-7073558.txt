For me it's difficult to check that problem because I don't have that
configuration and I ignore what Amaya receives when you hit the dead-key.

If the dead-key works normally, I suggest you to disable the multi-key in 
special>preferences>general then to check what is received:
either by xev or by debugging the Amaya code
The concerned function is TtaHandleMultiKeyEvent

Let me know the result of your investigations.
