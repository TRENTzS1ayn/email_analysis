Hi,
Accordingly, the Thot Tool Kit API has been written for Unix. Despite this
fact, the Amaya team has used the tool kit to develope Amaya which also
works on Windows platform. What would it take, and what modifications are
necessary to transfer the tool kit into a set of API which also works under
Windows ?(how did the Amaya team did it?)

Best Regards,
T. Khajepoord
