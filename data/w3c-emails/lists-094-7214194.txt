Dear Sir,

Very thank you to read this mail!
We had a question on Amaya . Because we want to find a browser ,
that can work on embedded-linux playform. 
So we find Amaya , and because it is open source code . But we don't
know how to make clear the code and how
to cut the module for only have browser function , not include edit
HTML function. So please help us to find some
solution . Thanks!

Regards,

Steven.Shiou
