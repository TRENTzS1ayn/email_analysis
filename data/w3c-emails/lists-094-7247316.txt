I'd suggest that if you don't have the tools needed to
compile Gnu tar for win32, you are far short of what
you need to compile Amaya.

Note that NT comes with a tool, pax, that should be able
to handle tar files, although Win 95 may not.

The Cygwin environment definitely includes tar and gzip
utilities for win32.

[DJW:]  zip files are generally bigger than tar.gz because,
although they both use the same compression algorithm, 
.zip resets the compressor for every component of the
archive, but with .tar.gz, the compression dictionary can
be carried over from component to component; this is 
particularly beneficial for short source files written in
a similar style.  Of course, if size really matters, you
should use .tar.bz2.
