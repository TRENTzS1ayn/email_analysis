You know that Amaya is mainly an editor and it doesn't provide some browser 
functions
like the support of Frames, Scripts, and the Mail.
Nevertheless if you want to cut editing functions in Amaya, you have:

1) to edit the file Amaya/amaya/EDITOR.A for removing menus New, Edit_, 
StructTypes,
Types, Links, Style, Attributes_, Annotations_

2) change the makefile for removing all editing modules *edit.c, EDIT*.c,
UIcss.c, HTMLpresentation.c, and probably EDITORactions.c

3) perhaps you will have to move some functions from one module to another.
