Hello,

I just installed the binary distribution for Amaya 3.1. I have two 
issues so far:

1) All colors seem halftoned or dithered, even though I have 256 
colors.

2) A <H2> element if followed by untagged text, e.g.
<h2>SAP</h2>Ablabla
renderes the first letter of the text (the "A") at the right end of 
the same line as "SAP" if the window is wide enough. "wide enough" is 
significantly wider than "SAP". However, making the window even wider 
does not cause more letters to be displayed in the first line.

Regards,
Ulrich Windl
