Hi all. Forgive my first post to the list being a negative one, but isn't Amaya 
an experimental editor first and a very basic browser second? At least that's the 
way I read the notes on the Amaya pages. My first impressions of Amaya is that it 
is a good tool for playing with HTML that will only improve with feedback.
Cheers,
Brad
