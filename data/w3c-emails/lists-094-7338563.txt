...but, this raises another question:  should the validator just throw errors,
or should there be a "proposed/concept" option, or second validator which takes
rule-bending into account and helps evaluate future possibilities...?  I'd be
the last to propose a M$-like "embrace and extend" attitude; but standards don't
always stop when agreed upon.  Many evolve to new levels...  to wit: HTML
*4.0*...  But; by all means, flag M$ extensions as strict violations...  :^)
