I got 86 errors when I ran the Inforworld page through Tidy.

It has sometimes seemed to me that an ideal browser/editor would have a
"tidying" feature that would re-render loaded invalid pages according to a
best approximation of a valid page (with an alert in the status bar),
flagging errors in an optional extra window or file, and allowing the reader
to view the source of the existing page or of the resulting tidied page.
But I expect that this is something the Amaya team doesn't have the time /
personnel resources for (I guess it would have to run the loaded page
through Tidy or some analog first and then parse it into a tree for Amaya to
display and edit; my programming skills are definitely sub-par so I haven't
looked at the source code), so I haven't mentioned it.
