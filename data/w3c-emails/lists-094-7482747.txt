Thanks. No I don't have a french keyboard (live in the US and work almost 
exclusively in english). Will test and will let you know how it goes.

irene said that the tab bug is fixed in the cvs tree. 
you probably have a french keyboard like me. but i don't have problems
with the mouse and the return key (to be accurate, the return key
still behaves strangely sometimes) . i think you have to precise the exact
configuration you have.
