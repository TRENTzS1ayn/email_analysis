Well, if the Amaya team intended Amaya to be a full-feature browser, this
would make sense.  At this time, though, they seem to be focusing on the
editing features, so that Amaya is very useful for browsing Amaya pages, but
less so for browsing non-Amaya pages (almost all of which violate some part
of the spec).  But it does serve another, higher purpose: spreading the word
about the idea of the editor/browser, which I wish the Mozilla and IE folks
would heed.
