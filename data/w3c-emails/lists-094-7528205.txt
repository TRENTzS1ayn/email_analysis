The idea of an editor browser is a very powerful one indeed. When full 
implemented, it could hopefully enable to regain independance from bloated 
desktop applications such as word and wordperfect. This could happen very 
rapidly the Amaya folks could announce loud and clear that the browser can do 
other things such as presentation and spreed sheet. Then the psychological 
barriers that tie people to the desktop will pretty much vanish, for in 
reality, the majority of users need only an editor but always look for things 
that they will never use and don't know how to use them. 

I found browsing with Amaya a bit confusing in the sense that every familiar 
click -in the IE/Netscape world- I made almost ended being interpreted as an 
edit command. I must admit that I have not invested enough time though to know 
the ins and out of Amaya to avoid those pitfalls.

Well, if the Amaya team intended Amaya to be a full-feature browser, this
would make sense.  At this time, though, they seem to be focusing on the
editing features, so that Amaya is very useful for browsing Amaya pages, but
less so for browsing non-Amaya pages (almost all of which violate some part
of the spec).  But it does serve another, higher purpose: spreading the word
about the idea of the editor/browser, which I wish the Mozilla and IE folks
would heed.
