The problem here is not with install-sh itself, but rather, it's due
to the fact that `../install-sh' is an incorrect path to this script
at the time it's being invoked.

Therefore, if `install-sh' was replaced with `shtool' and if nothing
else was changed in the build process, an identical error would occur
if the build were trying to invoke `../shtool install'.

In the above case, was the configure script run as `../configure' from
within the `Sun-Sparc-Solaris-2.5.1' directory?  And then, was `gmake'
run from within that same directory?  I used to get similar errors
until I did this.
