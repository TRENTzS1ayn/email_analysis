A solution for you is to give an absolute path for install-sh
by this way:

rm Options config.cache # get rid of old stuff 
INSTALL=~hgs/Amaya/Amaya/install-sh ../configure options...

A solution for amaya developers may be to set an absolute path in 
configure.in:

AC_PROG_INSTALL
prog="${INSTALL##*/}" # prog=$(basename $INSTALL)
dir="${INSTALL%/*}" # dir=$(dirname $INSTALL)
cd "$dir"
INSTALL="$( pwd )""/$prog"
cd -
AC_MSG_RESULT([install is now $INSTALL])

maybe this should be mentioned to autoconf people.
