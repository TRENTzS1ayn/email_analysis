The problem there is that the zlib.a, zlib.h, and zconf.h are not found where
the libwww configure expects them to be (/usr/local/lib/libz.a or
/usr/lib/libz.a, and the same for the include/zlib.h).

We don't have right now any mechanism allowing to pass an extra include
dir to the libwww configure. What you can do is to go the libwww/Library/src
directory and make a symlink to zlib.h and zconf.h. You can find those
files in the Amaya/libpng/zlib directory.

It should compile then.

Of course, now the question is... why don't we arrange our configure to use
those files systematically? or should we try to continue using those found
in the system?
