Hello Hugh,

Sorry for the slow replies. We're quite busy preparing some demos for next 
week at WWW9, in Amsterdam.

Your install-sh proposition should be already in CVS.

You're right. We're already using our own configure in order to be able
to compile only a part of libwww. The libz problem is a quite new one. So
far we had only compiled Amaya in boxes which had libz in /usr/local or
in /usr/lib, and the configure scripts take this into account.

I don't have time to try your suggestions right now, but I'll definitely
work on this problem when I come back from WWW9. 

If you have time to help us with this problem in the meantime, we'd appreciate
it and add your patches to the base.

No, the CFLAGS in libwww/Library/src are hardcoded. They
don't take into account what's being passed thru the environment (unless
I'm wrong).

Make a symlink between the libpng/zlib/{the above files} and libwww/Library/src.
The latter is the directory where there is the source.

Thanks for your feedback and patience!
