Congratulation for your amaya editor 3.1 for win98. I think I will use it very often. Please let me tell simple suggestions :

- It would be great if size/position of All windows were saved, including state "open or closed"
- It would be great if font of all windows except browser/editor were saved
- I would really appreciate if amaya would not definitively block when a remote page cannot be opened (I have a telephone internet link and I am not always connected)
- the images do not display correctly on my machine (IBM300GL 65000 colors screen configuration, see 2 gifs joined : im1 is the netscape display, im2 is the amaya display)

Thanks for your work
