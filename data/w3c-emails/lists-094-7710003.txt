The best way to check that is to see the source view.
If some content is within the source view but is not displayed in the
formatted view, it could be either a Amaya bug or an error in the
document structure.
I met this kind of trouble when I dowloaded document with invalid
height constraints.
Could you check also that there no height attribute or a CSS constraint on
the element.

I probably need to check that on a Win2K machine and adapt the code.
