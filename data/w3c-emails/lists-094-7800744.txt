<humor> Then don't put a space character in the filename.</humor>

Seriously, web page names shouldn't have spaces in them.  If a page is on an
NT box, you can usually get to it in other (non-Amaya) browsers using an
escaped space (%20 I think); I haven't tried that in Amaya.  But it's a bad,
bad idea: unix don't like spaces, and some of your readers will be unix.
