Not so.  Space is perfectly legal in Unix; you just need to quote it in
some cases, such as on the command line (where it has another meaning)
or in a URL (where unquoted spaces are not legal).  Spaces are also
legal in filenames in (OS/2) HPFS, VFAT (W95 and later), NTFS and HFS.

Of course, a URL with quoted spaces may be somewhat less comprehensible,
but there's nothing invalid or illegal about it.
