Thanks, Andrew

There's legal, and there's legal but undesirable.  Spaces in filenames are
legal in VFAT (I had not known that they were legal in EXT2, since unquoted
they aren't legal in the console), but I would NOT use them in the name of a
web page.

Wouldn't you have to link it

<a href="&quote;http://www.somewhere.com/This is my
file.htm&quote;">Link</a>

?  Will that even work?  When I've tried it, this has worked

<a href="http://www.somewhere.com/This%20is%20my%20file.htm">Link</a>

(I might be getting the escape character wrong), but I still wouldn't
recommend it (for one thing, it's ugly).  For anything but a GUI file
manager, spaces are a pain in the neck.

Thanks again,
Patrick
