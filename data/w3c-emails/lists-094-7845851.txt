I'm a consultant developing a web authoring tool for set-top box browsers.
The first rev. however is supposed to run on WinNT/Win2K in MDI (Multiple
Document Interface) style; that is, I have to look at more than one window
at a time. Microsoft's solution DHTMLEdit just has too many bugs to be
acceptable. I am currently building a layer over IE, but I would like to
consider adapting the AMAYA code.

I would like some advice.

Thanks,
Jack.
