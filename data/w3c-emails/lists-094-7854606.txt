No, that probably won't work.  The use of double quotes for protecting
spaces in filenames applies to command-line shells, not URLs.

Yes, that works.  It's also perfectly legal, if ugly.  I believe you
should also be able to use the "+" character to encode spaces in URLs.

Well, quoting isn't THAT hard.  But I agree that it's not particularly
nice in URLs.  Mind you, long filenames can be harder to read without
the spaces!
