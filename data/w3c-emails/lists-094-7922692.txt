URNs need to be resolved into URLs. Typically, this is done by a specific
server. Today you can find a very good example of such a service at

http://www.purl.org/

As to whether this should be integrated or not into a browser, I see it as
a special configuration option where you could set up a number of URN
resolver servers, something similar to the configuration of your DNS servers.

However, we're not yet there yet. I don't know the exact situation today,
but I suppose one of the problems is having people agree on how to use such
services.
