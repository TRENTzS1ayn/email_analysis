HI,

I have been using amaya for some time. Great tool ! 

However, I am missing something which looks like an important item : 
The Table of Contents. 


I know there is a view to it. But I could not find anywhere a way to insert it 
in the final HTML page. 

This is a little annoying as I have to use different tools for that sole 
purpose (like asWedit). 

Am I missing somthing ? If not, why can't we insert the table of contents that 
Amaya produces anyway ?

Thank you 

Philippe
