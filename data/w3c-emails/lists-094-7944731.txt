Hi,

This is not a bad joke or a provocation, but I'm looking for a free tool that
could decently print a long (~ 130 pages) HTML document with a stylesheet. It
should, among other things, honor the page-breaks for printer media as defined in
CSS 2. All I could get until now, trying Amaya (that was very good at composing
the document, espacially the "make book" feature), Netscape (including the
Mozilla betas and DocZilla), Internet Explorer was at some point unsusable : pictures
and/or text lines splitted over two pages (IE), mangled formatting (Amaya,
Netscape Navigator), no page breaks (all but IE), no page numbering (none of the
Mozilla breed), etc.

So far, having a report printed is a somewhat frustrating experience.

A clue any one ?

Cheers,

Serge Torres
