Amaya runs on WinnNT/Win2K but we didn't do any specific adpatation for
the MDI (Multiple Document Interface).
You have first to try Amaya in your environment then you can report us if you 
think
that we can make some adaptation.
Someone from the team or someone from the www-amaya-dev subscribers colud 
perhaps help
you.
