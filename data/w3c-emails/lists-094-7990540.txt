Hi,

the Table of contents is simply a particular view of the document - nothing
new is generated (as far as I know).

It would require some coding to add the TOC at the beginning - interested??

  HI,
  
  I have been using amaya for some time. Great tool ! 
  
  However, I am missing something which looks like an important item : 
  The Table of Contents. 
  
  
  I know there is a view to it. But I could not find anywhere a way to insert it 
  in the final HTML page. 
  
  This is a little annoying as I have to use different tools for that sole 
  purpose (like asWedit). 
  
  Am I missing somthing ? If not, why can't we insert the table of contents that 
  Amaya produces anyway ?
  
  Thank you 
  
  Philippe
