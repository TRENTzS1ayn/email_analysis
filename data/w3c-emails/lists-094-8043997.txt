Some kind of new W3C standard, I suppose? Sounds like a good idea, except
for one thing... where is the infrastructure going to come from? It means a
whole *new* hierarchy of name servers...and another bunch of money-grubbing
greedy and incompetent bastards in a parallel to internic controlling the
top of the hierarchy with a monopoly. :-) In any case, I thought
redirecters and virtual domains pretty much eliminated the trouble of
address changes, at least for those wealthy enough to afford a domain name.

...Or is this part of a scheme to steal Internic's thunder and provide a
means for every netizen wealthy or poor to have a memorable site name
instead of the poor being stuck with an address like
http://some.isp.com/~jrandom?
