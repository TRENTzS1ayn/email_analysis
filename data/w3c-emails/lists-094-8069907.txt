You're getting close. RFC 2141 defines the actual URN syntax:

  urn:Namespace_Identifier:Namespace_Specific_String

Appendix A says:
> An URN MUST be considered an opaque URL by URL resolvers and passed
> (with the "urn:" tag) to an URN resolver for resolution.  The URN
> resolver can either be an external resolver that the URL resolver
> knows of, or it can be functionality built-in to the URL resolver.

Some people have been advocating using the DNS as a URN resolver. See
RFC 2168 (Resolution of Uniform Resource Identifiers using the Domain Name 
System) for details.

You might also want to have a look at RFC 2169 (A Trivial Convention for 
using HTTP in URN Resolution), RFC 2288 (Using Existing Bibliographic 
Identifiers as Uniform Resource Names), RFC 2276 (Architectural Principles 
of Uniform Resource Name Resolution), RFC 2483 (URI Resolution Services 
Necessary for URN Resolution) and RFC 2611 (URN Namespace Definition
Mechanisms).
