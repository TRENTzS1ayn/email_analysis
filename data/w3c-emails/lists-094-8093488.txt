>> So far, having a report printed is a somewhat frustrating experience.

IMO, this kind of task is one to which HTML is ill-suited. XML and XSL with
the Formatting Objects might be better suited, but these are still in their
infancy; nonetheless you might want to investigate Cocoon, at
http://xml.apache.org.
The mature technology best suited to your needs, IMHO, is LaTeX. Stick it
in a search engine and you'll get a wack of links. (Use the word "typeset"
or "TeX" or "Knuth" and you'll get a wack of *relevant* links...otherwise
you may or may not be surprised by the nature of the bulk of the links
you'll receive :-)) Some of them link to free software for nearly every
platform imaginable, and others to tutorials. Try these in particular:
news:comp.text.tex; an Archie search for "lshort.pdf" or "lshort.zip".
