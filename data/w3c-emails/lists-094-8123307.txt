Hello Jim,

Thanks for your report.

You're right. It isn't possible to set up a cache on an NFS directory. This
is because we set up a Unix system lock to avoid having two instances of Amaya
overwriting the same cache.

The problem is that this locking mechanism doesn't work on NFS and the
Amaya documentation doesn't say so (but it should).

As you said, if you configure the cache directory to be in the local disk,
you wont have this problem.

Does the existing cache locking mechanism annoy other Amaya users?

-Jose
