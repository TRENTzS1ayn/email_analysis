I'm running Amaya 3.1 on Windows98 and have had frequent
problems while browsing. Almost every web page I go to
has problems being rendered. For example:

http://www.cnn.com crashes Amaya when I scroll to the bottom
of the page.

http://www.usatoday.com does not display properly

http://www.dash.com doesn't display anything

http://www.doubleclick.com displays all the elements on
top of each other

http://www.cfp2000.org displays two columns on top of each other

http://www.acm.org displays two columnns and graphics on top
of each other

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-amaya/ - if I do a search
and then click the back button twice to come back here, the
page no longer renders correctly (word wrap is very strange).
Then if I go back again and then forward, Amaya crashes.
