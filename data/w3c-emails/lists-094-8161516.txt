I have been trying to edit the P3P issues list
(http://www.w3.org/P3P/Group/Specification/p3p-issues.html) 
with Amaya 3.1. Amaya seems to crash periodically when
doing this. For example, I accidently added a column, then
removed the column, and Amaya promptly crashed.

Also, I have been unable to figure out how to change the
background color of a cell. Any suggestions?
