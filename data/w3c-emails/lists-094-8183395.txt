Hello,

In our previous episode, Fox One said:

This directory was removed from the CVS base by hand, when trying to clean
up a bit the repository.

Everyone who had checked Amaya previous to this change (it dates from about 
one month ago) will have the same problem. 

The solution is to remove that directory. CVS will work then.

We apologize for not having sent a warning before.

-Jose
