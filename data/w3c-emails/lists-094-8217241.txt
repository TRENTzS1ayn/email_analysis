This is a bug due to the Unicode support in the 3.1 release. It's solved now

Sorry for the inconvenience.

I'm fixing that bug in the new release.

I restored the old Win95 versions 2.5 and 3.0 on the http server
http://www.w3.org/Amaya/Distribution
In the future we will keep the previous version on the server.
