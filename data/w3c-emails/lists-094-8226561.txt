We don't have a precise for for a DAV support in Amaya. As I understand the
main part of that work should be done on the server side.

For Amaya a template is also a page.

The button  Edit/Browse is used for enabling/disabling editing functions on the
current document. But you can browse a page even if the editing is allowed.
I guess your problem is related to the simple/double click for browsing.
You can change the standard choice in the menu Special/Preferences/Global
