Using the help document  
keyboard.html  in /doc/amaya 
If  I search using edit - find   hyphen 
   it does not find the word hyphen which
 is an entry in the first table .....
even with checkbox UPPER = lower
which i assume stands for case insensitive search
is this a quirk because it is in table construct  or
  because i started by using help menu to get
to keyboard.html
