oops -- mea culpa!
the problem that i had reported is NOT a lack of
 finding the word hyphen in the text keyboard.html
 as original stated.
it IS a result of two other problems though
[1] on a 800x600 windows display and with the 
    amaya browser not max sized......
   the find leaves the highlighted word OFF SCREEN
   so i thought it was not found
[2] Amaya changes USER mode selection!
  this is a particuilarly dangerous stunt.  Most
  browsers do a find next without changing the 
   options --- this caused me to think there were
   more errors because i changed the word to
  search for to a KNOWN word which was at start of file
  and didnt spot that the USER selection buttons
  had been manipulated by the system....  this is
  very unfriendly and am unaware of any other 
   finder that does this !!!!!!!!!
