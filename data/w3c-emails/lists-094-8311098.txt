There seems to be a problem with long hrefs that get broken into several lines.
Amaya does not recognize such links on the main screen, but it does in the Links
window. For example, go to http://www.phil.uni-passau.de/lehrst.shtml and click
on "Politikwissenschaft (Politische Theorie und Ideengeschichte)" (somewhere
down the page) where a linebreak occurs between "und" and "Ideengeschichte
(at least on my screen, may depend on the width of your Amaya window).
Links that are not broken into multiple lines work fine.
