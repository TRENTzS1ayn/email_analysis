hello.

re: libwww.w3c :
I remember reading something about the libwww-bot being used in experiemnts
with different hyperlink-models.

today, I came across an instance of what would require a link between >2
xml-nodes [sidebar: the xml-source of document.that is targeted for XSLT to
HTML]


so, hoping that this list will be appropriate for it:

has anyone been developing a prototype of a more-than-2-ended hyperlinking
system?

I'll probably just use some sort of <ul/> or <dl/> with an "also see:" label
on it, but wondering if there are other options in-progress.



thank you.
