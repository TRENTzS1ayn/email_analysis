You're right. If the cursor is currently in the middle of the row, Amaya is 
looking
for in the DTD a way to generate a row here and I guess it found that the 
better is to
split the current cell and the row here, generate a new row and fill the end 
of the
previous row and the beginning of the next row with empty cells.
Perhaps the context was more complex and Amaya tried to do more than that?
Probably we have to avoid generic editing within tables and provide specific 
commands.

I guess if you selected the row by ESC (or F2 on Windows) then enter a return 
you obtained
what you wanted.

The right way is to select the row  by ESC (or F2 on Windows) then Delete.
I'll add the information in the help page.
