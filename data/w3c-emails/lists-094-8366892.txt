Actually I find that Amaya takes a very long time to deal with re-rendering
tables of any size, but that after I come back from making coffee it is
sitting there, very pleased with itself, and has done just what I
asked. Perhaps you should get more coffee/tea/milk/whatever breaks?

(Seriously, I have found it can take a couple of minutes or more, but I have
not found it actually infinite-looping.)

  I've found that inserting a new table row often (but not always) causes Amaya to
  get into a state where it is constantly re-rendering the table, causing the
  browser window to flash, but stop responding. It has to be killed and
  restarted at that point. This seems to happen all the time if I place my curser
  in the last row of the table in any spot other than the right-most cell, and
  select tr from the types menu. While I can understand that this may be 
  partially a user error (I should put my curser in the right-most cell I think --
  I couldn't find an explanation of exactly this point in the help pages, but
  I think that's probably the correct way to use it) I don't
  think it should crash Amaya.
  
  Also the help page for tables doesn't explain how to remove a table row.
  How is this done?
