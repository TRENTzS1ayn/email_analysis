You think so? Then try this little example:

<html>
<body>
<a href="noref.html">In that page Amaya has a problem with the attribute height
of TD elements when their contents is greater but no problem with long
hrefs</a>
</body>
</html>

At least my version of Amaya does not recognize the href in the main and
alternate windows, but it does so in links window.
