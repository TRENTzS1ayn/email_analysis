I just added the printf command to the HTMLactions.c file,
and I got the following error messages using gcc and gmake:

../../amaya/HTMLactions.c: In function `UpdateContextSensitiveMenus':
../../amaya/HTMLactions.c:1193: `Types' undeclared (first use in this function)
../../amaya/HTMLactions.c:1193: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only
../../amaya/HTMLactions.c:1193: once for each function it appears in.)
../../amaya/HTMLactions.c:1193: `BImage' undeclared (first use in this function)
../../amaya/HTMLactions.c:1194: `BObject' undeclared (first use in this

../../amaya/HTMLactions.c:1225: `StructTypes' undeclared (first use in this
function)
../../amaya/HTMLactions.c:1225: `BComment' undeclared (first use in this
function)

Could someone please help me?

Thanks in advance,

Willie
