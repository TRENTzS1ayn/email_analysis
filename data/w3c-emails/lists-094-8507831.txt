[DJW:]  There always has been a very simple browser, 
the line mode browser, that uses libwww.  If you want
something more, you should consider integrating the latest
libwww into Lynx, but be warned that even text only browsers
are far from simple, especially when you consider the need
to support contemporary HTML abuses.
