A more interesting project might be to make a very simple XML browser... (and
just stop on people who produce invalid XML - if this had been done way back
when  there might have been more pressure for decent HTML tools and
authoring).

  [DJW:]  There always has been a very simple browser, 
  the line mode browser, that uses libwww.  If you want
  something more, you should consider integrating the latest
  libwww into Lynx, but be warned that even text only browsers
  are far from simple, especially when you consider the need
  to support contemporary HTML abuses.
