Hello Nikola,

We're using the same configuration for publishing and we do get prompted
for authentication credentials.

The problem may come from your Apache configuration. Maybe you have a 
special rule to say that the PUT is only valid thru Netscape.

Have you tried to see what the Apache logs say?

Cheers,

-Jose
