The version of Apache that I use 1.3.12 that comes with Redhat 6.2 with
(23.6.2000) updates has a put handler as a module. All you have to do is enable
it. It seems to work fine with Amaya. I used to use a custom put handle derived
from one found on the net but after applying the latest updates found that the
config had been clobbered. Investigating the reasons for the failure, I found
the references to the put handler. Give it a try!

Hi,

Could you post details of your PUT handler for Apache please?

I'm investigating various PUT handlers for our Intranet (we use Amaya), and am 
interested to know which one you use.

Thanks V much
Yan
