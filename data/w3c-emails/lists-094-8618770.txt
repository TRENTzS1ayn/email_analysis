This suggestion is probably too late for next version
but is something to contimplate for the future.
Currently, there is no method in Amaya for the user to
know that he is on a hyperlink hotspot.  Most other 
browsers indicate in some manner that cursor clicks will leap!
I see one possible way of enabling this kind of feedback by
having a Special -- General (or its own subitem) with 
checkboxes (to allow multiple choices)  for
a] hover type display (with optional color choice)
b] show selected address in status line
c] change cursor to hand or different icon
of course no checked off boxes allow action to be as is now.
this allows the user flexibility in choosing the feedback method.
Perhaps a checkbox could also be included for underlined
hyperlinks even though it is now the custom to use
the default stylesheet for this.
I know this is a browser and not editor issue but this type
of user accomodation will help make amaya more 'sellable'
to average user....
