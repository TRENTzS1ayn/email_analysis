Amaya does not render frame sets ... 
However when a frameset page is accessed, Amaya 
could and should render it in a fashion that allows the
user to move on to one of the pages addressed in the frameset
by making the src="foobar" attribute into a hypertext link.
This would allow the user to continue in his travels 
while at the same time allowin amaya to remain frameless.
Once again this suggestion is to accomodate the user
  (not the page designer) who otherwise would deselect
   Amaya (perhaps forever)  to gain access to material.

Amaya has sound reasons for not rendering frames and
  for not getting absorbed in repairing broken syntax on
  websites but should also not lock itself out as a browser
  Many sites use frames so at least provide a mechanism
 to jump past the gate to the material on the other side.
