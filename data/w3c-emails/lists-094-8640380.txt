further checking shows that the src is indeed hyperlinked
so that one can move on ... my confusion points out
the need for the feedback mechanisms i suggested......
there was no icon change/ status bar notification or hover 
available  and indeed   my Amaya.css request to 
underline  links   wasnt even followed   although when 
i accessed the w3.org page  the links were underlined.
At a minimum  the underline the link  setting in my 
default amaya.css should have been honored....
Perhaps this is an unnoticed bug !!!!!!
but at least i am not stopped at a frameset page so
   the big hangup doesnt exist ......
 adult males have high incidence rate of color blindness
(as i have just demonstrated) so color difference alone
is not enough to flag links --- please make underline
   work for frameset attributes  in next version if at all possible.
