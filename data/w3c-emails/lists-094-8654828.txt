Certain design decisions have been made with good reason by
the implementors.  However some of these are not well known
 by others who are testing the software and seem to be missing
  when compared to other browsers.
Perhaps the features and reasons for omiting them should be
documented either as a help page or even better as a page on the
web.  This will let new users decide if Amaya will or will not be
 useful for them ....  For example:

Amaya is not as tolerant of bad syntax as many browsers are
REASON: Amaya is concentrating on suitable rendering of 
   correct html documents.  This allows Amaya to be more
   efficient.

Other design decisions which i dont know the reason for
and hence the request of a documenting page are:
[1] Floating images are not implemented
[2] Frames are not implemented
[3] JavaScript and Java are not implemented
[3] Animated GIFS are not implemented
[4] Plug-ins are not implemented
[5] Helper programs are not implemented
There are probably good reasons for each of these decisions 
but they should be documented and readily available to
potential users for decision making!
A lot has to do with available resources and trying to focus on very
important issues such as internationalization   and accessibility
  functions.... Not being critical of decisions but would like
 documentation Thanks
