i have a short file that demos two problems....
[1]margins are not correct immediately after a header item
if an image is used on next line!
i know this isnt good design practice but the file passes thru tidy
so it should be rendered in a consistant manner

[2]if one doesnt use the image file (can rename for testing)
the flagging icon overlaps text rather than being a space holder!
