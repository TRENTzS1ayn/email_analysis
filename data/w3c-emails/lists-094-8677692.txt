There are a number of features in CSS that are implemented by Amaya and could
be part of a default user style sheet. On e problem is that it is not very
easy to write CSS for beginners (and it is not the way Amaya generally is
designed) - it would be nice to have the option of saving style information
to the user style sheet instead of the main page (it would also be nice to
have the option of moving a style elemetn to an external stylesheet...)

Cheers

  Currently, there is no method in Amaya for the user to
  know that he is on a hyperlink hotspot.  Most other 
  browsers indicate in some manner that cursor clicks will leap!
  I see one possible way of enabling this kind of feedback by
  having a Special -- General (or its own subitem) with 
  checkboxes (to allow multiple choices)  for
  a] hover type display (with optional color choice)
  b] show selected address in status line
  c] change cursor to hand or different icon
  of course no checked off boxes allow action to be as is now.
  this allows the user flexibility in choosing the feedback method.
  Perhaps a checkbox could also be included for underlined
  hyperlinks even though it is now the custom to use
  the default stylesheet for this.
  I know this is a browser and not editor issue but this type
  of user accomodation will help make amaya more 'sellable'
  to average user....
