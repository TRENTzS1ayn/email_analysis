I can understand why you made that design choice. It's a reasonable
choice to make, although it does mean that Amaya may never be
useful as a browser for anything other than demos and
browsing the W3C web site (it may still be useful as an editor, 
however). It would be nice, however, if Amaya recovered gracefully 
from bad HTML and limited its failures to simply bad rendering. 
I see no reason why Amaya should crash from bad HTML
(as it does on cnn.com for example).

Now it displays OK

Now this one does not display anything at all. I wonder if 
performance is degrading over time (the longer Amaya is
running or the more bad HTML it displays, the more things
break)?
