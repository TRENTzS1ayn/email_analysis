<h1>Amaya and horizontal tabs</h1>
Under some circumstances, namely when rendering the source
view of a document whose source contains ASCII&nbsp;9 (<acronym
title="Horizontal Tabulation">HT</acronym>) characters, Amaya
causes successive words to run into one another.
<p>This has been observed under Linux using lesstif, but I suspect
that the problem is generic.
<p>The present document is intended to demonstrate the problem. Most
of its lines begin with an HT character. Load it into Amaya (I
used a CVS snapshot as of 1999-12-31) and look at the source
view. (The HTML view is fine.) I hope mailers along the
way won't strip the tabs fromthis message.
