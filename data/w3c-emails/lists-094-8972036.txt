Hi,

We effectively omited to update that part of the help documentation when we
introduced the menu Preferences.
By default the multi-key functionality is disabed and the user can now 
dynamically
set and unset that functionality using the the menu Special->Preferences.
We will update the documentation.

Thanks for the report and Happy new year
   Irene

I wanted to bring the fact that this line is missing from the v2.4 .thorc file to your attention because the help file in v2.4 tells the user to change the "no" in this line to "yes". I thought this could possibly cause some confusion since the entry, 'ENABLE_MULTIKEY=' doesn't exist.
