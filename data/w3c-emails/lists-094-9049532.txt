Hi,

As of version 2.4 the Alt Gr key has no effect any more on my french
keyboard and with Linux. Still works fine on Windows. I've tried with a
previous version (2.2): it works (at the first glance, it is not my Linux
or X-Window). What I miss the most is the circumflex accent. I have
"solved" the problem with new entries in my amaya.keyboard (Ctrl <Key>g ,
Ctrl<Key>a is now ?) but I still miss #{[... since I was to lazzy to add
the entries (check the Iso-Latin codes table, transcript to octal ...).

I do not  know if this tip has already been given for those who use Amaya
from a french keyboard: 
Ctrl Shift <Key>1: CreateHeading1() instead of Ctrl <Key>1:
CreateHeading1(). In general, see note in amaya.kb.

Cheers,

Serge Torres
