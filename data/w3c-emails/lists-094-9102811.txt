They *should* be &amp;, although the one before lookup is also
wrong.

These &s occur in a CDATA parameter context.  In such a context,
SGML entitities are replaced.  That means that any paramter name
that spoofs a known entity will get substituted by that entity and
any that doesn't will be at the mercy of the parser's error 
recovery.

The HTML 4 specification goes as far as to advise people creating
form handlers to accept ; as a synonym for & when the server is
likely
to be used with GET type form URLs coded in anchors rather than 
generated by forms.  It does this to avoid the need to use &amp;
