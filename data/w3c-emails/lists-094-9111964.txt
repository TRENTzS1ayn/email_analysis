Thanks for your report.  It helped us to fix the bug.
If you update module amaya/html2thot.c from the CVS base,
the table of content of HTML 4.01 will display correctly.

There is no error in the HTML file, so no need to complain.

Sure, but it's a matter of priority.  Validation is already available
through other tools, such as the W3C validator.  Amaya only tries to
detect and fix errors that may pose problems at editing time.

You are right.

I guess "<-- insert..." is supposed to be a comment.  Adding a '!' after
'<' improves the situation, at least in the structure view, but it does
not magically solves the nested bodies problem!  We will look into this.

Amaya claims to *create* well-formed and valid documents.  It is also
supposed to add well-formed and valid *new* stuff.  But it only *tries*
to recover from some usual html errors.  Other tools are provided by
W3C to validate and fix invalid documents.  This is not a priority for
Amaya.

Only for stuff generated by Amaya, unfortunately.

The source view behaves differently on purpose. For some manipulations
strict structure editing is not very convenient and editing the source
as plain text, without any constraint is much more efficient. This feature
has been added recently and we still need to improve it.  Checking validity
when the user synchronizes the source view, for instance, would be nice.

Have you tried HTML tidy?  That's exactly its purpose.
