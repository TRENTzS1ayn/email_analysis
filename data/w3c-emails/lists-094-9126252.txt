From the HTML 4 specification:

B.2.2 Ampersands in URI attribute values
The URI that is constructed when a form is submitted [p.245] may be used as
an
anchor-style link (e.g., the href attribute for the A element).
Unfortunately, the use
of the "&" character to separate form fields interacts with its use in SGML
attribute
values to delimit character entity references [p.32] . For example, to use
the URI
"http://host/?x=1&y=2" as a linking URI, it must be written <A
href="http://host/?x=1&#38;y=2"> or <A href="http://host/?x=1&amp;y=2">.
We recommend that HTTP server implementors, and in particular, CGI
implementors support the use of ";" in place of "&" to save authors the
trouble of
escaping "&" characters in this manner.
