You need to update the dialogue files as well. There is doucmentation on
adding a menu item, and I guess the process is the same for taking one out.

  Hey,
  
  I'm trying to only reconfigure the menu bar, move some things around and get
  rid of one of the menu bars... I edited Editor.A to get rid of the Links
  Menu but how do I update this? I tried rebuilding the entire project but
  when I went to see editor.h, it still had the dialogue linked to Links. How
  do I update the changes in Editor.A without doing a complete rebuild.. is
  this possible?
  
  Thanks for any information,
