When one selects file | new | HTML in Amaya 2.4 on NT 4
whilst viewing an existing page, the proposed URI replaces
the final / of the current page with  a \ before appending
New.html.   It also seems to strip too many components
from the right hand side.

Specifically,

http://www.bts.co.uk/homepages/djw\New.html

is proposed, while viewing:
