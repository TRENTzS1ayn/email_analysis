Noticed that new files created with Amaya 2.4 (Win 95) automatically save
in the xhtml format sted html as was the case previously.  This can be
corrected by choosing the "save as" function from the file menu.  Wondered
if this was intentional?

Would like to see next version prompt for a filename and (x)html/text
choice prior to initial save of new files.

On another note, concerning the Ctrl+Return use for <br>.  This feature was
previously in the 2.2 version.  Trust next release will fix the bug.
