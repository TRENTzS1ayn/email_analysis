If one tries to draw an area, the window jumps to the top left of the image,
and
there is no apparent way of scrolling back to the correct place, so one
can't
draw an area that is outside a window aligned with that top left.

In addition, although handles are displayed on the area, there is no
apparent
way of manipulating them graphically.

Also, an extra click appears to be required before the href dialogue box is 
displayed, after accepting the alt text box.
