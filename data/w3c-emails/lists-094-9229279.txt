After partially constructing a client side map using
Amaya (and with no intervening saves or loads), on
saving the HTML, a bogus "   rect" was output before
the </map>:

  <area shape="rect" coords="497,36,737,218" alt="Picture: Aneet and Dave
  Waring," href="pic0004.jpg" />
  rect</map>

Because of the other problems noted areas where repeatedly added and
deleted,
so this could be a consequence of a fault in deletion.

Attempting to do view source created an empty window, although
I'd previously got view source to work.  The bogus rect does not appear
in the structure view (but this won't copy and paste for illustration).

(Although one can go through the motions of copying part of the structure
tree to the clipboard, the clipboard viewer indicates an empty clipboard,
not even an application specific format.)
