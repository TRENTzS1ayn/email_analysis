Jean Raymond,

I need more context to help you.

From where are you compiling Amaya? 
From the CVS base or from the source distribution?

You should have a directory called libwww/modules/md5/ and that's where
the md5 code is found.

Can you tell me where are your trees? It should work if you have it as

/somepath/libwww/
/somepath/Amaya/
/somepath/Amaya/obj

and if you call configure inside the obj directory.

Are you interested in testing message digest authentication? If yes,
I made a bug fix this week on the main libwww branch, but I haven't yet
committed it to the libwww Amaya tagged branch. I can do it if you need
it. I didn't do it yet because I'm going to merge to the latest dev branch
in a couple of weeks.

-Jose
