Sun Sparc Solaris 2.5.1 gcc-2.95.2

The build for amaya 2.4 seemed to go fairly* OK.
On installing:
gmake[2]: Entering directory `/home/hgs/Amaya/Amaya/Solaris-2.5.1/libjpeg'
gmake[2]: Nothing to be done for `all'.
gmake[2]: Leaving directory `/home/hgs/Amaya/Amaya/Solaris-2.5.1/libjpeg'
../install-sh -c -m 755 ../bin/amaya /usr/local/Amaya/applis/bin
gmake[1]: ../install-sh: Command not found
gmake[1]: *** [install] Error 127
gmake[1]: Leaving directory `/home/hgs/Amaya/Amaya/Solaris-2.5.1/amaya'
brains# pwd
/home/hgs/Amaya/Amaya/Solaris-2.5.1

I thought configure had found an install program already.

* The only problems with the build were:

When the source tar file was unpacked it created an Amaya directory
and put the stuff in it, but it tried to put things into a libwww
directory which was in the same directory as the Amaya directory -- i.e
Amaya/.. and it failed because there was no such directory.

Most software distributed as tar files creates one directory and puts
everything below that. 

When I moved everything down one level putting the tar file in a
new Amaya directory, creating an empty libwww directory in there with
it, then the untarring went OK.

I didn't epect gmake to complain about the lack of an Options file, or
a .depends file, but it created these so persumably they are OK.
