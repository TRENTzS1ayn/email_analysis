I'd like to edit some Java Server Pages using Amaya. Because the files
have a .jsp extension instead of .htm or .html, Amaya won't recognize them
as a HTML type document and disables the HTML features and also won't
syntax color the files.

Is there a config fire I can edit to change Amaya's behavior? I've looked
around and haven't found anything I can edit to do this.

Thanks,
