These two URLs are different.  Assuming the first
is more correct, most servers will respond to the
second with a re-direct to the first.

Actually, all the responses are correct.  This is not a directory
and the server takes recovery action for your s-less form.
At a guess, this is a dynamic page done in a cache friendly
way.

404 is the correct response for the first:

HTTP/1.0 404 Not Found
Server: Apache/1.3.6 Ben-SSL/1.36 (Unix) PHP/3.0.12
Content-Type: text/html
Via: 1.1 cache.www.uk.psi.net (NetCache 4.0R4)

X-Cache: MISS from athena.bts.co.uk
Proxy-Connection: close
                               
and 200 is the correct response for the second:

HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Date: Wed, 12 Jan 2000 11:29:34 GMT
Server: Apache/1.3.6 Ben-SSL/1.36 (Unix) PHP/3.0.12
Last-Modified: Mon, 10 Jan 2000 18:35:09 GMT
Accept-Ranges: bytes

X-Cache: HIT from athena.bts.co.uk
Proxy-Connection: close
                                
the third produces a permanent redirect to the second:

HTTP/1.0 301 Moved Permanently
