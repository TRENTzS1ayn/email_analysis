You're right, the s-less form gets a 301 Moved Permanently response. I didn't
think about this possibility. But the problem remains that when I enter the
URL with the final slash and then realize (after the URL has been loaded)
that it's wrong and delete the slash and press return, Amaya doesn't do anything.
