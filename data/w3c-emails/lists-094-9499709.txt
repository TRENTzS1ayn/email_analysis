I guess the way I stated my question was misleading. The problem is not that
the two URL's produce different results but that Amaya seems to think they
mean the same. Please try the following: Load the first URL (with the slash),
then delete the final slash and press return. Amaya does nothing. Netscape will
load the second URL (which results in a different page, of course).
