Right Amaya considers that 
http://wings.buffalo.edu/soc-sci/linguistics/dryer/atlas
and http://wings.buffalo.edu/soc-sci/linguistics/dryer/atlas/
are the save URI. 

Normally the server should serve the same page.
You can try that with http://www.w3.org/Amaya and http://www.w3.org/Amaya/,
the displayed page is is always http://www.w3.org/Amaya/
