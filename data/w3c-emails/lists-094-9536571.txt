Documents and directories are implementation
details in the server; that there is commonly
a correlation between a URL and a directory path
doesn't guarantee that to be so.

The particular problem with dropping the / is that
the resulting redirect isn't cacheable, so the 
request goes end to end even when a local cache has
the required page.

Redirects are essential here, otherwise relative
URLs will break.

In the case quoted the client has broken because the /
form was tried first and, reasonably, rejected (some
serveres would ignore the excess pathinfo) but Amaya
thought that the non-/ form must be equivalent, so
has refused to refetch it.
