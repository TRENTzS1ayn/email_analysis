I guess you omitted to confirm the new title value. You have to hint the Return
key to confirm.

I suspect you download the source tar file with IE or Netscape.
If you want to do so, you have to check that that tool uses a up to date
winzip program. The tar file includes long file names and suffixes like
"Makefile.am" and old unzip versions may not support that correctly.

A solution could be:
- to download a winzip version see http://www.winzip.com,
- to download the source with Amaya or ftp
- unzip the source with winzip

Could you confirm that that fixes your problem?
In that case, I will add the information in the source page and the FAQ.
  Irene.
