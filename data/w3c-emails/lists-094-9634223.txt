Hello,

I have been using Amaya to create some html-pages full of mathematical
formula's. Since these have to be read by others, who don't use Amaya,
how can I write out my files in a format that Netscape or Internet
Explorer can read (for example with little gif's in the place of the 
formula's, or empty places, leaving the links as they are?

Any help would be very much appreciated.
