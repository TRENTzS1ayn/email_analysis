Hi,

Just another weird behaviour of version 2.4 with my Linux (Redhat 5.2,
glibc 2.1.2) box:
when I try to "save as" the document address box will not accept vowels
(!?!), other letters are OK. 
It happens no matter the size of the document or the span time I have been
working with Amaya.
On the other hand, everything is fine my other box (Linux Mandrake 6.1,
glibc 2.1.2).

None of them allows me to get the characters accessible only through the
Alt Gr key (~"{[|`\^@]} and all the circumflexed vowels, with multi key
enabled )on my french layout keyboard.

Cheers
