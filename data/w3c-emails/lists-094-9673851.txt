Today Amaya supports only a limited list of languages (see the entry 
Attributes->Language).
If fonts are available and you have set the right language in the body, Amaya 
could display the page
correctly. This support is very limited, but we're working on the Unicode 
support in Amaya and that
will better solve the problem. We hope to have an alpha release of the Unicode 
support by end of April.
