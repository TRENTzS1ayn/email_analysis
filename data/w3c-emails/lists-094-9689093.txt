Hi,

These is a known bug. There is a conflict with some XF86Config and/or
xmodmap configurations when you're using a non standard keyboards. 
Someone mentioned that he is looking at that problem.
Meanwhile, I can suggest three checks:
- first check if you have the right configuration for your keyboard
  in /etc/X11/XF86Config
- check if it works better when you don't have the NumLock set
- start xev and check what encoding is returned when you hit the key of a 
  vowel within the xev window.

  Irene.
