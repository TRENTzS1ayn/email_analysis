Morning All,

I was working along in Amaya this morning (Built from the CVS library as of
yesterday morning), and came across an odd behavior in a table. I created a
3 row * 2 col table, selected the first row (not the cells in the first
row, but the row itself), and went through the Type menu to change the row
cells to <th>, and things just seemed to go haywire. I Can duplicate it,
Below is a test document with the results and directions to replicate the
problem. Once, on top of adding everything that you see below, Amaya simply
shut down. I was able to retrieve my work, so no loss there.

I hope this helps... If you have any questions, or if I can be of any
further assistance, I will be glad to help.
