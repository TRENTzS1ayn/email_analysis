Hi,

the documentation that comes with the binary installation of Amaya (for 
Solaris) includes a document entitled "Configuring your WWW server to 
understand the PUT method" in file .../doc/amaya/Put.html. That document
contains a link to "overview of a PUT operation", supposedly in file
PutOver.html, and a link to "configuring the CERN for a PUT", supposedly
in file PutCern.html. But PutOver.html and PutCern.html do not exist (I 
guess they are just missing in the installation tar file).

Peace,

Bertrand Ibrahim.
