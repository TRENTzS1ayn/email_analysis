Hello Bertrand,

In our previous episode, Bertrand.Ibrahim@cui.unige.ch said:

Mostly yes. If you're testing against an apache previous to 1.3.9, it'll
work. Because of a misinterpretation of the MDA spec, I had a bug in my
libwww implementation which keeps it from working against 1.3.9.  I don't
know how it'll work against other servers.

I committed the fix to the libwww base, but didn't tag it yet for the
Amaya release, as I'm in the process of moving to a more recent libwww.

If you want the fix, you can get it from the current libwww CVS base.
The file is called HTAABrow.c. Remember to get it without using the
Amaya tag.

-Jose
