Morning All,

Another behaviour that has been bugging me, so to speak.

When I create a table, and fill in a table's first two rows for the
heading, then realize that I meant to change those cells to be Table
Headers, I select the rows, change them, and lose the contents of those
cells. Ideally, I would like to see the the cells maintain their contents
when the modification is completed. I am using CVS version as of the
morning (US EST) of 17 Jan.

Thanks in advance...

Gary Klesczewski
