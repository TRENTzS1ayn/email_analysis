Hello John,

The comment is ambiguous. I just edited the doc to make it clearer.

You need to uninstall any previous Amaya in the Windows platforms. Unix
boxes don't have this problem.

If you're using rpm, you can just do an rpm -U name_of_the_amaya_rpm
and everything will be taken into account :)

If you want to uninstall the previous version, you can do a "make uninstall"
in the Amaya directory. I haven't tried it, but it should work.

Sorry for the confusion.

-Jose
