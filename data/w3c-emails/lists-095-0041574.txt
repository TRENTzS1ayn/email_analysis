This is an intersting topic.

There is not too much value in adding tidy to the output chain, since Amaya
outputs clean code anyway.

Having it as an option in the input chain would be good. As the Authoring
Tool Accessibility Guidelines require, a tool should not change the markup it
reads without asking the user about it anyway (this itself is one of the
tasks to bring Amaya to double-A conformance with those guidelines).

In fact, exposing a way to provide filtering of content would be very
helpful. At the moment there is the transformations language, that can be
applied to selected content, or the source view, that takes the entire
document, and synchronises back and forth. It would be useful to be able to
take a section that was selected, and instead of applying a transformation in
the Amaya transformation language apply a transformation in XSLT using an
external engine. Or to take a fragment that happened to be in an XML music
language and pass it to a music playing helper application. Or to pass the
entire document to an application that rendered X3D...

cheers

  So if he loads his XHTML into amaya then it will require him to fix <img>
  into <img /> before it lets him save it?
