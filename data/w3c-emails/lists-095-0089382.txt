Hi,

Amaya 4.1 seems to have a problem with the <col> element: it will not put it correctly (as <col/>) when saving as XML. It will not reload it, complaining for the error. Even if you put it correctly by hand in the file, it will repeat the error the next time you save. I did not check with previous versions of Amaya. I use the binary release over a Red Hat 7.0 Linux box.

By the way, I would gratefully welcome any solution to get double-clicking in business again within the sawmill/sawfish window manager as this problem seems to be a WM issue.

Best regards

Serge Torres
