I think I reported this with previous versions of 
Amaya, but it doesn't seem to be fixed in Amaya 4
(at least not the windows version)....

Form submissions do not work properly... I'm not
sure exactly what the problem is, but I seem to
get prompted to save the page when what I want
to do is submit the form. I use Amaya to
edit pages on the W3C jigedit system, and
if I have to update something with CVS, I have
to use a different browser because I seem to be
unable to get the "perform action" button to work
on the CVS form ... for example
