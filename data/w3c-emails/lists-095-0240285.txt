Hi there


using the 4.1 build on linux (dated 23 Nov)

I created a table 7 cols 3 rows. I wanted to make a standard row
into a header row, so I selected it in the structure view (clicking
on the tr element), then selected Types/Table/Heading cell.

Something strange happened (looked like an entire html doc was
inserted into the first td element).

Selecting the data cells individually works fine.

Hope this info helps!

Thanks
