To:www-amaya@w3.org

The README file found in the ftp site's Amaya directory
indicates that I should write to this address to request
any additional dicitionaries.

I would like to get a Portuguese (European) dictionary...
Please advise me accordingly.

By the way, that sentence in the README file (from which I
quote above) fails to adhere to writing standards, in that
a period is used AFTER the e-mail address www-amaya@w3.org

Thank you for the service.

C. Coimbra
