A couple of browsers (at least IE and Opera) implement CSS properties (I
think it is page-break) that allow them to be used much like powerpoint to
present an HTML presentation that consists of a single page, marked up and
styled appropriately.

As a heavy Amaya user, and someone who does a lot of presentations, this
would be a good feature for me to use, and a good way to show off Amaya.

(For another reason why I like Amaya, look at
http://www.w3.org/2000/Talks/1116-oz/all.htm in another browser, and then in
Amaya - there are some cool things about supporting SVG natively. I am
looking forward to a serious level of SVG support - good job ;-)
