We have three new configuration options (Annotations -> Configuration),
for disabling the automatic download of local and remote annotations.

These options changes Changes the behavior as seen by users who 
previously had 'autoload annotations' enabled, it would be good to add an
additional comment saying that in release 4.2 Amaya now
defaults to not load annotations each time it is started.
Further, the note should add that to change back to the
earlier behavior users must select Annotations/Configure...
and uncheck the 'Disable remote autoload at each startup'
and check the two 'Autoload' boxes.

Also, we fixed bugs that hampered the use of annotations under Windows,
when Amaya was installed under a directory that had a space in its
name (like Program Files).

Just for curiosity, have any members of this list tried the annotations
feature? Our public test annotation server doesn't show much activity
yet. If it's because of problems with Amaya or with the server, please
send some feedback. Remember that each bug reported makes our software
more robust.

Do you consider that the annotation documentation we ship with Amaya is 
too technical? If yes, would it be helpful if we wrote a beginner's tutorial 
on how to make annotations? 

Thanks,
