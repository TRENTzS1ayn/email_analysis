Hi Irene,
i installed amaya 4.2 / Win NT 4.0 and the printing problems occurs
further on. The command Print crashed, while printing amaya's startpage.
This happens only when printing with amaya. So it should be no common
problem with the installation of my printers. I tried printing with
several printers and the outcome was the same. 
 
Is this a known problem, or just a single case. If first, does anybody
know, why it occurs.

With friendly regards, J?rg.
