The printing problem doesn't occur on my Win NT box. It probably may occur
on your box and not on mine because Amaya cannot save tempory files in 
your directory c:\temp

Could you process this way:
a) clean up if necessary the directory c:\temp (all subdirectories ThotXXX
   should be removed)
b) try to print the Welcome page
c) check if a subdirectory  ThotXXX has been created
