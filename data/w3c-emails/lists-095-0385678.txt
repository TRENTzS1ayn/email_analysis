Jose,

Thanks for the new configuration options!

Actually I demonstrated the annotation features (sans a live connection) at the
Society of Biblical Literature annual meeting in Nashville the weekend before
Thanksgiving. I have been contemplating whether to setup an annotation server
for our members to try using the annotation features of Amaya. I suspect with
some subject matter (biblical studies) illustrations of its usefulness, I may be
able to attract some users.

I suppose I saw the annotation server address in the server or user
documentation but assumed it was just illustrative and not actually available
for public use. (One of the consequences of reading too quickly! ;-))  I will
try it out over the holidays and see if I can generate a short article to our
membership on the use of Amaya for annotating webpages.

I did not think the user documentation was too technical but a tutorial might be
helpful. If I finish my illustrations using biblical studies pages before your
tutorial appears I will forward them for whatever use you would like to make of
them.

I hope you are enjoying the holiday season!
