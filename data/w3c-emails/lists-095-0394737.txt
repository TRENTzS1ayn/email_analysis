Hello,

We found a crashing bug in Amaya 4.2. When you apply a transformation,
Amaya crashes and your latest modifications are not saved. This is
an annoying bug.

We decided to remove version 4.2 from the server and we're preparing a new
one. Hopefully, we will release it today.

Sorry for the inconvenients,

-jose
