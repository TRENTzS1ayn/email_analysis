Amaya Friends,

While I wait for the next release later today to cure the crashing bug in 4.2, I
was playing with annotations in 4.1. A couple of problems:

1. Does the annotation mechanism not recognize element IDs? I was trying to
modify a text to have word level markup and unique IDs on each word but not only
did it not display properly, the annotation window did not "see" the elements
below <p> and no IDs at any level.

2. I am just missing something in the documentation or does Amaya not support
XML/XSL? The best I could do was an imitation of HTML with CSS, which is not
really adequate for serious academic work.

What I really need is full support for XLink in the annotation engine so I can
markup text down to the character level and others can post variants or
annotations on suggested readings at that level. Support for XML/XSL (as opposed
to its poor cousin CSS) would also be a big plus.

I really appreciate all the hard work that has brought Amaya this far and hope
that full support of the XML family of standards is not too far in the future.

I hope everyone is enjoying the holiday season!

Patrick
