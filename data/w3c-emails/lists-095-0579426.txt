I don't think the semantics of this are tightly defined - it 
tends to be a mix of text-align and auto margins.

> <ul>
> <li>First item in list</li>
> <li>Next in list</li>
> <li>Final item in list</li>

The CSS2 specification explicitly does not define the
exact position of the bullet when it is outside of the
text area.

The sample style sheet in the CSS2 spec specifies explicit
margins on UL, which means that block box type centering must
be achieved by explictly overriding them to auto if the browser
follows the sample.

text-align type centring doesn't move the actual boxes, only
the text within them, and as the list marker is outside the text,
it seems reasonable that it should not be affected by
text-align, albeit noting that CSS2 is explicitly undefined
here.

I am pretty sure the only (reliable) CSS way of getting ragged lists
is
to explicitly set auto margins and explicitly set the width of
each list item.

Incidentally, I hate lists with ragged bullets.

The text is centred in the anonymous inline box, but the bullet
is presumably being positioned relative to the explicit block
level box for the LI element.
