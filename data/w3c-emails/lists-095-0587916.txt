I notice that Amaya calculates relative measures fairly
well at the point of download/parse of a document but 
does not recalc relative measures as a window is resized.
To get a proper view the refresh button must be clicked.
I suspect the spec is vague on 'relative' definition about this
point but i notice other browsers dynamically calc on 'current'
window dimensions....  Small point to be relegated to 
  'while working on related issues' bugfix I think.
