#1> when entering data in textbox,  the <cr> key is
     filtered out of text string even though it should remain 
     for forced wrapped purposes......
#2> if in non-edit mode  the delete key doesnt work
     although the backspace key does.
#3> there is no scrollbar for longer messages 
     but i couldnt test well because of issue #1
