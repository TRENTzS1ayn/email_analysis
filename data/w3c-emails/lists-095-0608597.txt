I am trying to set a form with a short text line followed by a select box
  all in the same line.   As the select box has several items, i am trying
to  place the text midway down the box....  The valign attribute does
not apply either to paragraph or select.   
I can use a table to get the alignment correct but is there a better 
way using style or some other mechanism ???
