The 4.2.1 is a very old version. Normally this bug is fixed in 4.3.2

It's crossed out on the Unix version, but we didn't find how to change the icon
on Windows platforms.

I suggest you to test the last version.

Probably yes, but this is not a high priority for us.

Today Amaya has to do too many checks and transformations to do that 
frequently.

Amaya has a configuration file. This file is thot.rc.

Please see the last version 4.3.2.

It's available from http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/BinDist.html
