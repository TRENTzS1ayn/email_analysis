[DJW:]  Only if a list box is used.  Amaya appears
to be fully compliant, if it behaves as you describe.
(Lynx even has an option to use radio buttons, as that
can be easier for blind users).

From HTML 4.01 section 17.6:

size = number [p.52] [CN] [p.51]
If a SELECT element is presented as a scrolled list box, this attribute
specifies
the number of rows in the list that should be visible at the same time.
Visual
user agents are not required to present a SELECT element as a list box; they
may use any other mechanism, such as a drop-down menu.
