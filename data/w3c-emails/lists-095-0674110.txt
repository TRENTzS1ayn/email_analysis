For those of you who don't know, Sean is a member of the W3C's Web
Accessibility Initiative, and practically in an expert in HTML and its
cousins. I think all of his comments are very good and should be seriously
considered.

Speaking of that, what are the Amaya team's thoughts on all of the CUAP
recommendations (small r):

Recently, the Mozilla team has reported on the status of their
implementation of these features:

I believe that as part of Amaya's job to demonstrate the power of Web
technologies, it is also essential that it get the user interface right. The
W3C has put together a great set of suggestions and I'd love to see Amaya
implement most of them. I think this will set a great example and take a
leading role, demonstrating to other browser makers.

I understand that the Amaya team is very busy, but I hope that you can take
some time to look at these problems. Thanks for your help.
