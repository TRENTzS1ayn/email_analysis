Some responses from an Amaya user...

On Tue, 3 Apr 2001, Sean B. Palmer wrote:

  1) IBUG: It rearranges my code... this is very frustrating indeed, not
  only because I like neat source code, but because (for example) if you
  use <span> in <pre>, it messes up the whitespace. If I take the DTD or
  the XML PI out, Amaya pops it straight back in. Maybe there is a
  "preserve source code" feature in there somewhere... if so, then I
  think it should be turned on as a default setting - why would anyone
  want it messing about with their code (unless the code was wrong)?

CMN Nope, there is no such feature. I agree that it would be nice, but
considering that Amaya aims to always have valid code, may need some careful
thinking. As I understand it the main barrier at the moment is that it would
involve rewriting the stuff that serialises the internal document to source
code, which woulds slow it down a fair bit. (I guess it wouold involve a
comparison of the new version with the source view as a simple but not very
effective method).

  2) IBUG: One of the WCAG techniques is to use <map> to group HyperText
  links [1]... and yet Amaya does not seem to display <map> even when it
  is used in this way.

CMN Yes, this is an important bug. It s noted as something that should be
fixed. I would like to have done it, but never found the time to make it
work, and don't currently have a development environment :(

  6) BUG: Why is "information type" under the style menu? Semantic
  elements under style?? I think that they should be under "types",
  would be more appropriate.

CMN It is also a problem that there are no menu or keyboard access methods
for graphics functions. Since I often end up editing graphics through the
structure view (I do not have good control with a mouse) this would be
helpful, as well as an accessibility requirement.

  8) BUG: It seems difficult/impossible to add rel/rev attributes to <a>
  after creating the link.

CMN Should be easy.  Select the link (get there, and then use f2/esc
(windows/unix) to make sure it is the a element that is selected) and then
select the attributes menu.

  10) BUG: Why doesn't "show targets" tell you what that target is?

CMN I don't understand the question. Could you explain again please?

  15) FEATURE: Is there anyway to use a file on hard drive as a
  template? For those of us who can't install template servers... I
  presume that I could just edit the temple files in the Amaya
  directory, but what if I wanted to use a file elsewhere - on my home
  server for instance.

CMN I used to use a file: URI as my template server - it referred to a page
that included a list of files I used for templates. I haven't checked that in
newer versions, but it should work.

cheers
