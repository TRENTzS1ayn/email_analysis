The support of preserve is in the todo list of Amaya.

I know that problem. If you consider that it's important to support
that in Amaya we can change our priorities.

We made some progresses in the last version, but Amaya is still redisplaying
too often.

We'll check the specification.

The problem comes here from notepad which needs the ^M to work correctly.
Our position is to not work differently on a Windows and on a Unix platform
(the Web should be platform independent).
Any modern Web tool is able to read a Web page without ^M.

Because these tags work like a presentation style. There are toggles 
that set/unset the tag around the current selection. It's not the case
for other entries in the type menu.

I tested these functions on a Windows98 platform and they worked.
Could you send us a page that shows these crashes.

We don't have the manpower to do that. This is listed in open projects
concerning Amaya (http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Stage.html).
Any contributor is welcome.

When the element <a> is selected, you can add this attribute.
To select an anchor you can select the text within the anchor then hit
the key F2.

> 9) BUG: It gives phantom parsing errors, such as "line 696, char 12:
> not well-formed" - this particular document only had 695 lines in it,
> and was indeed well formed XML.

This bug is detected by Expat and I never saw this kind of bug. Are you
sure that all tags are correctly ended.
You can send us the URI if you don't find any cause of the error.

> 10) BUG: Why doesn't "show targets" tell you what that target is?

Show targets shows all elements that can be used as a target (anchors
with an attribute name, elements with an attribute id).

It doesn't add words with special characters, but no problem with other
words. They are added to your private dictionary.DCT
The character newline is not interpreted as a separator by the spell
checker. This is a bug we'll fix as soon as possible.

Good idea.

Probably yes.

Our plan is to use the right button to open a linked page into a new
window.

Not yet. See open projects (http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Stage.html).
