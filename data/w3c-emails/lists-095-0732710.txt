One of my pages uses nested ol lists to catagorize data.
What I am trying to do is to apply bold style to the top
level only , leaving sub levels in regular face.
Unfortunately the inheritance ?feature? of css makes all
levels appear the same.  It seems unnecessarily complex
to have to tag each sublist as regular face ... is there an 
alternative method around this other than using headings
for top level and reorganizing markup ???
