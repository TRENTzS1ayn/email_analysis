I have a small layout/rendering problem with Amaya 4.x on Windows/98.

See for instance:
http://www.osinet.fr/code/glo.asp?Initial=Y

The two images (banner and square) are displayed on top of the page, over the site
logo (osi online, www.osinet.fr), instead of being displayed within their respective
iframe.

The page is in XHTML1.0 with the transitional DTD, and is validated against XHTML1.0
and CSS1 using the W3C validators (plus SiteValet, actually).

Is this an error from me, or from Amaya ?
