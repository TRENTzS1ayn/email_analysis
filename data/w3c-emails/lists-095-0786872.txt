To do that we have to introduce a new environment variable DEFAULT_PATH

This is the default color of the selection if you selected the whole body (the 
bottom
line displays the current selection).
Normally you don't need to select within the new created document, you have a 
caret
displayed in red, and you just have to type.

That occurs when nothing can be inserted here.
Could you try this scenario:
a) Insert your URI the field Open: C:\Alan\Math\new.html (if C:\Alan\Math 
exists)
   You can use the command Open too.
b) You should have a red caret at the left top corner of the window, then you 
enter
   the text "Title".
c) Press the key F2 to select the whole text (check the bottom line), then 
click the
   button H1. You text is now within an element H1.
d) click at the end of the text and press Enter. You should have now a 
paragraph after
   the H1.
e) etc.

It seems that the last release introduced a bug in the command New. It will 
fixed
in the next release. Meanwhile, I suggest you to use the command Open. If the 
file
doesn't exist, Amaya will generate it (like should do the command New).

Thanks for your bug report.
