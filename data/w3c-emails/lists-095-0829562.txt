Hi,
I have downloaded Amaya because I wanted another browser oin my Sun than
Netscape. It looks nice, but I see all the colors reduced to 256. Is
that correct? And why is that happening? I definitely would appreciate
more colors, since I am working with a lot of photowork and reducing
that to 256 is not ok.

Regards,

Bas
