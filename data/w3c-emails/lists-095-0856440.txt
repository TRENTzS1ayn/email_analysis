Hi,

- I've just download Amaya 4.3.2 (rpm version for i586) and I start editing my
docuemnt that comes from Amaya 4.1. I've have also lesstif 0.91.4.

Rapidly, an error occured :

 amaya: Symbol `_XmStrings' has different size in shared object, consider
re-linking
*** Thot: Irrecoverable error ***
[3]  + segmentation fault  amaya

Is the error come from LEsstif (Xm ...) or Amaya.


- After that, I download Amaya 3.1 (rpm version for i386) and all seems to work.


- I like Amaya, but there is a problem with font : could it be possible to have
a <font size="+x"> control that work kindly (as Nescape's menu has) ?


Thanks you for all,

        Benji.
