Hello,

The Amaya FAQ [1] says:

  "Amaya cannot be used to check documents validity. It accepts 
   valid and invalid documents and tries to dynamically correct
   detected errors. For example it's able to add missing end-tags
   and to move misplaced elements."

[Question: What is the relationship between that correction
 and tidy's [2] functionality/heuristics?]

I downloaded the W3C home page, whose DOCTYPE is

 <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
    "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">

and edited it in emacs, removing one ending </li>. Amaya 
was not able to correct the error (it just assumed I meant
to continue the <li> and it choked much later on). Tidy
did the right thing. I think that if tidy can be shown to
do the right thing in most cases, that it should be integrated
into Amaya.

 - Ian

P.S. I'm sorry if this has already been discussed.
