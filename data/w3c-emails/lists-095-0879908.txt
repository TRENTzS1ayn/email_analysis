Hello,

I've tried Amaya 4.3 on a Windows machine. Fascinating. But here are
some errors. Hope you will find them useful:

1. Colours in C:\PROGRAM FILES\AMAYA\amaya\AmayaPage.html aren't
displayed right: there are points instead of a solid colour. This is the
case as well in the colours of the cubes as in the background colour of
the page, so that the text is poorly readable. I've attached two
GIf-images to this e-mail: one of your welcome page, one of another
Amaya page.

2. The colours of the colour palette to adjust the fore- and background
colours show up right. However when a colour in the colour palette is
chosen it changes from solid to points again.

3. Horizontal as well as vertical scroll bar doesn't end up totally at
the end, when scrolling towards the horizontal or vertical end of the
page.

4. Neither the horizontal nor vertical scrollbar disappears when the
page fills the entire length or height.

5. When going back to C:\PROGRAM FILES\AMAYA\amaya\AmayaPage.html:
"Attributes" in the menu disappears.

6. Local browsing of directories doesn't work, browsing of only local
files works.

7. There is no go-history to go back into.

8. There is no refresh for restoring the colours.

9. Aligning the pictures to the right and having the text wrap around it
doesn't work: the text is shown below the picture (<IMG SRC="....gif"
ALIGN=RIGHT>)

10. Visited links to global files are shown in a darker colour, however
visited links to local files aren't.

Hopefully they are of any use to you. The colour error is the most
annoying one. As long as the background colours aren't depicted right
and the letters are poorly readable, I can't work with Amaya.

Looking forward to any change you might implement,

Han.
