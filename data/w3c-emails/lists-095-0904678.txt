    Hello,
    
    The Amaya FAQ [1] says:
    
      "Amaya cannot be used to check documents validity. It accepts 
       valid and invalid documents and tries to dynamically correct
       detected errors. For example it's able to add missing end-tags
       and to move misplaced elements."


If this is still true, then what's the `show parsing errors' item under the 
Veiws menu for ?????

Perhaps the FAQ is out of date.
