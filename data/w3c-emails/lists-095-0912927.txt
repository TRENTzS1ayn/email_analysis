Amaya makes a difference between HTML and XHTML.

When it parses an HTML document it tries to recover from some
common errors and fix them. Should it not do that, it would
only display very few Web pages.

When the document claims to be XHTML, it checks the document
for well-formedness and stops parsing as soon as it encounters
an error.  The idea is to help XHTML to deploy in a cleaner
way as HTML, by encouraging authors to fix XML errors.

In both cases, Amaya reports errors in the log displayed by the
`show parsing errors' command. This log also contains warnings
about elements or attributes that are not supported (yet) by
Amaya. I think this is a useful feature.

The passage of the FAQ you quote is applies only to HTML documents,
not to XHTML documents. I'll update it.

Thanks for pointing this out.

Vincent.
