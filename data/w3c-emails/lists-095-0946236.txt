Hi!

(Win 95 platform):

In \Amaya\Config\, the files tr-*dialogue should specify Latin-9 
encoding, not Latin-1. [Turkish dotless lower-case i and dotted capital 
I, as well as g and G with carons in Latin-9] replace [Icelandic eth 
and thorn in Latin-1], as I recall. You may wish to confirm this with 
an i18n expert, or research the Web.

I just downloaded the latest vesion of Amaya; it's a remarkable 
creation! I expect to be using it to create my own Web site before 
long.

Best regards,
