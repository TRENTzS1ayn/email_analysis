The file http://www.w3.org/Amaya/Distribution/extenddic.tgz provides the
c code of a tool (traiter.c) that is able to translate a source
dictionary XX.DIC into a formatted dictionary XX.dic
You can find included also an example of a source dictionary.
The format of a source dictionary is extremely simple:
a) The first line gives the number of following lines and the number of 
following
characters.
b) Then there is one line by word and words are alphabetical ordered.
