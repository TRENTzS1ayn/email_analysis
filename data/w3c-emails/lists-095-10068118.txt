Hi,

I am discovering Amaya software ...

When i do a copy from another software, a text editor by example with 3 
lines of text and then a past in Amaya, i loose the line break and get 
only one line of text.

In other words, is there a feature (like in Netscape Composer) when you 
do a paste to get the <br> tag at the end of each line you copy ?

Thanks for your answer

Patrick GIRARD
