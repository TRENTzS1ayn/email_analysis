I also had a similar problem with posting a message using a form.  The
message I was typing in ran out of the form box, and when I pressed "enter"
the line jumped to the top of the page (over the top of other text/images).

How "browser capable" is Amaya designed to be?

Subject: Doing copy and paste loosing lines break

Hi,

I am discovering Amaya software ...

When i do a copy from another software, a text editor by example with 3 
lines of text and then a past in Amaya, i loose the line break and get 
only one line of text.

In other words, is there a feature (like in Netscape Composer) when you 
do a paste to get the <br> tag at the end of each line you copy ?

Thanks for your answer

Patrick GIRARD
