Hi,

Could you please send your message in text format.

       *  Publishing Preferences dialog misspells "application/xhtml" as       
      "application/xthml+xml"

Fixed

       *  Text size is smaller in GL version for the AmayaPage.html file

We analyze the problem.

       *  left/right cursor keys do not work (already reported)

Fixed

       *  Default button General Preference dialog has no effect on Export
          CR/LF

Fixed

       *  en_US is accepted by General Preferences dialog for language, but
          when reopened, the preferences list en

In Amaya en-US and en are the same value.

       *  The windows version is supposed to use the %TEMP% variables, but it
          is using the original directory-c:\temp\amaya.  %TEMP% variables
          are:

    TEMP=C:\DOCUME~1\Brant\LOCALS~1\TempTMP=C:\DOCUME~1\Brant\LOCALS~1\Temp

Fixed

       *  Shortcuts beginning with Alt such as Alt + t + Alt + w for cite do
          not work.  This includes most shortcuts in Style > Information Type
          and Style > Character Element.

Fixed

       *  For AmayaPage.html, the normal view only lists Set DOCTYPE to XHTML
          1.1 + MathML, but source view gives all options

       *  The modify doctype menu is available for CSS files.

       *  The doctype appears in structure view and is editable for new XHTML
          1.1 files.
Fixed

In Amaya there is no distinction between en-US and en.
