PNG Transparency does not seem to be working.  Example page is 
http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/png-MagnoliaAlpha.html.  Much of the 
background is trandparent in Mozilla.

Also, the W3C part of the W3C HTML 4.0 logo appears incorrect.  It shows 
as having a dark blue background, but it should be red.

To enter a quotation mark, I must press the quotation mark key twice.

Multi-imbedded lists do not cycle marks.  Testcase is at bottom of 
http://www.mozilla.org/quality/browser/debugtc/bft_browser_html_mix3.html.

The W3C images in the Test Suites column appear to be stretched.

The underlines on links at 
http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/CSS1/current/test11.htm appear to be 
lower than the underline for the rest of the line.

The alternate stylesheet is unavailable for 
http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/CSS1/current/test11.htm in the 
enable/disable stylesheet lists.
