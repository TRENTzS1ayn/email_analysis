You can read my previous message " Bug Report ? Delete links with links view
- Supprimer des liens avec vue liens "

In the view links (when you select views/show links - en fran?ais
vue/montrer les liens) makes you believe that's you work only on the links.
I have understood that actually you work on the all document, all parts that
are not links have been just hidden. From my point of view it is an
interface problem or a documentation problem.

Best regards
