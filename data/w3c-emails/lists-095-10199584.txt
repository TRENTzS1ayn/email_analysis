I agree that this is a problem.

There is a related question in how the table of contents view works.
Selecting a particular heading does not select everything up to the next
heading of that level, but selecting two headings does almost allow you to
move the relevant part of the contents to a different place in the document.
It would be nice if the table of contenst view allowed you to easily move the
sections identified by headings (conceptualy, unless you use ISO-HTML).

cheers

  You can read my previous message " Bug Report ? Delete links with links view
  - Supprimer des liens avec vue liens "

  In the view links (when you select views/show links - en fran?ais
  vue/montrer les liens) makes you believe that's you work only on the links.
  I have understood that actually you work on the all document, all parts that
  are not links have been just hidden. From my point of view it is an
  interface problem or a documentation problem.
