All, 
Hi I am new to Amaya. My goal is to use Amaya to become more fluent with
xhtml while
updating my worksite with Amaya when new work is done. However, my work site
uses the MS Exchange Server. I looked and looked and can't find any way to
pass the necessesary password and login to the exchanger server in order to
use Amaya in a manner similar to how I would use FrontPage or Interdev to
update my site. I hate to 
ask stupid questions but could not find anything in the FAQ section either.
Anyone
care to help?
