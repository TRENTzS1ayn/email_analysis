GIF transparency doesn't work either.

Example page: http://www.oxnardcc.org/committees/curriculum/; the condor 
image in the upper left corner has a transparent, not white, background, 
and should blend smoothly with the light blue background rather than being 
displayed in a whitish square. Other images on the page exhibit the same 
problem, although the condor makes the problem the most obvious. Compare 
the rendering with that of the same page in IE 5 or 6, Mozilla 0.9 or 1.0, 
or Opera 5 or 6. It probably works properly in Netscape 4.x, too, but I 
haven't tested it.

Also note (at least in Win98SE) the slight misalignment of the second 
column of the main layout table. The blue-dot bullets are supposed to be 
just to the right, not the left, of the vertical blue/white boundary in the 
upper portions of the page. Again, comparison of the rendering with one of 
the browsers listed above will show the original intent.
