I'm not the expert here, but you need to have something that enables an HTTP
PUT. (I know there is some rudimentary support for FTP but I don't know if it
works by default, and how stable it is - it was an experiment to support
people with servers that don't manage to do HTTP properly.

Hopefully someone can give better answers than that.

cheers
