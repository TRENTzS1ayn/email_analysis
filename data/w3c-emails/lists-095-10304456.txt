You can use the Apache mod_put module. I tested it some time ago and it
worked well at that time with Amaya.

http://hpwww.ec-lyon.fr/~vincent/apache/mod_put.html

I don't have any idea on what to do with MS Exchange or how it works.
Someone from the list must do that work and report back to us. I'll be
glad then to add it to the FAQ file.

I'll add a pointer to the mod_put page to the FAQ.
