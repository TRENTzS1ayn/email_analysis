Hi,

I am using Amaya 5.3 for Windows in a Windows 98 SE computer and I want to report two bugs:

1. When I select some paragraphs and I search for a word that it is in every paragraph, Amaya find all the words except the words that are in the first paragraph.

2. Search and replace works recursively and I think it should not. For example, a search for "John" and replacing by "Mary and John", selecting "automatic replace", hangs Amaya.

Thanking you in advance,
Barto
