Another important bug:

1] images with width= {some relative size , say 90%}
attribute should scale. I have a jpg diagram in
http://www.cgocable.net/~jrussel/rrjournal.htm
that should adjust to window size  but it does not!

And the same file illustrates the ongoing problem of :

2] html floating images not being encorporated even though
this is an OLD part of the standard. I could build my navigation
area with a table but this practice is being discouraged as 
an incorrect use of tables...  Many sites rely on floating images.
Maybe it is about time to fix.
