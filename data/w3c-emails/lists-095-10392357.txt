  Amaya 6.1 Bugs

The bugs have been found in Amaya 6.1 on April 29, 2002 on Windows XP. 
 Display is 1024x768, 85dpi.

    * The shortcuts for most items in the style menu do not work since
      ALT + T + ALT + W for example just activates the menu bar, then
      the types menu, followed by deactivating the menu bar and then
      typing a "w".
    * Despite showing as application/xhtml+xml when saving, Amaya sets
      the content-type to text/html.
    * The DOCTYPE is still visible and editable in Structure View for
      XHTML 1.1 documents.
    * When I change the DOCTYPE of an XHTML 1.0 Strict document to XHTML
      1.1, I get a confirmation message that is in a dialog box that is
      too small.  The message is "Creating or Changing the doctype
      causes teh document to be reparsed.  Pending modificatio" (message
      is cut off after the "o" in "modification")
