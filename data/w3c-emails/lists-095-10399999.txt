Good morning,
I downloaded 6.1 and checked. Is it my Win98 keyboard
or character mapping? As described under "Help >
Characters > Optional Multi-key Support", the following
tests and results are shown for the computer from which
this message originates:

'*,O' and '*,o' (for ? and ?) = O,o -unexpected result
'*,A' and '*,a' (for ? and ?) = ?,?
'`,A' and '`,a' (for ? and ?) = ?,?
'`,O' and '`,o' (for ? and ?) = ?,?

I hope soon to recommend Amaya's adoption and use to my
university (maybe Annotea too). I also want to propose
to the university that it should apply for W3
membership. Is there any collateral material in
addition to everything on the W3.org website that I
could use to support my efforts in winning stakeholder
approval within my institution? 

Now in final year International Business Studies, I had
some study and work experience in Oslo 2000/2001, hence
the interest in ? as a character.

Thanks & Best Regards
Robert Moore
