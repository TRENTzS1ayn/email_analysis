Yes, by default Amaya displays p, h1, h2 as blocks.

Amaya 6.0 and the future Amaya 6.1 make some progresses in the implementation 
of CSS
but they don't provide a full support of CSS2. This selector is still not 
interpreted
by Amaya. This is due to a lack of manpower, so if you want to contribute that 
can help
us.

See current status of CSS implementation in Amaya at
 http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/CSSStatus.html

This is due to conflicts between default Amaya rules and the display:inline.
We'll check how to improve the current implementation.

Today Amaya does a strict comparison with attribute values.
