Text as images is rather more strongly discouraged than
table layout, so doing navigation areas as images is 
probably out.

A more valid criticism (unless fixed in the very latest
release) is lack of support for CSS postioning, which is the
reason for discouraging tables for layout - they are considered
acceptable in accessibility guidelines because of the need to 
support NS4s broken CSS.
