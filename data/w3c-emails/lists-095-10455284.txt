Amaya does not recognize links with types of "text/css; charset=UTF-8" 
and other types that specify their character set as stylesheets.  The 
determination of whether the media type is supported as a stylesheet 
should be based on the primary type (text), the subtype (css only I 
believe), and the optional charset (excluding if charset is unknown). 
 Currently, the inclusion of charset makes Amaya not recognize the 
stylesheet.
