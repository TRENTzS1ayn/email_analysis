Thanks all for not being nasty about pointing out my error. When I said 
Exchange Server, I actually meant Win2000 IIS V.5 Server. Frankly, I try to 
avoid Microsoft except at work. (I think the Exchange Server must just be for e-
mail and associated services) Just to give you some backround I am a pharmacist 
but have taught myself quite a bit about linux, java, expect, basic html. I 
have interests in timesaving through automation of programs, electronic medical 
records, and preservation of intellectual property for web documents.

At any rate, I believe David Woolley answered my question entirely. I searched 
the web and found some indication that there might be a non-microsoft solution 
to the NTLM problem but didn't research it further. Our web administrator had 
an option to use a different authentification but chose not to, probably for 
the reasons David mentioned:

If it is using NTLM authentication, you are locked
into IE; not even Netscape supports that.

In that case, get it reconfigured for Basic 
Authentication, but note that clear text equivalent
passwords will go over the LAN.
