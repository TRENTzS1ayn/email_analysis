All,

I am having trouble with the linux version WSIWYG editor. When I use the 
backspace or delete keys, for instance, control characters appear in the html 
and odd characters may or may not appear on the WSIWYG. It is interesting that 
on any other screens, for instance the screen to set or change attributes, 
those keys work fine. I did set the environment to include the the keymap as 
mentioned in the installation instructions, by the way. 

Thanks,

Jim
Meyer
