Yes, this is essentially due to the fact that Amaya doesn't support the
rendering property float (in CSS) - nor the old-fashioned HTML equivalent
people used to use for aligning images.

I don't know where float is on the Amaya team's development priorities,
although it is a reasonably common request now. I too would like it ;-)

(But since I don't have time to try coding it, I keep waiting for a
saviour who does - open source projects are like that.)

  All,

  I became somewhat frustrated trying to align and size pictures using the
  WYSIWYG editor with Amaya. Although the html editor in Amaya shows "right"
  alignment and the image would show as aligned "right" on a normal browser, the
  Amaya WSYIWYG editor seems to ignore alignment all together, not to mention odd
  sizing problems. (I am using the linux version). I realize it would be a big
  project, but it would be really neat if the WYSIWIG editor could be used to
  drag pictures around to where you want them and size them as well.

  But at the very least it would be nice if the pictures would show up as they
  would on a browser, with the correct alignment. Perhaps I am doing something
  wrong? I have a student who was also frustrated with the image rendering on the
  NT version.

  If Amaya is purely for demonstration purposes, then this is probably not a
  problem. If it is to be a useful editor, it might be a problem. It is a problem
  for me.

  Thanks,

  Jim Meyer
