Only the GL version supports 255 level of aplha and blending.
GTK only has one aplha level (due to imlib limitation)
Motif and WIN32 (GDI)  may only have one level of 'alpha' => only if the background an uniform color.

As Opengl is going to be the main version, we do not plan to code alpha levels management for others version. 

(And we'll need any bug report on this version before making it the main version, including graphic card vendor)
