Are you using a recent release of Amaya?

For several versions it has saved files opened without the extension in
whatever their actual location was - adding the correct suffix. But if you
don't specify a suffix for a new file Amaya does exactly what you ask and
saves that.

Being warned that you should put a file extension on a particular file is the
sort of thing you woud expect for a windows-based system (except it doesn't
warn you anymore - it adds it even if you already did) but doesn't make so
much sense on the web as a whole. It's just a convention that works well in
some setups.

  Hello Amaya folks,

  Please forgive me if this has already been discussed
  before (and point me to the discussion, please).

  When I use Amaya with jigedit, Amaya saves a file with
  or without a suffix (e.g., .html) depending (I believe)
  on the name of the file I am editing.

  I would like Amaya to warn me when I am saving a file with
  or without a suffix and there is another one already there
  without or with a suffix.

  I don't know to what extent Amaya can add a suffix
  automatically. I am not an expert on these matters. Would
  it be possible for Amaya, given a media type, to query the
  server for one or more possible suffixes, and when the user
  has not provided a suffix on the file name:

    a) If there is only one suffix expected, use it and
       tell the author (when configured to tell the author).

    b) If there are several possible suffixes expected, ask
       the author which to use.

    c) On systems where no suffix is expected (perhaps Unix
       systems?) don't do any special prompting, or allow
       configuration to always require a suffix.

  Perhaps this is all very w3c-centric, or apache-centric.
  It may be perfectly ok to publish N files with the same
  name differing only by suffix (e.g., to be served using
  content negotiation). However, it is a common problem
  at W3C that people don't realize they are publishing
  two different files, one with ".html" and one without.
  It would seem that a warning from Amaya when this situation
  exists would help authors a lot.

  Thank you,

    - Ian
