Amaya does not support frames.
  Is this a resources unavailable for implementing issue or
  is it philosophical in that group believes there are alternate
  techniques that accomplish the same goals.  
If it is the latter, i would like someone to show me or point me to
design notes or pages that have implemented in css or html4
  Using tables is so bizzarre and archaic for several reasons:
1] one must repeat content on all pages with sidebar -- a real
     maintenance headache. 
2] menu scrolls off screen just when you need it most.
3] no scrollbar for long menu... you must scroll main screen tsk! tsk!
the w3.org main page is a good demo of what not to do
can anyone point me at what TO DO to achieve sidebar menus
   without frames or ugly table construct.   An inquiring mind needs to know!
