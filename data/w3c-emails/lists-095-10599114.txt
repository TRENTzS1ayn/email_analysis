I bet it is the first. You can add that Amaya is an editor with browse
capacities, not a browser.

If it is for browsing pages with frames, use a browser capable of doing so.

If it is for editing pages with frames:
create the frame page manually
create all sub-pages to fill the frames with amaya.

If you use an ascii editor for editing, you would do a similar thing.

Do not let amaya restrict you! Use it for it's power, not for the missing
features.
