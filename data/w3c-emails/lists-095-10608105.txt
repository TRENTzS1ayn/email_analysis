My personal preference would be to have the float property implemented - this
is what is done on more and more sites.

    Is this a resources unavailable for implementing issue or
    is it philosophical in that group believes there are alternate
    techniques that accomplish the same goals.
  If it is the latter, i would like someone to show me or point me to
  design notes or pages that have implemented in css or html4
    Using tables is so bizzarre and archaic for several reasons:
  1] one must repeat content on all pages with sidebar -- a real
       maintenance headache.
  2] menu scrolls off screen just when you need it most.
  3] no scrollbar for long menu... you must scroll main screen tsk! tsk!
  the w3.org main page is a good demo of what not to do
  can anyone point me at what TO DO to achieve sidebar menus
     without frames or ugly table construct.   An inquiring mind needs to know!
