     Surely most professional web sites are generated from some application
- even if it is as simple as a page generating script in PHP or Python, etc

     I'm not quite sure what you mean by a menu here - you were referring
to a table - in my experience a menu is entirely hideen until selection is
about to be made (eg onhover or onclick activities).

     A matter of opinion - I personally MUCH prefer to scroll the whole
window contents (I presume that you didn't mean screen - 'cos that is an
entirely different kettle of fish (so to speak)!

     Again I beg to suggest that ugliness is a matter of taste not
technical necessity.  I actually like tables and use them several times on
every page I have ever written.

     I don't think trhat we ought to get into the wars about this - it is a
matter of taste - I always go for a no frames page in preference to on
ewith frames - so much easier to control and see what is going on!  But
that is just my opinion of course!!
