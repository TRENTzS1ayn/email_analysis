Thank you for your response, I will try to address these issues, but I 
have attempted to answer your problems right here.

The different document formats include HTML, XHTML, XML, PDF, and many 
others.  I will probably use an XML based language since it is easy to 
convert to other XML-based formats.

A loose DTD includes pieces of HTML that are now deprecated (shouldn't 
be used).

What exactly do you mean by prescribed DTD, or CSS?

I highly doubt it, but I am not a developer so you might ask one of 
them.  Besides, I don't think Microsoft would like it.

p is paragraph.  In HTML, the <p> element is used to markup where a 
paragraph begins and ends.
A block starts on a new line, while inline elements are, well, inline. 
 <div> is a block element, while <span> is an inline element.
href is an attribute used to give a hypertext reference.  This is most 
used in anchors and links.

No question is ever stupid.  Asking questions is how you learn.  Don't 
put yourself down for asking questions or let others put you down for 
doing so.
