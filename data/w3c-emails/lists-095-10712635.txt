To:"Lista Amaya"<www-amaya@w3.org>

Hi,

I am using Amaya 6.1 in a Windows 98 SE (Spanish) computer.

I want to create documents with accents in their file name, but Amaya behaves in a strange way.

For example, Amaya let me create a new document filenamed "m?sica.html" through "New Document" menu. But if I save an already created document as "m?sica.html" (trough "File / Save as" menu), Amaya closes inmediately.

I have been trying several characters (not all) and Amaya seems to dislike the u. I have got problems when there is an ?, ?, ? or ? (except when the u is the first letter of the name).

Thanking you in advance,
Barto
