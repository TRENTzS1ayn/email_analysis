Suggestion: in de editor mode of Amaya, put dotted border lines around the
cells of a table which does not have the BORDER attribute, as in the
Netscape Composer.

Note that presently the existence of a table might easily go unnoticed
in the Amaya editor; the table being "invisible".

At least two persons have considered this a bug:
