No, it's very easy to use another editor within FrontPage, just go to

  Tools > Options > Configure Editors

FrontPage will not alter any source code. However, to avoid version
conflicts and allow working on server-based webs, FrontPage passes
temporary copies to external editors, not the original files. Thus,
saving the file in Amaya (or any other editor other than frontpg.exe)
doesn't affect the original file. FrontPage won't update it until you
close Amaya.
