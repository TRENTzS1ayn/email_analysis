I understand that (according to the Amaya 6.1 Binary Release page) the RPM i386
package of Amaya 6.1 has the motif library statically linked, but installation
failed (I only have LessTif/Motif1.2):

pike:/opt/install 129# rpm -i amaya-6.1-1.i386.rpm 
error: failed dependencies:
        libXm.so.2   is needed by amaya-6.1-1

I installed the package with --nodeps, but I cannot run amaya:

pike:/home/phil/schneide 188>amaya
amaya: error in loading shared libraries: libXm.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

Is this a bug in the creation of the rpm package?
