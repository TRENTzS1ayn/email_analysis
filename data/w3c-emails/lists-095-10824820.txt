I believe the original request was to assure visibility during editing,
not to change the display behavior during browsing.  This seems quite
reasonable, even if it is not a high priority enhancement.

The simplest way to deal with this is to use the border attribute on any
tables you want visible. That's the way the table tag is designed and
changing that behaviour would seem to me to be a violation of the accepted
definition.

Suggestion: in de editor mode of Amaya, put dotted border lines around the
cells of a table which does not have the BORDER attribute, as in the
Netscape Composer.

Note that presently the existence of a table might easily go unnoticed
in the Amaya editor; the table being "invisible".

At least two persons have considered this a bug:
