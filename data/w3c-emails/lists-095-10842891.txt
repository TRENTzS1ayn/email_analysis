I already have amaya 5.3 and the source code. Now
there's amaya 6.1 but i can;t find the source code.
When I visited SourceDist.html the source code still
for amaya 5.3. Does source code amaya 6.1 has not benn
release yet?

I'm studying the source of amaya especially for mathML
for my final project in university. I want to know
what files that involved for mathML in amaya specially
for windows platform ?  Thanks.
