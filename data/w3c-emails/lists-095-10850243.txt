I downloaded 6.1 a couple of days ago and am just getting to grips with 
it, however when I select View Source from the menu bar the new window 
contains an advertisement for Contempt.Productions superimposed on my 
code, and when I close the window it transfers to the main editing window. 
Can anyone advise what's going on?
