Hi,
I've just joined the list. I downloaded Amaya 6.1 yesterday,
previously had 5.3.
SVG support has progressed, but rendering on a page seems
to have two major problems (and lots of little ones).
Anyone who is interested in SVG and Amaya, take a look at
this page:

http://www.goosee.com/evewe.htm

in which SVG graphics are inserted using the "embed" tag.
The SVG graphics are rendered in the wrong place on the page.
This is a consistent error.
Secondly, an SVG graphic with multiple lines of text (using the
"tspan" tag), only the first line is in the right place, subsequent
lines are rendered in very strange locations on the page (see the
SVG graphic near the bottom of the page).

These two problems make the page look awful. Fix these and
at least it will render with nice layout.
Alternatively, an anyone suggest changes to my "evewe.htm" to
improve the layout rendering?

Regards,
Barry Kauler
