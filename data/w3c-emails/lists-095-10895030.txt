Mystery,
Previously I had opened "evewe.htm" locally, on my own machine,
and the SVG graphics do display.
However, when I look at the evewe.htm page on my website, the
SVG graphics don't display at all.
So, what's going on...

I just tried it again to confirm -- open it locally, they display, on the
web they don't.
Ha ha, I opened the page using IE (with Adobe SVG Viewer) they
display fine, and I chose "File > Save as..." to save the entire page
locally, *however* IE doesn't save the SVG graphic files. You would
need to download those separately.
-- I have just done so, and the graphics do display (with parsing errors, 
but that's another matter).


Regards,
Barry Kauler
