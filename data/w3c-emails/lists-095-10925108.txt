New subject title, as this is a different problem from the incorrect
rendering of SVG on the page.

So that you guys can see the problem clearly, here is the offending source
code in my http://www.goosee.com/evewe.htm page:

<p><embed src="evemanual/user1.svgz" width="634" height="480" vspace="0" hspace="0" 
border="0" type="image/svg+xml" pluginspage="http://www.adobe.com/svg/viewer/install/"> </p>

When I open the document locally, resident on my PC, I get parsing errors, but the
SVG *does* display. Here are the errors for the above line of code:

   line 171, char 115: Unknown attribute value "type = image/svg+xml"
   line 171, char 128: Invalid attribute "pluginspage"

Amaya reads the SVG file and gives these errors for it:

*** Errors/warnings in C:\2002\www_goosee\evemanual\user1.svgz
  line 6, char 0: Invalid or unsupported SVG attribute "text-rendering"

  line 6, char 0: Invalid or unsupported SVG attribute "shape-rendering"

  line 36, char 0: Invalid or unsupported SVG attribute "text-rendering"

  line 99, char 0: Invalid or unsupported SVG attribute "pointer-events"

  line 164, char 0: Invalid or unsupported SVG attribute "pointer-events"

That last lot are a rendering issue. The question here is about the unrecognised
mime type. I found some documentation that Amaya ... I'm going from memory
here, but I think it said that the correct mime type for SVG is application/svg+xml
but that image/svg+xml is still recognised. ...can't recall where I read that.

Anyway, all other docs I've read give it as image/svg+xml.
