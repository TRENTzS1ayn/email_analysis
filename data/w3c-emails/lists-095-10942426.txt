Greetings,
     The attached tiny file is an extract from a larger stylesheet which
works happily in mozilla and opera.

     When run using Amaya under linux kernel 2.2.19 it crashes in one of
two ways -

     (1)  During loading a 'show errors' window comes up - clicking
     'confirm' opens the error and source window and then crashes with an
     'irrecoverable error' displayed on the desktop background.

     (2)  During loading a 'show errors' window comes up - clicking
     'confirm' immediately crashes with the displayed message on the
     desktop background '9391 segmentation error'.

     If I have a smaller file then complaints about all of the xsl elements
and attribute values are shown - but no crash.  If there is an error in the
file - as an xsl document - then I must apologise - but I don't think Amaya
should crash anyway.

                        Regards,

                                Keith Hopper
