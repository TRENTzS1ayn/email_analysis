Amaya is used to demonstrate and test many of the new developments in Web protocols and data formats, and is coded in  C. As touchgraph is dedicated to visualize networks of interrelated information and is coded in Java, mixing our code is a hard tasks. 
Perhaps could you be more precise ? 

Thanks for the feedback on the OpenGL version.
In fact, the real Amaya GL 6.1 haven't been released yet, but will be soon.
That version will correct the arrow keys bug that have been corrected in the normal OpenGL version.
