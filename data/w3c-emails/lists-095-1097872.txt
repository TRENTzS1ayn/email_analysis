i have placed three accesskey attributes on anchor elements 
in my homepage... anchor is one of seven permitted elements
for the accesskey attribute.  However i could not ge amaya to
do the hyperlink  i tried  c,  alt-c,  and ctr-c .  what is the secret
code to make it work.   is it a conflict between shortcuts used
by the amaya editor and the access key i chose.  Does Amaya
need to be in browse only mode to use accesskey correctly???
