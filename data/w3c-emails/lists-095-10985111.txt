I have observed unusual behaviour using Amaya 6.1 under Windows ME. To replicate
this behaviour follow the steps below:
1. Create a .gif file named "index.gif" in the same directory as an HTML file
you want to edit.

2. Launch Amaya and open the HTML file.

3. Open the view source window and make some minor editing change. Re-save the
file from this window.

4. "index.gif" will then appear as a background image in either the view source
window or the main browser window.

This is the cause of the mysterious advertisements in Amaya (see my previous
postings). I haven't checked whether it happens with other image files.

Does anyone else observe this behaviour?
