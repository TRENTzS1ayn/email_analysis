Hello Keith,

Thanks for your report.
Amaya complained about xsl elements/attributes because it considered this 
document as HTML. this bug is now fixed in the CVS base.
About Amaya crash, you are right, Amaya shoulnd't crash. I tested the extract 
and it didn't crash. Could you send us the whole XSL stylesheet ?
