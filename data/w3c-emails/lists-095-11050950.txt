Amaya is a structured editor and includes functions that as no equivalent
in other Microsoft applications. We'd like to improve the current user 
interface, but we need more concrete suggestions for that.
Could send us a list of shortcuts you're missing and scenarios that produce 
wrong or weird results.

MathML requires to be familiar with the structure editing. Do you experiment
the F2 function and transformations?

There is a MathML palette, but I agree it's too limited.
But you know you can generate &ApplyFunction; with Ctrl m Ctrl a and 
&InvisibleTimes; with Ctrl m Ctrl i.

Thanks in advance for your suggestions, we'll try to improve our code 
as much as possible.
