You guys are responding to my problem, but no one has
actually told me what to do to fix it.
The web page that I gave as an example, that Amaya can't
display the SVG graphics on, is my own site, so I can modify
it as required. 

Here is the problem shown another way:

I open an SVG graphic locally, it displays.
I upload it to my website and try to view it, I just see the text.

For example:
http://www.goosee.com/evemanual/user1.svg

Now, it is quite reasonable that I should be able to type in this
URL and then see the graphic.
But, Amaya is only displaying the text of the SVG file.

The structure of the SVG file follows the guidelines in W3
SVG spec 1.0 exactly.

I JUST WANT TO KNOW HOW TO FIX IT!

Barry Kauler
