The correct mime type for svg is image/svg+xml and application/svg+xml is not 
recognised by Amaya.
To embed a document into a primary HTML document, it's preferable to use the 
'object' tag instead of 'embed'. I think that 'embed' has never been defined 
in HTML recommendations but Amaya supports it because it is widely used. 
Nevertheless, Amaya shouldn't complain about the value of the 'type' atribute, 
I will fix that as soon as possible.
