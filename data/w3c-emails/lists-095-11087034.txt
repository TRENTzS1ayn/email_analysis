Mention was made of perhaps using more of the Windows
interface conventions on the windows model ...  some of the 
ones that are not there that are needed the most are
EDITOR MODE
>>move cursor word(s)  forward/back      ctrl - rightarrow  , ctrl leftarrow
    amaya does one time only but doesnt repeat !!!!   BUT IT WORKS
    MULTIPLE TIMES IN THE SOURCE VIEW ;-]  ;-]
>>select to end of line BUT NOT THE NEWLINE CHARACTER   shift - END
>> select to beginning of line   shift-home
>> select word(s) right/left  ctrl-shft  rightarrow/leftarrow

THE FAILURE OF SELECT MODE BY KEYBOARD IS MAJOR ISSUE.

BOTH EDITOR AND BROWSER MODE
>> Find next     F3
   moves in direction and for word set by ctr-f  (find first) dialog
ACCELERATOR KEYS ---- 
a lot of shortcuts would be redundant if the standard accelerator key
 convention was used .......
menu items  have underline  under initial letter (or other if duplication
      unavoidable)  
submenu items also have underline under initial or appropriate letter 
ALTERNATE key sets up the accelerator motion  
alt f x    would be  File Exit
alt f p    would be File Print
alt f r     would be File Reload   etc --- 
alt v b   would be View Buttonbar   --- gee almost there on that one ;-] ;-]

selection of wording to remove duplicate first letter   such as the mysterious
    Special ----> Configuration   or whatever ....
this convention works well for windows users and most programmers toolkits
let it be setup quickly.  Designers chose their menu and submenu names
 thinking about reusing what others use, avoiding duplication of initial letters
and easy to remember operations  such as alt - Edit - Replace    
 or in some  alt -- Edit -- Change 
lack of accelerator key function is major inhibitor for windows users.
