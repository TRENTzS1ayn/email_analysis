1] If I set an accesskey to either v or w there is a conflict in the
   action for alt-v   and alt-w   (used as shortcuts by amaya).
   A test indicates that accesskey has priority.  But what if one
   wants to use the shortcuts ???

2] On my home page i have accesskeys  e, c, p, v, w
 Amaya branches to the href spot. MSIE sets focus on
 item that contained the accesskey. pressing <enter> completes
  the branch.  Which interpretation is correct???
