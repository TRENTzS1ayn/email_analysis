The latest version of the Amaya browser includes for XHTML + MathML 
documents an XML stylesheet processing instruction to

http://www.w3.org/Math/Group/XSL/pmathml.xsl

However, when I go to that URI with Mozilla 1.0 RC3, I get a text/html 
page stating that I am not authorized to view that page.  In Mozilla, 
the page I attempted to view gets wiped out. 
 http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=147126 has the details.

There are already bugs filed against Mozilla for incorrectly handling 
the text/html mime-type when requesting an XSLT stylesheet.  However, 
the fact that we public users cannot rely on this private XSLT 
stylesheet means some inconveinience in Gecko-based browsers such as 
Netscape 6 and Netscape 7 PR1.

Could your development team please reference a stylesheet that I can 
actually reach?  If not, I'll have to manually comment out the 
processing instruction to get Mozilla to render the page.

Very Respectfully Yours,
