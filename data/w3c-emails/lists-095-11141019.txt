Okay, you guys, I found out that the reason I can't see SVG
graphics in Amaya, and can in ALL other browsers, is because
Amaya has got it wrong.

I checked my host's Apache server, and it does server SVG as
image/svg+xml.

Furthermore, I verified it at this URL:

http://www.rubynewbies.com/~tobi/mime.rb

This page will test mime type.
  Enter this in the box: 
  http://www.goosee.com/animate4.svg

However, you try that same URL in Amaya, and it gets the SVG
in plain text.

I rest my case.
