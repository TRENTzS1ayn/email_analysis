Excuse that hasty previous posting.

After getting the Apache server to serve SVG with
correct mime type, I had started Amaya and loaded
the URL, but it still showed plain text.

After sending the email, it suddenly occured to me that
the problem might be Amaya's cache. So, I flushed the
cache, reloaded the page, and presto, the graphic appears.

I finally got there!
Thanks for the help.

I'll write all this up and put it into my EVE SVG online manual.

Regards,
Barry Kauler
