Now that I have SVG graphics being served with correct mime type,
we can get back to the original problem
Sorry to be a pest, but these SVG graphics in the following page
display ok with the Adobe viewer, but have two serious bugs when
viewed in Amaya:

http://www.goosee.com/evewe.htm

BUG 1
The seond and subsequent lines of multiline text do not display in
the correct position. Multiple lines are displayed using the "tspan"
tag, you can see in the source code.
If you look at the first SVG graphic on the page, you will see that the
second line of text is displaced considerably down on the graphic,
even worse on the second graphic.

BUG 2
The images are in total displaced from where they should display. The first
graphic is displaced downward, the second is displaced left and up.
