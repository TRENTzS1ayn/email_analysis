If i accidentally paste an URL that has a trailing space in it,
Amaya will not find the document.  And simple viewing doesn't 
reveal the typo.  Could a simple edit of the location url be done to 
strip leading/lagging spaces to prevent this error from occuring.
I don't believe any legal URL has a lead/lag space and other 
browsers seem to cope ok.  And it is visually hard to spot error!!
