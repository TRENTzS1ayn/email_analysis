And there are a few more problems with trying to get numbered lists.
Create a new XHTML 1.0 Strict document:

    text
    one
    two
    three
    text

Position before the word "one". Press the "numbered list" button". There is
nothing I can do to get the "one" included in the list. If I press "delete"
the list disappears, and if I position before the "one" and press backpace,
the list disappears. (And if I focus on "One" and press "numbered list", I
get a crash).

Furthermore, if I position before "one" and press "numbered list", the up,
down and left arrows all work, but the right arrow doesn't.
