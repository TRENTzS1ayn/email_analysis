I am having fun figuring out why this bug exists ... it appears to
be an inheritance one .......
I have an ordered list nested within an unordered list
   the ordered list is styled for decimal
  the unordered list is styled for an image .......
and also an unordered list nested within an unordered list
   the nested list is styled as undecorated
   the nesting list has an image styling

in msie, netscape, and opera, the image overrides the inner styling
even though they are for different structures.... is it because of inheritance 
or because both structures use li and confusion reigns ????
it also overrides the nested styling --- way wrong!!

Amaya avoids this problem by not allowing list styles to have images
in spite of the recommendation    ;-[   ;-[   ;-[ 
and if amaya adds image capability, will they end up with same problem!
There is no way that one structuring should interfere so badly with another.

Also Amaya continues to use default bullets in spite of the request for 
list-style:none   ... once again potential errors are hidden by real errors ;-] ;-]
