When saving a file to an IIS 4.0 server, the file is being saved, but Amaya
displays a "Confirm" dialog box, stating:
----

Failed to save to URL...
<can't read, only the upper half of the line is displayed>
OK

Server reason: OK

----

When reloading the page, and confirming that all changes will be lost,
displays the page with changes saved.

I've tested with other HTTP PUT tools, like AOLpress and Netscape
Communicator. Both work correct without displaying error messages.
