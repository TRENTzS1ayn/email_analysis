This is another request to alter the initial Amaya startup sequence 
to display/activate the stopsign on the iconbar.  When a user has
the homepage location set to a site that is offline for some reason
(such as my isp was today), there is only the crudest way of halting
the search (the windows three finger salute, one for bill, one for his wife
and one for the dog too!).  If the stopsign were there, it could be used and 
then a new url entered to continue working.
