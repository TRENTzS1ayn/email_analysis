Hello,

can someone tell me, wheather amaya 6.1 does support
the Viewbox concept in SVG.

I like to create a sheet in SVG placing some SVG
images in it and scale and transform those images to
fit them into the page. 

My first impression was that amaya can't do that. 

Any hints are very welcome.

regards,
Darya
