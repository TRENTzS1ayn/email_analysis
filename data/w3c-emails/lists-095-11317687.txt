Well, when Amaya does that, the server refuses to save a document with the 
MIME type
'application/xhtml+xml' because it was previously saved with the MIME type
"text/html'.
As you are aware about that, you can change the configuration parameter in 
Special/Prefenrces/Publishing to set "Use the application/xhtml+xml MIME type 
for XHTML documents".
