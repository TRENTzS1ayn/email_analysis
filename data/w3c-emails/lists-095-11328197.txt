peculiar thing happening with latest Amaya version
setting a background mage with a style element works as in
http://home.cogeco.ca/~ve3ll/am_css.htm  but not when it
is set up as part of a linked stylesheet
http://home.cogeco.ca/~ve3ll/home.htm   and zestyle.css
does the browser check the mimetype on the incoming css file
as i think the server is sending the wrong type ...
