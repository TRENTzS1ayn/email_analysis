Arrow head isn't a  predefined shape in Amaya nor in SVG.
But you draw draw it with the polygon tool.

You can also edit the source :

<polygon stroke="black" fill="black" points="233,498 243,498 238,508"/>

SVG edition is under construction. 
Drawing is often limited in a small area for now.
Im not sure to understand your problem, could you explain more precisely ?
