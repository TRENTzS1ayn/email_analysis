Dear Amaya group,

I'm classifying my bugs according to a scheme apparently introduced by Sean
B. Palmer.  His report was sent before I joined the mailing list and I
received only the reply.

The classifications are IBUG -- important bug, BUG -- bug, and FEATURE.

I'm using Amaya 4.3.2 under Windows NT 4.0 (SP5).

IBUG important bug
BUG bug
FEATURE
(Sean B. Palmer)

IBUG -- Amaya changes old code to confirm to XML without warning. This is
impolite.

IBUG -- After many cycles of searching, adding text, and reversing the
changes (i.e., trying to find the exact conditions causing an error), Amaya
freezes. (or crashes. After the crash, Amaya restored the original version.)

BUG -- In editor mode, cursor disappears just before a "<br>" at the end of
the line. This makes it difficult to see where the cursor is., particularly
on lines with only <br>

BUG -- (Interpretation error) In this code, using the cursor to move from
the second line to the first and putting a character between "</a>" and <br>
resulted in the two lines being displayed on one line.

     <a href="./legal.htm#TOP">legal on-line magazines</a><br>
     <a href="#TOP">Top of this page</a><br>

This does not occur when the cursor is moved from right to left.

BUG -- (Display error) In this code, using the cursor to move from the
second line to the first and putting a character between "</a>" and <br>
resulted in the two lines being displayed on one line.

<a href="./legal.htm#TOP">legal on-line magazines</a><br>
<a href="#TOP">Top of this page</a><br>

The page below the incorrectly interpreted line was displayed incorrectly.

BUG -- Text in cells containing more than one line is displayed overlapping
the cell below.

BUG --After several alternate searches in the main window and in the source
code window, it is no longer possible to search in first one, then in both
windows.

BUG -- A change made in the source code window can only be reversed when
this window has focus.

BUG -- typing [path]\*.htm* in "File Open"-window opens a file "*.htm*".
Amaya also attempts to save this file.

BUG -- When main and source windows are open, doubleclick on internal link
in main moves only main window cursor to the address.

BUG -- In "Creating New Elements"
     "It is a definition list (dl) containing two terms (dt) followed by a
definition (dd). To add a new paragraph within the definition (dd), put the
caret at the end (after word "terms") and hit the Enter key."

Should it be "cursor" instead of "caret"?

FEATURE -- Using ALT-TAB to change to another Amaya window does not give
this window focus, at least as far as the cursor is concerned.

FEATURE -- Amaya should/could present an empty window (instead of exiting)
after the last window is closed.

FEATURE -- In order to decide which file to open, I would find it really
useful to be able to search all files in a directory for a string.

FEATURE -- I really miss being able to open lists or activate buttons with
ALT-(underlined letter).

Yours,
R. G. McKenzie
