We thought that the meta element was useful when documents loaded locally?
Amaya does coherent things: the mime type in the meta and the http put header
are the same.
If I understand your point of view, the author chooses to create a XHTML or 
a HTML document but Amaya should not give information about the mime type. 
The server is enough intelligent to determine it by itself.
That's easier to implement for us.

What about the encoding? Servers give self-decided encodings too and that 
generates
errors when the document is saved in UTF-8 and served with ISO-8859-1.
