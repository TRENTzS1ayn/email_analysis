Hello,

I'm working for the CHIP Computer Magazine (Vogel Publishing) Polish Branch.
I've found your software quite interesting and I'd like to include it to our
cover CD, issue 07/2002.
All I need is your permission for publication of Amaya 6.1.
Would you be so kind and give me one?

Cordially,

Grzegorz Ga?ecki
