As you see we prepared all the stuff to publish XHTML documents with the right
MIME type, but as I explained before that doesn't work with current servers
as long as they don't accept to register this new MIME type.

I refuse to explain to all our users that they cannot save their documents
as long as their used server is not updated.
As soon as the new MIME type is accepted by servers Amaya will conform with 
this
new recommendation.
