Yes, but not if it wrong.

XHTML 1.1 should not be served as text/html (see
http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/NOTE-xhtml-media-types-20020430/#summary). But if
I create an XHTML 1.1 document with Amaya, it automatically adds a <meta>
for text/html.

I created a local file, and it still used text/html, even if the extension
was .xml.

No my opinion is that Amaya shouldn't give the *wrong* information about the
mime type.
