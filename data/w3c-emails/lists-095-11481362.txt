It is nothing to do with servers, it is to do with documents. Amaya creates
XHTML 1.1 documents with a <meta> for text/html. This is broken. It is
incorrect.

What's the problem with leaving off the <meta> for XHTML 1.1? The character
encoding is given in the XML declaration and the mime type can be got from
the server or file extension.

Best wishes,

Steven
