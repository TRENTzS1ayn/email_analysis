http://www.town.pelham.on.ca/council/council.htm
exhibits some unusual positioning problems
1] The text in the right column of the table bleed into the
left column. The left column is my navigation sidebar and 
set to a specfic width in style  th {width:100px}   or so.
The right column is what is left of a 780px width page....
Tested on many browsers msie, opera, net4, gecko engine
and all others did expeted. Amaya 6.1 (win98 binary) bleeds
text into navbar background....
Some other pages do not bleed but the clerk's page DOES.
One common construct to offending pages seems to be 
unordered lists .... may be pointer to where problem is.

2] unusual positioning of bullet markers when a list is 
aligned centered. This problem was reported several versions
ago but not touched yet.  This 'real' page shows issue.
