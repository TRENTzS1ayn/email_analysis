Hi Amaya Family

In what document type the figure should be drawn i.e in svg or html?

I drew in html type and when I tried to take print then Amaya misaligned all the
objects. Same happened when I took posscript print.

When I drew the same figure in svg type then it didn't print the figure and gave
garbage at the prompt. Also nothing is printed in postscript form in this case.

Oftenely when I draw  lines then Amaya does not adjust its second coordinates.
In the source file when I put the "y" coordinate of the 2nd coordinates then the
line is well adjusted.

Kindly guide me where I am making the  mistakes!

When a bug is fixed or any change in Amaya is informed over the  group mail,
then we have to download Amaya from w3.org again for reinstallation or these
changes are integerated in the Next coming version?



Regards


Aslam
