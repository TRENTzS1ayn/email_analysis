Hi Aslam,

I hpe the Amaya Team can answer your question about whether this is a bug in
amaya.

when bug fixes are announced they will be incorporated in the next version.
You can download the source and compile Amaya yourself - and in that case you
can get the latest version at any time - with bug fixes (but possibly with
other code that is being worked on and may have bugs).

For more information on this see the pages on compiling Amaya from CVS:
http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/cvs

cheers

  Hi Amaya Family

  In what document type the figure should be drawn i.e in svg or html?

  I drew in html type and when I tried to take print then Amaya misaligned all the
  objects. Same happened when I took posscript print.

  When I drew the same figure in svg type then it didn't print the figure and gave
  garbage at the prompt. Also nothing is printed in postscript form in this case.

  Oftenely when I draw  lines then Amaya does not adjust its second coordinates.
  In the source file when I put the "y" coordinate of the 2nd coordinates then the
  line is well adjusted.

  Kindly guide me where I am making the  mistakes!

  When a bug is fixed or any change in Amaya is informed over the  group mail,
  then we have to download Amaya from w3.org again for reinstallation or these
  changes are integerated in the Next coming version?



  Regards


  Aslam
