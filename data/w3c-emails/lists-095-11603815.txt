It could be a stand-alone SVG document or within a <svg> element in a HTML 
document.

If you want to control the position of your SVG elements, these elements must 
be
children of the same <svg> elements.

The page http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/ChangeLog.html lists new features and 
bugs fixes
in the CVS version. Obviously these new things are included in the next public 
release.
