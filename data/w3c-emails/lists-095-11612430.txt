When using integrals in Amaya with mathML, the integral signs are displayed
properly on the screen but not on print: they appear a few centimeters (i.e
several rows!) below when printed. I'm using Amaya 6.1 on Win95 and the
printer is HP laserjet 4 plus. Has this been reported before, or is it
something with my setup?
Regards
Kris
