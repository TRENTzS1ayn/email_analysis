 Ciao  a tutti!

I'm using amaya 6.1 both GTK and ELF
I've found two problems
* - with GTK version when I select a phrase or a word with the mouse to
change style or color at the end of the change I see a background tag inside
the code and a "something-like-white" color as background of the word or
paragraph I selected. I have to remove the tag background to have the
original color.
* - Both GTK and ELF: select a period between <span> and </span> tags. Avoid
to copy the last > of </span> then save the job an try to open your file.
Amaya crashes,


Ciao.  Stefano             - wmw -
