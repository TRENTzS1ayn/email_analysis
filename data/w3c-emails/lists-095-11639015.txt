http://home.cogeco.ca/~ve3ll/stamp1.htm  illustrates another case of
Amaya's inability to get measurements correct. This time it is a very 
simple 5x5 table with cell widths speced at .75in.  No ambiguity or
relative measures to fuss with.  but print the document and measure!!!

An interesting point is that Amaya does not print the contents which is
what i wanted as i made the color white, background white.
All other browsers print the contents in black even though the specs says
white.   all browsers broken on simple document    but in different ways...

If simple documents fail, i wonder what happens with more complex ones ???
