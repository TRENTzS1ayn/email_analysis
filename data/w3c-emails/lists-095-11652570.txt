Hello!

<http://schneegans.de/temp/amaya-bom> is labeled as
"application/xhtml+xml; charset=utf-8" and contains a BOM. A BOM is is
allowed in UTF-8 encoded XML entities, at least
<http://www.w3.org/XML/xml-V10-2e-errata#E22> is absolutely clear in
this aspect.

However, Amaya 6.1 complains about a "Not Well-Formed XML document" and
points at the BOM. When reloading this document as HTML, the U+FEFF
character becomes part of the character data of the document. This
behaviour should be fixed.
