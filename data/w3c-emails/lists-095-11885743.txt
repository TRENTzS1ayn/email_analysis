A 404 Page not found response is a real page (it is only IE that provides its
own page for this, removing the possibility for Web servers to provide some
site-specific useful information). So you can edit this page and save it.
Alternatively, you can already fix the link - there is no need to have an
extra dialogue getting in the way before you do that.

So I would prefer that this is not changed.

Cheers
