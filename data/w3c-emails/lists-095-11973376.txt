Is there a way to speed up the rendering and creation of tables.  I have a
very fast system and creation of a 5x45 table takes a long time.  I am sure
there is some sort of code cleaning somewhere that can be done to speed this
up.  This is the only drawback I have seen while using Amaya.  It has in the
past taken so long that Amaya seems to hang.
