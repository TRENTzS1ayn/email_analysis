Hmmm. This is tricky, because this is normal, desirable behaviour in a Unix
system. It means I can apply one attribute to several different elements in a
row with out changing between windows.

It sounds like Amaya is taking over some of the functions that it should be
leaving to the window manager - in particular how to change focus.

Cheers

  Description:
  If someone clicks somewhere outside the attribute box, the attribute is not
  inserted in the correct location and where the insertion point is receives
  what looks like a line break.

  Steps to reproduce:
  1. Start Amaya.
  2. Open an HTML document to edit.
  3. Highlight an anchor element.
  4. Click Attributes > type.
  5. Click somewhere else in the document (outside attributes dialog.)
  6. Type something in for the attribute and apply and confirm it.
  7. Check the attributes of the anchor.  The type attribute is not present.
  8. Look where the insertion point was, there is some extra spacing, but no
  attribute.
