Having a browse button for the attributes is a neat feature, and I
support the request, but I don't think of it as ihgh priority.

Being able to make URIs relative or absolute is a good thing. In addition,
when saving as, it should be possible to select whether relative URIs, URIs
with the same root (i.e. /some/path/starting/with/ as opposed to
../../some/path/with/dots or some/plain/path) and absolute URIs are
transformed with more granularity.

Turning the "transform URIs" into a dialog that selected these, and possibly
allowed the three to be selected differently  for image and object data,
should be workable as a User Interface.

cheers

  relative being the default.
