To help track bugs, their priorities, what it affects, etc., I think a
system such as Bugzilla or Bugzero would be useful.  I believe Bugzilla is
free at the Mozilla web site.  If it is not, Bugzero is free at
http://www.websina.com/bugzero.  We could even classify reports as bugs or
feature requests, assign them priorities, etc.
