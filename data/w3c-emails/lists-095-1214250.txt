Yes, I did read that section.  However, we install packages in an area
that is cross mounted to lots of different architectures.  One
implication is that we put the source in one place and install the
results of the build somewhere else (using the --prefix and
--exec-prefix options on configure).

But, just to make sure, I tried going to the source tree and doing
what the web page says:
           cd /swl/tmp/Thot/Amaya
   mkdir Linux-2.2-ppc
   cd Linux-2.2-ppc
   ../configure

I get what sounds like an error from config:
"Nor Amaya nor Thot package found, get the corresponding archive"

As expected, when I run make with the above config I get:
  make[1]: *** [libThotEditor.a] Error 1

The prerequisite listed on the web page don't say anything about
needing to install thot first. And, they don't say anything about how
to point to thot if it is installed.

   As explained in http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Autoconf.html due to 
   configuration files (like unix-thot.rc) needed by Amaya compilers you have to 
   build the application in a subdirectory of the Amaya hierarchy
   mkdir Linux-2.2-ppc
   cd Linux-2.2-ppc
   ../configure
