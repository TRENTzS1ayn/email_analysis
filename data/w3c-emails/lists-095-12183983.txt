I have had a couple of private requests for this too.

I have not yet built Amaya from CVS, , and have not built the 5.3  release,
but if I do build a new version I will make it available to be redistributed.
Note that at the moment I have been building the Motif version. Also, I am
not sure how fussy the builds are about libraries and things. I presume the
Amaya team knows more about this <grin/>

cheers

Charles

  I would also like to have Mac OS X builds. Would you make Macintosh
  distributions (just like Windows and UNIX) in the future?
