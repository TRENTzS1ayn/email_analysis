As I said, this could be the user's option.  I don't copy and paste often,
but I do happen to stumble upon bugs that make Amaya crash fairly often.
This has caused trouble in the past.  I also work on  at least two documents
at once usually.  Usually the file linked to and the linking file.  If I
have made changes in both windows and one window crashes, the whole thing is
gone.  Amaya's recovery system does not seem to protect multiple documents.
