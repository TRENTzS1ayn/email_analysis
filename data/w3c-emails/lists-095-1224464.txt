Alt keys are used for the accesskey function in html documents.
Some are also used for shortcut functions in the editor....

To resolve conflicts may I suggest that editor mode be used...
Editor mode on --- invoke any shortcut assigned to an alt key.
Editor mode off -- (assume browsing) -- do accesskey if used.

This would also allow more edit shortcuts based on alt key
These may be required once more mathml pallettes available.
