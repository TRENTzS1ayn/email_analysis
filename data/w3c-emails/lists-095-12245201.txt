Yep, me too. And a "copy as" to match. But this is not a common use case I
don't think (although I don't have the ability to do it so I am not sure).

For example, when copying from Amaya to Amaya it is useful to copy "as is"
but it would be useful to be able to copy a fragment as source, and then
paste it into a different application. Or copy some source from another
application, and then paste it into Amaya as a fragment (although this can be
done by opening the source window, it would be a useful side effect of a
copy-as mechanism I think).

Cheers

Charles
