How about the ability to add custom markup.  This could be done by
surrounding the markup with two comments like:
<!--Amaya custom markup begin--><$BlogDate><!--Amaya custom markup end-->
The reasons for implementing this is when the file is used as a template for
another program and entries such as <$BlogDate> are replaced with
appropriate HTML code.  Another reason is to be able to use new markup
languages before Amaya supports them.
