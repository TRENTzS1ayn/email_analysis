I guess there are two approaches to this.

One is to support XML processing instructions - Amaya should be able to
handle that already, but I forget if it does yet. Some languages like PHP use
these - other template programs look for things in XML comments (e.g.
Apache's Server Side Includes, I think), which are already supported.

the other approach is to have a generic XML-capable editor, which is in
progress...

  How about the ability to add custom markup.  This could be done by
  surrounding the markup with two comments like:
  <!--Amaya custom markup begin--><$BlogDate><!--Amaya custom markup end-->
  The reasons for implementing this is when the file is used as a template for
  another program and entries such as <$BlogDate> are replaced with
  appropriate HTML code.  Another reason is to be able to use new markup
  languages before Amaya supports them.
