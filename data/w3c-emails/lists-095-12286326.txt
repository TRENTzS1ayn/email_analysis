Is it possible to create make files for GNU compiler.  I use it on a Win32
machine and make does not read the compilers.dsw, etc.  I am currently
trying to compiler using cygwin and it appears to be working (except I still
need to download X11, but I want to be able to compile a WinNT/2000 version,
not a UNIX version.

I have tried the UNIX instructions and the Windows instructions.  No success
yet.

Thank you for any help and sorry for the crosspost.  I had sent a message
regarding this to one of the lists before, but I forget which.
