> I am teaching a web page authoring module to undergraduate students and would like to use Amaya as an example of a suitable aid to editing.  I would like specific permission from you to mount the program on my departmental intranet for open access to up to say 20 students (which I can limit through our control software).

Thanks for the information.
As explained in our Web page  http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-soft
ware.html you have the permission to use and copy Amaya and its documentation 
without fee or royalty.
