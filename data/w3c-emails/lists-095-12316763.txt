Greetings,
     In writing some tutorial material for a course in a page headed -
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?>
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EN"
    "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11.dtd">
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

I used the following example -

(<code><em><strong>work out from the above what the data type for this text
might be!</strong></em></code>)

     Mmmmm!  Although the structure display shows the tags correctly, the
page display makes no change from the parentheses to the contents.  I would
expect an italic bold monospaced font!  At the very least a mono-space font
if there were no italic bold variant.  In practice, since there is usually
an italic variant of a mono-spaced font then I would expect an italic
mono-spaced result.  My configuration, however, has no monospaced italic
bold font.  I certainly did not expect a completely unchanged text display.
For all other browsers I have tested on a couple of machines I get the
result in accordance with my reading of the reference recommendation -
which I give below.

     My reading of the reference documents suggests that a tag shall be
ignored if it cannot be obeyed - not all three tags in a row when the first
two -can- be obeyed.

                Regards,

                        Keith
