As I understand it this would be easy with Bugzilla, which has a feature to
track things as "requested Features" rather than existing bugs. Actually I
think there is an Amaya wishlist page somewhere, but I haven't looked for it
in a long while. (The other benefit of Bugzilla would be that it saves the
Amaya team from spending their time updating web pages, and lets them
concentrate on the work they are doing.)

cheers

  Perhaps a requested features page could be created so that people can check
  it before requesting a feature.  This way, Amaya developers do not get
  multiple requests for the same feature.
