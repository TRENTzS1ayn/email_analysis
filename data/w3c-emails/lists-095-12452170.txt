Certainly it is a possibility - the question is where to integrate it?

It would be useful to be able to run tidy over content that is imported into
Amaya. At the moment Amaya tries to do error correction on pages so it can
render them. It would be good if there were more detail available about what
it has changed, and if it was integrated it should be possible to use the
resources of the Amaya team for something else, and leave the development of
error correction to the Tidy project.

As an alternative, it might be useful to be able to run tidy over a source
view of a document.

In either case, maybe it should be possible to attach it via the
edit->transformations menu. It has some neat functions like removing font
tags and converting them to stylesheet rules that would be good to have in
Amaya (maybe this function could be attached via the styles menu seperately).

It might also be a good example of how to use Tidy in another program.

Note that Amaya produces valid output anyway.

cheers

  Since Tidy is written in C as well, is integration of HTML Tidy with Amaya a
