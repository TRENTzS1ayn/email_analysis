Does anybody else think better window titles would be useful?  Here is what
I mean (if web site title was "W3C"):
Standard view: "W3C"
Structure view: "W3C - Structure View"
Alternate view: "W3C - Alternate View"
etc.

I personally work with more than one view of a document open at once and
with all windows having the same title, it is difficult to figure out which
is structure view, etc.
