I don't think a strong integration is necessary. As Amaya works always on 
local
temporary files, these files can be processed by Tidy first. Any Amaya 
contributor
can work on that integration. He has to add the launching of Tidy at the right 
time.
But that will generate some problems because in this case the document 
displayed by
Amaya won't be the original document. Errors will be fixed without feedback
and the document tree will be altered so existing and new generated annotations
will be broken.
