  Does anybody else think better window titles would be useful?  Here is what
  I mean (if web site title was "W3C"):
  Standard view: "W3C"
  Structure view: "W3C - Structure View"
  Alternate view: "W3C - Alternate View"
  etc.

  I personally work with more than one view of a document open at once and
  with all windows having the same title, it is difficult to figure out which
  is structure view, etc.
