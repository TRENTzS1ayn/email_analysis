i applied the attribute mathbackground to the tag math in some markup
Amaya colored the work as appropriate but the IBM TechExplorer did
not.  The ibm consultant responsible for TE stated that mathbackground
could only be applied to a small subset of presentation elements and
said to bracket my work with mstyle and include the attribute there.
That practice worked for both Amaya and TE but what i am concerned with
is that obviously Amaya thinks math can have the attribute and IBM 
think not.  If the specification is unclear maybe someone should let
the writers at w3 know!!!    And in Amaya interp is wrong, maybe it
will indicate a parse error in next go round.... but of course if it is 
correct, maybe it is time to hassle ibm.....
and on a similar note , amaya does a better job of applying correct
glyphs to the math entities.  TE (intro edition) relies on existing 
windows fonts so many basic glyphs are not there. what is worse
is that some are done incorrectly....  Amaya does glyphs correctly
if they are aware and are working to add the missing ones ... good stuff!!!!!
