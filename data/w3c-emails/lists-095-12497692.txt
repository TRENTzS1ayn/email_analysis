Just another quick question....Is it possible to alter the value of a text
box, and save the change using the WYSIWYG interface?

What I need to do is take an HTML document and send it to my 'customer'.
They need to fill out the HTML document, save it, and send it back to me.
I'll then 'submit' the modified HTML document to a database where all of
the information that the customer provided is captured.

The HTML document requires a user to fill in text boxes, check checkboxes,
and fill in text areas.  While using Amaya, I can check the checkboxes and
fill in the text areas, saving the changes without issue.  But, when I
change the 'value' of a text field via the WYSIWYG interface, the change
isn't reflected in the HTML.

Am I doing something wrong?  Will Amaya do this?  If not, is there anyother
application, other than MS Word, that will do this?

Thanks.
