ONE:
I have used the special / general toolbar item to deselect
image download.... however the images continue to download.
TWO:
and i deliberately changed image name so that it would not be
found. However Amaya did not display the alt attribute, which
defeats thepurpose of forcingone to use it.... 

both are serious errors, one because it removes the ability to
stop downloading on slow connections, and two because it
interfers with accessibility.

another issue i have is how to set the text color for the 
alt attribute when it is part of a anchor.
  On one of my sites it is showing as white on white
unless hovered over and then it shows correctly as red.
This is not an amaya issue (see above as amaya gives nil)
but since many here are skilled css coders, they may be able to help
