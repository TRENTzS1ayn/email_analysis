-- found my problem with color of alt stuff. as it was nested
inside an anchor, the anchor properties were overriding.
so i used a new class with anchor pseudos to cope with color.

However I now see a problem with how a jpeg file is getting
resized.  I have a large jpeg that i set a width="150" on in
the image tag.   The width scales ok, but the height stays
as the original.  Other browsers maintain the ratio and scale
the height according to the scale used for width.  Which 
method of scaling is correct?? Is this a browser error  or
is yet another hole in the html recommendation. 
for a look at the effect  check with several browsers ;-]
