The status page for where Amaya's handling of CSS
 is very informative.
Could the development team document the status 
of (X)HTML in the same manner.  This would reduce 
redundant reports of known issues.  Once again 
with a small team, not all items can be handled and
some form of triage/ priority setting is going on but
documentation of status will let us know what we 
can expect (other than using the discovery method that is)
Thanks and keep up the good work on Open Software. ta
