Works ok in all browsers tested EXCEPT Amaya

http://www.town.pelham.on.ca/cao    
should redirect to /cao/cao.htm   off of /cao/index.htm
but doesn't .... clicking on manual link gets you there though
(as a workaround)

but this brings up another issue.   
body class="dark"   and
a class="dark"  not doing what they should
screen display looks like default body and a element from
my css sheet not the class specs!
