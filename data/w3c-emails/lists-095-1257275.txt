just did a copy to buffer of my parse error view.

Issue 1: where did all the line feeds go --- sure makes 
it difficult to read. intention was to have parse errors
readable for group to analyse problems...

Issue 2: certain math entities are not supported. is this
because the font set you provide doesn't have the glyphs yet
--- this is TE problem in that they use a windows provided set
which is incomplete.....
or are these entities that have been missed accidentally. if so
i can help by finding others that require interpretation asap.

and the embed error is because my demo page is also for 
IBM TechExplorer which needs embed to cope with ancient
browsers like netscape 4.
