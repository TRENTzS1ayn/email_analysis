Hello, I am looking at using Amaya in a rollout that we have planned for
late spring and the problem that I am running into is not really of
functionality but of looks.  It looks like heck on the NCD diskless
xterms that will be using it.  For example, instead of the background
being grey, it is purple.  I was wondering if there is a way to
configure it to use fewer colors and work in basically a VGA mode. 
Thanks!
