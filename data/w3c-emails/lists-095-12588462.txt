A nice solution would be to copy lynx. It provides the link at the top of the
page, like it and Amaya  do for frames - something like

Refresh: URI http://example.com/target ; 0 seconds

where the URI is also a hyperlink. meta refreshes are horrid things, but they
are common and it would make it easier to use Amaya as a browser.

  a class="dark"  not doing what they should
  screen display looks like default body and a element from
