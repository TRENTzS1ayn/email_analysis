Unfortunately the CSS specification must be preserved if 
height is set to auto.  Please refer to 
http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS1#width

and as test examples of not happening for gif and jpg  check out

or

for a real world example! -- the town crest is distorted.

I think the behaviour here is correct. If you wanted to scale it you would
use width and height explicitly (since there is no "scale" attribute). Being
able to set only one is a common use case for making single pixel images 
into
lines - not nice but not unreasonable really.

  -- found my problem with color of alt stuff. as it was nested

  so i used a new class with anchor pseudos to cope with color.

  However I now see a problem with how a jpeg file is getting
  resized.  I have a large jpeg that i set a width="150" on in
  the image tag.   The width scales ok, but the height stays
  as the original.  Other browsers maintain the ratio and scale
  the height according to the scale used for width.  Which
  method of scaling is correct?? Is this a browser error  or
  is yet another hole in the html recommendation.
  for a look at the effect  check with several browsers ;-]
