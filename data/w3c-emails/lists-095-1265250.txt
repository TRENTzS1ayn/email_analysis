http://www.w3.org/Math/testsuite/Characters/a.xhtml
and similarly named files will quickly show mathml 2.0
character enties still requiring font glyphs. I am hoping
that the next edition of Amaya will add many of these,
 especially those related to Calculus and Physics formulae.
 That would allow user browsing of existing docs
 converted from latex while the authoring interface is perfected.
