I would expect that it would be more logical to do possibly split C into two
steps:

2. bbbb
3. BBBB

and then

2. bbbb
3. |
4. BBBB

Reason: It is a simple Enter to create a new list item when cursor is at
beginning of line and is already implemented.  Cursor would be at beginning
of line in my step C.  I also think someone is more likely to immediately
make something like this a new list item immediately before they insert a
new list item in between.

Thanks, though.
