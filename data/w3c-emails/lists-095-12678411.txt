Hi,

I found a bug in the GUI part for MathML.

Create a MathML document

Click the matrix tool.
Click Cancel
Between the parentheses, Amaya generates a 2*2 matrix:

<mtable><mtr><mtd></mtd><mtd></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd></mtd><mtd></mtd></mtr></mtable>

In other terms, Cancel is taken as Confirm.

If you change the matrix dimension prior to Cancel, the dimensions are validated
too.
----------
Something else: when creating a MathML document, the Math panel should probably be
opened automatically. Same remark for SVG documents and the Graphics panel.
----------
Something else, although I suppose it's a long-standing enhancement request: it
would be greatly helpful if Amaya kept a history list (MRU list), to be able to
reopen recent documents.
