In this case Amaya doesn't know if the toggle off applies to
the last displayed document or to all documents.
As long as Amaya doesn't register the last displayed documents,
it doesn't keep in mind the previous state of the editor mode.
Meanwhile if you want to use Amaya as a browser only, you can 
change the Special/Preferences/Profiles/ and select Browser.
Amaya keeps that preference.
