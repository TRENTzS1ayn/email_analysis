Thanks Irene, the profiles settings cover exactly what 
I wanted to do.  But now a bit of work for the documentation
writing crew ... The help section does not explain
the difference between profiles, especially between
editor and MINI editor ,   browser and MINI browser. 
A quick answer here  for me   but then
it should be added to configure.html  on next go around. 
thanks again
