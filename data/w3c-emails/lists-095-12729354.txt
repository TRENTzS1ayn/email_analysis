OK, but as I understood the question it was based on setting the width/height
in HTML, not in CSS.

  I think the behaviour here is correct. If you wanted to scale it you would
  use width and height explicitly (since there is no "scale" attribute). Being
  able to set only one is a common use case for making single pixel images
  into
  lines - not nice but not unreasonable really.

    so i used a new class with anchor pseudos to cope with color.

    However I now see a problem with how a jpeg file is getting
    resized.  I have a large jpeg that i set a width="150" on in
    the image tag.   The width scales ok, but the height stays
    as the original.  Other browsers maintain the ratio and scale
    the height according to the scale used for width.  Which
    method of scaling is correct?? Is this a browser error  or
    is yet another hole in the html recommendation.
    for a look at the effect  check with several browsers ;-]
