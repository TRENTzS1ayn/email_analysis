It would be helpful if Amaya could be set not to download images (does it
cache them?). It would also be very helpful if the alt/title/longdesc were
more easily available in the formatted view instead of only the alternative
view.

This could be achieved with CSS if a few of the CSS2 selectors and properties
were implemented, which could also be used for showing things like targets.

  defeats thepurpose of forcingone to use it....

  both are serious errors, one because it removes the ability to
  stop downloading on slow connections, and two because it
  interfers with accessibility.

  another issue i have is how to set the text color for the
  alt attribute when it is part of a anchor.
    On one of my sites it is showing as white on white
  unless hovered over and then it shows correctly as red.
  This is not an amaya issue (see above as amaya gives nil)
  but since many here are skilled css coders, they may be able to help
