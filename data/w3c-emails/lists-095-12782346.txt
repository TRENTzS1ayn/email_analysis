Hello Mark

In fact, there are two things.
First, the public Amaya releases until now (including Amaya 5.3) didn't treat 
the CDATA tag and only its content was preserved and attached to the parent 
element. The current CVS version of Amaya preserves this tag and its content 
and creates a specific element in the document tree (for XML documents only).
The second thing is that script languages are not (yet) supported in Amaya, so 
they are not executed.
