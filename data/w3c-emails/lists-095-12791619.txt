Laurent;
    Thanks for your note. I am fairly new to Amaya and so was not aware
that, as you and John Russell pointed out, Amaya did not yet support any
scripting languages. I had dark inklings of suspicion, but that was all. The
naturally arising questions are: Do you or anyone here know when or if
scripting languages will be supported, and if so, which language? Again,
thanks.
                                                       - Mark
