Looking at the original post, I had thought you originally asked why scripts
were not executing in Amaya - which Laurent answered by saying that wasn't
implemented yet. Scripts are useful because they make documents interactive
- in other words, the state of the document changes over time. Editing a
moving target is an awkward challenge, but some documents depend on their
script components in order to present properly, so editing them without
scripts active is awkward also.

Did you only want Amaya to execute scripts when not in editing mode?

Python is designed to be embedded in things, and I like the stuff.
