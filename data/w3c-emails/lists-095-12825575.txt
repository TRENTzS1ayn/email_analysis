    Obviously there has been a HUGH amount of mis-communication and behind
it all is that we come at the same thing differently - you from a GUI
environment and me from a console environment. What you are explaining I
already know, but the structure of Amaya to function primarily as a GUI
interface is not going to be useful to me at all - to many others,  'yes' it
will be useful. Best of luck in your development.
