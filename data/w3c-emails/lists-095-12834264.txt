Amaya is quite nice, and I will be experimenting with using it.
 
One thing I notice, it does not support any of the 'wheel' equipped mice
I use. Scrolling up and down long pages is quite nice and easy to do
with a wheel, and it helps me avoid the onset of carpal tunnel syndrome
symptoms.
 
Please don't take offense, but it is something that I think would be
nice for those 'browse-a-holics' like me that also want to edit their
remote pages.
 
Thanks for such an innovative and insightful tool.
