If you selected an element instead of a simple text Amaya generated
an id instead of an anchor.
We decided that policy because many browsers don't support links to id
and our users want to generate compatible pages.
In any case if Amaya generated at the same time a name and an id when a
link has to be generated we have to decide to use either the name or the id.

Amaya looks for the first word longer than 3 characters then checks
if this name or id is already used in the document. If it's used it
adds a code at the end and rechecks.
