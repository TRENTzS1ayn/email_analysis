Perhaps I wasn't clear; I'm not talking about which attribute
Amaya puts the anchor name in. It seems to choose well enough.

I'm talking about the fact that it chose "2000" as an anchor name,
but "2000" is not an XML ID.

Some part of Amaya knows this, because it didn't just copy "2000"
from the name attribute to the id attribute; it added a _.

Please just add the _ in the first place, i.e.
<a name="_2000">

Please check that it's an XML ID at this point.
