I tried saving the page to disk, and it hangs all the same. It displays the title of
the page, a white area for the first IFRAME, the load messages for the CSS files,
and stops there, whatever the name under which the file is saved.

Before anyone asks, here are the headers returned by a request to that page. They
look normal, don't they ?
(the wrapping on the PICS label is in the mail client, not the headers).
