I downloaded the tarball, and built amaya using
gnu make and gcc 2.95.

There was one error, however, and there were
78 warnings.  The error was on the second
entry into annotlib.  The first entry built
the .depends file, and then on the second
entry I got the messages:

External structure html
Recursive element Thread_item
Recursive element TI_content
Allowed only in section DEFAULT

*** ERR 1
APPLICATION HTML
            *
Cannot load structure schema

Then, on the next call to gcc, I get

gcc: ../../annotlib/../amaya/HTMLAPP.c: No such file or directory
gcc: No input files
*** make[1]: [../amaya/HTML.h] Error 1

Even so, after five minutes of browsing Amaya (using Amaya and Netscape)
I haven't run into any problems.  I looked for the files

amaya/HTMLAPP.c
and
amaya/HTML.h

and, sure enough, they were not there.  Can't help but feel that there is
something missing, though.

Is anybody worried about the 78 warnings?
