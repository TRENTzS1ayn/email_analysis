I am wondering if any changes are required to the source code
of Amaya to compile it on both linux and windows o/s.
Which compilers are used in each system and what areas
must be isolated and touched up....

I am wondering about this because of my experience with tcl/tk 
which is scripting language that provides gui interface and has
a compiler that make executables for both linux and windows
without alteration of the source code. 

If I knew where you find that c source must be isolated, i could
then check whether the tcl/tk approach has avoided this by
its language definition or if it is not truly cross compilable from
a single source....  hints on issues requested please  
thanks  john russell   niagara region, canada
