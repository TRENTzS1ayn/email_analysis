Hi Dany,

It's difficult to say immediately if it's a amaya or a jigedit bug. We need
more information to find the origin of the bug. The best would be to have a
document that always generates the bug, but that could be a dream.
In any case point us to the document that caused the trouble. We will try to 
save it in a temporary directory on the server available for testing this kind 
of things.
