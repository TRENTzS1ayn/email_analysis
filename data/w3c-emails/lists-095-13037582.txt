Hi Irene,

I believe that the doc on which it happened was

http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent/Group/Drafts/WD-PPWG-RF-Policy-20020208

but I fixed the source manually, so I don't know if there will be any
evidence left. As I recall, when the file was damaged the end looks
something like:

<hr />
<p>$Id:

I added back the </body></html> and all was well.

Next time this happens, I'll try to save the document in its buggy form.

Best,

Danny
