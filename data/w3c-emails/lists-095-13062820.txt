Hi,

I have problems creating links with Amaya 5.3 in a XHTML 1.1 document, but I have not problems in a  XHTML 1.0 document. 
In a XHTML 1.0 document, when I click the target icon with the hand, the link is always created. But in a XHTML 1.1 document, when I click the target icon, Amaya opens an Attribute window.

Perhaps the problem is that the hand that creates the link is waiting for a "name" attribute, and in XHTML 1.1 there is only an "id" attribute in an anchor.

I use a Windows 98 SE computer.

Best regards,
Barto
