So I tried my "troubleshooter's hat" on I reduced the file to

<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" 
"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd" >
<html>
<head>
<title>Amaya bug ?</title>

</head>
<body>
hello, world
</body>
</html>

which no longer hangs but produces the error message

"document coding unknown or undefined - see the log file."

but I ran out of experience with "log files" so don't know where to turn?
Has someone placed hidden characters in there to test our mettle? Is God 
playing a trick on us?

Stay tuned.
