I have had this problem with Amaya 5.2 not making links to targets that only
have an id.

But maybe it has been fixed already in the CVS version?

  Hello Barto,

  I don't have this problem with my version. The only time I have the Attribute
  window in this case is when I click slightly beside the target icon.
  What is the message of the opened Attribute window ?
