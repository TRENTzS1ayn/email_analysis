This form:

style="{ background-color: red ; }"

makes no sense; there's no selector, so there should be no brackets.

To ease analysis of the problem, I've managed to reduce the page size and
still keep
the problem.

This 11-lines page is W3C-validated for both XHTML1.0 and CSS, and freezes
Amaya.
    http://www.osinet.fr/code/amaya.htm

This one with just 5 characters changed does not freeze Amaya.
    http://www.osinet.fr/code/amayanofreeze.htm

If I understand CSS correctly (questionable issue), this probably points to
a bug in
Amaya., because both forms should be correct. And anyway, the CSS validator
accepts
both.
