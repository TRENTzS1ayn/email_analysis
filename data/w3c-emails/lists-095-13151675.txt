I was wondering if anyone else on this list has tried using 5.3 for
Linux on a diskless xterminal?  It works fine for me on the server
console and via VNC but it will not work on the xterminal (NCD HMX or
ThinStar).  5.2 will start on the xterminal but some things like the
input fields (where you insert the URI to browse, etc.) are far to short
to display the text (the boxes themselves are fine but I can only see
half the middle part of the letters in /myinstalldirectory/Amaya...)

The error from 5.3 is:
*** Amaya: Irrecoverable error ***
