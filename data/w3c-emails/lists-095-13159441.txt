Since next Amaya release is set for next month, I am resending the following
major bug in the hopes that it is fixed in the next version:

Platform:
PC

OS:
WinXP

Version:
5.3

Problem Description:
In a new CSS Style Sheet, it is possible to back space and the file name
becomes part of the file.

Reproducibility:
Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Amaya.
2. Click File > New > New CSS style sheet???.
3. Click Confirm.
4. Press BACKSPACE 3 times.

Actual Results:
The file name becomes part of the document.

Expected Results:
This behavior should not occur.

Other Information:
This is also possible with existing style sheets, HTML files (source view).
I did not test MML, SVG, or other file types.
