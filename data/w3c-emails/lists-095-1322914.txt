Both the validator at w3.org and tidy fail to detect errors
of the type style="{color:red}"  form.  Amaya hangs up rather
than treating it as a parse error.   and it was a toughy to track down!

Can the three tools be repaired to trap this type of error.
i am not suggesting making Amaya tolerant but it should
detect and issue warning rather than hanging.
