Hello,

> Is the DOCTYPE supposed to be deletable? 
Yes it is but the issue is that the document has to be parsed to interpret the 
content of the doctype. If you delete/modify it through the 'source view' and 
then synchonize the document, your modification is taken into account. If you 
delete the doctype through the 'structure view', it is removed from the 
document but its meaning still remain.
We are currently working on a new command that allows the author to 
dynamically create/modify/delete a doctype.

You are right. This bug is in my todo list and I hope to fix it for the next 
release.
