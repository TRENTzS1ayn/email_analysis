I suggest you first to have a look at the Developer's corner in
http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-amaya-970220.html
and the Introduction to Amaya: http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Overview.html

The whole organization of the code is explained in 
http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Sources.html
The Amaya code is based on a editing/formating library thotlib (+ tablelib). 
This library is split in sub-directories and modules. Module names give an 
idea of included
functions. In any case all external functions of a module are listed in the 
file
Amaya/thotlib/internals/f/module_f.h. Functions exported by the thotlib are 
listed in
Amaya/thotlib/include/*.h and are documented in "The Thot API manual".

I hope this help.
