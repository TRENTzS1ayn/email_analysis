I don't know if it's defined as an error by the CSS and (X)HTML
recommendations (is one allowed curly brackets in attribute values?
certainly square brackets seem to be allowed); I'm sure there must be folks
at W3 lurking about who will know.  But the brackets are unnecessary and not
standard practice.
