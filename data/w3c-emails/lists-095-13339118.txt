When I click Style>Format the language/abbreviations
are unfamiliar to me.  I have put a screenshot at
http://computercentral-1.com/screenshot.html 

It is easy enough to see what they do but can someone
tell me if this is correct?  I have checked the
settings I could find and they all indicate en.  Have
I missed something?  How do I change this to US
english if it is not correct?

I installed using gmake and gtk on Mandrake 8.1

Thanks,
John Little
