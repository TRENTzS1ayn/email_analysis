I am compiling Amaya 5.3 on a standard SuSE Linux 7.1.  

<Make all> fails with many messages like those below.  I have no Xm 
subdirectory.  Though I do have an Xmu subdirectory:

/usr/X11R6/include/X11/Xmu

that seems to contain most of the *.h files that are being sought.  I checked 
the archives and nsood@mitre.org had this same problem, except he was on 
Solaris rather than Linux.  No one replied to him.
