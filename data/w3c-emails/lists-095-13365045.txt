Amaya normally install fonts that display icons instead of characters.
It seems that it cannot installed these fonts on your font server. That
occurs with X-terminals because fonts should be installed on the 
X-terminal server and not the X-terminal itself.
If it's the case you can request your system manager to install Amaya fonts
(directory Amaya/fonts).

The joined picture display the form has you should see it.
