Hi all

To pre-sort the mails I receive, my mailbox automatically sorts mail on
their origin. For maillists, I have a mailbox per list. Some mails from the
amaya list end up in my amaya-mailbox but about the same number of mails
arive in my inbox. Currently the filter for amaya is on www-amaya@w3.org in
the header. What should be changed or added to recognize all mails from
Amaya? If there is no such thing, can the mail list server be adapted to
include a recognition thing?

For other maillists either the address of the maillist is in the to: or cc:
fields or there is a keyword in the subject.

Thanks,

CBee
