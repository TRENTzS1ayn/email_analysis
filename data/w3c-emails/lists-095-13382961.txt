Hi,

Your filter must not be taking into account all cases of the To: field.
if it uses www-amaya@w3.org it should work. Otherwise, try other headers:

X-Loop: www-amaya@w3.org
Resent-From: www-amaya@w3.org

(Does this question really belongs to this list? It should go to the
mailing list of the filtering tool that you use :)
