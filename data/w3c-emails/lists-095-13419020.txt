Hi Irene,

That fixed it.  If anyone else needs it here is the
procedure that I used:

Start Mandrake Control Center click on system then
fonts.

Click Add Fonts

Browse to /usr/local/Amaya/fonts.  This should show a
list of fonts.  Mine were grayed out.  Click ok.

This should bring a list box showing icones.pcf. 
Click install all.

Click Strong verification.

The system will ask to create a directory at
/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts called pcf_drakfont.  Click
ok.

The system will make the directory and install the
font.  The next time you start Amaya the icons should
show in the Style>Format dialogue box.

Best regards,
John Little
