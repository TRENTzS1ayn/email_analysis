Yes, Jose -
I thinmk this question DOES belong on this list ... I can filter to my 
heart's content, but if s.t. is showing in my "in-box / new mail folder"
I'd REALLY lkike to KNOW that it is from this list and not just more 
SPAM !

My preference would be for the server to add 
[amaya]   to the subject line ... but sometime ago Irene said that was 
NOT an option .... maybe it is, NOW ?

Hi,

Your filter must not be taking into account all cases of the To: field.
if it uses www-amaya@www.org it should work. Otherwise, try other headers:

X-Loop: www-amaya@w3.org
Resent-From: www-amaya@w3.org

(Does this question really belongs to this list? It should go to the
mailing list of the filtering tool that you use :)
