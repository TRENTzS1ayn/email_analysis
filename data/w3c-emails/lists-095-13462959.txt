Hi,

I found a (for me) suitable solution:

I found all messages from the amaya list have some header fields in common:
Resent-From: www-amaya@w3.org
X-Mailing-List: <www-amaya@w3.org> archive/latest/4859
X-Loop: www-amaya@w3.org
Sender: www-amaya-request@w3.org
Resent-Sender: www-amaya-request@w3.org
Precedence: list
List-Id: <www-amaya.w3.org>
List-Help: <http://www.w3.org/Mail/>
List-Unsubscribe: <mailto:www-amaya-request@w3.org?subject=unsubscribe>
Resent-To: Unlisted-recipients :;

From the above list, I use X-Loop or List-Id in my filter (yep, 2 filters)
This works since they are inserted by the amaya list engine. Which is either
a heavy reconfigured majordomo or no majordomo at all.

The next things I'd like to update:
- rearange the header so replies go to the list, and not to the originator.
- Add the real recognition header line to the list info.
- optionally, either add a tag to the subject or leave the list address in
the to: or cc: list (and disregard messages which are bcc:-ed to the list).


For the M$Outlook users, like me: With the version I have here, I can add a
filter to a header-line, It's hidden in the wizzard somewhere (Outlook
2000-sr1, version 9.0.0.xxx).

I've worked with the '97 version in the past and I recal i had similar
header-line filters but I cannot recall any details as I don't have access
to that system.


I succeeded, Success for all of you 

CBee
