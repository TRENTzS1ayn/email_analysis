Well, the code looks fine to me, and Amaya should display the internal
text...

  Some two years ago we wrote a simple page to test <object> handling.
  We were anticipating generating  XHTML display code from XSLT
  transform of  XML content, and wanted to make the result as robust as
  possible.

  http://www.ch.ic.ac.uk/chemime/tests/object/browsers/scheme2.html

  was tested against the then range of browsers, with pretty disappointing
  results. Only one browser (iCab) passed the tests. Revisiting this test
  some  20 months on, I found things certainly improving. Thus Netscape 6
  is pretty good, and now matches  iCab.

  Assuming however that  Amaya is the gold standard,
  I expected the result

  http://www.ch.ic.ac.uk/chemime/tests/object/browsers/mozilla_x.jpg

  (actually from Mozilla on  MacOS X, for which neither plugins nor
  Java are currently enabled; a situation which  I presumed matches
  Amaya precisely).

  In fact, the  latest Amaya does not perform as I had expected
  (try for  yourselves)., attempting to display the plugin and  Java,
  even though it cannot do either.

  Can anyone comment on whether in fact our code is wrong,
  whether there is a genuine  bug in Amaya, or whether the  interpretation
  is ambiguous?
