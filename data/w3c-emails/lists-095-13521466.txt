For M$InternetExploder: It's not a bug, it's a feature.
For Opera: how do you mean alternating?
For Amaya, Netscape e.a.: This is just our default stylesheet.

That's how it is (not) defined. You don't specify any style sheet. The
default stylesheet differs for every browser I check. The 2 major browsers
mimic the amaya view, except on size of the symbols. Opera shows the same
diamonds on every level.
