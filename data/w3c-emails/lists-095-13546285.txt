Hi,

the documentation for keyboard/mouse selection didn't include how to select
structures, which is a key part of using Amaya effectively. So I added it to
them, and also gave a bit of example stuff about what happens in the status
bar.

When I went to the home page the links to mailiing lists don't yet mention
the documentation list - can that be updated please?

cheers

Charles
