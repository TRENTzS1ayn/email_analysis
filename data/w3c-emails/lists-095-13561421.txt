It might be a bug in my version of Mozilla (build 2002022203/WinXP), to make
sure, could someone follow this procedure:

1. Navigate to http://www.w3.org/Amaya/.
2. Click the CVS link in the navigation column.
3. Scroll to "Configure and compile libwww".
4. Click "compile Amaya" which links to
http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/SourceDist#installation (no change occurs).
5. Click "Unix compiling section" (no change occurs).

I have recreated this in Mozilla multiple times.
