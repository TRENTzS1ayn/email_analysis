This is wild.

I'm running Netscape 4.something on Solaris.

Follow Brant's instructions and it says it has
loaded 100% in the status bar and nothing else
happens.

So I did a View/Document Source. It showed the
source for the page I was supposed to see.

Try to use Help/About to learn the version of
Netscape I'm running and end up on a Netscape.com
website (I hate that feature). Hit the Back
button. It now displays the page that should have
appeared when I clicked on "Configure and compile
libwww". (Oh, that is a different link than Brant
told me to click on.)
