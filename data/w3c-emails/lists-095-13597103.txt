They look fine for me in IE6/XP and Moz 2002022703/XP.

Only problem I see on http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/cvs.html
is on line 172, where there is an unclosed strong element.

No problems with the Autoconf.html page.

On the http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/SourceDist page, there are a elements
with no attributes at lines
88 (around "ftp Europe or US") and 151 (around the word MIT)

Maybe you've got a bad Mozilla build?
