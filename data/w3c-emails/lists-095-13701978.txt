 Hello All!

I'm currently user Amaya 5.3 ELF, yesterday downloaded the GTK version.
Two questions:
- Some messages ago someone complained about Style -> Format indications.
  well... in ELF everything is ok and I see exactly what Irene sent as an
attachment few days ago. With GTK I see what the user wrote.
- I have a web site (the URL is  below) and on some pages there are images
that are reduced via height and width statements. In ELF everything is  OK, 
in GTK the image is not reduced even if the "occupied space" by the  image
is correct.




Ciao.  Stefano             - wmw -
