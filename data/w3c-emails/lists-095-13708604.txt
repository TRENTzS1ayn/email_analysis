 Ciao  Amaya!

The below site has pages with volley championships and relative standings.
I keep them update weekly via amaya. When I've to load a page like
.../stz/IIDivisione.html I have to wait for a lot of seconds before the page
is displayed.
Another "frustrating problem" :-))) When I scroll among that page sometime
(often) everything seems blocked, then it proceeds till the next scrolling.
In my opinion it seems that tha page is not loaded in memory so amaya has to
do a lot of checks and replacements befor reaching the correct point.


Ciao.  Stefano             - wmw -
