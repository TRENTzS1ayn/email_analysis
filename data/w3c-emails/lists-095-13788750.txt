Hi,

I have a layout test page at:

http://www.osinet.fr/code/session/menulook.asp

It is validated XHTML 1.1 + CSS, and displays almost identically in O6 and IE6, but
Amaya makes it very different.

, but it works very poorly CSS-wise in Amaya, which doesn't seem to take into
account:

- float
- text-align
- color
- most (but not all) of the border properties
- font-family

Also, a:hover doesn't work, but this is a known limitation, so I don't mind it.

I thought CSS support was much better than this exhibits. Is there anything wrong
although the document validates as indicated, and could I improve its appearance in
Amaya, the most important issue being the "float: right" behaviour ?
