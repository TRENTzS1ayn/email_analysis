Hello Marta,

At the moment Amaya does not have a plugin interface, so is nota ble to
support flash. It does have some support for SVG graphics - full support for
SVG graphics will give you the ability to do the same things as flash. But I
don't think full SVG support will be available ion Amaya for a while.

cheers

people are using things - is it just me?)

  Maybe I'm just doing a stupid question.
  I've downloaded Amaya just now, and I was asking myself if the browser support flash-made pages or shockwave-made animations.
  Second question: is it possible to have more fonts to build pages?

  Thnx a lot
