It's difficult to help you because I see no reason in your message that 
explains why Amaya
works for other windows 98 users and not for you.
I remember people reported a problem with a specific version of a screen 
driver and they
fixed it by updating the driver version but I'm not sure the problem you 
reported is the
same.
