Now spelling and dictionary has hit the list, I wonder:

Does the dictonary follow some standard format?
If not: Why not? If any standard exist, a standardization group like the W3C
should follow (one of) those standards and so should a tool like Amaya.

If the dictionaries do follow a standard, include a link to this standard in
the documentation. Questions like this can be pointed to the information
with the (used) spelling and dictionary standard.

I would not add any names to the base dictionary: Names tend to vary in
spelling and names can be mixed with typo's of normal words.

Names should go in a secondary names dictionary: Names don't change when the
language changes, Names have a more defined case (first character needs to
be a capital).

You're right: THen the spellchecker can correct me on Charles since I don't
know any Charles.
