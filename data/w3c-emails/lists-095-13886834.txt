Since 5.4 is not yet released I would like to remind some annoying bugs

Platform used NT2000 professional

WYSIWYG window:

When a document contains only a table it is not possible to write 
anything before or behind that table.

When selecting a table for extraction Amaya crashes.


source code window:

After saving from that window it is not possible to return to the 
WYSIWIG window (which actually is a Zombie then).
You can only save from the WYSYWIG window when you want to continue.
