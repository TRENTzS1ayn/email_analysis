I am having problems getting tables to center with css
in msie  margin:auto  works
in netscape 4  putting a div element with text-align:center works
but mozilla family, Opera and Amaya don't buy into either method.
 ----  whats the solution ???

the exhibit is http://www.town.pelham.on.ca

also in Amaya how can we get the left sidebar to shorten down.
In net4 all it needed was a string without gaps on he longest entry.
In msie i forced the right side to use up space with a width property
on the h1 element. i know that was a kludge but at least i now have
good display in all browsers except amaya. what rules do amaya
want to fix the width of the sidebar ???
