Hi,
Yes I get this quite often:
When doing the back-one-word Command (Ctrl-LeftArrow) Amaya crashes (Version 5.3)

This happens only every onece in a while. And as I recall it happens when the cursor is at the end of an element (usualy a paragraph).
I also noted, that there is no Command back-one-word in the doc for keyboard shortcuts and the "Ctrl <Key>Left" does not apperar in the keyboard file amaya.kb.
