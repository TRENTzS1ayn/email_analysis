I vote against this request. I hate those 'are you sure', 'are you realy
sure', 'are you realy realy sure' windows for non destructive actions.

To prevent accidental printing in the current release is easy: define a 'to
file' printer on your local system and use it as the default printer.

For future amaya versions, the icon bar can be made customizable just like
M@Office applications. Then remove the 'print to the default printer' button
and replace it with the 'File->Print' action which invokes the printer
selection menu.

BTW: The amaya on my system (5.3, 18 dec 2001) asks what to print, isn't the
cancel on this window enough to prevent accidental printing?
