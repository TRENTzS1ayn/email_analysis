Well, technically printing is a destructive action.  You use both paper and
ink that can't be recovered.  Though I think we are all used to the
destructive use of electrons most actions involve so I don't think we have
to worry about that. :)

I don't want to define a 'to file' printer as the default printer for all
applications just because of Amaya. BTW, my system is Linux.

I second this.

My Amaya (5.3, Linux) does not ask me what to print, it prints the current
document.
