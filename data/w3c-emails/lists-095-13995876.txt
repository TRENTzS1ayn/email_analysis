Has anybody ever had Amaya crash while holding the backspace key down?
Ihave had this happen twice, but I cannot recreate it.  Has anybody else
hadthis happen?
Hi,Yes I get this quite often:When doing the back-one-word Command
(Ctrl-LeftArrow) Amaya crashes (Version 5.3)This happens only every onece in
a while. And as I recall it happens when the cursor is at the end of an
element (usualy a paragraph).I also noted, that there is no Command
back-one-word in the doc for keyboard shortcuts and the "Ctrl <Key>Left"
does not apperar in the keyboard file amaya.kb.
