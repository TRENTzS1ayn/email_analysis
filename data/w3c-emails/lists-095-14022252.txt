- Would it be possible to include current edition actions like :
copy, paste, cut, undo, redo In the main toolbar ?. Would it be possible 
for better space usage to update the icon bar depending on the amaya 
status (in edition or not) rather than disabling
some unusable actions ?

- Does amaya will work with QT ?

- Is it possible to change some amaya functions and builds another free 
distribution ?

Thank you for your effort !
