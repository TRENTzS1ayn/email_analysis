Hi,
     I have recently tried to revive my SuSE 6.2 Linux system and decided I needed to use a different browser than Netscape and Amaya appeared to be a good choice. I downloaded the binary for the GTK version and have run into problems installing it. The message I get - when I do an install and when I issue the ldd bin/Amaya command is as follows :

     /lib/libc.so.6 : version 'GLIBC_2.1.3' not found ( required by ./amaya)

     The libc.so.6 library defintely exists in the right place on my system but, I am fairly new to Linux (despite an 'old' SuSE distro) and it appears that even though I have the library it is at a slightly earlier level than the one Amaya requires (which level, I don't know). 

     Is there any way around this ? Would downloading the source as recompiling against the older library (with appropriate siwtcheds ??) just cause the same problem or is there an earlier version of Amaya that would be compatible with my system ??

     The other options are of course to upgrade glibc (looks ugly _and_ dngerous for a learner) or just upgrade SuSE Linus to 7.n .. I would rather get a compatible browser to be honest. If anyone can spare some time to advise a beginner I'd be obliged.

Regards, Kevin
