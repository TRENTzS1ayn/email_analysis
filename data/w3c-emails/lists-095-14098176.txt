Would it be possible to include in Amaya an action for automaticly put 
the current selection in a
table ? Currently, I try to include some code portion in a table cell to 
have a border.

Does Amaya will support a template mecanism from the current document ?. 
It will simply mean let
the user defines some data area in the current document and save it as a 
generic document. Thus,
amaya will ask to user to insert the data starting a new document.

Would it be possible to have a kind of ACP (like the JCP for Java 
Communauty Process, here
the Amaya Communauty process) for centralizing a set of idea and 
deciding to accept or not such idea or taking it into account for future 
release ?
