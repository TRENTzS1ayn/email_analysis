   has a simple table to create a navagation sidebar.
Works in all browsers but Amaya which produces a very
wide sidebar which forces use of the horizontal scrollbar
and also makes H1 elements go outside the body!!!.

The body is defined as 770 px   (constructing for 800x600
screens or better).  The H1 element is set to width of 570
px which keeps sidebar under control in all except Amaya.
What is the trick in Amaya for getting first column under control.
Note that it uses <th>  and column 2 uses <td>.   

I am enclosing my stylesheet in case it reveals clues.
style verified by jigsaw and html pages verify by WDG site verifier.
