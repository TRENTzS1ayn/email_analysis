It appears to me that the algorithm for calculating table column
widths is either busted or just too simplistic in Amaya 5.3
Using http://www.town.pelham.on.ca as an example , I see 
columns being of equal width to occupy the space allowed.
However column width should be based on the maximum of 
declared widths given by any element within that column.
For example style.css declares a width for H1 which appears 
in the right column. Other column widths should be reduced
by the appropriate amount down to some minimum (say 50 px
or whatever) and if more is needed then the table width is 
expanded (unless declared to fixed size).
If an element has a nowrap property than the width of contents 
should be evaluated before evaluating col width.
If an element has a pre  property  then ???  moot point here
maybe outside the box is ok in this situation. 

What is happening currently is that table is taking its default 
width (size of the body less margins) and spliting between 
2 columns.  When the H1 is rendered it continues on outside the
table frame and even the body --- seems as if treated like a pre
element might be ...  very strange handling compared to other
implementers approach to tables.
