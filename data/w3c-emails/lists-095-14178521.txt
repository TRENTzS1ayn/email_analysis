Hi,

I've been working on the SVG output from the graph-layout
tools in GraphViz.   (See:  http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/ )
In particular, I've been trying to generate <object> and inline SVG images
using the webdot graph server.  (See: http://www.graphviz.org/webdot/ )

Its all nearly working, but I'm having a couple of Amaya-specific problems
that I'm hoping you can help me with?

I'm using Amaya from today's CVS sources on RedHat 7.2 systems.

1.  Amaya doesn't yet support:   text-anchor="middle"  (or "left" or 
"right")
    e.g. http://www.graphviz.org/cgi-bin/webdot/webdot/svginline.html

    This is needed because the graphviz layout code has no access to
    the exact font metrics that will eventually be used by the SVG renderer,
    it may be that the fonts don't even exist locally.  text-anchor allows
    text strings to be visually aligned without knowing the exact string 
lengths.

    Are there plans for implementing this?


2.  Do you have a construct for embedding SVG graphics by reference
    that works on Mozilla, IE and Amaya?

    On page:  http://www.graphviz.org/webdot/svgembed.html  
    I illustrate a technique that works with Mozilla and IE, using the
    Adobe plugin.  Unfortunately it isn't working with Amaya.


Thanks in advance for any advice you can offer.

John Ellson
