Greetings,
     I was quite amazed today when I asked Amaya (5.3/linux) to load a url
http://......../fred.333 where the dots are arbitrary path components. 
Amaya declined to do anything (just a blank window) - but every other
browser I have cheerfully sends the url to the host - which then generates
a page dynamically.

     Where does it state that a particular string of characters has to be
recognised -by the browser-.  My understanding is that it is the server
which decides what to do.

     The same thing seems to happen if a form action url includes a session
identity (eg for a scripting langugae).  The form is not submitted - or so
it seems.

     Is this behaviour correct?

                        Regards,

                                        Keith Hopper
