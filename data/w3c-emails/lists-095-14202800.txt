i would approach it as a 4 column table with 1 2 3 etc just
the data for the first and third columns ...  
<tr>
<td>1.</td><td>xxx</td><td>5.</td><td>xxx</td>
</tr>
and so on

I'm trying to make columns with items numbered sequentially.

1. xxx 5. xxx
2. xxx 6. xxx
3. xxx 7. xxx
4. xxx 8. xxx

I used <ol><li></li></ol> for the numbering, but beyond that I don't
know what would make the columns.  Is it <table>, <col>, or what?
Whatever it may be, I don't know what would be the syntax, layout,
or proper coding -- essentially, whatever is required.

I looked in the documentation and found columns and rows for
<table>s, but tried several instances and couldn't get it to work.
I remember <col> worked for such a project and adjusted automatically
for the amount of items.  That's the extent of my understanding.
