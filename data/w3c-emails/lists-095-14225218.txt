Greetings,
     Once again I bring bad tidings about Amaya 5.4/linux.  I am developing
a web-based tutorial notes on CSS for a course and adapted an example from
the CSS Recommendation (section 9.2.3) to produce the following in a style
sheet -

dl[class=aside]     {
                     margin-left: 2em ;
                     background-color: rgb(224,255,224) ;
                     color: inherit ;
                     border: 1px inset rgb(128,96,96)
                     }
                     
dl.aside > dt       {
                    display: compact ;
                    background-color: transparent ;
                    color: rgb(128,96,96)
                    }
                    
dl.aside > dd       {
                    margin-left: 25mm
                    }

     The entire style sheet passed the W3C validator with flying colours -
but Amaya complained about a parsing error in relation to the display
property with the value compact.

     I experimented by putting the style in-line in a test document - which
passed through the HTML Validator as xhtml 1.1, no errors & no warnings -
but Amaya again complained - and this time it didn't like the colour being
inherited either! - though the validator was happy.

     Mozilla (0.9.9) does not handle this styling correctly as specified in
the CSS2 Recommendation although Opera 6.0beta does.  Neither, however,
produce parsing errors!!

PS Mor on the .333 url problem when I get back to work on Monday.
