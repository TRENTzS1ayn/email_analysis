is the so-called torture test offered by the mozilla mathml project team.
Aside from not passing the validity test ;-]  ;-]  ;-]   the document shows
amaya as doing a fine job.  only example #24 where vertical ellipses 
are used is there an open box (perhaps indicating a character not
 implemented).    Mozilla is finally including mathml support. Hope
they learn how to write valid code ;-]  ;-] ;-]
