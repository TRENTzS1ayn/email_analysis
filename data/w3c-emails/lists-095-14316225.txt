In the CVS version things changed.
Now you can directly open amaya.dsw and select the project compilers.
When compilers are built a window is displayed. You just have to build schemas
by F7. When all schemas are compiled you can close the window and move to the 
project amaya and build the application.
The advantage is to keep the same working space for compilers and the 
application
amaya.

We'd like to link the end of the schemas compiling with the building of Amaya
(it's trivial with Unix Makefiles) but we didn't find out a method to do that 
with Visual Studio.
