> Hi,
>      I have recently tried to revive my SuSE 6.2 Linux system and decided I needed to use a different browser than Netscape and Amaya appeared to be a good choice. I downloaded the binary for the GTK version and have run into problems installing it. The message I get - when I do an install and when I issue the ldd bin/Amaya command is as follows :
> 
>      /lib/libc.so.6 : version 'GLIBC_2.1.3' not found ( required by ./amaya)

That seems a problem with the system installation probably due to a partial 
update.

The command "ls -l /lib/libc.so.6" on my Linux platforms returns libc-2.2.4.so 
and that library exists.
Could you check your installlation?
