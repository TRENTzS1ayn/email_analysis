My homepage has  navigation spots to move to 
bottom of page  and at bottom to move to top of page.
these work well with all browsers except amaya.
the move to bottom of page moves one right off the page
and move to top moves one not quite to the top....

Hopefully this kind of thing may get fixed as it sure
impedes navigation of pages.......
