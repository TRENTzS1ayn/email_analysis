In the attached test case, if the cursor is inserted after "Brant" and the
left arrow key is pressed multiple times, instead of stopping before
"Brant", the cursor goes to the end of "Gurganus".

The same thing happens if the cursor is placed on the second line and the
right arrow key is pressed multiple times.  The cursor jumps to the
beginning of the line instead of stopping at the end of the line.
