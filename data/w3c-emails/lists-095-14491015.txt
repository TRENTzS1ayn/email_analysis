hi
I'm trying to find a way to have a styled MathML-Object embeded into an HTML 
(or XHTML) file without completly blocking the IE out of that file, so I 
tried it with embedding it into an <object data="integral.xml" 
type="text/xml">, but this is ignored by Amaya, when loading the file itself 
it's shown (the file is valid XHTML width MathML in it), also Mozilla does it 
as expected. Serversided Mime-Type is txt/xml too.
Where's my mistake?

everything to be found at http://mozilla.linuxfaqs.de
(should end on a B/W MathML in Amaya/CVS, as there's a nested <object>).
