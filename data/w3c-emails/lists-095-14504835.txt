Since Windows XP and possibly other NT-based systems support Unicode
characters in file names, could this part be implemented so that files with
Unicode characters in their file name can be opened.  Currently, Amaya does
not render the contents of the file and replaces the Unicode character (in
this case, a RTL mark) with a question mark in the address bar.
