Somewat related to the question: is it possible with some kind of
backspace entity to force accents on letters which are else not
represented as accented in iso-latin1? (I don't find any backspace
entity in the HTML4.1 reference). What I hint at is a 'c' with an accent
aigu which I need for a song title with Czech lyrics. Alternatively is
it possible to locally force another iso-latin character set enabling
that kind of characters and have the thus coded character accordingly
displayed by a browser? I would prefer tricks like that rather than
introducing unicode.
