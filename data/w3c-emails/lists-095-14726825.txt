Just fast scanning my homepage to see changes in browser rendering
  and i see lots of nicer looking pages....   however there are three 
 things that i am seeing that need repair
1] gif rendering still does not handle transparency ...  makes my logos
 look bad, loses background color and exposes a hidden message that 
 should only appear if stylesheet not interpreted.  A suspect this is a 
 well known issue awaiting fixer with appropriate knowledge.
2] the font size appears way larger than any other browser.  i noted the 
wrap point for the first line of text and amaya was earliest!!!   not an issue
on this page but does make navigation boxes at top of pages wrap 
  on some longer lines  RATS ....   is there no standard for font-size 
 either... why is 14 pt   not the same in each browser ??????
3] in http://www.town.pelham.on.ca/council/council.htm    i use
links of class nav to make text color navy....   but Amaya writes
them in white which doesn't show well when the background is a 
light color....  there seems to be a problem recognizing the rule
a.nav {color:navy}   i also have a.nav:link {color:navy}  in the stylesheet
no parse errors occur   but rendering not quite there......

but the last couple of versions have really improved on rendering  ....
now to go over the issues i am tracking thoroughly   and then to
the edit quirks that i noticed in previous versions .. hope they are gone now!
