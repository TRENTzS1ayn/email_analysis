well i tried cut paste operation in source view
shift end / shift home   work well 
cut  paste with  ctr-x and ctr-v  work well
cut with shift delete ok   but shift insert doesnt paste correctly   darnit
edit synchonize works to make edits take   
but on closing the source window --- the dialog is not right
both in wording the reverse to logical way and in not offering the third choice
it should  be      Save      NoSave      Cancel
Save should commit the change to disk
NoSave is exit without saving (reverting to older view)
Cancel drops dialog box and remains in source view
  i believe someone else mentioned this but it didnt get changed.....

The shift insert after a shift delete is a common windows edit method
  and to many is more intuitive than cut / paste with ctr x and v
