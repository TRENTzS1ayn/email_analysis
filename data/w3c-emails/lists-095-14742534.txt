It has been pointed out to me by another list member that the
variation in interpretation of font size by all the browsers is
due to assumptions made on screen size .... 
resolution size can be easily determined but not the size of
the actual display monitor  so  12pt will never be exactly 1/6 inch.
That being said,  it will become difficult to design attractive pages
if there is no agreement as to what  12pt should look like on 
   a given monitor with set resolution   between various programs.
 netscape 7 and msie 6 are very close visually,  opera is only a
shade off,  but amaya is really for the vision impaired  
 very big in comparison to others....   is there a specific reason
or was it a random choice....   as stated in first line there is no 
CORRECT way  but browser writers can try to coordinate for
  the poor document creater's sake ...
