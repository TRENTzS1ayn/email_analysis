it appears as if there are only generic serif and sanserrif fonts
for monospace courier is used
system  is available
and nothing for cursive or fantasy !!!!
Is there some licensing reason that the tt fonts loaded in windows
are not used .... 
fonts available to an operating system should be utilized within a
browser.  i suspect that is why netscape and msie agree so well.
there should be no need to reinvent wheels here. default fonts
could be provided to guarantee at least one of each type   but 
even that isn't followed as cursive and fantasy families are not supported.
life is difficult enough for a designer so unwanted/unnecessary varions should
be avoided......
something similar to putting the gas pedal to the left   cuz 
all the other autos put it to the right and one wants to be creative ;-]  ;-] ;-]
