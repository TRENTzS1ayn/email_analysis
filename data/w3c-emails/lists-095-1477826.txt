In theory, you can use UTF-8 (-16 etc) or numeric 
character entities to introduce the Unicode characters
for non-spacing accents (or the actual accented characters).

I'd be surprised to find a browser that supports this,
although it might be worth trying IE 5.5 or IE 6 using the
full Unicode font from Office 2000.

In almost all cases, using the Unicode accented characters is
going to be a better approach than using non-spacing accents.
