Best thoughts come while asleep...  some even are about computing ;-] ;-]
A} I thought maybe the 'zoom' setting is retained even though i uninstalled old
version first.    So i looked at general preferences ZOOM  and it was set at
100.   100 what   100x,   100 angstroms , 100 furballs ....   maybe HELP
will tell  me   ----  the image in help shows a setting of zero ... maybe 0
means no zoom effect....  looked at text part of HELP,  no mention of units.
So the only way is to test ...  i put 0 in ,  display is as originally seen with
too big a font... go back to dialog box and see nuber reset to 100.  
so i try 10  and it is real tiny.  200 is twice as big .... aha  i bet it is in
percent .....   but why did i need to experiment.  Three changes needed
1] dialog box should have unit measure printed beside the entry zone!
2] text of help document should explicitly measure units. no assumptions
    should be made on readers part or he wouldn't be reading help document.
3] image in help document should show the normal default setting (with units
    as in #1) or at least a valid setting and not zero which program correctly 
    resets to default. 
B} then i thought ... maybe an old stylesheet was retained and overriding 
    the one served by author of webpage (that would be correct action i think
    in cascade as then a user can set their own needs for large print or hi
    contrast etc.   but only css i found was in help directory that is used by
    help manual itself.  Are any of these properties so important to Amaya
    that perhaps i should include them in my general style sheet to 
    make Amaya appear more msie'ish ....   or was this a fudge sheet 
    incantation that i should be asking the documentation person about...
   Perhaps giving me an email address to send to will help on this...
So most of this falls into documentation although the dialog box needs
a redo to include units of measure on zoom ...  
and i still wonder how to get font-size coordinated and the use of all
avilable fonts that operating system offers.
