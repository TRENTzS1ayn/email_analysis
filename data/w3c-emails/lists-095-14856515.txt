Trying to select text, I noticed that shift-arrow does not work properly.

Version: Amaya 6.2, Win XP

To replicate: put the pointer at the beginning of a header, hold down shift,
press right-arrow. The selection extends to the end of the element, and then
goes back to the beginning rather than extending into the next element.
