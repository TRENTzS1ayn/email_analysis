Apologies for sending this in UTF-8, but it's the best way to show it.

Unicode has two methods of representing composite characters like:
precomposed characters and combining diacriticals.  The two methods would be
used as follows for the character in question:

c??
(U+0063 + U+0301; represented as entities as &#x0063;&#x0301;)

??
(U+0107; represented as an entity as &#x0107;)

(Note that these are HEXADECIMAL values!)

The former is that defined in Normalization Form D; the latter, in
Normalization Form C (the preferred form for web documents according the
draft of the W3C Character Model I last read).

In Windows ME, Mozilla 2001052708, IE5.5, and Netscape 4.77 [!] all can
manage both forms in UTF-8 (what I tested), though the combination is poorly
spaced in the Moz/Net browsers (not surprising).  In Mozilla and IE (but not
Netscape 4.x), entities do work.  I have managed to get both to work before
in Linux with Mozilla (later than M17) with a font that included the correct
combining diacriticals characters, though such a font is not currently
available; and it might work in Konqueror as well.

> I would prefer tricks like that rather than introducing unicode.

The suggestion that rather than supporting Unicode-based technologies Amaya
should kludge together its own method of supporting only those character
combinations that are requested by users is I would think counter to the
spirit of standards support.
