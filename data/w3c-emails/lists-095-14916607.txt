Does anyone know of a native OS X version of Amaya? I can't get the Fink
installation to run. I get:
    dyld: amaya can't open library: /sw/lib/libmd5.0.dylib (No such file or
directory, errno = 2)
But I can't find anything on Fink for an md5 library, except the Perl
packages, which is probably not what I need, right? Can anybody help with
this?
