I installed Amaya 6.2 (Windows-Version) and tried to look at a XML document 
(local xml-file with external dtd and css).
The display was not correct; especially namespaces following 
(<einfuehrung-xml xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40"> ...) were 
not interpreted.

This xml-file is displayed correct with opera 5/6, NS 6.2, galeon, ...

I do not understand, that Amaya interprets xhtml-files correct, but not xml ...
Both use normal xml-syntax.

Can you give me some hint please

Kind regards

V. Risak
