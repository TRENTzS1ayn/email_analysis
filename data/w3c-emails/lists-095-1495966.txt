I guess the problem is on the server side. Are you sure the server accepts 
the standard http put method and that any Web tool is allowed to write on
this server?
Amaya works well with Apache servers and Jigsaw servers which support
standardized http protocols.

Please check if your server support the standard http protocol HTTP/1.1.

What do you mean by "it takes the document opened in edit mode"?
The saving is stuck?

It's always a problem with the server.
I guess the solution is to change it for a free and open http server like
Jigsaw or Apache.
