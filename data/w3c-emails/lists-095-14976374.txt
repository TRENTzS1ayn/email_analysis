There is a bug in Amaya from CVS today where <td valign="middle"> 
doesn't work in all columns.

For an example of the problem, see the "right" text in the third column
of the table at:

        http://www.graphviz.org/amayatest/amayatest.html

(Note this example page needs an svg enabled build, but the bug isn't
specific to svg builds.)
