i want to know the process from MathML script to
become a mathematical expression. 
is it from text file ? and then amaya process the file
through some steps,
i.e: from parse the document and then ....bla...bla

I tried to trace the source code in visual C++ but it
said "can't trace into system dll's".  
This is for my final project in Surabaya technic
School (STTS). 
my final project is studying the Amaya source code
especially for mathml document.  
should i study about Thot language?
when i studying the source code i often 
found strange commands for me because i never study
such language.

how should i know the structure of MathML document in
Amaya?

can you give me some hint please

kind regards

Zheng Hui Ping
