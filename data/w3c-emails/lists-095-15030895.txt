John Russell also tested on windows 98 version 6.2 (800x600) and
 got even more bizarre results.  First letter margin 20 em
but that was only thing on first line. Second line margin 20 em and 
rest of text...  brought up horizontal scroll rather than wrapping.
test program was:

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN">
<html>
<head>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=iso-8859-
1">
<style type="text/css">
p {margin-left:20em; margin-right:2em}
</style>
<title>x</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is just a test of margins. There should be a 20em margin on 
the left and a 2 em margin
on the right.  quirk in amaya.</p>
