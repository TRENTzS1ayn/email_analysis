The W3C recommendation for HTML 4.01 says:

"In HTML, there are two types of hyphens: the plain hyphen and the soft hyphen. The plain hyphen should be interpreted by a user agent as just another character. The soft hyphen tells the user agent where a line break can occur.

Those browsers that interpret soft hyphens must observe the following semantics: If a line is broken at a soft hyphen, a hyphen character must be displayed at the end of the first line. If a line is not broken at a soft hyphen, the user agent must not display a hyphen character. For operations such as searching and sorting, the soft hyphen should always be ignored".

Still the Amaya interprets the entity '&shy;' as a plain hyphen, and when saving, it even replaces it with that hyphen.

Isn't that a bug?

Yours, Johs. Lind

P.S. It would be good, if the Amaya could warn the user if it wants to make changes in the document, maybe in the way the Chase HTML-kit does it.
