Hello Steve,

Thanks for your report. This is indeed a bug on the new Windows version.
I'm looking at it.

Regards,  Laurent

> 2. I attempt to paste it into a document openned in Amaya,.

> 3. Amaya pastes the last thing I had copied or pasted from within Amaya,

> 
> 4. One exception:  If I copy a URI (for example) and try to paste it into 
> the Save As form (for example), this seems to work.
> 
> This is an important bug, since I copy and paste things into Amaya frequently.
