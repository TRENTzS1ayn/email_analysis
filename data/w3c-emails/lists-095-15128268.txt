After a while of using Amaya GL with Windows XP Home Edition and the 
Nvidia GeForce 2 MX 100/200 drivers version 29.42, the display of 
right-click menus and Amaya corrupts.  This corruption seems to occur 
wherever alpha transparency is used.  The only workaround is to reboot 
the computer.  This is fairly serious since the corruption makes the 
screen in that region black whick can hide messages and options in 
program menus.
