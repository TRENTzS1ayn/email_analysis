Eager to try out the Annotea, I fired up my new Amaya and cruised over to 
w3.org.

Not a happy experience.  I noted in passing that the "menu buttons" at the 
top of the
entry page have ugly separations between them using Amaya that aren't there 
using
Mozilla (0.9).  Also, the first clue that <input .. > was going to be a 
problem was the rather strange look about the SEARCH on that page.  Moz. 
renders it as a small input with the button to the right; Amaya renders a 
big input space with the search button kind of awkwardly at the lower left 
of the input.

That wasn't enough warning, so I went to register with the database.
The problem was so much more severe there that I was totally unable to 
complete the form successfully.  I gave up and came back to it with Moz. to 
finish the job.
Then I went in with Amaya and left an annotation on the database input page 
to the effect of what I'm writing here.

Annotations are cool, indeed.
But form layout has been around a long time now.  Is there something that 
makes it difficult to do right?

But I didn't just post to grinch about Amaya!  This reminded me of a real 
need -- a whole forest of pages, preferably under w3 control containing 
very carefully crafted, canonically correct HTML of whatever version where 
we know precisely how it is intended to be rendered; say one page for each 
characteristic to be exercised.  Thus, voila! a way to compare browsers 
where the page content isn't also a variable.

Comment?
