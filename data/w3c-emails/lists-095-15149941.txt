Greetings,
     The attached tiny xhtml 1.1 file (validated) shows what I believe to
be three bugs - 

1.   The alignment of the float is wrong - the heading ('Culture') is well
below the place where the object text ('Man') should be - instead of on its
left - and the 'same' line!  Note that if the alternative text is actually
being 'displayed' it is well above the top of the window - an image
actually shows the bottom dozen rows of pixels right at the top of the
window.

2.   The structure view reveals two spans inside an object instead of the
single object element inside a span element.

3.   The object element structure refers to an img element - which is just
not there!


                        Regards,

                                        Keith Hopper
