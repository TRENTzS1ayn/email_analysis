Printing of mathematical symbols under Amaya 6.2 is worse than Amaya 5.3
I am using the amaya-LINUX-ELF distribution and an HP LJ4M+.

As an example, in the following document, 
http://cs.wwc.edu/~aabyan/KU/Math/FunRelSets.html
mathematical symbols are over printed on each other.The problem exists 
in 6.1 but does not exist in 5.3.
