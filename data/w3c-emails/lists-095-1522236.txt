[DJW:]  
HTML is not intended to have one true rendering.  Even CSS up
to CSS2, at least, is intended only to be treated as hints on 
presentation, but HTML is about document semantics and has 
very little to do with presentation/GUI rendering.

In the area of input controls, up to at least CSS2, then 
expectation is that the controls will be displayed in the
natural form for the operating system, not in any standard
format.

If you look at the PDF version of the HTML specification, it
was generated from the HTML and is a valid graphical 
rendering, including the collapsible outline tree; however, 
it is unlikely to look exactly like the rendering in IE 
or Mozilla.


If you want controlled prsentation, use PDF, whose design aim was
that.

Unfortunately most "HTML" authors are working on tne false 
premise that it is some form of page description language.
