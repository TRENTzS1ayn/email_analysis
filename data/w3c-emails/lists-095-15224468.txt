Amaya has the very useful annotation-facility, but no bookmark-facility.

Other browsers have all bookmark-facilities but no annotation facility.

For intensive work with web-texts, annotations ase necessary, but is hard 
to use without bookmarks. You have to copy the URL to/fromm a separate list.

And (at least under Windows) it is not possible to copy an URL from Amaya 
and paste it to say notepad.

? Is there a way to use annotations with e.g. opera, Netscape, galeon (or 
perhaps ME)?

? Will Amaya sometimes have a bookmark-facility?

Kind regards
