The baseline of the code element appears to be lower than the rest of 
the text by a few pixels in the OpenGL version.  I have a line of markup 
that is essentially:
<p>This text is normal <code>while this text block appear fractionally 
lower</code> and this appears normal again.</p>

This may not be the baseline in the CSS sense, but it is the baseline in 
the highlighting sense and it looks like the rendering sense as well. 
 If necessary, I can upload a screen shot.
