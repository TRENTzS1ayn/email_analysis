I opened README.cvs from the CVS repository.  Amaya considers this a 
text file since it does not have htm or html as an extension.  Amaya 
should use another method for determining file types.

Another alternative, probably the preferred method, is to have an Open 
As... menu so I can say whether to open it as text or HTML.
