I searched for CVS to replace with <acronym title="Concurrent Version 
System">CVS</acronym> with the following options:
 * UPPERCASE = lowercase
 * Replace on request
 * After Selection

I pressed Confirm twice.

I then changed to
 * Automatic replace

I clicked Confirm again.

Amaya crashed at this point.

I was editing README.cvs from the Amaya CVS repository.  It was being 
edited as text.
