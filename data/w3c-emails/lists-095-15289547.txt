I am sure the development team are setting their priorities
for the next few versions of Amaya. Although cleanup work
is not as much fun nor does it make for another paper there still
is a need.
  
Besides the well known issues of image float, transparency and 
resizing problems  there are long standing bugs, quirks and 
  unimplemented stuff  in both  forms and tables  that would
  help the way Amaya displays conformant sites.

Not to mention the fact that background:none  in a stylesheet 
raises a parse error even though the stylesheet passes the
jigsaw validator. 

Admittedly Amaya is an editor --- but it a visual one so should 
display valid code correctly!!! (and perhaps as much like other 
browsers as possible ;-]  ;-]  )John Russell, VE3LL@RAC.CA
