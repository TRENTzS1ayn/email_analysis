     I must agree here, though my personal priority is to merge in from the
WWW library the https protocol handling on the 'browse' front and, like
John, getting tables, object and float correct.  On the editing front my
personal priority is better SVG editing facilities.

     In suggesting the above I reserve the right to be totally wrong!!
