This was due to a combination of selectors not supported in Amaya.
It's fixed now (check on the CVS base.

That depends on the font sizes and the width of the window.
As you know one of the goal of HTML is to adapt the rendering to the current

If you used to fill a form by using TAB and ENTER, it didn't work with the 
current

As I see you discovered what Amaya doesn't do that Mozilla does but not yet the
opposite.

A lack of manpower and a lot of things to do.
