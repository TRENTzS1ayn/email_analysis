hi,

I'm happily using the Amaya 6.1 rpm.  I haven't gotten into Amaya's guts before 
and would prefer not to try now so I want to make sure it's necessary to 
recompile Amaya if I want to add some functionality to its Save command.

http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/AmayaArchi.html#L472 talks about how to "Modify 
existing commands" but it refers to files I don't have, such as EDITOR.A and 
HTML.A (because I'm using the rpm version i assume).

The Save functionality I want to add is to have Amaya save files that have a 
special extension (.litprog) in two versions, one as is and the other as plain 
text source code. This is to enable literate programming: The plain text source 
code file will be created by running at Save time a small, to-be-written program 
that can recognize the code chunks in the html document and use the output order 
I have defined for them.

tips?

thanks,
George
