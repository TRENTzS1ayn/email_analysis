Daniel,

Thanks alot but the reason i want Amaya to do this "tangle" step for me is that 
i won't be compiling the source code: My output most of the time will be .php 
files, which are interpreted (or JIT compiled, http://php.net has more info if 
anyone's curious).  I should have mentioned that, sorry.
