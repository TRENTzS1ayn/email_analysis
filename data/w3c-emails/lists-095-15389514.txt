I need a JavaScript guru who knows how to make client-side
file upload work.  closest i get is accessing the selected filename.
but i wish to move the contents of the file into a textarea for
edit / manipulation.  Anyone willing to share the technique.
have searched the net for examples and even dug into high powered 
(read o'reilly pubs) on issue but can't find.  ;-[  ;-[
