I having trouble with Amaya. I have looked at the lists and FAQ and my
question is not quite answered there (as far as I can tell).

We use a combination of HTML and PHP pages on our website. We want to know
whether we can edit *.php files with Amaya. When I try to open them I get a
message which reads: "Not Well-Formed XML document - Reload as HTML or show
Parsing errors?" If I load as HTML then my php coding is stripped out. If I
show errors then I cannot see anything in the WYSIWYG window, but can edit
the code. Do I have errors in my php files, which if corrected would enable
me to open them in Amaya, or can't it handle PHP yet?
