is a test suite for html4 that david cobb may be interested in.

There are many issues clearly defined in the recommendation that
would make Amaya look more closely like other forms if rendered
as the recommendation says. The most important one is SIZE
which sets the input box width in characters. Other issues can 
be identified by using http://www.cgocable.net/~jrussel/formtest.htm
And Amaya is not alone in not adhering to the html4 recommendations
about forms ---  MSIE, Netscape and Opera each fail at something
just not the obvious one of SIZE.  Renderings such as how a 
scroll box looks is not in recommendation as Dave says but 
that  it should display multiple selections when that feature is 
requested is!
