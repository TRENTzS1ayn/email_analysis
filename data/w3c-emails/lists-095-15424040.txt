I can edit a local php file with my Amaya (v6.1 rpm (Linux)) if I rename it so 
it has a .txt extension.  Otherwise, if the file has a .php extension, Amaya 
interprets the file to be plain html, and so doesn't show its <?php ?> sections.

(So i've been using Vim 6.1 w/color syntax hightlighting to edit my .php files. 
(But i'm also working on a .html->.php literate programming system. I'll post 
here when i have a decent version ready.))

To edit files on the server, i think WebDAV can help you there, but i wouldn't 
be the one to help you because I haven't used it yet.
