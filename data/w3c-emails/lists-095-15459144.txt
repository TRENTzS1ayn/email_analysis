i've just ../configure Amaya 6.2 over a linuxbox (ydl 2.3 for ppc) also i do 
have installed openmotif-2.1.30-12.ppc.rpm configuration was for GTK 
presumably because the "configure" didn't find Motif ; i've seen this :

checking for Motif... no

i wonder if either openmotif is out of date, i should make use of GTK anymay 
or if if openmotif is still alive and i'll gain SVG edition support by using 
it...

regards,

Yvon
