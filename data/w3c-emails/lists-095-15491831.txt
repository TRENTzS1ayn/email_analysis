Could the version string in win32 builds be correct to be 5.1, 5.2, etc. 
instead of the incorrect 1.0.0.1 that it currently is for the 5.2 GL 
version.  Also, the copyright date needs updated.  This information 
helps programs such as Bugtoaster (www.bugtoaster.com) to keep versions 
of an executable together to track repeated information across crashes.
