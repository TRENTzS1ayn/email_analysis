What version of Amaya are you using?
Often when there is no encoding associated to the document is
supposed UTF-8 encoded if it's a XML document and ISO-8859-1 encoded
if it's a HTML document. That makes an important difference and it's
why Amaya informs the user that the document could be misinterpreted.

This could be due to a bug, but I'm not able to reproduce it.
