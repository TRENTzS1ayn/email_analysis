Hello,

These are some issues with Amaya:

I tried Amaya in Windows 98. Unfortunately, it does not support non-latin1
keyboard codepages, and interprets any keyboard input as latin1. It is even
worse, as it displays the characters as typed (also in source view!), but
finally, &xNN; entities are written to the file.

It is not possible to paste an international text into the Title dialog box
- I had to do it in source view.

One can not change encoding etc. without saving a file. It is not easy for a
new users to guess that it is possible at all, until they see the Save as
dialog box.

Regards,
C.S.
