Input methods change with the platform and the country and today we don't know
what is sent by the keyboard. We're working on that and hope some help from 
people that work on internationalization can help us to find a good solution.

Today Amaya uses Unicode as basic encoding. By default it's able to generate
ISO-8859-1, ASCII, and UTF-8 which are encodings promoted by W3C.
Nevertheless it's able to read Windows code pages (provided the encoding is
declared) and keep the encoding when the document is saved.

It's the same problem for the cut/paste between applications. The encoding 
should
be clearly declared.

The Save command doesn't displays dialogs and Amaya doesn't have to change the 
encoding of the current document if the user doesn't request that change.
