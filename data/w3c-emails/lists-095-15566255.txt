/* all pages have this for sidebar | th is left sidebar */
table.sb {margin:0px; border:0px; padding:0px}
td.sb {margin:0px; border:0px; padding:20px; vertical-align:top}
th.sb {margin:0px; border:0px; padding:3px; width:145px; background:#b3e1a3;
       text-align:left; vertical-align:top}

this is property rules for my sidebar setup on most of my pages.....
but amaya doesn't like it at all ---
first clue is that the background color isnt rendered on the left column (th)
second clue is that borders used in amaya are those of the standard table, td,
 and th elements which are set to 1px solid gray....  found this by
changing to red and all extra lines were in red. 
i am limited to using binary windows 98 version ....  
has this been fixed in cvs version .... a fast look at my site with windows 98 
version will tell .... should have a colored sidebar and no line under 
navigation stuff at top of screen. 
my tutorial menu pages look pretty fair with amaya so rendering is getting
more acceptable each round .... hope that this is just a small interpreting 
thing and easily fixed.
