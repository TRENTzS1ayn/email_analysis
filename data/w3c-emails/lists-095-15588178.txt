Dear sir/madam,

S and P shema for mathML is written using S language
and P language. And i have seen the source of MathML.S
and MathMLP.P. my question is:

if i already write the schema, How can i compile this
source? 

do i need str, prs and tra compilers ? But i heard
that str, prs and tra compilers are not available on
Windows platforms.
Where I can get these compilers and the manuals?

my second question is:

To display math expression on the screen, The parser
build the document tree and the thotlib generate the
presentation based on that tree. so first i want to
know and understand the document tree. how can i know
the structure of the document tree of MathML in Amaya?
and the second 
If the thotlib generate the presentation based on the
document tree, which part of the code that build the
tree?

Thank you very much. i'm waiting for the answer.

kind regards,

The Fe Ping
