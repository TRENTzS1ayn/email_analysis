They are included in the source distribution.

If you compile a personal version of Amaya with the define
AMAYA_DEBUG the command Help > About Amaya will generate dumps
of the document tree (tree.debug), the presentation tree (view.debug),
etc. in your AmayaHome directory.

On Unix platforms, add the define in the file Options like the
following example
AMAYA_OPTIONS= -DAMAYA_DEBUG -D_GTK -DXML_GENERIC -D_I18N_

On Windows platforms, change Settings.
