One of my pages:
 
http://www.cgocable.net/~jrussel/rrjournal.htm

contains a gif image that i use the width="95%"
attribute to size it to a users window with a bit of margin.
However Amaya does not resize the gif.  All other 
browsers tested do this with no problem. I like using
per cent widths as this allows conent to adapt to window size.
i really hate hard coded stuff like 800px (where the author
tried for average 600x800 screen but forgot that scrollbar and application
frame take a few px ;-[  ;-[ 
But this fall into the pit with images not being floated when requested
and several other quirky display things .....
