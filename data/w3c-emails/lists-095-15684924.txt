You and CBee are correct (thank u) -- in addition to the Lesstif rpm i had to 
install the lesstif-devel rpm, because that has the missing files.  But after 
installing that rpm and re-running ../configure and make, I get the same missing 
file errors, from both configure and make.  ../configure returns "Motif includes 
were not found  Amaya might not compile".

So I re-ran ../configure with the --with-gtk option, but I then get the same 
errors from make:

. . .
../../thotlib/include/thot_gui.h:156:19: Xm/Xm.h: No such file or directory
../../thotlib/include/thot_gui.h:157:23: Xm/PushBG.h: No such file or directory
. . .

until, that is, I deleted the Options file and re-ran ../configure.  (Since I 
didn't touch that Options file, I didn't have any settings in there i didn't 
want overriden, so maybe configure should warn the user when it won't write new 
settings.)

Now make worked and amaya runs.  (Its warnings were mostly of type
../../thotlib/base/registry.c:1498:8: warning: extra tokens at end of #endif 
directive.)

So i'm all set, thanks alot.
