This is the list of directories where configure looks for Motif include files 
(Xm/*.h)
    /usr/lib/Motif1.2     \
    /usr/Motif1.2/lib     \
    /sw/Lesstif/Motif2.0/lib \
                          \
    /usr/motif/lib        \
                          \
    /usr/X11R6/lib        \
    /usr/X11R5/lib        \
                          \
    /usr/lib/X11R6        \
    /usr/lib/X11R5        \
                          \
    /usr/local/X11R6/lib  \
    /usr/local/X11R5/lib  \
                          \
    /usr/local/lib/X11R6  \
    /usr/local/lib/X11R5  \
                          \
    /usr/X11/lib          \
    /usr/lib/X11          \
    /usr/local/X11/lib    \
                          \
    /usr/X386/lib         \
    /usr/x386/lib         \
    /usr/XFree86/lib/X11  \
                          \
    /usr/lib              \
