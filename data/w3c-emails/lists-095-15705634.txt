Would the following URI may be a good starting point for implementing of Javascript (in C) for Amaya?
http://www.mozilla.org/js/spidermonkey/ [SpiderMonkey is the Mozilla (JavaScript-C) Engine]

I would like to contribute to integrating Javascript in Amaya. As a beginner level spare-time programmer, where 
in the source should I focus any potential efforts? 

Thanks in anticipation
Robert
