Apparently there has been some progress on this but those
of us who can only use binary images are a bit out of the loop....

But i must complement Amaya on getting one part correct which 
none of the other browsers tested (netscape, msie, opera, 1x) 
could!!!     Select lists with the multiple attribute should allow
picking more than one item from a list AND INDICATING THOSE
CURRENTLY SELECTED. Amaya shows checks on as many as
selected.   Other browsers will only hilite the last one clicked on
and i suspect no hilite means not selected.....  Well here's one
up on the name brands -- Jolly good show!
