Whenever I scroll a window, the rendering is always terrible. I see many 
lines copied at the screen edge. My guess is Amaya doesn't redraw the 
entire text area each time, or the redraw is too slow to keep up with my 
scrolling. I'm not doing anything fancy, just scrolling.

There is no smooth scrolling of the text/image. I can send along a screen 
shot if required.
