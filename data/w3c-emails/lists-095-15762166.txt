Are usability issues being looked at?

1. I'd like to see a simple context menu (when you right-click) that has 
some basic commands in it:

Back
Forward
View source
Edit
Zoom in
Zoom out
Reload

I know some of these are in the menus, but if I have my hand on the mouse 
it's preferable not to move it. I'm sure I'm not alone in this laziness.

2. Large buttons to make mouse pointing easier. All other major browsers 
have this feature, that makes using the browser much better since pointing 
to a large button is faster than pointing to a small one.
