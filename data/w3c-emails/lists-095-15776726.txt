I just tried this with make clean (since 
http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Autoconf.html has "# make clean : removes all 
object files, but keep the binaries in Amaya/obj /bin").

# make clean, however, leaves as is the LINUX-ELF/Options file (a file which, 
again, was auto'ly generated).  A subsequent ../configure also leaves the 
Options file as is.  Running # make all, therefore, still uses old options.  So 
I had to delete the Options file to put a new ../configure --<options> command 
into effect.

fyi,
george
