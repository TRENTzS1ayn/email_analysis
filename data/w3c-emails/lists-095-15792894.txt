Hello David,

Interesting bug. It comes from the fact that the icon of the domain used in 
this document is called 'arch'. When you open http://www.w3.org/2002/ws/arch/ 
the file is copied into the cache with the name 'arch' then when the icon is 
loaded, it is copied with the same name and replace the file, so the view 
source tries to open it.
We will try to fix it.

Thanks
