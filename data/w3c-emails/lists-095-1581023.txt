Is there any other editor that works like Amaya 
in assuring HTML conformant structure.  
That is by analysing and internally creating a 
correct treed structure that will ALWAYS generate 
correct code. 
I am used to using either pure ascii or ascii with
tagging macros  editors as i come from the 
programming world where these are merely extensions
 of ones fingers...   and a few passes thru the 
validator or tidy gives conformant output.  
I find this style to be quick and easy as these editors
use standardized mechanisms for blocking text and
cut/paste. They also employ hooks to whichever browser
you want to review code in so that you can see if what 
you think you will get is what you really get.
 
I am just wondering if there are editors that can be 
compared to Amaya for its internal treeing mechanism.
