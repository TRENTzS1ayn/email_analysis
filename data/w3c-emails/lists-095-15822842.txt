I use a ready compiled 5.2 RPM which works fine.
System uses XFree86 Rel 4.1 on 2.4.18 Kernel

A few months ago I downloaded 6.1 tarball and compiled it. 

View menu windows such as structure, parsing errors, alternate 
EXCEPT source looked like the attached image with the top 95% 
gray and only the bottom 5% visible (about 1 line).

Today I downloaded latest from CVS and compiled it, but the 
problem persists. 

./configure was run without options. 

I could not find anything on the list. Could you please have a 
look at the attached (small 4K) image and advise where I should 
look for the problem?

Thanks
Michael
