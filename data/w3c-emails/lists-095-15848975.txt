CSS is being promoted as a way of designing 'graceful regressive' 
pages that look ok in older browsers.
If this means readable, i will agree. but if it means 'attempts to be
attractive' then it fails.  Look at www.w3.org/Amaya in netscape 4
and shudder. Sure the browser is old but it should be treated better.
My father was old and we would even let him ride inside the truck
once in a while,  not sitting in his rocker in the flatbed (well sometimes)
