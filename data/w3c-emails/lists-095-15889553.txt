Hi annotators,

I've just been using annotatea features in Amaya 6.2 and find the service
quite useful. A few UI-related comments that might make use a bit more
smooth:

-file save vs. annotation post: The naive user (me) may not think much about
the difference between a local save and a post to a remote server. The
temptation is to use the file/save ICON in the annotation window to save.
I'd suggest either adding a post icon next to that or removing the save icon
from the toolbar.

-mouseover: reading annotations would be much easier if it were possible to
mouseover the pencil icon.

-annotation server list is confusing: What happens when you have more than
one server in the 'annotation server list'. Does the post go to the first
one, all of them, localhost and and first? It would be nice if the UI could
illuminate this part of the mechanism a bit more.

Thanks for your work on this.

Danny
