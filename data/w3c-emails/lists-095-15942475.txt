Hi,

I have had this bug across a couple of different versions, and it is
intermittent but repeats reasonably often in the same circumstances.

The result is that my X server quits.

The cause is harder to find. It happens when I try to open
http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/Group (which requires authentication). I think it
might only happen when I have had my Amaya session running for a day or more.

It has happened repeatedly with Amaya 5.3 and 6.1 - in both cases using the
fink package for Macintosh OS X

(I hope that helps to track it down. It is hard to find because it is
intermittent but I will try to provide anything new I learn).

cheers

Chaals
