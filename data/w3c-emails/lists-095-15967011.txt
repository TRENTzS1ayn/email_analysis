I tried to fink install the necessary bits (autoconfig etc) and do it a
while ago with no success. I am also interested in working on the codebase
(although mostly on documentation there are a few little hacks that I would
like to put back into my private version) so if you make this happen I would
be interested to follow up.

Cheers
