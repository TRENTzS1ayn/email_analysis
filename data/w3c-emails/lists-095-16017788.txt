Thank you for your comments, Danny.

point well-taken.  The "natural" set of gestures leaves you with
a local annotation.  And it takes more than one additional
gesture to post an annotation to a server.  That imbalance
is worth correcting.

I vote for an additional icon, next to the save icon.

indeed.  We've been looking forward to mouseover support
in Amaya for a long time.  When it arrives, you can be sure
we're planning to use it within annotations.

I guess the documentation does not make the current
Annotations/configure dialog box sufficiently clear.  We
recognize that that dialog needs several significant
changes -- to easily deselect and reselect individual
query servers for example.  Marja and I have sketches
of what we think would be a much improved configure
dialog, and we had been waiting for the GTK support
to give better UI tools before proceeding.  Now that
the GTK support is more stable, we should be able
to make progress on this.

But your question points out a more fundamental
confusion; the "Annotation servers" list on the right
of the dialog are the servers to which queries are
sent when Amaya is searching for annotations.
The server to which a new annotation is POSTed
is determined from the single entry on the left  in
"Annotation post server".  Perhaps the word
"POST" should be capitalized or all-caps there
as a quick improvement.

The Post server is not queried unless it also appears
in the "Annotation servers" list.
