Some more information:

It happens when I follow the link from http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/ which is
marked 'Member Page', and have to authenticate. It is reproducible under
those circumstances...

  Start X server

  amaya http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF

  Follow the link 'Member Page'

and the X server crashes.

Cheers
