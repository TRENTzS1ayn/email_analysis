Hello,

I've noticed two bugs in amaya V4.3.2 concerning its support for XHTML
Basic.

1. amaya allows the use of <input> elements as child elements of a
<form> element. The is not allowed according to the XHTML Basic
recommendation.

2. amaya doesn't allow the attribute enctype in the <form> element. It
is allowed according to the XHTML Basic recommendation

Yours sincerely,

Rainer Hillebrand
