Some dialogs, eg, the "Open in new window" dialog, don't handle copy and paste 
well:  I cannot, even using xclipboard, paste in anything into the text field 
(once in a while it does paste something, but rarely what it is supposed to).

If someone's already reported this, sorry.

Amaya 6.2 from 8 July 2002 on Linux (from rpm) utilized.

thx,
george
