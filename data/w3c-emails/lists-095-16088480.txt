dear sir/madam,

i have some question about s schema and p schema
especially for MathML.

1.If we want load a mathml document, first we need to
load the p schema an s schema. There is a
LoadPresentationSchema function and
LoadStructureSchema function. What do these function
do? These function read form the file *.P or from file
*.prs ?
If it read form *.prs file how should i know the file
format in order to know what information that i read
from that file?

2. In the function LoadPresentationSchema, what is
done when amaya load the schema?

3. If we already load the schema we need to apply them
to an element (is it right?). How can amaya find the
rule for certain element. i.e: elemen mfrac have
a,b,and c rules?

I hope somebody can answer my question because i need
it for my final project.
i'm waiting for your answer as soon as possible. 

thank you very much

kind regards,

the fe ping
