Hi. I compiled Amaya 6.2 (Amaya-6-2 tag) and libwww (Amaya
tag) on Linux 2.4.19.

1- Does it compile with libpng 1.2.x ? I ask because configure
searches for 1.0.x and then compiles zlib and libpng.  Even if
it requires 1.0.x, couldn't it use the installed zlib ?

2- I get the following warning from GCC 3.2 when it compiles
libwww:

cc1: warning: changing search order for system directory "/usr/local/include"
cc1: warning:   as it has already been specified as a non-system directory

It's adding -I/usr/local/include

And here's an easy to fix:

In file included from ../../thotlib/view/initpses.c:26:
../../thotlib/internals/h/pattern.h:229:25: warning: no newline at end of file

I also had to manually include -I/usr/X11R6/GNOME/include and
-ltiff -lungif in 'Options'. Not sure why, as it included
-gdk_imlib.

3- Is there any way to compile from another partition ?  Like
/home/foo/objdir to /usr/local/src/CVS/Amaya ? To succeed I had
to compile from /usr/local/src/CVS/Amaya/objdir.
