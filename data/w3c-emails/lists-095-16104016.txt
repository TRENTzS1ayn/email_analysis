More precisely, the S schema is loaded first, and then the P schema,
which relies on the S schema.

They load the compiled schemas in core memory. But those are
internal functions. You should use the documented API:

   http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/APIman.toc.html

Refer to section 10.
No need to load a S schema explicitely. This is done by the
functions that create a new document (TtaNewDocument) or
load an existing document from a file (TtaOpenDocument).
Then you associate a P schema with the document with
function TtaSetPSchema.

From the .STR and .PRS files.

Why should you care about this file format? The above function
do the job for you.

It just loads the .PRS file and store it in core memory.
The internal representation is described in file typeprs.h
But I am not sure you need to go into those details. Use
the Thot API.

The thot library does it for you. When you have associated
a P schema with a document, the library applies this P schema
to all elements of that document.

Again, the Thotlib does it for you. See function TtaGetPRule (16.3.6)

May I suggest you use the list www-amaya-dev for this kind of message.
List www-amaya is for users, while www-amaya-dev is the appropriate
forum for developers.
