Hello Ulrich,

The handling of blocks/inline elements in Amaya is quite complex and works 
well on (almost) all documents. The problem with your document is that it 
doesn't contain the <body> element and that causes some 'troubles' to this 
handling.
If you add a <body> tag, the input elements will be aligned (except the last 
'submit' and 'reset' but I fixed that bug in the CVS base).

Regards,

Laurent
