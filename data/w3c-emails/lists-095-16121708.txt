hi,

Copy & paste can be finicky:  I lose the linebreaks pasting to preformatted 
(<pre></pre>) sections of an Amaya document in normal view if I'm copying from 
the same window.  Copying text from another window or from outside Amaya 
preserves the linebreaks fine.

But, if I try to paste in an amount of text exceeding about a page printed from 
say, Mozilla, nothing happens.  I know the text was copied because I can paste 
it into linux's xclipboard.  I have to copy in smaller chunks to paste to Amaya.

not a biggie, i can work around the problem.

Amaya 6.2 from 8 July 2002 on Linux (from rpm) utilized.

thanks,
george
