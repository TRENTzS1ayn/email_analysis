when a stylesheet has a null property i.e. an extraneous ; in it,
amaya reports a parse error although the w3.org validator does
not indicate an error. for example  body {color:black; ; background:white}
if this is not an error then Amaya should be fixed 
(but i am afraid i am too late for the coming release)
if it IS an error then hopefully the issue can be relayed to those
in charge of jigsaw...
just spotted this while helping someone else debug their problems
of course i would never do this myself ;-]  ;-]   ;-]   //
