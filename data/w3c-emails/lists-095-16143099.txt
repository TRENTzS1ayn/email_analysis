Many issues have been dealt with this time around. Thanks.
But there are still some to put on your 2.do list

1] class properties do not always override basic element rules

http://home.cogeco.ca/~ve3ll/home.htm
demonstrates this problem. I use a table to create a sidebar menu
the sidebar element rule is given as th.sb   with both background
set to light green and text-aligned to left justify.   Note that the 
page does not do this (but does in all other browsers).  If i move
the background and text-align properties to the basic th element
it displays ok ....   not a solution as basic td / th used in many places
on my site. just an indicator of what is misfunctioning....  the fact
that the sidebar table cell is classed as sb  is missed by Amaya
for some reason.

2] My weekend report missed the cut I guess.  css rules with null
properties (ie redundant semicolons) throws a parse error in Amaya
but not an error as far as the css validator is concerned.  A siimple
example is 
body {color:black;;;background:white}
