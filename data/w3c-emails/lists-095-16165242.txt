Hi,
     Thanks for eliminating the parsing error which used to occur in
relation to objects.

     I find it mystifying, however, that whenever an object is read in with
both height and width omitted then amaya explicitly adds in these two with
a value of 400 (px?).  If one of them is missing then the other is made the
same - being added in.

     I appreciate that the program - could- use these defaults (although I
rather suspect that the 'native' sizes of an image (say) would be a better
default.  What I do think is still a bug is that amaya actually writes out
the added width/height attributes - just to make things look bad
everywhere.

     Perhaps you could put this on the list of 'things to do' in relation
to objects and floats when time permits?

     Thanks for all your efforts - they are much appreciated.

                                        Keith Hopper
