    *   At the default AmayaPage.html, if I press the up arrow multiple
      times, the whole document is selected.
    * When the whole document is selected (html element), there is a
      bogus attribute listed called NoImages.  This seems to be related
      to the new preference.
    * There seem to be occasions when the vertical scroll bar is drawn
      in the wrong place.  This cannot be recreated consistently, however.
