Possibly related. When I copy an image from a different site (for example I
am working on http://www.w3.org/foo and I copy from
http://www.example.au/bar/) it copies fine.

(This is the behaviour described below, and where the image comes from a
different server I think it is a feature, but within the same file system I
think it is a bug).

But if the image is a link, and I copy the link and image then I only get the
image path as it was in the original, not the full URI. In the example above,
if on http://www.example.au/bar/ I copy the following code snippet:

  <a href="something"><img src="/images/icon" alt="don't do it"/></a>

(using the formatted view, of course) I get the following code inserted into
http://www.w3.org/foo:

  <a href="http://www.example.au/bar/something"><img src="/images/icon"
alt="don't do it"/></a>

(Actually it would be useful to have more control over whether links created
were relative, relative to the root, or absolute, especially when copying
them. I have thought a bit about that but the interface design is
complicated.)

But if the image is in a directory outside the directory of the document, Amaya creates an img tag with an absolute path (src="C:\etc...") instead of a relative path (src="..\etc..."). Is it a bug?
