All pending/suspected bugs in [1] are still present. Any idea of when they 
might be addressed -- particularly the dictionary interface?

I've further experiemented with this issue in an xhtml document and if I set 
the encoding to "us-ascii" Amaya converts the &deg; entity to its numeric 
form: &#xb0; . This makes sense as an XML document, but could not Amaya 
also preserve it as an XHTML document? Do I have to do something in my 
doctype to enable this preservation?
