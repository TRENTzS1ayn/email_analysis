Okay I read probably too quickly your message and we're not speaking about
the same use of Content-Location.

------------------
I have a resource available at "http://www.example.com/news/latest.html"
The server is smart enough to serve it with a Content-Location header with
a value of: "http://www.example.com/news/archived/2002/09/09/news.html"
The page is pointing to the previous news with a relative link of
According to RFC2616 [1] Section 14.14:
<<<
The value of Content-Location also defines the base URI for the
entity.
>>>
------------------
If I resume the suggested change:
- a relative link from that page should be resolved as relative to the 
Content-Location
  instead of the current URI.
- a Save of this page should use the Content-Location.
- a link from another page to that page should use also the Content-Location.

By example a link from http://www.example.com/D1.htm with the Content-Location
http://www.example.com/news/archived/2002/09/09/D1.htm to another page
http://www.example.com/D2.htm with the Content-Location
http://www.example.com/news/archived/2002/09/09/D2.htm
should generate the relative link "D2.htm"

In this case, why not forget the actual requested URI.
