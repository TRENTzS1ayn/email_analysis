Yves,

This sounds quite problematic. I understand using Content-Location for
solving Content-Negotiation problems when publishing. However, using it
as a Base URI is akin to making an unexplicit redirection. This
sounds problematic for an editor, and even when following links.

In the case of an editor, which URL should you use then when making
a link? The one given in the Content-Location? If you do so, then you
may break Content-Negotiation (e.g., linking to image.svg intead of
image, if image exists in many formats).

When following links, you would then follow them relative to the
Content-Location. For example, if open a document at www.example.org
that has a content location value of www.w3.org/, then the
next relative URL you'd browse from there would be taken directly from
www.w3.org and that's the URL we would show in the address field, just
like with a redirection. This sounds confusing.

If the server is able to add a Content-Location header that points
elsewhere than where the document actually is, it may be as easy to
make a redirection to the actual location of the document.

Can you give us some specific examples where this may be useful? 

Thanks!
