Content-Location is indicating where the real resource is. In the case I
described, you have http://www.example.com/news.html that have the
semantic of "latest URI" and
http://www.example.com/archives/2002/09/09/news.html have the semantic of
"news of 9/9/2002", so it is not about solving conneg issues, it's a
matter of semantic of URI.
Regarding Base URI resolving, RFC2616 has authority on this and say that
the Base URI is the one given in the Content-Location. If it is relative,
it is then computed from the request URI and this relative URI.

When you create a link, you are already in the document, unless you want
to edit and follow links from the linked doc, you don't even have to
compute the real URI for it. But if you are creating a relative link, then
yes you should compute it according to the base URI (it can be displayed
in the "add link" box, to tell the user that it is not the same as the URI
displayed in the location box).

Well, it is not confusing, links are opaque, so linking to the new site
directly won't make any difference for the user.

No, a redirection does have the same semantic! See the example above for
an example of why Content-Location may be semantically important.
