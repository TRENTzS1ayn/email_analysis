Yes (as it will make easier the ETag checking also).

The fact that the other page is served with a Content-Location is
orthogonal.
If I take your example:
http://www.example.com/D1.htm
Content-Location=http://www.example.com/news/archived/2002/09/09/D1.htm

If you want to link http://www.example.com/D2.htm (that has a specific
semantic), the relative link from D1 to D2 should be
../../../../../D2.htm, regardless of the Content-Location of D2, as
http://www.example.com/D2.htm and
http://www.example.com/news/archived/2002/09/09/D2.htm has a different
semantic. So deferencing the targeted resource is not needed and only the
first two points should be implemented. In fact, just one thing needs to
be modified, the computation of the base URI of the document.

As explained in another email, the requested URI has a specific semantic
which may be different from the URI in the Content-Location.
