Hi,

There are packages available for Mac OS X. To install it, you need to install
fink - http://fink.sourceforge.net - and then the amaya package. Once you
have installed fink you can use any of

  fink install amaya (compiles amaya)
  apt-get install amaya (gets a binary package)
  dselect (allows you to install many packages, including amaya)

It can take a while (a couple of hours on an old G3 to compile and install
everything) and there is quite a lot to download if you are doing it from
scratch but it is easy - a two step process for people who don't like doing
anything that smells like coding or scripting.

The latest currently available is Amaya 6.1 in Motif or GTK versions. If you
don't update fink from the 0.4 release version it will offer you Amaya
version 5.3

(could some of this information please be added to the Distributions page?)

Some vaguely technical detail (if you just want to install and go, ignore
this bit):

The package is put together (so far) by Damian Steer, and involved a few
changes to Makefiles for the 6.1 package (and the earlier 5.x packages). It
runs on X, so you need an X server. This is readily available - fink can
either install one, or recognise an existing one.

I have found a couple of stray bugs relating to screen refreshes, which are
not all Amaya's fault. In the main it seems to work as well as on any
platform.

cheers

Chaals
