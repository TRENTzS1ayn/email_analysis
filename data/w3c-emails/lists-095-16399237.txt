I'm not able to read german dialogues but they seem well displayed in my GTK 
6.4
version.
Could you point me to an dialogue entry that doesn't work?

It could be due to your glibc locale? I suspect more a choice of a specific 
font for your GTK dialogues.
Could you check your configuration file .gtkrc
