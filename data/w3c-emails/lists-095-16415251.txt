e.g. the following entries in de-amayadialogue

25 ?ffnen
26 ?ffnen (neues Fenster)...
33 DTD ?ndern

and all others that contain umlauts. Interestingly, the tool tips are displayed
correctly, even those containing umlauts, like

86 Zur?ck
87 Vorw?rts
97 ?berschrift Ebene 1

in de-amayamsg, but for instance "2 Zur?cksetzen" in de-amayamsg is not
displayed in dialogues.

However, when I replace umlauts by ascii characters, like e.g.
"2 Zuruecksetzen", Amaya displays the string correctly.

I don't have a .gtkrc in my home directory. There are a lot of files
/etc/gtk/gtkrc.<language>, but no /etc/gtk/gtkrc.de or /etc/gtk/gtkrc.en.
