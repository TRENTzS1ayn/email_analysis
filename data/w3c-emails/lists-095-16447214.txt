I just installed Amaya 6.4 (German, Windows) and the Transform Command does
not work at all.

This seems so stupid. Do you know what to do?

When I klick on the menu or when I use the shortcut nothing happens.
- I selected a list (which I know can be transformed)
- The html.trans is where it has to be.
- I do have my own shortcut in my own amaya.kb but that one worked fine on
6.1 so there should not be a problem.

Please help

Christoph
