Hello Christoph,

Actually, there is a bug in the Transform command on Windows. It comes from 
recent modifications we have made on popup menus. We have fixed it in the CVS 
base. Until it is released, you can use the few buttons of the toolbar or the 
Type menu to make transformations in Amaya.

Regards, 

Laurent
