This has been important in allowing people who are going to edit source code
to do more or less anything. You can synchronise before saving which will let
you know if there are parsing errors.

An exception to this, which I think is a bug, is that it does not correctly
test for the presence of an alt attribute, which is required by all HTML
versions implemented in Amaya.
