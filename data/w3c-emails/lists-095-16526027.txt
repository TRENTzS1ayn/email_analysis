So I tried to reproduce this (Amaya 6.1). It doesn't work with XHTML, only
with HTML, as far as I can figure.

What happens is that it is possible to introduce strange things into the
source of HTML, and Amaya corrects the markup when synchronising.

Does this match what you were doing? (And do you have a sample file or more
details?)

cheers
