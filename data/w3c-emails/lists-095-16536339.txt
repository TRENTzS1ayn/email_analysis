     I don't know whether the interesting problems I have been having with
documents originated elsewhere - for revision to current standards.

The document I have  been playing with is at 

     http://www.microdigital.co.uk/newsdesk/September02/thur19.htm

which claims to be HTML 3.2 - but isn't.  I loaded into Amaya 6.4 (linux
GTK version) and tried some simple editing - but Amaya kept indicating that
anywhere I wished to select was -

Graphics\area\map\td\tr\tbody\table\center\body\html\Document

and would not let me select it.  I thought to try and save it locally which
Amaya did - but didn't raise a protest either then or on an attempt to
reload it - that is all I can do apart from viewing many red marks on the
structure view and several lines in the parsing errors.  Might this be a
related problem??
