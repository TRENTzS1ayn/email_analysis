Dear Sir/madam,

I have some question about MathML in Amaya:

1. There are several display function for displaying
box. I want to know what display function are invloved
in displaying MathML. I think they are :
DisplayJustifiedText(), DisplaySymbol(),
DisplayBorder(). (correct me if i'm wrong please ?)
because i think math expression only consist character
and symbol.

2. if i have MathML like this:
<math>
  <mroot>
    <mi>a<mi>
    <mi>n<mi>
  </mroot>
</math>

I think the tree structure like this:

       main root
           |
          math
           |
         mroot
           |
        mn    mn
         |     |
         a     n

but when i trace the code, i find out that when it
call
chechMathSubExpression() function the tree become :

       main root
           |
          math
           |
         mroot
           |
  Baseroot   index
     |         |
     mn       mn
     |         |
     a         n

Am i right or wrong? Why is it become like that?

So i also get confuse with the tree of abstract box.
Can somebody tell me the structure of the document
tree and abstarct box tree ??

Irene told me to compile Amaya with -DAMAYA_DEBUG, but
there are no file created (view.debug and box.debug ?)

Can someone give me a hint please?

Thank you.

kind regards,

Hui Ping
