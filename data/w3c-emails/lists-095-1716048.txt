They are both open source projects. That's the major similarity. The second
similarity is that they aim to implement the specifications properly. (And
they are both browsers)

The difference is that Amaya is a test-bed for implementing specifications,
whereas Mozilla aims to be a "commercial" product in the way that Netscape
was. A more important differnce for a user is that Amaya aims to be an editor
as well as a browser - so that while you are browsing and you decide you want
to add a llink or something you can, whereas Mozilla seperates these two
functions into two different pieces of software (slightly bundled together in
the package you download).

  I just joined the list so I'm an admitted newbie.  Would someone explain to
  me the major differences between the Mozilla and the Amaya browers?  Aren't
  they both open source projects?
