Hi Coralie,

As explained Laurent we cannot reproduce the bug probably because we didn't
play the same scenario.
Do you remember how the bug was generated: It was the first time you created 
the
image with its alt attribute? Or did you only update the alt value.
Where is the image in the document structure? A paragraph, a table?
