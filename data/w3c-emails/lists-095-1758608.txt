Hi Irene, all,

I'm using a script that works on a directory containing described images
(jpgs) and thumbnails and it produces the index.html (and index001.html,
etc.).

The page contains a table of 4 x 4 cells, each cell containing a
thumbnail linked to its large image, an alt (that I am not supposed to
edit, unless the descriptions I entered via rdfpic failed) and a title.

The page (that I eventually corrected last night on the amaya running on
unix (semir update at each release) which is amaya V4.3.2 of 23mar2001)
is at 
http://www.w3.org/People/CMercier/Walks/Madrid2001/Jun02/index003.html

I hope it will help you reproduce the bug.

Thanks
