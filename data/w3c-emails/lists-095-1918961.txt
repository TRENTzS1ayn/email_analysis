One goal of future versions of Amaya should be to prevent
parse errors on the relatively small number of internet pages
that actually pass the validator.w3.org  criteria.  
it is very frustrating to resolve whether it is a page error 
or a Amaya error when validated pages fail !!!
for example:
 http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-basic/
validates but throws parse errors......
i think the group is already aware of the mathml pages
which validate but throw parse errors. these are mostly 
attributes yet to be included.
but this one on the xhtml-basic page is new to me.
