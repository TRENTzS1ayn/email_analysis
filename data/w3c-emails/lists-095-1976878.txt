I am using the optional multikey method   and windows 98 binary 
and have found  that star O   and star o  Oslash  and oslash 
  do not work.   Aring and aring can be achieved with *A and *a !

also would it be possible to add thorn and eth characters as well.
perhaps the star prefix for these would do -- not as apparent as standard
compose method though.

and while using the help window i found that save geometry would
not save the reposition info for help window.
