Hello,

I just used Amaya for the first time and would like to offer some
feedback. I'm using version 4.3.2 on FreeBSD 4.3.

I sought out Amaya because I was looking for a visual HTML editor that
works on FreeBSD, and  Amaya is one of the very few that fits that bill.
Thanks for your work on it and thanks for donating to the web community!

I like the Annotation feature (I've been exploring  Annozilla as well) and
I like the unique "Transform" function. Now here are some suggestions to
improve it:

* I wanted to delete an empty table column, but I couldn't find a way to
visually select it to use the "delete column" function.

* The method of adding table columns is unintuitive. I'm fond of the
Dreamweaver method (using contextual menus) of manipulating tables.

* The shortcut keys for "cut" "copy" and "paste" make no sense to me. Why
not use the standard "x" and "v" keys instead?

* After deleting the first column in a 3 column table by accident, I used
the "undo" command to fix it. Instead of correcting the mistake, Amaya
very slow re-rendered the table..with about 20 columns.

At least for now, it looks like it's going to be faster for me to
manipulate table designs by hand.  I'll check in with a future version of
Amaya and see how it it's coming along.

Thanks,

  -mark
