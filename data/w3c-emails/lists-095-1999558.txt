Hi,

I wrote the unix version keyboard shortcuts, and based them on a set of
shortcuts I was used to for emacs, which was more or less a standard in Unix
shells and editors. There is a help page which explains how to configure your
keyboard shortcuts, but one thing you can do is copy the cut and paste lines
from teh windows file into your unix keybnoard file - they use
windows-standard ctrl-X, ctrl-C, ctrl-V.

For deleting a table column you only need to select a cell in the column, but
it looks like you have found that. Because Amaya is a structure editor to
start with it will need to be able to select non-contiguous ranges to select
table columns - Jose will know how hard or easy that will be.

Cheers

Charles McCN

  Hello,

  I just used Amaya for the first time and would like to offer some
  feedback. I'm using version 4.3.2 on FreeBSD 4.3.

  I sought out Amaya because I was looking for a visual HTML editor that
  works on FreeBSD, and  Amaya is one of the very few that fits that bill.
  Thanks for your work on it and thanks for donating to the web community!

  I like the Annotation feature (I've been exploring  Annozilla as well) and
  I like the unique "Transform" function. Now here are some suggestions to
  improve it:

  * I wanted to delete an empty table column, but I couldn't find a way to
  visually select it to use the "delete column" function.

  * The method of adding table columns is unintuitive. I'm fond of the
  Dreamweaver method (using contextual menus) of manipulating tables.

  * The shortcut keys for "cut" "copy" and "paste" make no sense to me. Why
  not use the standard "x" and "v" keys instead?

  * After deleting the first column in a 3 column table by accident, I used
  the "undo" command to fix it. Instead of correcting the mistake, Amaya
  very slow re-rendered the table..with about 20 columns.

  At least for now, it looks like it's going to be faster for me to
  manipulate table designs by hand.  I'll check in with a future version of
  Amaya and see how it it's coming along.

  Thanks,

    -mark
