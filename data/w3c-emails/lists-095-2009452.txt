Mike,

Amaya is probably not the best tool you may use to edit templates.
Amaya tries to produce valid documents, but Velocity templates,
as far as I understand, are not valid HTML or XML documents. They are
made of a mix of HTML fragments and VTL statements and the result is
not usually valid HTML. I guess this is the reason why Amaya strip
out some VTL statements.

Vincent.
