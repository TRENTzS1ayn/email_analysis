Then how come that I may provoke line breaks when changing Netscape
window width near
http://icking-music-archive.sunsite.dk/scores/Instr.html#furchheim? I
hint at pairs of .ps.gz and .pdf links in a list item containing sheet
note scores for a recorder arrangement of a composition by Furchheim.
The postscript links arre textually marked with the names of the scores
while the pdf links all have a small red icon. I want to prevent line
breaks between these pairs but get them nevertheless by varying the
width of the browser window.

The html file used for this page is
ftp://sunsite.dk/projects/icking-music-archive/web/scores/Instr.html
generated with a perl tool from
ftp://sunsite.dk/projects/icking-music-archive/web/scores/Instr_src.html.
The latter file was first emacs edited and afterwards taken into amaya
and re-saved. I've stored a copy of Instr_src.html as it was before the
amaya-save as
ftp://sunsite.dk/projects/icking-music-archive/web/scores/Instr_src_with_nbsp.html
