This is the result of a test I did:

 D   e   t   a   i   l 240   D   e   t   a

The 240 is tbe result of Amaya re-saving this:

 D   e   t   a   i   l   &   n   b   s   p   ;   D   e   t   a

(od -c output from Cygwin using using NT V 4.2.1 Amaya).

Either your problem is platform sensitive or some other
tool is not 8 bit clean.  As the above version saves
a valid non break space character.
