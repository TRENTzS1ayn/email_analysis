As Christian points out &nbsp; is changed to a regular space.
In addition &shy; is changed to an ordinary hyphen.

This is of course incorrect as the character entities have different
interpretation than the ordinary characters when looking at line
breaking for wraps ---  
&nbsp; should as the name implies NOT BREAK!
&shy; should not display unless it is used as a breaking point
  then it should be last character on the broken line.

Hoping there is still time to get these fixs in next version.
