After creating a new document, i used the menu command
 file -- exit 
This caused an abrupt exit without a save file dialog !!!
All other editors i have used would sense changed text buffer
 and prompt to save / nosave / cancel . 
It must be exciting for those who are unaware of Amaya's method
and type lots of material before closing....   
 I just lost the classic foo bar line (without no break space ) ;-[  ;-[
