NO. It's saved with the ISO-latin-1 code of the non-breakable space
when the document is saved in ISO-latin-1 like &agrave; is saved
as ?. If you save your document in us-ascii the entity &nbsp;
will be generated.
In the next release, you will be able to choose the saving encoding, so you
can generate entities if you're mor comfortable with them.

Amaya doesn't use the technology of the soft hyphen to find a breakable 
position in a word.
But Amaya is able to hyphenate paragraph. It implements an algorithm that
is able to find a right breakable position in words according of the current 
language. It works for English, French, Italian, Spanish, etc.
