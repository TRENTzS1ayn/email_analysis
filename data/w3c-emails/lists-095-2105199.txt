What is the procedure for entering character entities other
than those on the accented characters list.
For example thorn is missed as well as the representations
for cent, pound sterling, euro, copyright etc.

Perhaps the page that deals with accented characters can be expanded
to include all the entities (ie generalized).  Personally I would 
like to see pallets for this but for the moment if the procedure
was clearly documented (and a help menu pointer to same)
that would suffice.
