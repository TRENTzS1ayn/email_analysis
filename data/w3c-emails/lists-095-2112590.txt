As mentioned, the next version will allow user to pick ascii/iso filetypes
Anticipating utf-8 in the future and issues with existing docs vs new
may i suggest a dialog that uses radio buttons to pick and segmenting
 new from old. Something like:

 New Document FileType
  [.] Ascii 
  [ ] Iso -####

 Existing Document Fileype
  [ ] Ascii
  [ ] Iso - ######
  [*] Use stated type - none stated gives Ascii
  [ ] Use stated type - none stated gives Iso 

This could easily extend to any types amaya chooses to support.
And it would prevent accidental conversion of entities when undesired.
Someone has already mentioned a browser that doesn't deal with iso well
so any user/author should be able to select filetypes to avoid those 
situations.
