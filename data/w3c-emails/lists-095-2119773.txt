The normal OS mechanism, e.g. for Windows,
ALT-0163, or cut and paste from charmap.
For GBP, of course, you just type in, if you
are using a British keyboard.

There are around 60,000 numeric entities.  XML only has
four or five named character entities common to all 
applications.

If it's not clearly documented, and you are using Windows,
complain to Microsoft.

[DJW:]  Chinese on a non-Chinese build of Windows is more
difficult (Amaya doesn't support such characters yet, though);
you have to enter them into a form in IE and then cut and
paste them (works to get them into paintbrush).  Actually, 
Mozilla appears to hook into the the Chinese input method that
is provided for IE and allows one to compose in Chinese without
subterfuges.  This is for NT; I think that Win 98 Unicode 
support is less good.

Character input methods really ought not to be the realm of
individual applications.
