The WAI Evaluation and Repair Tools group is looking at developing a metadata
language that describes the accessibility status of web pages, including
information about pages as a whole (for example is it valid) and information
about particular elements (for example does the alt text for an image make
sense, does it need a long description, ...).

This is likely to be in XML, and probably in RDF. Is there any interest in
using a language like this in Amaya - either in generating the information,
or in using it (for example to identify images that are missing an
alternative and asking the author to supply one)?

One possiblity is that it could be an interesting extension to the
annotations work being done.

Cheers
