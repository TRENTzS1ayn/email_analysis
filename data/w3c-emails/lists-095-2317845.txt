The goal is to provide information that may not be apparent from teh source
code itself. For example, it is impossible to know from HTML source that an
alt attribute actually does what it is meant to do. So having identified that
a particular one does, it is helpful if an editor can open the document, find
the images where an alt attribute has been identified as being useful, and
ask the author to confirm the rest...

(this is one example of a large number of use cases.)

  I'd welcome developments in this area.  If pages were accessible would
  people have had to invent WML?  My concern is that metadata on the web
  has already been abused (search engine stuffing) -- are people going to
  generate false calaims of accessibility?  If the page source is a
  necessary and sufficient input to determine accessibility, what is gained
  by having metadata?  Or is this for use in search engines for ranking
  pages, for example, where you don't want to go through the source of
  each page every time, and standards would assist in realistic evaluation
  of pages?

  As for Amaya -- I'd like to see more support for existing
  accessibility features such as "accesskey" -- which I'm not sure if I'm
  using correctly.  I've not tried the latest version yet though, I admit.
