I installed the RPM on my machine, RedHat 7.0.  When I tried to launch, the
program opened, then immediately closed, and the terminal window I opened
Amaya from gave this error:

libpng error: Application uses deprecated png_read_init() and must be
recompiled
.
ping read image error
*** Thot: irrecoverable error ***


I tried following the instructions for building the source, but it said that
I did not have Motif installed (I do have Lesstif 0.92? installed), and
frankly, I have no experience with compilers. Can anyone help?

Can anyone suggest a version of Amaya that will work and is available as RPM
(sorry to be a wimp, but)?  I used 2.4 a lot on RH6.2, but ever since I
upgraded to 7.0 I've had problems (I didn't try 2.4 on RH7.0).
