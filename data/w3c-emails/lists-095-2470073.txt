If you have a look at the CVS version of Amaya, you can see that the support 
of shortcuts on Windows platforms has been re-implemented and access-keys are
now available.
Amaya handles a lot of shortcuts: a set for browsing functions, a set for 
views,
a set for HTML editing, a set for MathML editing, etc.
I don't know if we made a good choice when defining the configuration file
amaya.kb, so your remarks/suggestions are welcome.

This was due to a feature not already exploited that allows Amaya to show
with special characters normal-spaces, unbreakable-spaces, line-break, etc.
Amaya is also able to justified lines on the screen and displays words at the
right position in the line.
We may add a specific mode that displays line by line.

I don't know what I can do for improving the current situation.
