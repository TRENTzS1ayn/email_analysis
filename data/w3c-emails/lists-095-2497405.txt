[DJW:]  These have been deprecated for about 4 years now
and nearly all the first rank high profile sites (Microsoft,
Deja, AltaVista, Google, etc.) do not use them, at least for
home pages.

Amaya is only secondarily a viewer, it is primarily an editor
aiming to create strict HTML. (Nontheless there are various 
features for viewing non-compliant pages - however frames is
such a major feature, that I'd doubt the developers would ever
consider them.)

[DJW:]  Incidentally the site quoted has severe accessibility
problems in this area as there is just a condescending message
instead of a useful <noframes> section.  The frame names are 
better than many, but only marginally useful in terms of the
de facto work round used by text mode browsers for framesets
with semantically broken <noframes> elements.

[DJW:]  
Client side image maps seem to be broken on NT4 - the areas are
in the wrong place.  Also, the plain text view fails to show them,
whereas they ought to be displayed, at least conditionally - there
is an alternative way of specifying them which falls back better
to browsers that don't understand client side maps at all, which
I guess is what Amaya is trying to simulate in the alternative
view, and why it doesn't show them, but the most likely text only
browser, Lynx, shows the image as a link to a virtual page
containing
links for each of the areas.

Note the current consensus in the presentationalist world is
that one should use table mosaic's, partly because the structure
is apparent before all the images have loaded (although mouseovers
are probably an another factor).

I think the current accessibility position is that you should not
do text as graphics.

[DJW:]  Amaya is intended to be politically correct software.
It's aim is to create valid HTML.  On the other hand, whilst 
scheme guessing doesn't add to its primary goals, it probably
doesn't get in the way either.  Personally I always key in the
schema and trailing slashes, etc. into IE.

[DJW:]  These are just my views.  I know the team have their own
views as to which real life web site features they will work around,
even when there is no benefit to the editor function.
