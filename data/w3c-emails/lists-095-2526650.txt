Well, I noticed that Dave mentioned that Frames have been deprecated for
FOUR YEARS. Granted, there is a disconnect in both HTML Strict and XHTML
Strict and the Frameset DTDs that effectively deprecate Frames, but this
deprecation has not be formally acknowledged. I'd like to recommend that
they BE formally deprecated, if that is the intent.

I can live without Frames. We're currently doing away with them on our
sites. It would help if W3C would be more definitive about this issue.
