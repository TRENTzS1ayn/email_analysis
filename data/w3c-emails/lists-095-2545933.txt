Well! I was wondering whether each frame could not be automatically opened
in a separate Amaya window (the <noframes> section would be displayed in the
original window). This would of course not render a site exactly like a 
frame-supporting browser would, but it could still allow one to edit the 
content of each frame.

That kind of support might not be too hard to add to Amaya. But would
people consider it useful?

Peace,

Bertrand Ibrahim.
