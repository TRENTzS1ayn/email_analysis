It's a use of XML in the same way as HTML (and 
XML) are uses of SGML.  XML defines a framework,
but you must actually define some elements before
it becomes useful; the same for SGML.

[DJW:]  
HTML was supposed to have minimal presentation implications
and when the commercial browsers started violating this rule,
quite seriously, CSS was developed to try and remove presentation.
Ideally, HTML should have semantics but no guaranteed presentation.
XHTML is the same.  XML and SGML don't even fully define the
syntax, let alone the semantics and need DTDs (or XML schemas) to
do this.

[DJW:]  
As pointed out above, you can do that with HTML on an ideal
browser.  I'll leave it to the Amaya team to say what is 
hard coded in Amaya.

[DJW:]  
XHTML becomes a namespace.  I don't know how well Amaya supports
general namespaces.  Again one for the development team.

[DJW:]  
Amaya has no scripting support.  I don't remember any
mention of XSL.  Development team to confirm.  Obviously, what
it produces can be manipulated by agents that do.

[DJW:]  
Amaya is one of these.

[DJW:]  By definition, pure XHTML documents cannot
include other namespaces.  I suspect, however that
Amaya can mix namespaces (it can certainly mix in MathML),
and therefore create multi-namespace documents, not just
XHTML namespace ones. 

Amaya cannot create badly formed documents.  I don't remember
the DTD support needed to prevent invalid ones.

Amaya is a test bed for CSS!

I'm not aware of any transformation tools in Amaya, but any
third party tools ought to work on what it produces.

I sense that you have been sold the benefits of XML without
actually really being told what XML is.
