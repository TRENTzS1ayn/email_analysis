This is on our TODO list.

I guess the introduction of SVG generated the problem. We'll check.

It's for platforms that have no pre-installed libraries or in the case where
available libraries are incompatible.
You can configure and build with your own libraries.

To avoid to enter file:// when you are loading a local file it needs
to check the local file system first then access the network.
We didn't spend time on this feature but if any external contributor can 
contribute
there. Any volunteer?

This is a limitation of the used widget.
Probably the best would be to send a message when clicking on the mail address.
Who knows how to do that?
