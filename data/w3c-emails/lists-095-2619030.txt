Not much. Default style for HTML pages is defined within Amaya.
This default style may be changed easily. It's defined in a single,
separate file (amaya/HTMLP.P), but it's not CSS. Formatting and
style for MathML is defined the same way (in file amaya/MathMLP.P).

You can use CSS style sheets, or the HTML <style> element, or the
HTML style attribute to change the default style with CSS.

Amaya provides general support for namespaces, I mean there is a
general mechanism for mixing various namespaces in the same document.
XHTML is really handled by Amaya as a namespace, as well as MathML or
SVG.  In the latest release, you can author SVG documents (documents
whose root element is <svg>) and in those documents you can include
pieces of XHTML or MathML.
Conversely, you can inlcude piece of MathML or SVG within XHTML pages,
or pieces of SVG containing MathML, and so on.
There is a limitation in the current version, though. Amaya can handle
only a few predefined namespaces: XHTML, MathML, SVG, XLink. And not
all those namespaces are fully implemented (only presentation part of
MathML, only a few SVG elements and attributes, only simple links from
XLink).
The Amaya team has plans for supporting any namespace, the style being
defined by a CSS style sheet. A future version will also allow several,
not predefined namespaces to be mixed in a single document. But don't
expect the editor to have a very smart behavior with those unknown
namespaces.

Right. There is no plan currently to embed an ECMAscript or XSL engine.

Right - see above.

And the implementation of CSS is not complete yet, but a reasonable
set of features exists.
