Actually I would find it useful if there were an option to open a link in a
new window. (At the moment I use a hack - type a space or something into the
current window...)

  Well! I was wondering whether each frame could not be automatically opened
  in a separate Amaya window (the <noframes> section would be displayed in the
  original window). This would of course not render a site exactly like a
  frame-supporting browser would, but it could still allow one to edit the
  content of each frame.

  That kind of support might not be too hard to add to Amaya. But would
  people consider it useful?

  Peace,

  Bertrand Ibrahim.
