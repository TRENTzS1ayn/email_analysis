[DJW:]  Background is not a legal attribute for table
elements in either strict or transitional HTML 4.0x.
(bgcolor is legal but deprecated in the transitional
language).

I would say the bug was that it neither converted the
attribute into 'style="background-image: url(...)....', nor
coded it as red in the structure view, allowing its deletion.
(I think it is in a half way house, where it has actually been
rendered as part of the error recovery, and therefore exists too
much to delete character by character in the structure view, but
not enough to delete the whole attribute name!)

As I understand it, Amaya is a validating editor for
HTML 4 and upwards and the GUI will not allow the insertion of
code which violates one of the relevant DTDs.
