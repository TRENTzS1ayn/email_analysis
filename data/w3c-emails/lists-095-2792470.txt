To the members of this list this may be a trivial question, but I will 
ask it anyway.

I teach our undergraduate students the basics of HTML as part of a module 
on "information technology for economists". I get them to do some manual 
tagging, starting from a simple ascii text file, before letting them 
explore Amaya. The problem I face is that there appears to be no browser 
which is strict in its interpretation of HTML tags and students often 
produce working scripts which are badly constructed.

I came across Amaya when looking to deal with this problem, but Vincent 
QUINT's recent remark elegantly summarises the situation. So, is there a 
browser available which does process only strict HTML?
