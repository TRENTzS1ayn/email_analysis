Hi,

On my NT workstation I have two user (Mel & MelAdmin) name who share the
same profile. This profile is store under the  D:\WINNT\Profiles\Mel folder.
After using Amaya a file (thot.rc) and a folder (annotations) appear under a
newly created D:\WINNT\Profiles\MelAdmin\Amaya.

I have no other comment on Amaya yet because I haven't any time to test it.

Regards,

Marcel Eric

P.S: Any comments and corrections of my written English are welcome . I'm
still learning.
