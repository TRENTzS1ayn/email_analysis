Hello,


I am just descovering Amaya today and find it has some very goog features.

I was nevertheless astonished that some sites show bad, for example
  http://www.sidos.ch.
http://www.snf.ch
http://www.uib.no/nsd/
http://www.data-archive.ac.uk/
mostly because of difficulties with frames. I did look at the archives of 
this list to find some information: I found ideas about the sens of 
framing, no hint that frames are not welcome to this browser.

Secondly: while browsing, I prefer helvetica fonts to times fonts. Is there 
any way to change the setting? I did not find any.

Thanks in advance
