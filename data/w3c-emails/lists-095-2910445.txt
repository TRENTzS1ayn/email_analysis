No.  Are you looking for Windows, Linux, or Mac? For Windows, I'd suggest
XMLWriter, which while it uses MSXML3 as a default, allows you to add other
transformation engines (like XALAN) as user tools.  It's less expensive than
XMLSpy, and less ... "Visual."

See www.xmlwriter.com .  The license is a little under US$50.00 (it's an
Australian company).
