I recently found that one of my local government depts. had revamped
their web site, soI decided to check it out with Amaya 4.2.1.

It seems to have discovered an amaya problem:

Most of hte pages have no parse errors, however some show:

*** Errors in
http://www.fairtrading.wa.gov.au/charities/links/index.shtml temp
file: /home/users/johnd/.amaya/1/index.shtml   line 68, char 66:
Panic: buffer overflow

What does this mean??
