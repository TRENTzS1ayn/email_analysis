Hi,

Does anybody know of a way to open a new window with an already running instance of Amaya ? I do not want to open a new one. It could be something like the " -remote "openURL(an_url,new-window)"" command line options of Netscape Navigator.
I'm running Amaya 4.2.1 with Gnome on a Linux box if this can help...

Best regards,

Serge Torres
