The following style sheet works as expected on
NS 6 and IE5.01, but, on Amaya 4.2.1 NT:

- The submenu links are still blue (which doesn't go well with
  the blue background!);

- The list marker is well below the baseline (interestingly,
  NS4 gets it well above the top!)

- The graphic list marker is not used (but that may be a 
  known limitation, or a problem with BASE handling - the 
  grahic is being taken from the real site).

(I've tidied up the table structures (particularly colspan!!), from
the base document <http://www.sid.cam.ac.uk/indepth/indepth.html>
and stripped out nearly all the presentational markup, replacing the
simulated list with a real list, and moved the styles to the head.)

Style sheet:


<STYLE type="text/css"><!--
A { text-decoration: none }

A:hover { text-decoration: underline }

body {font-family: "Sabon,Garamond,Arial,Helvetica" }

ul li { list-style: url(../navyball.gif) disc ;
        margin-top: 0.5em;
        margin-bottom: 1em; }

tr.submenu td { background-color: #000088; 
             color: white; 
             width: 8em; 
             height: 2em;
             text-align: center;
             font-family: "Arial,Helvetica";
             font-weight: bold;
           }

tr.submenu a:link {color: white; }
-->
</STYLE>
