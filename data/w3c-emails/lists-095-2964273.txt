Dear Sir or Madam:
I just finished a document (http://arts.bev.net/roperldavid/rollovers.xml) 
using amaya to create it. Here are some comments I share with you about amaya:
    * I like it very much. I plan to use it much in the future.
    * I liked very much being able to see the source alongside the wysiwyg; 
especially nice is the pointer showing in the source where the wysiwyg 
cursor is.
    * I have the editor set for non-adjustment of text in the editor and it 
shows that way when browsing it from the Internet; however, when I print 
it, it comes out adjusted at both margins. How does one change that?
    * It would be very helpful if some colored small carets could be made 
to delineate where structures begin and end. I constantly had troubles 
adding to equations outside a fraction, sup, etc. It is difficult to tell 
whether one is inside or outside a structure.
    * I had considerable trouble adding equations and text inside elements 
of tables. Some times some extra test "searchable index..." mysterious 
appeared, also. Some times the table got completely screwed up.
    * When a table is at the end of a document, the only way I could figure 
out how to add more info after the table was to go into the source view to 
do it. I think the same is true if an equation is at the end.
    * I couldn't figure out how to get a space after an equation to 
separate ordinary text from the previous equation.
    * It would be nice to have a MathML help/tutorial available in the 
amaya help.
    * It would be nice to have frame support.
Thanks for all the fine work all of you have done!

Yours, Dave Roper
