Only, if you specify both height _and_ width.

Unfortunately not.

It _is_ my intention to scale my pictures dynamicly according
to the screenresolution! Ok, I know this is not very usual,
but where is the problem?

If you view my page with e.g. Netscape 4.7 or MS-InternetExplorer
and change the size (more precise: the height) of the window you
will know what I mean.
