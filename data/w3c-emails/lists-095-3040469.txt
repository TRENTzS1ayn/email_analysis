Hello, I've been using Amaya casually, not really using it to actually do
anything. I've mostly been just playing around with it :), and I couldn't
find any support for layers, and was wondering if there is in fact support
for layers, or if layer support is going to be incorporated into Amaya soon.
Perhaps someone could clear this up for me.

Thank you.
