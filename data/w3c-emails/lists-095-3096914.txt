By default Amaya prints with the css rule text-decoration: justify

The structure view can help here: when you select in the structure view you
know exactly where you are.

Yes we have to improve the editing within tables.

A sequence of returns will provide a paragraph.

Normally you can add a Control Space at the begging of the next text or you
can play with margins.

Certainly, but the team is very busy. It would be great if one provides a
first version of it.

We don't plan to work on that.
