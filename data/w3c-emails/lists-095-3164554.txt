This is invalid HTML (height may only be specified in pixels
in TD elements) and attempts to create a circular reference,
in that the only reasonable interpretation is % of row height,
which depends on the maximum height of any cell in that row.

Also, if Amaya treats BR as being a paragraph break, and inserts
that break into the object model seen by CSS, it is broken.
BR is an inline element and cannot create a new block element.

[DJW:]  I suspect % heights on images are only useful when
a containing element's height is specified using CSS.
