This is a follow-up to a bug report from about a year ago. I finally
figured out the DNS issue I reported, and it was not Amaya's fault at all.
In fact, my name server set-up was incorrect. My server worked with libc5
based programs, but not with libc6 (=glibc2) based programs. As my system
was mainly libc5, but Amaya was one of the few libc6 applications, I
incorrectly suspected Amaya. By the way, the fix was very simply once
traced down. The file /etc/resolv.conf needed to get the line "nameserver
127.0.0.1" added.
Well, one loose end tied up!
Uwe
