height is defined as a Length
Length: The value (%Length; in the DTD) may be either a %Pixel; or a 
percentage of the available
horizontal or vertical space. Thus, the value "50%" means half of the 
available space.

problems.

The pseudo paragraph is generated just to keep in mind the area width in which
BR and images are set inline.
