Sorry if this has been dealt with before, but I am having trouble building
Amaya 4.2.1 from the source tarball.  

I created .../Amaya/solaris (this is on Solaris 2.7) and did 
"../configure --prefix=/devel/local" but it complained about not finding
libwww sources.  I retrieved w3c-libwww-5.3.2 and untarred it at the same
level as Amaya and made a symlink to libwww.  The configure then runs
without error, but the "make all" blows up.  It looks like after it 
completes the libpng it returns to the solaris directory and starts to
rerun configure.  It then complains "configure: error: source directory 
already configured; run make distclean there first" followed by 
"libwww is configured" then "/bin/sh: libwww/modules/md5: does not exist"

Have I missed something obvious here?
