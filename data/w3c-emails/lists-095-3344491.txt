Hi,

The error was in old versions like 3.2 which handled ISO-latin-1 files
without setting the encoding
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?>

The version 4.0  detected these errors and proposed to set the encoding.
Today the best solution is to add  encoding="iso-8859-1" in the xml
declaration in the source view and save the document FROM the source view 
(not from the formatted view).

HTML and XML use a different default encoding and tools (including previous
versions of Amaya) didn't take care of that difference. I guess it's already
the case today for a lot of browsers that parse HTML and XHTML documents 
with the same parser.
Sorry for the inconvenience.

It should work better after that change.
