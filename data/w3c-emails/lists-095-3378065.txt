Irene -

This was from the source tar file, and I finally figured out what happened.
After I unpacked the source, I started the ../configure, and at the same
time
I started deleting stuff from old versions of Amaya.  I expected the libwww
included with the source to be somewhere below the Amaya directory, not at
the
same level, so I deleted it thinking it was from an older version.

I re-extracted, and everything configures and compiles fine.

Thanks for the help, and sorry for my confusion.

Jack

---------------------------

I didn't understand if you downloaded the source tar file or the CVS
version.
The source tar file is complete and include libwww sources.
Installation form CVS is explained in our page
http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/cvs
