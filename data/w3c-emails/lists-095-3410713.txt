To: Amaya List<www-amaya@w3.org>

On my home system, but not on my work system. Both are SPARC
Solaris 8.  At home, when opening or saving a file, there are
no subdirectories shown in my home directory in the browse dialog.
Anywhere else in the file system seems fine.  I tried starting
Amaya in another directory; it still will not show any directories
under my home directory.  Permissions are generally drwxr-xr-x and 
-rw-r--r--.  If I type a subdirectory at the end of e.g. a file:
URL, Amaya opens that directory and displays its subs, if any.
Is this something I have configured oddly?
