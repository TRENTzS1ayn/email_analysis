There's no way of properly sizing them as the HTML calls for them to be
180% + the width of an image, of the total width of the table!  Actually
percentages are invalid in this context, so the widths are undefined.

Also, you have two, mutually contradictory, content-type meta elements.

There are a large number of parsing errors (more than Amaya shows, even 
in Views|Show Parsing Errors).
