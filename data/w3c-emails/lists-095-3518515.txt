Hi,

there seems to be a big problem wiht Amaya 4.3 and HTML-Code for Umlauts
like &Uuml; because Amaya inserts a line break after each Umlaut-code
and does not convert the Code in the structure display any more
(LINUX-ELF version).
This is not so much of a problem in normal text but it definitely is a
problem with umlauts in the Document Title or in the "alt=" section of
an image tag because Amaya doesn't display the whole title then. Version
4.2.1 didn't show that behaviour.

Armin
