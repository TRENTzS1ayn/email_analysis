Very nice job! Now that I can use my keyboard and dialog boxes in an 
intuitive manner, the class of things I edit with Amaya has greatly 
increased. I've noted a few other things given this greater experience:


1. In 4.3 the CSS background/foreground colors of an HTML document are no 
longer displayed!
2. In the Win2K left-click-open-with-option, Amaya has the name of "libwww".
3. It isn't surprising that it doesn't, but it would be nice if Amaya could 
understand Windows file shortcuts (so I could edit files from my Desktop).
4. When I close a window, sometimes that view closes, sometimes the
whole document. This inconsistency drives me a bit nutty. I'm not sure if 
it's a bug, or if I don't understand the heuristic of when views have been 
synched/linked and when not...
5. Silly question that must be answered somewhere: how do I keep the target 
view (bulls-eye) on by default?
6. Also, if I want to copy some text *including* its hypertext from within 
or between amaya windows, how do I do that?
