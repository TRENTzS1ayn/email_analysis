Hi 

Can anyone tell me if it is possible create word processor style documents in
Amaya 4.3? 

We currently write documents in Word and would like to be able to produce XML
tagged documents, to a standard (DTD, or Schema?) of our choosing and save them
in a searchable database.

The other thing which would be very helpful would be the ability to do
spreadsheet quality calculations.  

Would documents created in Amaya be compatible with Word and Excel?

I will be very pleased if anyone can help.

Neil Smith
