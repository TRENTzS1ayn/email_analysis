Hello,

Amaya seems to favor left to right selection in the address field
when the whole field is selected.

1. Launch Amaya. My copy says: /home/slesch/Amaya/amaya/AmayaPage.html
2. Insert cursor to the right of .html and select the address by
    dragging to the left. The address becomes highlighted.
3. Type delete, return, or type in a new address.
    Nothing happens.

If one instead inserts the cursor before /home and selects
to the right, then delete, return, and typing work as expected.
Also, right to left selection works if only part of the address
needs to be changed.

Amaya 4.3 Linux, Red Hat 6.1 in emulation on a Mac.
