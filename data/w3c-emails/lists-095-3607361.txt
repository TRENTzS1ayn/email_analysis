Is there a configuration method for setting window size
and/or position for specific windows.  Or can they be made 
to retain resized/repositioned information.

Why I ask is that the help window always opens unmaxed
and I would prefer maxed.  Even after maxing it and then
closing it it opens unmaxed. 

Just a personal GUI thing I guess but is it doable.
