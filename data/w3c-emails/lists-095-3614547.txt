I mentioned my problem with www.w3.org
if i set my UA background to grey 
I suspect that they have specifically set
 color: foobar ; background-color: white;
under assumption that all would use white ...
can someone give them a heads up so that
they use 
 color: foobar ; background-color: transparent;

this will make their screens look ok until 
Amaya fixes their cascading problem.
