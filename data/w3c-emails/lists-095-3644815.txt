My version, on Win98, returns

    "amaya/V4.1 libwww/5.3.1"

as its user agent string.

You can find such answers, for instance, at:

No stats service I know or use seems to tabulate data for Amaya. I even had to
request inclusion of Opera on my stats provider because they kept it in the misc
category.
