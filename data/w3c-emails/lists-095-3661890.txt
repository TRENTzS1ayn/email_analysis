As it if often configured by ISPs, Analog doesn't take Amaya into account. My
hosting company uses it, and I never see the Amaya frequentation, although I usually
check my site with it. Admittedly, the traffic I generate with Amaya certainly makes
up for less than 0.1% of the total visits, so it may be drowned in the data noise.

Here is an example of what my Amaya sends, taken from
http://www.osinet.fr/code/showheaders.asp
You can see the user agent string : amaya/V4.1 libwww/5.3.1  (yes, I know, I'm not
up to date on the version). What worries me more is the fact that is does not seem
to send referrer information.
