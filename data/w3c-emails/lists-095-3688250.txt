Hello Amaya folks,

I like the "link to previous target" functionality available from
the Links menu. However, often I "don't like" the anchor name
that Amaya creates automatically for me, so I edit it by hand.
Then, when I use the link to previous target functionality, it
links to the automatically generated target name.

Can Amaya keep track of my edits to the "last" target name?

Thank you,

 _Ian
