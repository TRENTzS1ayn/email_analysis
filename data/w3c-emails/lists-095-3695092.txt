I run Amaya under Windows (ME) with my display font size set to use large
fonts (125% normal size 120 dpi)

If I open Amaya and then run spell check on the opening page the word list
collides with the button above it.

See tiny gif file showing the top left hand corner of the window "Spell
Checking..." attached. The problem does not exist with the font size set to
small fonts
