[DJW:]  
A number of sites use Referer to enforce no deep-linking 
policies or security by obscurity login procedures.  
I don't think either of these web site policies are good, 
but the result can be that one is locked out of the site, 
and sometimes one cannot just boycott them.

On the other hand, it should not be an issue for Amaya's
primary use as an editor.
