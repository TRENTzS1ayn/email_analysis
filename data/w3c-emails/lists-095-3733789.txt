Hello Gregg

On page http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/BinDist.html your e-mail appears as the
one of the person in charge of the HP-UX distribution of Amaya, so here is a
question:
The link http://www.w3.org/Amaya/Distribution/amaya-HPUX10_20-3.1.tgz
<../Distribution/amaya-HPUX10_20-3.1.tgz> on the W3C Amaya web site page
apparently is broken, could you help me find this distribution ?
I have already done a search on the HP site, on Google, and on the Amaya
mailing list archive, and found nothing. Please help a faithful k-class user
!
Cheers
