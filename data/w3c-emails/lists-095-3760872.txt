This menu dropdown contains a lot of items.
Perhaps they should be arranged alphabetically
or organized functionally -- that would put config 
near the top as it would be one of first used.
Or as an alternative reduce the number of options
by having a single item for Table of Contents
maybe another one that points at Programming
TOC for THOT and related programmer stuff.
ie one item for user help 
another for programmer stuff.
