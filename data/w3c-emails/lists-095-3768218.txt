Yes, re-organising this would be helpful. (It has grown with Amaya, and is

  This menu dropdown contains a lot of items.
  Perhaps they should be arranged alphabetically

  near the top as it would be one of first used.
  Or as an alternative reduce the number of options
  by having a single item for Table of Contents
  maybe another one that points at Programming
  TOC for THOT and related programmer stuff.
  ie one item for user help
  another for programmer stuff.
