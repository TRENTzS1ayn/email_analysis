Dear Madams and Sirs!

I am delighted with the improvements in the latest version of amaya (4.3),
which solves the more severe bugs I encountered in the former version.
However, as a feature, it would make editing with Amaya much more powerful,
if table colums could not only be deleted, but also copied and moved ('cut
and paste' for table columns).

All the best wishes - Josef
