We have been testing this for some time.

Our SVG pages (http://www.ch.ic.ac.uk/svg/ ) contain exactly
such a declaration. Curiously, we find with common browsers
that one  <object> is fine,  but two often breaks them.

For a more in depth analysis of the issues
see http://www.ch.ic.ac.uk/chemime/tests/object/browsers/ )

The one  browser not evaluated in the above was  Amaya,  because
it did not offer either plugin or  Java support. 

So the outcome of the above would be interesting.
