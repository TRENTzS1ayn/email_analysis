Since Amaya can directly handle SVG (well, a subset of it anyway) and since
it supports object already, I am surprised that this doesn't just work.

If I wasn't in the middle of a system rebuild I would test it, but I don't
have amaya available today :(

  Hi Bertrand,

  With the support of paths, the implementation of SVG in Amaya is making
  some progress. This will be available in the release scheduled for tomorrow.
  With this release, the only way to include SVG drawings into XHTML documents
  is to use namespaces. We have plans for supporting the img tag in a future
  release, but without the object element. Something like:

  <p>A nice paragraph followed by a drawing.</p>
  <img src="URLOfSomeSVGFile"/>
  <p>A paragraph after the drawing.</p>

  Obviously the drawing will have to be served with mime type "image/svg".
  Not sure yet if we will spend time on the object thing.

  Vincent.
