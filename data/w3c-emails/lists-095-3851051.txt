[DJW:]  Object support is more or less broken, particularly for
simple objects, in the big 2.

In principle, for a good plug-in architecture, or native support,
img should work.  It doesn't, even for Amaya 2.4.1, although that
might be because the image was all path elements (it took a long
time to display a placeholder).  (img would allow server side 
content negotiation, as currently done for PNG on the W3C logo.)
