 I noticed that &parallel; has been muddled in the test suite
 http://www.w3.org/Math/testsuite/Characters/p.html
 look into the second section -- source codes and
 note that &para has been replaced by its glyif
 and that &parallel has been replaced by paragraph glyif followed by llel!

 I don't know if this indicates a problem in the parser when the
 document was edited with Amaya but the testsuite doc is problematic.
