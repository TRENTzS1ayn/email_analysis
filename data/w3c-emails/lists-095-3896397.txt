Hi everyone

Is it possible to use Amaya to write and store word processor type documents?

We presently use Word (and Excel) to write reports and would like to start
writing natively in XML with the minimum of difficulty.  I know we can use text
editors like Abortext and S4Text but is there an easier way?

I assume that everyone will soon want to create their word 'processed documents'
in XML.  I would just like to know what the easiest and most future proofed
method is.

Regards
