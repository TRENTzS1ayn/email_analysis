Thanks for your tests John.

The document you mentionned is a HTML document, so it is parsed with the HTML parser, which one tries to correct invalid documents. In this case, it assumes that semicolon is missing and interprets the HTML entity &parallel; as the supported entity &para;.
I will correct this problem for the nexr release.

Following your previous mail, I have add the support of the MathML entity &parallel;
