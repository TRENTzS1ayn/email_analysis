I just noticed that Amaya doesn't work on an ftp site
only http sites ... is the addition of ftp access or mailto
anticipated or do they not fit the goals of Amaya...
Unix philosophy normally says one tool for EACH job (efficiency)
so user uses his own ftp / mail  utilities   
but Windows tend to tie systems together (user friendliness)

Wondering which philosophy is pursued here ?
