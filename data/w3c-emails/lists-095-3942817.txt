It works for me.   Are you using a local copy with no style sheet maybe?
It should work - I made those pages all with Amaya.
I haven't seen than phenomenon, so I can' think what might have caused it.

I do find the background color is different, and the line spacing, but the
DL indentation
seems to be fine.
