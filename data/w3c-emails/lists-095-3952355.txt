I've recently started to experiment with Amaya, and immediately ran into a 
problem with the presentation of Tim's DesignIssues note on Notation 3 
(http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Notation3.html):  specifically, Amaya 
doesn't indent the productions after the first of a BNF form (e.g. 
uri-ref2), which makes the intent _much_ harder to understand.

For comparison, the display using Netscape (4.7) is fine.

I don't know if this is a problem with Amaya or the document, so I'm 
copying this message both ways.
