[DJW:]  Given the very poor level of compliance with this 
requirement on the web, how would you suggest that Amaya 
do its best to achieve compliance?

Whilst I think that it is incorrect that one needs to 
include a bogus space when the image really is purely 
cosmetic, accepting the empty contents of the alternative 
text box is what a typical commercial tool might
do, not what a standards enforcing tool should do.

It ought either to have check box, always defaulted off, 
to positively indicate that the alternative text was empty, 
or ought to initialise the alternative text to something 
referring to the incompetence of the author, although I think 
the latter might generate less thought about correct contents
than the check box.

I'd even suggest that, with a check box, it should still 
generate a warning, explaining why alt text was needed, and 
defaulted to not accepting the change.

Please post plain text, not HTML.
