It is not well-formed. Example:

<html xmlns:o="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"
xmlns:w="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:word"
xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40">

<head>
<meta http-equiv=Content-Type content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<meta name=ProgId content=Word.Document>
<meta name=Generator content="Microsoft Word 9">
<meta name=Originator content="Microsoft Word 9">
<link rel=File-List href="./7221-380_files/filelist.xml">
<title>9 February 2001</title>
<!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>
 <o:DocumentProperties>
  <o:Author>Nobody</o:Author>

And so on (body, div, and other elements have unquoted attribute values; too
many for me to keep correcting and checking for well-formedness, let alone
validate). Every paragraph element has an unquoted class attribute.  There
are also proprietary CSS extensions, like mso-bidi-font-size, etc.

Perhaps Office XP will improve on this (though I doubt it).
