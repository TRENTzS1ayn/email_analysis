MathML has a large number of character entities for many operators.

Amaya could help authors by providing several pallettes preloaded with
a selection of operators organized in 'reasonable' groupings , for
example  calculus ,  statistics,  logic ,  geometry , etc

And even better would be a couple of blank 'user' pallettes that an
author could populate either by dragging or cut/paste from an existing
one  or  defining a glyph by entering the entity name.  This would
let author 'customize' the pallette to the current project.

Additional pallettes would ease the learning curve for math authors
who are new to MathML.
