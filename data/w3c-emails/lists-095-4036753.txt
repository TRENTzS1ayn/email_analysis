I have a MathML test document at

http://www.cgocable.net/~jrussel/mathmld2.htm

It parses ok and most of the character entities are ok
but there are lots of > characters interspesed in the display
Can anyone spot the problem.  Is it in the code or is
it in the Amaya browser ???   Inquiring minds are wondering !!!
