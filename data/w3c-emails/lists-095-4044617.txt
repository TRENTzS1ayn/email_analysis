What about auto-generate an alt text? such as the image's name without the
.gif extension? or the image's software text chunk? (this could be really an
idea) Don't act know-it-all, mr. Woolley, we don't need to piss off people
with stupid, enabled-by-default dialogs. Don't pretend to indoctrinate them.
Show the warning during validation, NOT during editing. Or show it in the
status bar, just like Homesite does (I believe you have a lot to learn from
Allaire - not the memory management for sure :), so the user can continue
his/her work without interruption

Anyway that message is plain stupid. I used to use gif images to create
round corners for tables and other merely cosmetic artifacts, and to enforce
table layout as well (we really need a true layout grid), why the heck
should a 3x3 pixel round corner have an alt text? is it supposed to?

Be practical: people don't use <table>'s to show tabular data, people don't
use gif images to express deep concepts or add content to a page
