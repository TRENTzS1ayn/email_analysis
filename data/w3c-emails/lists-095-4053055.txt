Hello John,

In fact, there are two kinds of problems with this document.
The first one (> characters interspesed in the display) is due to a 
communication problem between the HTML parser and the XML parser used in Amaya.
For HTML documents with embedded XML sub-trees (as in the document you 
mentionned), Amaya starts with the HTML parser and for each <math>...</math> 
sequence, launches the XML parser.
The second problem concerns many entities (as &amp;langle; for instance) that 
are not correctly interpreted by Amaya.

We will solve these problems in the next release

Regards

Laurent Carcone
