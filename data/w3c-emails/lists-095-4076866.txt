Office XP will be the version of Microsoft Office that succeeds Office 2000:
i.e., the one that includes Word 10.0.  XP in this has nothing to do with
cross platform technologies (I don't remember what Microsoft's "XP" is meant
to stand for in contrast - it's also being used with the new NT-based
consumer Windows that will be coming out, the previously-named "Whistler").
Most certainly not Open.

Hope that helps,
Patrick Rourke

Are you speaking of 'openoffice' ?
What is XP ?
