Hi,

Thanks for the suggestion, I added this information in the Amaya FAQ.

> If you take a file in XHTML, and edit it with an HTML editor, you may create
> something that is not valid XHTML. Amaya, behaving as required by the XML
> specification, warns that there is a problem, says something about what and
> where it is, and stops processing.
> 
> If you had loaded this as an HTML file, there would be no problem. You could
> save it back as an XHTML file perfectly well.

> For example, looking at the source, removing the namespace attribute from the
> html element and synchronising seems to do the trick.

> factors (MIME type? others?) come into play?
