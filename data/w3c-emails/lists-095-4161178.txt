Nice idea, but I think that, given Amaya's role, using an XML structure would be
more appropriate than an INI format. Something along the lines of :

[...]
<palette title="Arithmetic" rowcount="3" colcount="2" >
  <row>
    <item>&cross;</item>
    <item>&divide;</item>
    </row>
  <row>
    <item>&pm;</item>
    <item>&neq;</item>
    </row>
  </palette>
[...]

Same benefits, but probably cleaner conceptually.
