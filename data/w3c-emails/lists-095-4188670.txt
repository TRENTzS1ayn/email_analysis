I think it was about having several empty paragraphs in a row. The HTML
specification says the following on the topic:

We discourage authors from using empty P elements. User agents should ignore
empty P elements.

HTML 4.01 - Paragraphs, Lines and Phrases - 9.3.1 -

  Check some examples at

   http://www.osinet.fr/code/glo.asp?Initial=S#SCSI
  for instance. The XHTML validator does not seem to complain about this

  having other types of errors (I've removed the complete XHTML compliance for
  the time being: too busy adding new content to validate it).

  Also, this code:
  -------------
  <td valign="top" class="main" width="59%">
  <div class="item" id="a20010319">
  <h2 [...]</h2>
  <p>[...]
  -------------

  is on the W3C home page, which seems to imply there is nothing wrong with
  such use of paragraphs within a <td>. They even add divs within the <td>.
