VERSION : 4.3.1
============

Idea : Could it be possible to make template pages ? When making an XHTML page,
I save it as a template and decide by special tag the content
that will be inserted later.  When loading a template, It asks me to set each
content and the page is built automatically.

I agree with you that Bold, Italic... are for physical presentation H1, H2...
are for
structural information. However, XHTML must be considered as a physical
presentation
of a documentation, meaning I 'draw' my web page and not I structure my web
page.
Such method like this, is for beginner like me easier, I don't know if H1 is
more pertinent and
should be replaced by a simple P or BR with a specific font.

A better idea shoud be to have a list of available properties on the selected
object.
It could be available in tne main toolbar or in a standalone window. I think
this
independant window could help people to waste his time to search the good menu
and
the good action.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Ok, but it seems that I can't change easily this properties value later
(Meaning, I must
go to the source).

I try again, but the bug is not the same. I have built a new XHTML page. I have
inserted
a 10x10 table it the beginning. When I insert a text on the first cell, the
table is not resized
and the text is under the grid

Idea : Could you have a TRACE MODE that could store each user action ??????
++++
This is a system used by emacs for showing where's the bug otherwise, it's not
really practice
to redo itn the proove is here...

----------------------------------------------------------------

Sorry, I can't redo the error. Howeve I have met several other bugs :

1?) Build in the introduction page a table of 10x10, add a second table of 2x2
inside the first cell (top left). You can't select other cells from the main
table in the
first line.
2?) Now remove the second table. The table is not completed, a refresh problem
appears
and the cell disappears.

ok

Could you store a kind of stack trace ?

---------------------------------------------------------------

ok, I understand. However, why not adding a link only for a non empty target
defined ?

ok

------------------------------------------------------------------

ok but a dialog box could be better for adverstising that the document was not
saved.

+ I notice, that amaya doesn't take into account the user working directory as a
default path
when saving a document.
