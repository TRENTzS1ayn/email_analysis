Since this is a text base medium i think we should examine all aspects of typography.
To get this iron out. I kind of like microsofts make big, med, small fonts. Simple.
The two packages i like are Homesite and Frontpage because of the ease of functions.

I think we have to know what mode were in and type seems to be able to download
faster than any medium i have seen.

Now should it be a word processor or just a imput devise to change formats from text to html on to ftp.
