When you say that expat didn't transmit entities... do
you mean that it gives you the replacement text of
the entity rather than the entity reference? That's
not a bug; that's as designed. When parsing this document

<aDoc attr="abc&amp;def"/>

I would expect an XML parser to just give me "abc&def"
as the attribute's value.

If you're trying to preserve markup like
"abc&nbsp;def"
then you're going to need something other than
a generic XML parser. I don't recommend that
you try to do that at all. Just deal with
attribute values as plain strings.
