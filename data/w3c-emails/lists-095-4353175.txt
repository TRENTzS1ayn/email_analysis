H1 is *NOT* a style.  It represents a part of
the document structure (you've generally misused
"style").  It does not produce the same result
in Amaya:  try using Views | Show Table of Contents 
with correct markup and with your presentational 
markup.  (Use the HTML specification reference below for
an example of correct markup.)

Incidentally, although Amaya 4.2.1 for NT produces the
typical GUI browser rendering of STRONG and EM (bold and
italic), there is no requirement that a browser should. To
ensure this specific rendering, you need to use style sheets
on a visual browser that is physically capable of producing
the effects in question.

Especially given that Amaya is a test bed for style sheets,
the correct way of exercising control (although it should not
really be necessary for a technical document like this) is
to use style sheets.

[DJW:]  Yes.   Lynx 2.8.1rel.1 (1998) ignores the <p><br></p>
sequences and leaves a single blank line between each 
non-trivial paragraph.

From section 3.1 of the HTML 4.01 specification
<http://www.w3.org/TR/html40/struct/text.html#h-9.3.1>:

We discourage authors from using empty P elements. User agents should ignore
empty P elements. 
[DJW:]  
(Putting <br> or &nbsp; in empty paragraphs are basically hacks
to try to stop tbe browser realising they are empty. <br> is 
itself collapsible.)

On the original issue, my copy of Amaya renders the page in the
way I would expect a big 2 browser to render it (given that Amaya
and IE have different default styles for body {background-color}.

object quite strongly when this is done in reply to their list
contributions.  (In fact, your article has not yet appeared on the
