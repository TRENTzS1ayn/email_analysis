This version solves a few MathML difficulties for me.
There are some important MathML attributes still missing
 such as angrt and the contour integral glyph....
Should i make a list or are you still adding lots ....

The edit mode no longer needs extra toggles at start (thanks)
but the short cut procedure shift ctrl *  still doesn't toggle mode.

Each revision makes things easier for MathML for sure
thank you very much.
