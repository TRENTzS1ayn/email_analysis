some ordinary spaces are being discarded after </math>  in mathml

for example
    this is a sentence containing <math>........</math> stuff that is ok
the space before <math> is kept but the space after </math> is lost.

I know that any spaces inside an html element can be lost and is expected
to be  but the space is outside the element so shouuld be retained.
