Is there a mechanism for setting up a macro in MahML

For example I have an elementary calculus text that
requires many instances of lim as x-->zero from minus side

Or is it a matter of building an instance and cutting/pasting

If you do a pallette from ini files , would it be possible to
allow a macro construction to fit where entity would.
That would sure ease the pain of setting up lots of 
examples of  integral from a to b ... dx  and replacing ...
with appropriate function
