It is quite easy to check which entities are missing 
by downloading  the w3 test suite files , cutting the png table
and changing &lt; and &gt; to < and >, cutting <pre></pre>

Many entities are missing so i assume they are being added
 on a needs basis.

Two more important issues however are:

1] if the all-names file is used (185k),  Amaya chokes and truncates 
the document. It does issue a warning not to save which is good !!
but no parse errors are displayed.  I dont know whether this is a document
size issue, a document complexity issue, or a parse error overflow thing.
Someone on the team may want to use the w3 testsuite -- all entitynames
document as a test situation for document capacity and
 error dialogue / recovery if possible.

2] each of the test suite files has a blank heading such as
     <h3></h3> as well as a <p><b>MathML Test</b><p> 
   which should have been a heading .... 
Looks to me like a left hand -- right hand faux pas
where one branch of company not doing what other is!!!!
