[DJW:]  Every version of Amaya that I have ever tried 
supported CSS.  I think you need to be specific about the
exact version you are using.  (I believe that some versions
didn't come with a copy of the default style sheet, but that
is a client issue, not an authoring one.)

[DJW:]  The authors of the HTML 4.01 "specification", 
and by implication the World Wide Web Consortium; 
this was a quote from the reccommendation, from the section
given in the URL.

[DJW:]  Detailed responses on correctness of Lynx, margin styles
for block elements, reader should be in control, and the double
reply problem on mailing lists  have been  editted out.
