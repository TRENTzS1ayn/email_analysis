I tested the functionality. It seems to work correctly. Could you check 
that the attribute was correctly parsed (no reported parsing error).
If the error persist, could you send us the document that generates that
error.

Some selectors are not correctly interpreted by Amaya. I guess it's the origin
of your problem. This is still in our todo list.

We've no plans for that support. We're waiting for external contributors.
