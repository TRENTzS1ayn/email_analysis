Aaron,

We need more info. Can you post the complete protocol exchange that
took place? 

Second question, why are you not using HTTP/1.1? :) Have you tried using
mod_put in apache or my own (now old) put.c program?

For every 100-continue, there's a timeout. If we don't get the reply,
we then send the body. This is done as such as we don't know beforehand
what's the version of the protocol and it's they way that the HTTP spec
precises to do it.

As for the crash, I can't reproduce it without more information from you.

Amaya is not an origin server, but an HTTP 1/1 client.
