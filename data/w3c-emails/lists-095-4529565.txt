I have compiled and installed amaya-4.3.2 on top of Solaris 2.7
with lesstif-0.92.26. Works fine, as usual.
Between amaya-4.3 and this new version, we have now &times; and
&divide; working, but &oelig; and &OElig; don't work any more
(on printed paper).
How can we make these 2 characters work again?
