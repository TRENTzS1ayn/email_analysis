&inodot; should be not working either. However, &#144; can catch it.

For those who still want &oelig; and &OElig; on paper, modify
thotlib/editing/print.c:
- replace all "ISOLatin1Encoding" by "ISOLatin1Encodinh"
- replace two /.notdef in front of /dotlessi by /OE and /oe

&OElig; and &oelig; get printed if you use &#142; and &#143;
(it works on paper only)
