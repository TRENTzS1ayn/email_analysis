I think I've figured out what the supposed border is, I've gone through 
Amaya's
structured view and located and fixed several errors and still get the 
problem.
After looking closely at the out put the "border" is the same colour as the
background of the page. It looks like despite using cellspacing="0" in the
table definition, Amaya is accidentally putting a small 1 pixel space 
between cells.


Thanks for the help, I'll be looking at the source code and seeing what I 
can come
up with down the road. Never know, I might actually contribute something.
