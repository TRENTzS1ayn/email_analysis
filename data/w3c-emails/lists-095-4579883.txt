The simple html 4.0 pattern
<div align="center">
<ul>
<li>First item in list</li>
<li>Next in list</li>
<li>Final item in list</li>
</ul>
</div>
centers the text correctly but leaves the bullet on the left edge.
This occurs if ordered list as well.
It appears to be more of a call sequencing problem than a
primative operation   ie....
dsply_centered (bullet_object + text_string)
rather than 
dsply (bullet_object)
dsply_centered(text_string)

This simple example of misrendered code is tops on my please fix items
as it comes up often in docs that otherwise look ok and it appears as
a simple fix is all that is required .... not like the floating object issue
which also hurts many documents out there (especially mine ;-[ ;-[  )
ta fer now.
