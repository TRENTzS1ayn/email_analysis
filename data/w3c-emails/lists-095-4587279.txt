It seems that the only way I could get a nicely centered form 
inside my page was to put it in a table --- but this goes against
using table for formatting
but i tried align= "center" width="70%" on body , form and div
element and did not get result i wanted ... is there a better way.
and when i did use a table --- it didn't work out to be 70%
in Amaya although other browsers did ok....
