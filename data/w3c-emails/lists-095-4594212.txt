Well i just found another way ---
using margin-left and margin-right
this worked well in M, N, and O brand browsers
but not in Amaya --- probably to do with the 
relative size settings on margin !!!!

Is this relative size on measures a known issue??
I know that using relative heights within images is problematic
but this may be a new situation.
Relative width margins is necessary for sized windows and 
allowing for 640x480   and big screen users !!!
