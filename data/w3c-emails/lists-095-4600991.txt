Sorry -- the form centering works
I had left a <tr> tag in code from attempt to use table...
Now that parse is good --- margins are good
So technique is to use style for format --- dah ;-[ ;-[
That is obvious to all but a newbie who also didn't
realize that a:hover must come after a:link and a:visited
in css2  .... still learning.....

but my test form reveals lots of problems such as fieldset lines,
 tab control, disabled functions not disabled, reset not clearing
 boxes and  button frame on reset/submit button not drawn ok.
