Hi,

I am a software developer but relative new to html and amaya. I have done 
some searching for the answer to this (I hope) simple question in your 
archives but have not found anything yet.

Both amaya.png and another simple graphic (jpg) I have display quite 
differently with amaya than they do with a simple graphic viewer and with 
Opera on my PC.  They both look like bits have overflowed from each 
pixel.  amaya.png which is grey scale? shows up in some kind of hacked color.

Any ideas?  Or this the right place for this kind of question?

Thanks,

Paul Scott
