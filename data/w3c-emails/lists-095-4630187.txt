According to the evidence provided the question should
be why is Amaya not using HTTP/1.1.

[DJW:]  The evidence presented is that it is a
HTTP 1.0 client; the PUT in the trace purports to
come from Amaya.  I would say that any HTTP 1.0 
client sending Expect: 100-Continue could reasonably
expect to either have it ignored or receive a 417 
status return.

I would say that an HTTP 1.0 request with an Expect 
header was broken.
