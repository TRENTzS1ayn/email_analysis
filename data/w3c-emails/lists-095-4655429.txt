Is there a way to store a kind of stack trace when Amaya crash ?

Secondly, is it possible to integrate a Debug Mode that will store all
commands used by user. This kind of
Debug stack is used by Emacs, this is the best way to test problems.
Otherwise it's really difficult to know
what is the context for a Crash (I have a lot of crashes for tables,
source editing...).

Thank you
