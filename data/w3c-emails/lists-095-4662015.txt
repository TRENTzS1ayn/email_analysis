Hello R. G.,

Thanks for your report. You should try V 4.3.2 as it's the most recent 
one :)

Here's just a short answer on one of your points. We'll get to you for
the other ones.

I fixed this in the latest version. The abort button aborted the application
and it wasn't possible to abort a printout once it had started.
