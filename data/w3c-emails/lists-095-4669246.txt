Errors :
     In the documentation : the Editor icon is 
greyed out, not crossed out,
when the editor mode is inactive.

I could not find this -- please tell me which 
document to touch up!  

And while searching, i tested the edit icon
by toggling repeatedly.  OOPS sometimes
it takes two clicks to move from edit to 
browse...  The initialization problem with
shortcut has been repaired but here is a new 
one -- very minor though --
