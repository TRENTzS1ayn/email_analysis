there is an inability to print 'selected text only'
both from the 'browser view' and the 'source view'
this causes many trees to be slayed unnecessarily.
hopefully this can be repaired for next version.

And the shortcut keys for print and print setup 
should be reversed!  This would make control-p 
  fit what windows users are expecting.....

The most logical of course would be ctrl-p for print
and ctrl-P for print options but this may confuse the windoze
crowd as they are untested on the shifted key aspect of
 shortcuts ... the gui was really designed for computer illiterates.
