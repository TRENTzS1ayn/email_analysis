Hello dear Amaya developers,


I think I might have found a bug in Amaya.

Imagine the following form:
<form action="" method="post"><!-- or get, no matter -->
<div>
<input type="hidden" name="pass" value="" />
<input type="hidden" name="user" value="" />
<input type="text" name="for" />
<input type="submit" value="search" />
</div>
</form>

In a resource with the following URL: http://www.informatik-lexikon.com/

I think the form should be submitted to the resource that created the form or the directory of the resource that created the form, I think the last one is the case, but that does not matter in my case.

With other browsers (but what does that mean regarding what is standard or not...) action="" works fine.
Amaya won't save the form.

I have changed all occurrences in action="/", but this is a superflous byte in my files which I don't like (I am a Perl programmer... ;)

The action attribute of the form element is defined as a required attribute of type URI, and URI is defined as CDATA. As far as I know, required CDATA attributes may be empty, so <form action=""/> is legal 
regarding to the action attribute.

I tried to verify this using the following code:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE test [
<!ELEMENT test (tests)+>
<!ATTLIST test
action CDATA #REQUIRED
>
<!ELEMENT tests EMPTY>
]>
<test action="">
<tests/>
</test>

I validated this code using xmlint from Microsoft (shame on me), xmlint reports nothing (which means the document is valid).
I also validated this code using the validator from the w3, and it also reports no errors.

And I validated a code using a form element with given but empty action attribute using the validator from the w3, and it reported no errors.
I used the following code:
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML Basic 1.0//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-basic/xhtml-basic10.dtd">
<html>
<head><title>FormTest</title></head>
<body>
<h1>FormTest</h1>
<form action=""><div><input type="text" /><input type="submit" /></div></form>
</body>
</html>


So I think Amaya should be changed to allow empty action attributes on form elements. Perhaps there should be a default setting that reports a warning on empty action attributes that can be deactivated, since 
usually action attributes require a value.
