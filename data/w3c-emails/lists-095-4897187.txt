Hi,

Great work :-) I understand this is the email address for Amaya issues? I have a couple of issues with indenting:
 
1. Amaya does not seem to render indents (HTML <DIR>) correctly, ie. it doesn't actually indent.

eg.

<dir>
1
<dir>
2
</dir>
3
</dir>

In IE5 looks like:
 
1 
2 
3 
In Amaya looks like:

1
 
2
3

2. To improve the look/feel I suggest Indent increase & decrease buttons as per Netscape Composer & MS Outlook Express, and MS Word. At work I am used to Netscape Composer, and generally I'm used to MS Outlook Express. I guess there may be many people who have got used to the same feel.

I have Amaya V4.3.2 23 March 2001 on Windows 98.

Geoff (geoff.benn@bigfoot.com)
