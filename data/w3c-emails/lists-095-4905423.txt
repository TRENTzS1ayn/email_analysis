[DJW:]  There is *NO* indent element in HTML.  As far as I know DIR
is
deprecated (because browser developers failed to distinguish from
other
list type structures).

If you want indenting you *must* use style sheets.

(Incidentally, the element normally abused for 
indenting is BLOCKQUOTE.)

These are mis-features, as they make people think that HTML
is a WYSIWYG page description language.  If you really want
such a language, I'd reccommend PDF.

Indenting in HTML always has to be seen as a two stage process:

- provide HTML to indicate the structural nature of the element;

- provide style sheets to indicate how you prefer such elements
  to appear (don't forget to provide them for all media types, not
  just high resolution GUIs with mice).
