The help menu misses pointers to manual.html
and keyboard.html  which are provided as doc in french and english.

There are also three docs in english only  CSS.html, HTML.html,
and Transform.html.  should these be added....

As the help item is getting very long, perhaps the windows help
 approach may work better.  Provide an item for Index  and
 add the standard search box which displays a portion of the index
as a scrollable selection. As one enters letters into the input area
the scroll moves as close as it can to he selection.  This widget is
provided in many toolboxes but do not know which one amaya is
using!!   That plus the entry for manual's Table of Content should
 eliminate need for all others.

This would allow for entries for Credits, What's New, FAQ's (on the web)
and Known Bugs (on web),  ToDo list (web) .... Enhancements (web)
and sundry items.
