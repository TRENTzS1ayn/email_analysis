Hi all,
I have successfully configured jigsaw in order to allow PUTs in my working area.
This is great but I would like to restrict who can do PUTs
without having to force him/her to authenticate for accessing that realm.

Can anyone point me in the righ direction? Or to the right manual page?
Or am I trying to do something impossible?

Thanks in advance
Enrico
