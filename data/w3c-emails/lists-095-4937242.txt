Dave,

while you're giving a tutorial on style sheets :-) there's one construct 
I haven't been able to achive, despite searching all references I could 
find.

How can I express a style sheet to get a <DL> to be rendered with the  
<DD> content starting on the same line as the <DT> ? This is how 
dictionaries (for example) are usually laid out, but I have been unable 
to achieve it with CSS.

Term 1: Definition 1
Term 2: Definition 2

As I understand it, this is the sort of thing that <DIR> and <MENU> were 
supposed to assist.

Does anyone have a useful CSS reference which is sorted or can be 
searched based on the required effect, rather than the names of the 
attributes?

Thanks,
  Scott Davis
