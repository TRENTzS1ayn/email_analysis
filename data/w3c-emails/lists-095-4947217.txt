dt {display: block ; font-weight: bold }
dd {display: inline }

(I don't  think that the block and inline display properties work in Amaya
but they do in a number of browsers)

  Dave,

  while you're giving a tutorial on style sheets :-) there's one construct
  I haven't been able to achive, despite searching all references I could
  find.

  How can I express a style sheet to get a <DL> to be rendered with the
  <DD> content starting on the same line as the <DT> ? This is how
  dictionaries (for example) are usually laid out, but I have been unable
  to achieve it with CSS.

  Term 1: Definition 1
  Term 2: Definition 2

  As I understand it, this is the sort of thing that <DIR> and <MENU> were
  supposed to assist.

  Does anyone have a useful CSS reference which is sorted or can be
  searched based on the required effect, rather than the names of the
  attributes?

  Thanks,
    Scott Davis
