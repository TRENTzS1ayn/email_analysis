I would say that dt should be display: compact and dd 
should be display: block, although I don't know how
well compact is supported.  I think I got a test case to
work on IE5 once, but I'm not sure.

DL was intended for this, and I seem to remember that some
early browsers actually implemented it that way.  I was one
of the early casualties to popularisation and presentationalising
of HTML.

I never really understood why the it wasn't implemneted like this,
although a realisation that the market was not interested in
structure
may have mean that designing code to support it was too low a
priority
activity.

I think DIR was intended for the sort of multi-column directory
listing that you get with an MS-DOS dir command or Unix ls -C (some
don't need the -C).

I'm not so sure about MENU, but I think a good way to format it
would have been like the very first presentational pseudo list form
in HTML:   [ option 1 | option 2 | option 3 ], but it's too late
now.
