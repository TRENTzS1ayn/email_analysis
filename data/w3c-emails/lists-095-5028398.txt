Sorry to report that a new bug has crept into 
the Windows 98 binary version of amaya 5
The page down key no longer does appropriate
scrolling. However the page up key continues
to work well.... Maybe you will be collecting 
a few of these to make a 5.0.1 in a week or so.
Complex projects always have a few glitches
but there is a lot of nice things done on latest ;-] ;-]
