The page down key also fails to function in the help section
 ---- i appreciate the index item !!! ;-]
this makes viewing awkward unless very short docs.


Two other non-functioning key sequences are:

1] shift ctrl *  to toggle edit mode ( this mode does toggle by menu
    selection so fix is not urgent)

2] using the optional accented keystroke method  star o and star O
    do not put the slash overstrike on the o.  All other accents appear
    to work including star A  for ring.  The o appears but without the slash
    --- perhaps it is mapping to wrong character code??
