I'm afraid the problem is more serious than that. I've been able to
repeat and reproduce the following behaviour:

I load http://icking-music-archive.sunsite.dk/scores/Instr.html into
Amaya5.0 after having had it parsed with no errors by Amaya4.3.2. Then I
do a small change and save from within Amaya5.0, reload the file and
find an extra '<dd> <dl>' inserted shortly after
http://icking-music-archive.sunsite.dk/scores/Instr.html#hill
