Neither the index nor the views.html document explain the 
show parse errors view .....
Part of the explanation could be difference between error 
and warning messages.  Also whether some warning messages
are just indicators of unimplemented instructions or whether
these are authoring problems .... 
maybe a third level ie   error / warning / notice 
where notice flags the unimplemented components
 such as list-style-type: none    etc!
this will help author decide whether it is his problem to fix or not!
