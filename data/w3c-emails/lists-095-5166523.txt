Good news -- bad news
The bad news that the page down function IS BROKEN
the good news is that because Irene tested and found it worked
i was encouraged to test further to see why my machine is different
On windows 98 there is no compose key so we use the OPTIONAL 
method for accents.  Linux users have the advantage here (as in many
other ways ;-] ;-] ;-] )   So i went in and DESELECTED optional accents
method ---  page down works --- selected optional -- no workee
and this is repeatable .... so it looks like the routine that 
traps first char looking for accenter is not passing the pagedown
character thru !!!!   ---- hope that has isolated problem enough to
resolve.
