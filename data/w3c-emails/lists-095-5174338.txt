if any work is being done in this routine could you add
some of the missing characters such as AElig, eth and thorn
as well as their lowercase values too ... you may have to add
another accenting character such as dash (hyphen) as A and O
seem to have almost all accents .... only accenter not heavily used 
is comma --- maybe it could bethe one for eth  ,D and lig  ,A  
but dash seems more natural ... your call.
