It may be helpful for some users wintel types) if the following was added
 as the third paragraph in the 'entering iso-latin1'  section.

For microsoft windows users, the charmap paste/copy utility will
allow insertion of iso-latin1 characters not implemented by the 
optional multi-key method

Although this is not a part of Amaya, it does allow users to work
around some of the program's limitations while our overworked 
programmers solve things that are doable only in Amaya.  Help
is for the users benefit so they can maximize their productivity
so I feel this pointer to a utility outside Amaya is not disruptive.
