Just testing my theory of what is happening with star o 
when in optional multikey mode. I save as with charset set to usascii:

star a ---> &aring;
star o ---> o    should go to &oslash

and ctrl space --> :nbsp;   just right !!! 

so scoreboard shows (when optional multikey selected)
1] pagedown  gets eaten and not passed to routine that needs it
2] star o and star O are not mapped to correct character entity
3] some accented characters supported by regular compose method
    have no mappings under optional method (eth, thorn, para mark etc)

as my last msg indicated there is a workaround for all but # 1, pagedown
other bugs may have way more priority than this or documentation touches.
just file for future action.
