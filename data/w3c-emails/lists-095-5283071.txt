The NT version of Amaya 5.0 displays nothing for either
the built in start page or any URL I specify.

The status line at the bottom indicates that it is going
through the motions of fetching the external URL, although
possibly too quickly.

There is nothing in source view or structure view, either.

Show parsing errors is disabled.

NT 4 SP 6a high security.

I tried a de-install/re-install cycle, and have rebooted since
the first failure.

The only unusual thing I can think of is that the boot drive 
and NT system drive are different.
