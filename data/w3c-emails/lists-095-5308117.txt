i verified my test document
http://www.cgocable.net/~jrussel/mathmlde.htm
at validator.w3.org with the following heading

<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC
        "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1 plus MathML 2.0//EN"
        "http://www.w3.org/TR/MathML2/dtd/xhtml-math11-f.dtd">
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

it gave a 'no errors' response but when i ran the document in amaya
it gave lots of errors about tags not recognized.  My previous doctype
on the file was html4.01 which in amaya only gave errors on missing 
  character entities.....  but of course would not verify at w3

both doctypes gave similar results so i am puzzled at Amaya parse
errors on this doctype which was cut/pasted from www.w3.org/Math/validator.
just trying to get things right here so am validating all my docs except the
one that needs embed tag to run TechExplorer....
