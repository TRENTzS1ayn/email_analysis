Hello John,

With the previous doctype (html 4.01), your document was considered as a HTML 
document and parsed with the HTML parser of Amaya. This parser doesn't 
interpret the XML namespaces but calls the XML parser for specific parts of 
the document (mathml or svg expressions for example).
With the new doctype, your document is considered as a XHTML document and it 
is entirely parsed with a XML parser that interprets the XML namespaces. As a 
result, if no nemaspace is specified for an element, it belongs to the same 
namespace as it's parent. In tour test document, every <math> element should 
be preceded by the appropriate namespace, not only the first one 
(unfortunately, errors on missing character entities are still remaining !)
