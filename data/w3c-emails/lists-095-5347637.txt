Well ... actually <!> is a valid (empty) comment declaration, at least
in an SGML sense.  HTML 4 spec is a bit unclear whether it allows empty
comment declaration, but HTML 2.0 (RFC 1866) allows empty comment
declaration and explicitly lists <!> as an example in "3.2.5. Comments" [1].

On the other hand, ISO/IEC 15445:2000 explicitly says "[t]here shall be
exactly one comment per comment declaration" in "12 Comments in HTML" [2],
so empty or multiple comments in a comment declaration is not allowed
in ISO/IEC 15445:2000, like XML.

Of course <!P> is an invalid declaration.

I would say, authors should avoid using empty comment declaration in
HTML, on the other hand, HTML user agents should tolerate it.
