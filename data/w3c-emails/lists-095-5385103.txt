[DJW:]  It does exist and does have Amaya and
thot71 sub-directories, but the driver is out of
space, so Amaya can't write to it! (It's VFAT, so
there is no access control.)  There's just over 
half a MB of content, all Amaya/Thot, except for one
21kB file.

Clearing it out causes Amaya to start displaying the home
page, but TMPDIR=d:\temp, in the thot.rc file, doesn't seem
to prevent cached entries being put in c:\temp\amaya.

> Could you also tell me in which path Amaya is installed?
[DJW:]  
d:\program files\amaya\
