Looked a bit deeper into documentation and it is 
only DIALOGS that are provided in portugese!!

The pages on the w3.org site should be altered to
indicate that dialogs are provided for:
English, French, German, Spanish, Portugese,
Italian and Turkish
but help only provided for english and french at this time.

In addition there is a wide variety of language
dictionaries provided.  

Quite a bit of interesting work done here Many Thanks!
