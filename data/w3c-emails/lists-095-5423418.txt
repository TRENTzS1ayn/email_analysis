Probably unimplemented, but much of this
stylesheet is now working, so I'll log it:

http://www.NatReformAssn.org/statesman/01/bibfreedm.html

contains three div tags with class="pulltext" which
is intended to emulate the teasers in paper magazines,
part of the page width, larger print, different colour
scheme, with the main text flowing around it.

The div.pulltext style of float:right has no effect.

The td.pulltext style of font-size:larger has no effect.

(Honoring the div.pulltext style of width:40% is
new with version 5.)
