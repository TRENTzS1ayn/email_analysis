There are several things that need repair in the editor
to make Amaya more useful from a document creation 
function view....

E1] The shortcut procedure (shift ctrl *) for edit mode toggle does not work.
    However the menu selection method works fine!
E2] Shft-End and Shft-Home do not highlight text for cut/copy operation.
    Last version (4.3) did move cursor correctly.  The current version
    (5.1 Win98 binary) moves to top/bottom of document if cursor not inside
     text area which is the ctrl-key function and still does not highlight for
    selection.  If cursor in text area, there is no action on shift home or
   shift end! 
E3] Shift-DownArrow includes first character of next line in highlighted area
    when it should not do so.
E4] Star-O does not enter Oslash as advertised. Perhaps character mapping 
error!
