is an index of Hebrew quotations and phrases in
a larger work. The links in that page link to
the places where the phrases appear in the
larger work.

Amaya 5.1 renders the phrases themselves as
whitespace (having the effect of indenting
the "(?)" I've placed after one of them).

Previous versions displayed an open box to
indicate the presence of an unrendered 
character. I believe this previous behaviour
is required by the specifications:

    7. If it encounters an entity reference (other than one of the
       predefined entities) for which the User Agent has processed no
       declaration (which could happen if the declaration is in the external
       subset which the User Agent hasn't read), the entity reference should
       be rendered as the characters (starting with the ampersand and ending
       with the semi-colon) that make up the entity reference.
    8. When rendering content, User Agents that encounter characters or
       character entity references that are recognized but not renderable
       should display the document in such a way that it is obvious to the
       user that normal rendering has not taken place.

for example, from section 3.2 of
http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#normative

(The race to standards compliance heats up -
the Netscape 6 with Gecko that I download some
months ago displays the characters [except for
some combiners] but backwards, the Internet
Explorer 5.5 that I downloaded yesterday
displays the Hebrew correctly. It is really
refreshing to see Microsoft in the lead
[however fleetingly] in a matter of standards
compliance. And, because one of your goals is
to encourage attention to the standards, this
development from Redmond should give you
some satisfaction.)

(Another kudo - recently, I have been typing the
lexrex project into Amaya to get the text itself,
then doing more markup in emacs and with perl
scripts, and it looks like the windows unicode
character browser may be the easiest way I have
found so far to enter the Greek and Hebrew 
quotations. I started the project doing it all
in emacs and the earlier version of Amaya became 
the easier tool to start things with.)
