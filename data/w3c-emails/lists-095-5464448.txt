Thanks for the link. I had not noticed that page.
It helps to follow your progress. I tried to guess
the URI of a similar HTML or XHTML status page,
but failed.

About not supporting first-letter and first-line:

  Those same two pages have many paragraphs with
  first-line indent styles on them and Amaya 5.1
  renders them perfectly! (Something that neither
  Netscape 6 nor Internet Explorer 5.5 does.)
