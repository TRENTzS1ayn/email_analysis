It would be ok if Amaya DID NOT render pseudo first-letter!

However it renders it INCORRECTLY!

When one already has a page marked up for first-letter  as
my home page does, Amaya proceeds to operate on entire paragraph
 rather than ignoring the style altogether.  This makes it hard
to view documents   previously set up for many browsers.


And the workaround for placing indent on first line 
is to place the indent on paragraph  which is much more natural
cuz its the paragraph that is being indented.
