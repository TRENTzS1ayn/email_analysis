(I assume that i had to be subscribed to get this thru to the list, as
the below is still not listed at
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-amaya/2001JulSep/. I'm now
subscribed; hopefully this'll work.)

attached mail follows:
hi,

I'm attempting to compile Amaya 5.1 on my RedHat Linux v6.2 (2.2.14-5.0
kernal).  This is my system's first attempt at compiling Amaya;
previously I installed Amaya via rpm.

To satisfy Amaya's Motif prerequisite, I downloaded openmotif 2.1.30
(openmotif-2.1.30-4_MLI.i386.rpm and
openmotif-devel-2.1.30-4_MLI.i386.rpm from
ftp://openmotif.opengroup.org/pub/openmotif/R2.1.30/binaries/metrolink/)
and installed these w/o error.

However,
# ../configure 
from LINUX-ELF directory still ends with:
'Motif seems not installed on this machine
Amaya need Motif 1.2 or 2.0
Now start "make all" (GNU make preferably) to build the bianries'.

So configure doesn't seem to recognize my OpenMotif.

I also tried ../configure --with-gtk because
"--with-gtk                build Amaya using GTK, instead of Motif"
makes it sound like Motif might not be needed. But the error's the same.

After i installed the openmotif-devel-2.1.30-4_MLI.i386.rpm,
# make all, instead of failing quickly with complaints of not finding,
eg, "xm/ScrollBar.h", lasted ~10min. But it too eventually died, ending
with:

".

collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
make[1]: *** [../bin/amaya] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/local/Amaya/LINUX-ELF/amaya'"

I went back to the instructions. 
http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Autoconf.html says "4. Edit the
Options.orig file as needed".  I think that should be the "Options"
file, not "Options.orig".  I edited the Options file to add
MOTIF_INCLUDES=/usr/X11R6/include
(MOTIF_LIBRARIES=/usr/X11R6/lib wasn't necessary as that directory is
already showing up with make all's gcc -L).  This didn't seem to help,
though.

Suggestions?

thank u,
george
