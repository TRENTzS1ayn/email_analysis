My testing of negative indents with margin 30px and indent -30px
shows msie and netscape doing the same thing, opera not handling
the indentation and Amaya doing a negative indent  but  setting
the start line 30 px in and the remaining lines 60px in --- so it looks
 as hanging indent but with a right shift !!!!
I wonder how detailed the spec is on this.  And thought that CSS
was intended to make design more universal in rendering ;-] ;-]
