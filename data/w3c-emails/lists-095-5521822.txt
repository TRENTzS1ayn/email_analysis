I encounter a somewhat alamrming behaviour with Amamy 5.1 when I load
the file
ftp://sunsite.auc.dk/projects/icking-music-archive/web/index_src.html
and save it. If you compare this file (saved with Amaya 4.3.2) with the
attached version (saved with 5.1) you'll notice that the two last lines
of the <head> section (a <link> and a comment) are moved to the start of
the <body> section with very unconvenient consequences:-(
