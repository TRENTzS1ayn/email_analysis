if after a comment element in a head element there is
a link, meta, or another comment element. the latter 
element is shifted to the body when saved...  this can
cause a previous valid document to become invalid! 

tested using version 5.1 binary on win 98 ---- from
Christians comments this appears as a new bug
not existing in previous version.  I had not used 
comments previously so cant verify if bug is old
but it sure is there !!
