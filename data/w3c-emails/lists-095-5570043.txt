well i found only msie would center tables with text-align:center
  maybe tables are not considered text??

so i tried a different tact  
table {margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto}
this works for opera and netscape
so if i combine what works for msie with this i can
get these three to center a table.....  but no luck
with amaya --- only way is to regress to html attributes
which is going against the separation of structure from 
presentation concept ...  is this a bug that can be fixed???
