The problem is general and consistently repeatable with documents from
different sources. Two that would be easy to replicate: printing the
product of the "make book" command on Manual.html has repeatedly failed
when Amaya reports printing page 64 and it also leaves the spool messed
up; printing AmayaPage.html (the default home page) also fails. And this
just failed:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?>
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
    "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">

  <title>No title</title>
  <meta name="GENERATOR" content="amaya 5.1" />
</head>

<body>
<p>Test. Print this.</p>
</body>
</html>

It printed okay, but that instance of Amaya spontaneously vaporized,
leaving no trace of itself even in the task list.

I just realized I haven't yet tried removing an re-installing Amaya.
I'll do so later this morning and see if that helps. (rusty with this
kind of thing-- many years since I've done much configuration work!)

PS-- I'm sending this to both the list and the originator. Is that the
group's preference, or would it be better to just send replies to the
list?
