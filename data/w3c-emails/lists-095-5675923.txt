At about 2001-07-17 15:03:33 UCT, `keeper' moved the following files from
Incoming to apps/www/browsers/amaya (W3C's Amaya testbed browser/editor):

amaya-5.1.ELF.tar.gz     Amaya is a Web client that acts both as a browser and as an authoring tool.
amaya-5.1.src.tar.gz     Amaya is a Web client that acts both as a browser and as an authoring tool.
amaya-src.lsm            
amaya.lsm                

These replaced the following files:

amaya-4.3.2.ELF.tar.gz   Amaya is a Web client that acts both as a browser and as an authoring tool.
amaya-4.3.2.src.tar.gz   Amaya is a Web client that acts both as a browser and as an authoring tool.
amaya.lsm                

Thank you for your contribution of time, effort, and creativity.

This message was a form letter generated by keeper 1.54, but replying to

If your package was actually uploaded by someone else, and you know who that
person is, please try to get that person to list him or herself in the LSM.
