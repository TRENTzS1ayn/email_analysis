I guess it may be priority setting time for next version of Amaya!

My personal wish list is for: 
1] Completion of the CSS 1  recommendation
2] Completion of the html 4.01 recommendation
3] More mathml character entities... dont know whether 
    this is a STIX problem or a Unicode one but quite a few
    basic entities are missing.  Mind you everyone is in catchup
    mode with new recommendation.
