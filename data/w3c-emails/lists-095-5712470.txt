John,

I generally just lurk on this list as I've been following the development of
Amaya in the hope that eventually it will be a useful tool for our
operation. It's getting there, but it's not ready for me to recommend it as
a replacement for the editor tools we currently use.

I'm interested in your comment in your "wish list" below about a need to
complete the HTML 4.01 Recommendation. Given that both Amaya and W3C are
geared toward XHTML in all its evolving forms, why do we need further work
on HTML 4.01? Hasn't it been superseded by XHTML and shouldn't work on Amaya
be focused solely on implementing the various XHTML Recommendations rather
than going back to a now superseded standard?

Regards,
Tom Murrell
