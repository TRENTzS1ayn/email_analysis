The XHTML 1.0 standard depends upon & incorporates the HTML 4.01 standard.
That's one reason.

As a long-time user, the things that I think would most like to see the
Amaya team complete are

1. HTML 4.01/XHTML 1.0 support
2. CSS 1 support
3. Unicode support
4. Annotea
5. MathML support
6. SVG support

(that's my order of preferences).  There's no need for frames support, as
Amaya is not a consumer browser; and anyone who wants Amaya users to see
their pages shouldn't use frames anyway (they're bad authoring practice) or
should at least provide the "noframes" mechanism.
