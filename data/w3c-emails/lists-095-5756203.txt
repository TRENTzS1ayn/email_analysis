My Amaya usage continues to increase (I figure up to ~70% now)!

Issues: older one's are earlier, new ones (7+) are later.

PENDING

1. I really wish it wouldn't rewrite my names/id to prevent
collision, this has cost me hours in accumulated time in figuring out
where I have broken fragments -- I prefer to rely upon tidy to tell me
about this problem (or have Amaya report a validation problem) instead
of it breaking my links.
2. When editing <pre> deletions in one part create alterations in
unrelated portions of the same pre element.
4. Feature request: no auto-highlight of text within a dialog field. For
example, when changing a link, I have to select the text, delete it, then
type in order to change a URI. This is a super pain if you don't want to
have to resort to your pointing device. (Maybe a ^a to select all?)
5. Feature request: bounce (increase/decrease) the nesting level of nested
lists easily.
7. Amaya presents a huge background image of some icon that make it
impossible for me to see the text when I'm editing in CVS; my w3c
icon has no extension since I expect it will be content negotiated by
http.
   <img src="../../Icons/w3c_home"alt="W3C" border="0" height="48" 
width="72" />
8. How do I make the font size that I prefer stick: maybe it should be
saved with save window position? I feel the start font size is too
large.
9. A shortcut key for skipping/replacing+next in the spell checker so I
don't have to rely upon the mouse and compex navigation to quickly move
through the document.
10. Why doesn't it respect CR/LF when I paste text into the window?
11. Please make "Open in New Window" shift-click so as to be consistent
with every other browser out there. alternate-click might be useful one
day for easily changing other characteristics of the page (like the
class of that paragraph.)
