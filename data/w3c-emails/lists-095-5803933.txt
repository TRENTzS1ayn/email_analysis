Thank you Vince and Dave for the answer!

I was just trying to move from html 4.01loose to strict
and going from the TR for 4.01
Unfortunately section 13 which discusses frames in
detail makes NO mention that frames are not in
 the strict definition ... does this mean that it will not
be supported by future browsers.
This would be unfortunate as i see no alternate to
frames for making sidebar menus that DO NOT SCROLL
OFF SCREEN while reading text.  The alternate approach
as demonstrated in the w3.org material  is rather dumpy ;-[ ;-[

I guess the solution for me is to verify against strict to remove
other problems such as style attributes but put it back to
loose so that i can keep my frame sidebar menu ....
Only other way is fancier menu with javascript and open/closing
branches  but i think there is some issue with javascript as well ???
just trying to do good pages here....
