hi,

ff I invoke the "Attribute/lang" dialog for a <html> element in 
structure view, double-clicking on "German" does not do anything, 
although the popup closes. Also when single-clicking on German, the 
input field remains empty. Am I supposed to copy the text from the list 
above, or must I enter "de" there? I'm using the precompiled version 
for Windows NT...

Hmm.. I found out that closing and reopening the structure view 
reflects the change. However the update in the structure view should be 
automatic I guess.

Regards,
Ulrich Windl
