Hi John,

the alternative to using frames to achieve this is to use CSS positioning.
This does work in many browsers, (more and more) and in browsers where it
doesn't work your navigation bar just stays where it was (in other words it
transforms gracefully cross different browsers). Unfotunately there is not
yet support in Amaya for this part of CSS.

cheers

Charles

  Thank you Vince and Dave for the answer!

  I was just trying to move from html 4.01loose to strict
  and going from the TR for 4.01
  Unfortunately section 13 which discusses frames in
  detail makes NO mention that frames are not in
   the strict definition ... does this mean that it will not
  be supported by future browsers.
  This would be unfortunate as i see no alternate to
  frames for making sidebar menus that DO NOT SCROLL
  OFF SCREEN while reading text.  The alternate approach
  as demonstrated in the w3.org material  is rather dumpy ;-[ ;-[

  I guess the solution for me is to verify against strict to remove
  other problems such as style attributes but put it back to
  loose so that i can keep my frame sidebar menu ....
  Only other way is fancier menu with javascript and open/closing
  branches  but i think there is some issue with javascript as well ???
  just trying to do good pages here....
