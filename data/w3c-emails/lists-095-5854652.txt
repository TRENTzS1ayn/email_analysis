On http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/BinDist.html the HP-UX 10.20
version of Amaya is listed as being available at

http://www.w3c.org/Amaya/Distribution/amaya-hpux_10.20-3.1.tgz

This .tgz file is not in a compressed tar format and it does
not contain any binary (Amaya/bin) files.

Is there another location for the HP-UX 10.20 Amaya distribution
that has binaries ?


Thanks.

Dave Young
