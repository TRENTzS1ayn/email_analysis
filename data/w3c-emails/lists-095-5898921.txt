hi.

I'm not having much luck getting name anchors to work.  For example, in 
one page i have this:
<a href="#Websites">Websites</a>
.
. (much text deleted)
.
<a name="Websites"><b>Websites</b></a>

When i click on the href="#Websites" link above the text does shifts 
downward slightly but nowhere near the name="Websites" target.  Why?

My Amaya is v5.1 (binary libc6 downloaded yesterday) on linux 2.4.2.

These links did work on Mozilla 0.9.2.

thank you,
george

(I searched the w3 archives [on "<a name" and "name anchor"] w/o luck.)
