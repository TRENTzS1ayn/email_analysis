Using amaya 5.1 win32 binary
If a document is still loading from the internet and one tries
to open another document, Amaya aborts back to desktop!

What should happen is program issue a STOP DOWNLOAD
 then continue with the open file operation. 

The workaround is to hit the stop button several times and
when it functions, then do the open file operation.
HOWEVER this is a problem as the stop button is not displayed
until the website is found and if the website for the home page
is off- air   one never can do the stop !!!!!
that problem was reported months ago but yet to be fixed.
