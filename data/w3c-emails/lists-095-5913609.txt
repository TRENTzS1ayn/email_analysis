Histories should be enabled for both the address dialog
AND the open file dialog .... this will aid those who are
working on specific documents ... they can then easily
get back to those recent documents for ammendments.
right now there is a lot of retying  or one can keep resetting
their homepage pointer but that only works for ONE document
all other editors have ways of loading recent docs other 
than having to browse folders.....
