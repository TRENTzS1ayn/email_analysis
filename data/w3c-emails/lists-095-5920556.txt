Windows normally uses the tab key to move around different parts of a dialog
- for example in the "open" dialog, I expect tab to cycle me through the URI
text entry, and the four buttons.

Using version 5.1 the tab key isn't working to do this - I presume it is to
do with the way that tabbing between links was enabled, but I am not sure. I
didn't try re-assigning the function to some other key yet.

Cheers
