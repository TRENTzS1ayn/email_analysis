Is it possible to use the keyboard file to define shortcuts for the various
graphics functions available on the palette? These aren't available via the
menus either, so I have to use a mouse to put them there (then I canedit the
attributes directly).

What would be nice is to have a default placement when they are selected from
teh keyboard, and the ability to move them around before "fixing" them in
place.

This is similar to the functionality that used to exist for making links via
the keyboard - I could use the navigation keys to move around the document
(and between documents) to get to what I wanted to link to. Then I had to
mouse-click to make the link there.

If it was only one key (such as space) that triggered the dialog asking for a
URI, could this be enabled again, with the addition of a key to anchor the
link to wherever the cursor had got to?

Cheers

Charles
