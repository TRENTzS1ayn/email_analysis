Yes, I just found that out. Mozilla doesn't seem to support  this either.  I
cannot see any other sufficiently advanced browser that might.  Ygdrasil don't
seem to have touched Arena since 1998.  Mnemonic seems to have come to a stop
last year.

I am beginning to wonder where all this is going.  I know the Amaya
team is *really* small, but the others don't have that problem.  There
is mention of CSS3 now, there is XSL, there are a whole load of new
things like XHTML, DHTML, not to mention XML, and still standards
of 5 years ago are not implemented.
