After a new release of Amaya there are situations that
may require a bug-fix release for those who do not have
access to CVS and compilers...
I do not know the priorities of the team but I think some
of the situations that should cause a emergency 
fix-it-up and rerelease are:
1] bugs that crash the system
2] bugs that hang the system
3] bugs that destroy files or authors documents
4] bugs that take a file that validated and makes it into
   a file that no longer validates!!!

Currently there exists a type four problem. When comments occur
prior to other elements in the head element of a validated file,
 loading the file into Amaya and saving as foobar creates an invalid file.
meta and link statements can get moved into the body element.
My example (rrdiesel.htm) is included as a test document.

This type of action validates the statement that says Amaya 
produces valid html....  Can a fix be applied!  And if so can a
new binary release be issued so that the 'produces valid html'
 is legit!!!
