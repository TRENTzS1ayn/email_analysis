There used to be an automatically created tarball of the CVS
stuff that was updated daily or {4 hour}ly.  This seems to have
gone, from what I can see on the Amaya website.  I haven't got
my head around this CVS really yet, so I'd support this being
made available again.

Free compilers are available for most platforms...
