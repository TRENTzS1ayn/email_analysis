I tested your file. I only had the problem when the elements following the comment were preceded by a line break. I don't mean a <BR>-element, but an actual line break in the textfile. When the "jumpy" elements (or rather: the first of them) followed the comment on the same line, they didn't jump. Instead Amaya inserted an actual line break. Is a comment in HTML invalid if anything else follows it on the same line? I don't see anything about that in the specification.
