Only on a typewriter, as typewriters must use monospaced fonts. In
electronic typesetting, one uses an extended space after a period (I've
never worked with metal type, so I don't remember if one used two en-spaces
or a special double-en-space or some such piece of type). Word processors
automatically extend the space after a period, as do web browsers. I'd
suggest checking a book on typography out of the library if you're
interested in an extended discussion of this.

This is not correct behavior. The extended spacing should be handled
automatically at the browser level.

Probably a case of Amaya trying to cope with those WYSIWYG HTML editors and
their wrongheaded support of typewriter methods in a (limited, obviously)
electronic typesetting environment.

I hope the above is Amaya's reasoning.

Anyway, I hope this helps. Unfortunately, everyone has taken typing classes,
but no one who teaches keyboarding in this electronic world has ever studied
or practiced electronic typesetting, so this particular bit of
misinformation continues to spread (my own company wrongly uses a double
space in our publications).
