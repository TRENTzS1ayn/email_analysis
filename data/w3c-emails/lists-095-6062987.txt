My mistake.  I thought browsers do, but can't find any evidence to support
that belief, so I am likely wrong.  However, it should be logically possible
to distinguish *most* end-of-sentence periods from *most* other periods (see
if the letter following the space following the period is a capital, and
then check the letters before the period to see if they match those
abbreviations (like courtesy titles, or the Ph. in Ph.D., U.S. in U.S.A.,
etc.) most likely to end in periods and be followed by a capital, etc.).
