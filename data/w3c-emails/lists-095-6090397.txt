I'd like to develop a Java-based application that will "catch" and process
DOM update events from an interactive HTML editor.  I'm wondering if Amaya
would be a suitable platform for this.  I know that the soure code is in C;
has anyone developed a Java API for Amaya?  If not, does anyone know of
other open source programs that might be suitable?

Thanks very much,
Larry Bergman
