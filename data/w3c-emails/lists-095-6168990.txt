As I'm working with Amaya and Emacs for correction, I would like to know
how to support
Special ISO-8859-1 caracters input with Amaya like ?, ?,  ... (I don't
like to enter entities).
Note that it looks a bit odd because under Linux, any X application
supports this caracters input
(even the big bugged Netscape 4)...

Thank you,

Alexandre
