BOTTOM LINE... IS AMAYA THE BEST TOOL FOR LEARNING XHTML CODING ON.... YES
OR NO.

YOUR ANSWER AND ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE TO ADD WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED.

THANKS,

I am intently looking for the best XHTML Editor for learning and bridging
the gap between HTML and XML and beyond. Since you are the source of
"authority about such matters" it would seem that Amaya would be the perfect
tool... However.

As I did a small comparison of it's capability as a browser viewing common
web sites like "www.msn.com", "www.yahoo.com" and a website we created with
FrontPage 2000 for our Intranet. The Results with Amaya viewing "msn" and
"yahoo" were pretty miserable... with the FP2000 site a great deal better.
And, The turning the whole thing around... Of course, Amaya views your
w3.com site perfectly but the other browsers have odd little difficulties.

By the way the Browsers I'm using are Internet Explorer 5.5, SP1, and the
latest version of browser that comes with Copernic 2001 Pro ( v 5.02 ) {by
the way the greatest little search engine you'll ever run across.} And I do
want to try it with the latest version of Netscape... 

It really would take me a very long time to list the differences I noticed
in just a short browse of just a couple of pages.

ALL THIS ASSIDE (almost) MY QUESTION IS... IF AMAYA IS POOR AT BROWSING IS
THAT JUST BECAUSE... IT JUST ISN'T MATURED AS A BROWSER YET OR BECAUSE OF
THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HTML AND XHTML AND XML OR THE LIKE... OR THAT IT
WASN'T SUPPOSED TO BE A BROWSER IN THE FIRST PLACE AND THAT FUNCTIONALITY IS
RECEIVING LESS ATTENTION... ETC. ETC. ETC.

BOTTOM LINE... IS AMAYA THE BEST TOOL FOR LEARNING XHTML CODING ON.... YES
OR NO.

YOUR ANSWER AND ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE TO ADD WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED.

THANKS,
BOB
