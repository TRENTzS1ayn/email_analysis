I think that every system with a built-in validator is ok :-)

Actually, there are some "features" (like frames, if I 
remember correctly) which are not present in Amaya by design;
moreover, FrontPage is known to add some "features" on its 
own, which are not standard (nothing really strange - 
Netscape won over Mosaic for the very same reason...)
