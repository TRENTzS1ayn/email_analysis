Amaya's as Browser Vs Amaya as Coding ToolStrictly speaking, frame ARE
present in Amaya. It's just that they're displayed in a way that differs
from your vanilla user-oriented browser...

I'm more worried about Amaya not implementing the DOM and a reference
ECMAscript engine than about frames.

Actually, there are some "features" (like frames, if I
remember correctly) which are not present in Amaya by design;
moreover, FrontPage is known to add some "features" on its
own, which are not standard (nothing really strange -
Netscape won over Mosaic for the very same reason...)
