Note, this is just a perspective from a user:

Amaya is not a great tool for learning to code, although it can be used to
teach you that. It is a good  tool for creating code without learning too
much about the details - all you need to understand is the structure of what
you are trying to write and it can do the coding for you. As an XHTML
authoring tool I use it a lot and find it is good, and has excellent support
for the standards.

It is true that the browsing functionality is not generally as important to
the development team as the editing functionality - particlarly in coping
with non-standard HTML or XML.

And remember that it is an open source product, led by a very small team,
trying to implement a large number of specifications. If you are a programmer
and can contribute, please do so.

cheers
