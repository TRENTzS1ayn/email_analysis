I like the way Amaya and Lynx treat frames, giving
me control over my windows in spite of everything
those nasty page authors can do to try to force me
to spend window real estate on things I'm not 
interested in and force me to have my window the
same shape as theirs. (And always have the keyboard
focus in the wrong frame so PgUp and PgDn and UpArrow
and DownArrow scroll some part of the screen other
than what I am looking at.)

And I really do consider the page authors in question
to be nasty.

Down with absolute widths.

When will Amaya allow me to create a local stylesheet
that cascades ahead of the page author's stylesheet
and overwhelms those absolute width features.

Or the dark green stripe on the right hand edge of
everything at www.townhall.com that makes the last
few characters of every line toward the bottom of
each article invisible and indistinguishable?

(I haven't done much playing with Amaya 5.1 -- does
it now allow the reader to cascade his own stylesheet
in priority over the styles of the author? Of course,
what I really want is to make a stylesheet that trumps
all the Netscape-invented appearance markup.)
