Hi,

I am behind a proxy and want to use amaya for browsing net.

When I specify the proxy address in my configuration menu option, it halts
saying Reading <site Address>..

I have the rights on the proxy.. so no issues regarding authentication pop
up etc.

what do I have to do... 


regards

raghav..
