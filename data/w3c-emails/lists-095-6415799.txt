Hello!

This sounds very strange. Have you tried to do a telnet IpAddressOfProxy port
from your station and see what it answers?

Could you send me a copy of your amaya.rc file too? If you are under Unix,
it should be under ~/$HOME/.amaya/. If you're under Windows, you should
open the Special/Preferences/General menu. It will tell you where it is
storing the user preferences.

Thanks,

-jose
