Would it be feasible for Amaya to maintain multi-line formatting for "description" and "keywords" meta entries? 
 
My content attributes are lengthy, so for ease in editing, 
I split these over several lines using Source view. 
 
When saving from the main view, Amaya reformats these content 
attributes, converting all linefeeds to spaces. Can this behavior 
be changed?
