This request could also include a setting for where to wrap at....
Raggetts tidy utility includes a document width setting which
amaya should adopt for readability purposes.

Unfortunately tidy also fails wrap settings within the head section
so it cant be used to correct for this. i do have a utility that i
carved for this use. it can be done with awk or perl as well.
