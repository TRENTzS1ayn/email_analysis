I couldn't find any amaya.rc in the system, but I could of course locate
thot.rc in winnt\profiles\raghvendrash\amaya 

and one win-thot.rc in program files\amaya\config 

I put the proxy address in both of them, but it didn't help. 

I am attaching both the files for your reference.

raghav..

Hello! 

This sounds very strange. Have you tried to do a telnet IpAddressOfProxy
port 
from your station and see what it answers? 

Could you send me a copy of your amaya.rc file too? If you are under Unix, 
it should be under ~/$HOME/.amaya/. If you're under Windows, you should 
open the Special/Preferences/General menu. It will tell you where it is 
storing the user preferences. 

Thanks, 

-jose
