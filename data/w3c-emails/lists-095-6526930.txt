I am using Amaya to create MathML snippets for my mostly non-mathematical 
web pages.

I noticed that the Greek Alphabet menu in the Amaya MathML editor also 
contains some handy math symbols, one of which is the approximately-equal 
symbol, located in the fourth row of the grid, immediately to the left of 
capital Greek "alpha". (It looks like a tilde stacked on top of a standard 
equals sign.) One of my "equations" is only approximately correct, so I 
tried to use this symbol for the first time today. Upon clicking the 
symbol, Amaya incorrectly writes this into the file as the character entity 
&Congruent;, rather than as &cong; (equivalent to &#8773; or U+2245, 
according to Chapter 24 of the HTML 4.0 spec). The next time Amaya opens, 
it displays the incorrect expression as an identity symbol (this looks like 
an equals sign with a 50% bonus).

Although I can fix the symbol by hand (and it thankfully stays fixed, once 
I correct it), I am hoping that the fix would be a "quickie" replacement of 
the &Congruent; string with a &cong; string in a table somewhere. 
Unfortunately, IANAP (I am not a programmer), so I can't do it myself.

I am running the Windows 95/98 precompiled binary, downloaded from the 
public Amaya site. Thank you for your consideration.
