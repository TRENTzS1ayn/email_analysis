When opening a new document that references external stylesheets, I
cannot manage to make amaya display all available class attributes (be
it internally or externally defined) in the "Apply class..." dialog box.
Only those already in use in the document are made available.

Thus I supppose that when it opens (and then updates its vision of) an
HTML document, amaya parses only this document to build the list of
class that will be displayed in the dialog box, external sources being
ignored.

Is there a way to configure amaya in order to solve this problem ?

Thanks in advance and congratulations for this pretty good editor.
