I have a really odd problem with Amaya (at least for me!).
I compiled it and everything went fine, I tested
it with "bin/amaya" and again no problems, a nice window opened,
everything seemed to be fine, so I run " make install " .
I got this error: /bin/install: ../../amaya/AmayaPage.html
../../amaya/AmayaPage.html.fr :  no such file or directory.
What does it mean? I really have no idea....
Thanks for any help,

Stefano
