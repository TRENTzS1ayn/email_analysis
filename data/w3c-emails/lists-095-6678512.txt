Oh, mistake.

The use element had been placed inside a group that was not supposed to
display. But it still seemed to behave strangely. (I was using an external
reference - it seems to work OK is the symbol is in the same file as in
http://www.w3.org/1999/09/poulet.svg - the external symbol file that also
uses the symbol a couple of times)

cheers

  Using Amaya release 5.1 for Windows 98 on VirtualPC the use and image
  elements do not behave properly for the following picture:

  The image element generates a big broken picture icon. The use element does
  nothing at all.
