I repost my question hoping that someone can help me.
I'm running Linux (not an ufficial distribution) and I'm trying to 
install amaya from sourse.
Running "./configure" and "make all" don't give me any trouble, I also  
test it with /bin/amaya and everything is fine, amaya opens correctly 
and all the buttons work well.
The problems come up during the install process, with the error 
message  "../../../amaya.html not found" (99%) or "amaya.html and 
amaya.html.fr are the same file" (1%).
I checked for amaya.html but i haven't found it anywhere.
I also tried different versions and different download compressed files 
but i got the same error.
Thanks for any help,

Stefano
