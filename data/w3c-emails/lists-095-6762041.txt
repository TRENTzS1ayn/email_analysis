The color encoding differs with each platform (Windows or Unix) and each 
screen depth. I tested a lot of these configurations including the
16 Bit screen + Windows platform (Win 95/98/NT) and it works correctly
with tested images (those included in the AmayaPage.html, Annotations.html, 
etc.)
Do you have troubles with these images?
