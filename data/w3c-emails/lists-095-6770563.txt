Yes, both the images on http://www.w3.org/Amaya/Amaya.html and the
local amaya.png are wrong. In Opera 3.6, IE 5.5 and Netscape 4.7
they are displayed correct. The amaya.png seems to be a gray scaled
picture, but amaya shows it in some violet and olive. When I capture
the wrong image from the display and take it apart in RGB with
PaintShopPro, I can see, that the blue part is correct, but the red
and green part are not correct.

With kind regards
