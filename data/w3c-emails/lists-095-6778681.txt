Hallo,

I experimented on some pictures, perhaps the results can help fixing
the bug. I constructed a picture with pure red, pure green, pure
blue, mixed red-green = yellow, mixed red-blue = magenta, mixed
blue-green = cyan, white, black.
Amaya shows this picture correctly in gif, jpg and png. Then I
transformed the picture to a gray-scaled. The colornumbers (as they
are read in PaintShopPro) are now each identical for the three
color-parts; they are 76, 150, 28, 226, 104, 178, 255, 0 in the
above order. This gray-scaled picture Amaya doesn't show correctly.
In gif and jpg I get dark and light violet for 150, 226, 178 and
olive for 76 and 104. For 28 I get near black. If you need
colornumbers, I can read them from the screenshot. In png the
picture is shown completely wrong or amaya crashes with closing.

with kind regards
