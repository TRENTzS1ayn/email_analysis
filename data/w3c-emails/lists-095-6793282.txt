the CSS style reference page
http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/
really gets mangled in Amaya....
mind you msie, netscape, and opera
are all having problems with this page too.
it says something about consistancy of implementation
(or lack thereof). Stylesheets were supposed to solve
this but many pages WITHOUT style seem to render
better across the range of browsers.....
This may be more deeply rooted than an Amaya
implementation issue but work is required in this browser too.
