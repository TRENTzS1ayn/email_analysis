I don't think any browser can handle that page: as Mr. Russell said, even
Opera and Mozilla have serious problems (e.g., in Mozilla, the overlap
between the first paragraph and the border of the rounded-cornered box, in
Opera, the alpha is inconsistent, the rounded boxes aren't rounded, etc.).
Perhaps the designer ran away with the technologies too much.
