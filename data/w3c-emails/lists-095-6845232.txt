You could use RCS to do this for you, with $Date$ and/or $Revision$.
I have a few links to info on RCS at:
http://www.eng.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~hgs/#RCS
SCCS will do similar things for you, but I can't remember how.  Note, the
timestamp refers to the checkin date.

Hope that is near enough for your needs.
