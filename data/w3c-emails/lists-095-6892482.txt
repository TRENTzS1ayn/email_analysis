If a user has a defined spreadsheet, shouldn't its style
override that of any author defined style (excluding !imporant)
That way vision challenged users can 'fix' poor choices of
contrast to suit.
If that is the intended action of the cascade, then it is busted
in Amaya as my Amaya.css has no effect on other designer's work.
