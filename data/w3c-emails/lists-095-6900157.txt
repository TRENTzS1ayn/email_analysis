Since there is a pending release in less than a month and
since Amaya is considered an editor first please check 
these issues that existed on last windows binary release:

Editor Problems
E1] The shortcut procedure (shift ctrl *) for edit mode toggle does not work.
    However the menu selection method works fine!
E2] Shft-End and Shft-Home do not highlight text for cut/copy operation.
E3] Shift-DownArrow includes first character of next line in highlight
    when it should not do so.
E4] Star-O does not enter Oslash as advertised. Perhaps character mapping 
error!

Keyboard Shortcuts
K1] Standard shortcut nomenclature should be used in menus.
    For example Alt + P  instead of Alt p
