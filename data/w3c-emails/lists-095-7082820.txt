I have been experimenting with Dia
http://www.lysator.liu.se/~alla/dia/dia.html
(actually the windows version: http://dia-installer.sourceforge.net/ )
and this is meant to produce SVG files, which it does, but they start with

<?xml version="1.0" standalone="no"?>
<!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD SVG 20000802//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/CR-SVG-20000802/DTD/svg-20000802.dtd">

Which is not the 1.0 scheme as described on the SVG page:
http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/Overview.htm8#more

When I put the images into Amaya they come up almost invisible.   I have
tried changing the header in one file to agree with the 1.0 spec
to fudge this, but it still displays incorrectly.

So the question is: "is the bug in Amaya, in Dia, or are they using
incompatible SVG specs?".  To answer that I need a validator for SVG, but I
cannot find one.  Is this because there isn't one, or have I just not found it
yet? If there is one, I can check the images are valid before asking anything
else, otherwise, would the Amaya team like to have such an image to explore?
