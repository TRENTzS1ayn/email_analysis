This is not a Dia Bug. 

Dia's export filter seems to work pretty well, 
based on the august SVG specification, 
before that SVG 1.0 was released as a recommandation.
That's why Doctype declaration differs.

Amaya recognizes Dia's SVG, 
but the current implementation of SVG in Amaya is not yet complete.

The Dialog named "Parsing error", 
that can be accessed from the view menu, 
diplays warnings for unsupported SVG tags in Amaya.

There isn't any SVG validator for now.

Regards,

Paul
