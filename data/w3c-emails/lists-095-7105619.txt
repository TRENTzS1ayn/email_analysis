I have a Macintosh G3 Powerbook, and I installed OS X on it to try and
install Amaya natively.

The good news is that I know of at least one working installation of Amaya on
OS X (on a G4 PowerMac - the big black ones)

The bad news is that I could not get Amaya to compile on my system.

I will post a screenshot and installation notes as soon as I have worked out
how to do it.

I had tried to use fink, which provides a debian-type system. It provides an
Amaya source package for version 4.2.1 but couldn't successfully download the
src tarball from ftp://fftp.w3.org

So I downloaded the Amaya source and tried to compile it in /usr/local/ but
compiling Amaya failed becuase it couldn't find the Motif libraries, which
are in an unusual location with fink ( /sw/Lesstif/ - not Motif itself).

When installed it runs fine.

Possiblities I haven't tried:

installing the gtk version.

installing Motifnot Lesstif

installing the 4.2.1 source as fink wants it and using fink to do the rest of
the install.

getting someone who has compiled it successfully to make a debian binary
package

-just thought this might be interesting. I will follow up the technical
troubleshooting on amaya-dev but when I have some workable instructions that
seem reasonably certain I will post the details here again.

cheers
