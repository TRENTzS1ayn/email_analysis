Thanks to Joel Rodrigues for the following link:

http://www.darwinfo.org/ports/show.php3?node=X11/applications

it describes some more information about compiling Amaya, although it points
to a version 3 source.

Still hoping to make this work for me, but no more time to play with it.

cheers

Charles
