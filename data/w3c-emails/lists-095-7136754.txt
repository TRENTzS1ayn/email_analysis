Morning Jose,

Are you using hardcoded paths here? Under Win2k, the paths are different,
again.

There are functions within the Win environment that you can use to locate
these paths, that may help out Christoph, assuming he has configured the
paths to be picked up automagically.

It has something to do with SpecialPaths, but I couldn't find it in MSDN
this morning... But it is part of the scripting runtime, for sure.

HTH,
Gary Klesczewski





Hello Christoph,

We implemented the \winnt\profiles\USERNAME target directory as this
is what our other Windows NT users had advised us to do. Perhaps there is
another way to do so that is more portable? We're open to suggestions.

If I understood correctly, what you want to do is install the Amaya
application
in a server and have the users run it from other boxes. What you could do
is to open the Amaya\config\win-thot.rc file and add the following line
under the [thot_lib] section:

APP_HOME=\path\to\the\dir\where\you\want\to\store\the\profile

For example, you could use the name of a drive found on every computer. A
drawback of this approach is that depending on what you select, users
profiles
may get mixed up if they are all stored in the same file.

Tell us if it works OK or if you have other suggestions.

Cheers,

-jose
