Ola todos,

You're welcome, Charles.

If anyone here succeeds in getting the current version of Amaya running, be
sure to let us all know about it. I'll have OS X (10.1) within the next
week, so I'll give it a go after that.

I think it's time there was a distribution for Mac OS X available on the W3C
Amaya site.

Here's a possibly relevant/helpful Apple page :

UNIX Development on Mac OS X
http://developer.apple.com/unix/

Cheers,
Joel
