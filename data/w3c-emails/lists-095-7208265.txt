I haven't had any difficulty as i run a utility that adds/removes
 <cr> for moving between m$ and everyone else.
However if it is easy to add to amaya then go for it. The mechanism
for selection should be in Preferences as it normally would be set 
one way or other.  It is not desireable to make it a part of SaveAs
dialog unless it was preset to Preference selection and only touched
on a one off basis....   
The big question is why one would be using NotePad anyways....
In the windows world Textpad is far superior as it at least has
spellcheck and  html tagging thru macros.
