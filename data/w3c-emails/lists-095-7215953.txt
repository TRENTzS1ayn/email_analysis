For utility: it's very lightweight, doesn't mess up fonts when pasting,
doesn't inadvertantly double space your lines, or have any rubbish like
spellcheking that eats up memory.

Yes, it would be easy to write a Python script or whatever to fiddle about
with the whitespace, but it would be nicer to have the feature in Amaya in
the first place IMO. Plenty of feature requests for Amaya though, like
don't treat line breaks as whitespace: when editing in a text editor, you
have to remember to add a space when re-formatting.
