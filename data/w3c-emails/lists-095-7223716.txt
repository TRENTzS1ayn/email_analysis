Amaya needs all the effort the developers can put into making the code more 
stable and usable. I think what is asked is a waste of time and effort.

Notepad is a notorious stupid editor. Why don't you use Writepad, instead? 
It's also small and much more useful (and read Unix's LF). And it's there, 
for you, Windows' users.
