I too would like Amaya to be able to save files readable in Windows
Notepad.  A preference setting for that would be nice.  Or, suggest in
the Amaya help an alternative to Notepad that also is inexpensive,
small, fast, and doesn't change spacing or newlines.  Maybe I'll try
TextPad http://TextPad.com (v4.5, US$27, 2.6 MB download) or HandyHTML
http://SilverAgeSoftware.com (v1.4, US$30, 1.6 MB download).  I don't
always use Amaya to edit HTML.

David
