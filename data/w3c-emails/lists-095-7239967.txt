Suggestions for alternative raw text editors under windows: (For free (as
in beer), the right price!)
Programmer's File Editor ( http://www.lancs.ac.uk/people/cpaap/pfe ) - I
use this quite heavily. It's small, fast, flexible, and can handle Huge
text files.
XEmacs (Yep, it's available for Win32, check out xemacs.org)
vi (again, around and about. You will need to get the Cygwin package from
Red Hat though. I haven't found it anywhere else)
gvim (No clue where, but it does havea  Win32 version)

HTH,
Gary Klesczewski
