I too can confirm this error.  I have found that many
software products seem to have trouble with 16bit
graphics.  Other color depths work fine, but 16bit
causes trouble.  Quick Time used to have trouble
detecting hardware in 16 bit mode.  If Amaya bypasses
the Windows driver layer in some way, try going
through the Windows driver layer.
