The issue is that the input document is wrong. If you refer to
the specification [1], you'll see that there is no charset
attribute for the meta element.  The charset information must be
put in the content attribute, and this is what Amaya does when
it saves the document.  But Amaya is still wrong: it should not
keep the (wrong) charset attribute that was in the input file.

Probably something to be fixed in a future release.

Vincent.
