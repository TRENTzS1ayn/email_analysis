Hi,

i need to embeed an SVG viewer into our client C++ application.

We don't need too complicated SVG constructs,
but it should be possible to modify dynamically from C
the current loaded SVG picture.
We receive dynamic data updates in the client from a server
and need to update parts in the SVG drawing.

In a future version, it is possible that we need
to support some chinese dialekt as well.

Can you recommend Amaya-SVG for such a task?

thanks for any hints or recommondations,

Marcel
