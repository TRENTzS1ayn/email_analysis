I tested 16 bit screens on several configurations but the trouble didn't
appear: Win 95 + NeoMagic, Win98 + Matrox, WinNT + Matrox.
I looked for information on the Web and I found out trouble reports
with the video card ASUS V3000.
Messages explain that colors should be encoded 565 (5 red 6 green, and 5 blue)
to work fine. I guess the code do that but I cannot debug on that platform.
Could somebody help?
