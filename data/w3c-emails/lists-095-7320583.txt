I may be able to help debug, as I see the problem on Win95 OSR2 with an ATI Graphics Xpression. The same PC multi-boots with Windows 2000 and RedHat Linux 7.1. 
 
So far I have only tested Amaya 5.1 under Win95. I've attached a screen shot which shows the problem. The small ZIP file expands to a 2.5MB Windows 24-bit BMP image. 
 
Would I need any tools other than Visual C++ 5.0 to build Amaya and help debug this issue?
