Hi everybody!

I have a simple question about the SVG support in Amaya : Is Amaya 
implementing the Rotate operation from  SVG?
I have some friends that were trying to use ROTATE operation  in the 
TRANSFORM attribute, but they don't succeed.. They even tried some 
examples from the SVG manual.... May it be a configuration problem?

Thanks a lot!

Manuele
