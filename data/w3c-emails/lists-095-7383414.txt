dear amaya-team,

i have noticed that amaya ignores if
i specify the size of an in html included image like

<img src="picture.jpg" height="70%">

it simply ignores the %-sign and makes
70 pixels out of it, you can check it when
reopening a page that was saved with amaya -
the % sign is gone.

would you please fix this bug?

many thanks,
 michael bunk
