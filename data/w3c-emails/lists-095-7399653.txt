I achieved -some- improvement by changing the encoding, as shown in the 
attached ZIP file. As before, this expands to a 2.5MB 24-bit Windows .BMP 
file. The background is now gray scale, but foreground still appears to 
contain too much red and blue. To get this result, I changed one source line: 
  
 bshift = 10; 
 
However, I'd guess that these original lines from WIN_MakeImage() already 
attempt to encode 5:6:5 - 
 
 rshift = 0; 
 gshift = 5; 
 bshift = 11; 
 
I'd be glad to test any specific changes to the code which you can suggest. 
Or, to develop and test more extensive changes on my own, some detailed 
documentation on color encoding would be helpful. 
 
I've used the version of gifhandler.c extracted from amaya-src-5.1.tgz 
because WinCVS is advertised to require Windows 98. If this source file has 
been updated, do you know of any way to download the latest CVS under Windows 
95? The easiest method for me would be if your team could revive the CVS 
Daily Snapshot.
