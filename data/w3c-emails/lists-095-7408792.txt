Greetings,
     As a newcomer to this list, my reason for joining is that, as an
educator, I prefer using open source software for student
experiments/exercises.  In March next year I will be starting a course on
internet installation and web-site authoring and administration.

     At present my intention is to use Amaya as a 'reference' vehicle
against which all student work will be measured.  I do, however, have a
number of detail mis-givings about the state of CSS2 feature implementation
in some respects in version 5.1 - using xhtml 1.1.

     Are the following likely to be fixed/implemented in 5.2 or a later
version which may be available before March next year?

     a.   Table/block centring -
          sometag {display: table ; margin-left:auto ; margin-right: auto}
     does not work as stated in the last para of CSS2 10.3.3 and used as
     second example in 17.4.1.

     b.   Table spreading - a two cell row with the first cell text-align:
     left and the second (an image) with padding-right:0pt in a 100% width
     table does not, as expected, occupy 100% of the width - just the
     concatenated cell width!

     c.   Table cell vertical alignment where a text and an image cell
     adjacent on a row both have vertical-align: middle the alignment seems
     to be 'top' in both cases - certainly the text and image are not
     aligned centrally.

     d.   An image with width and height set to auto in a table cell width
     also auto - even with padding of 0pt has some padding - which is
     greater on the right than on the left by a couple of pixels!!

     Note that a and b above with xhtml 1.0 transitional using an 'align'
attribute in the xml page table/cell tags work as expected - not as
described above!
