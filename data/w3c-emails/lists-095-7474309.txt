Well, I apologize for the second post on the same topic.

I was too quick: the new documents created with version 5.2, as they are 
read after they have been saved, look the same way the documents created 
with ver. 5.1.

The HTML header is the same. So I suppose that the characters set rendering 
fails; perhaps it reads the Extended ascii set like a standard ascii set.

That's all this time.

Thanks for your patience.
