1. A detail to a bug already reported: Amaya 5.2 is displaying an A^
character in front of the copyright character (written as numerical entity
&#169;)

2. In an XML file with a CSS sheet, the background-color for the root
element (whose children are block elements) does not fill the whole width of
the page: there is gray on either side.  Adding a padding of 1em only adds
1em of extra white space; the gray stripes remain.

Of the three browsers on this computer capable of rendering XML files with
CSS - Mozilla, IE, and Amaya - Amaya's rendering is the best so far.
