the Ahat is not in the delivered document but is a result
of a space character between two tags at 'show background images'

more bad news  --- an atilda character causes a pound stirling character
to be added to the document.....

so it looks like these errors are not just from character entity troubles
but a deeper issue...  hopefully a 5.2.1 release fixes as this really
affects usefulness.  haven't tested whether saving doc puts messed
up stuff in permanently but suspect so as it appears in the source view
of amaya.  

also hope that retention of spacing in meta tags is fixed for .1 bug repair.
