I'm using a dual-processor HP Kayak (kayuck) running Windows 2000.

I downloaded the installer for version 5.2 of the Amaya Windows NT
distribution (amaya-WindowsNT-5.2.exe) and it installed just fine. However,
the application failed to launch and/or give any feedback (error messages,
events, etc.). When double-clicking on the icon or shortcut, it appears as
though nothing happens at all.

I am a developer and not entirely unfamiliar with getting programs to run,
but I was unable to achieve success with this particular distribution.

However, out of desperation, I downloaded the Windows 98 version
(amaya-Windows95-5.2.exe) and to my surprise the application ran just fine!

I have subsequently confirmed that re-installing the NT version still
doesn't work and the 98 version still does work.

Just thought you'd like to know...
