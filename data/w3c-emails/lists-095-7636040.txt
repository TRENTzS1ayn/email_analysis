In addition to the Linux tar-gzipped and RPM packages, we're now also shipping  
a Debian package of the latest Amaya-GTK distribution. This package was 
generated on a Debian 2.2r3 stable release.

Note that the Debian site also generates such versions, but, unfortunately,
only using the testing and unstable Debian releases. The goal of our
package is to allow people to upgrade their Amaya version when running on
Debian stable.
