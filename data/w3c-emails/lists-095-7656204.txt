Would it be possible to update the User interface for character formats
please?
  - It should be possible for text-decoration to be checkboxes rather than
      radio buttons.
  - It should be possible to select any font, and a backup font family
      selected by radio button would be helpful.

Font sizes should be relative measures (em or % would be good) except for
the user style sheet. (It would be good to have a way of directly opening the
user style sheet out of the preferences or somewhere).

Can we please have back the possiblity of opening a new style sheet (or text
document)? I know Amaya is not a very useful text editor, but since it is
difficult to use it in conjunction with other programs it would be nice to
have the possiblity available. I presume it is still in the codebase...

Can we have a possiblity to save the style sheet of a page (save the contents
of all style elements in a seperate document, and link it as a stylesheet).

How hard is it to add an interface for specifying margins left right top and
bottom? (prefereably in em units not pt)

cheers

Charles
