Using Amaya5.2a, Win98, in browser mode:
I go to our website at 
http://www.eng.dmu.ac.uk/aeg/
and it picks up the colours correctly from the stylesheet.  How do I 
get at the alternate stylesheets I have defined?  Is this not implemented
yet?

Also, when I select text with the mouse, eg from the URL window
it does not seem to end up in the clipboard.

Finally, when I go to that doc I get a dialogue box saying:
   With the current Amaya profile:
   XHTML 1.0 Transitional [Editor]
   Editing and saving this document will change its type
                [Confirm]

* I cannot set the profile to be HTML 4.01 -- I only seem to have access
  to XHTML profiles.  Is this correct?

* This is a warning message, telling me of something I don't want.
  I don't really want to Confirm this.  Maybe the button should be called
  "Done"?

* I cannot save this document because it is on another machine which won't
  allow this.  Could Amaya detect this, so it doesn't tell me about 
  consequences of things I cannot do anyway?  I don't know if the protocols
  can detect this.
  
Thank you,
Hugh
