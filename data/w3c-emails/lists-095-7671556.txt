I am getting this message when i test my mathml demo page.

1] what is the correct profile setting for EDITTING mathml

2] if i have selected browser mode I should not get this message
but reselecting edit should then warn me.... ie if i come to this
page in browser mode there should be no warning....

3] several math symbols are displayed inside boxes, others are
 displayed as anticipated.  is the box conveying some info, if so what.
 and should they be there in browse mode. 

Amaya 5.1 displayed this page ok except for missing entities which
it flagged in the parse errors window.  now i don't get these messages
