Thanks for your message and encouragement. Unfortunately, I don't know yet
well enough how to use the Debian packaging tools to do the static linking.

What I can tell you is that I downloaded the openmotif Debian package [1]
and installed it. It's a free package. Maybe there's a more recent Lesstif
stable package too.

If you know how to do this change in the Debian rules, tell me so and I will
generate a static linked Amaya Motif :) I know how to do that in our
tar-gzipped distribution.

Maybe someone else can help us.
