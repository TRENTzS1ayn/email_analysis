Hello, 

In fact, we have just anticipate an interesting work.

David Carlisle, who was the editor of the spec, has written an XSLT stylesheet 
that will allow a Web page with MathML markup to be displayed in many 
browsers. The XSLT stylesheet he's written allows you to make your page with 
MathML markup (with MathML namespace) and a stylesheet PI that points to his 
stylesheet. Browsers that display MathML natively -like Amaya- will just 
ignore this stylesheet PI. For Internet Explorer, the stylesheet modifies the 
document and allows to display MathML with TechExplorer and other plug-ins. 
There's a fall-back, if no plug-ins are installed on Internet Explorer, then 
it attempts to display formula using CSS. Browsers covered are Internet 
Explorer, Mozilla soon.

This work is not yet achieved, so it has not been moved to the W3C site.
Refer to the MathML Working Group for the announcement.

Cordially
