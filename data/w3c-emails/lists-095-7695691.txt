my mathematics demo page is at

http://www.cgocable.net/~jrussel/mathmlde.htm

and has doctype XHTML1.1 plus MATHML2.0

can one of the existing profiles be used or can user add their
own. if not will an appropriate one be added to the profile
dialog.

also the profile dialog should open with the currently selected
or defaulted value highlighted for user edification !!
