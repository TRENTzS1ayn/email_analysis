Right it's not implemented yet.

The message warns you that you can potentially edit and re-publish this 
document
with a different document type. In this particular case the document type is 
strict and your editing profile is transitional (no warnings appears when 
you're
using a browsing profile).
In the future we plan to handle the Amaya profile document by document. But
meanwhile we prefer to inform the user of potential alteration of documents
even if eighty percent of times he doesn't plan to edit the document.

You confirm that you've read the message. Done works too.

I don't know too.
