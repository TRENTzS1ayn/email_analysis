I think these are appearing to indicate that an entity doesn't
have a glyph yet.  However instead of appearing where they should,
they are sliding to the left edge of the area and overprinting valid
 symbols ... a rendering problem.
And the feature of showing unimplemented symbols in the parse errors
dialog was a great help in finding the problems.   now this
has been removed SOB SOB WEEP!
