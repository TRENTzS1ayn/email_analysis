Greetings,
     Attached is a minimalist table bug problem.  The intent is that the
100% wide table gets one cell on the left and the other on the right -
which it does in mozilla and friends.

     I added borders to see where the cells are - and you will see another
bug - the table border is around a fictitious area wider at the right and
higher at the top than the real table contents!

     Incidentally, why does the 'text-align:right' also work if the actual
logo (as an 'img') is there?  Surely there is no text to align to the right
- or is an image viewed as in-line text?  I can't see this from the CSS2
Recommendation - where is it please?

                        Keith Hopper
