The doctype used in your pages allows you to validate these pages
but this doctype is not largely supported and it doesn't work as 
soon as your Web pages include SVG, RDF, or any other XML elements.

After a discussion with MathML guys we decided to not generate 
this doctype but to add a stylesheet PI in all Web pages that 
include MathML elements.
That PI should point to the David Carlisle XSLT stylesheet that 
will allow a Web page with MathML markup to be displayed in many
browsers. The XSLT stylesheet will be available soon.
