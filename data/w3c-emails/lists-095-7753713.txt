For those who are interested to have a look at our work in progress on the 
internationalized Amaya version, a Win98 version and a Linux version are 
available. Today these versions are not too demonstrative because they work 
vith a very limited set of fonts.

These distributions are complete but they can share configuration files with 
standard distributions. 
Binaries are stored within specific sub-directories: Amaya\I18N\bin\amaya.exe
for the Windows version, Amaya/unicode/bin/amaya for the Linux version.
