Thanks for your report.
Effectively there is a rendering problem with these entities. There is also 
another problem if you save document. I'am working on these two bugs.

It was sometime usefull but, in the other hand, many users tols us that only 
invalid entities should be shown in the parse errors dialog, not unimplemented 
ones. Moreovere, we are working on an internationalized version of Amaya that 
will support a larger set of fonts, so more glyphs will be available.
