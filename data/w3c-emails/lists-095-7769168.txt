list-style-image  does not work in amaya 5.2

is there a list of unimplemented CSS properties
and html attributes or is it to be a learn by discovery' thing.

since the feature that showed unimplemented math entities
was removed from the parse errors windows (rightfully so!)
perhaps an unimplemented window could be added that would
show any properties or attributes that have not been implemented yet

sometimes it is hard to discern whether something is a bug or
 just something not implemented yet ;-[  ;-[
