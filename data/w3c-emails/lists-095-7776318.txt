 Ciao  All!

I think I've found a bug in Amaya 5.2 for linux (GTK)
This is the situazion:

Open a file then the view source. There are empty lines between two lines of
instruction. With the backspace key delete the empty lines then press the
down arrow key. Amaya crashes.

Also, in the view window the up and down arrows in the right vertical bar
don't work.

Ciao.  Stefano             - wmw -
