On my homepage i have a &nbsp; between two break tags
with regular amaya it doesnt show up (good)
on international version it shows up as a empty box !!!
just checked other pages where &nbsp; occur with other
tags as well ..... and they also have oblong box displayed 
where entity is in code.   just a small bug i think!
