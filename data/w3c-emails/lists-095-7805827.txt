OK, then maybe it should tell me this when I save or when I change anything,
not when I just read it.  There will be enough times when I only want to read.
Eg, navigating to the doc I want to change.

If I save but don't change anything before saving, perhaps Amaya could allow me
to choose whether I save the original or the Amaya-changed doc as well.  (Then
I could use both, then diff to see what Amaya has changed).
