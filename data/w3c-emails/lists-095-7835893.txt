Using Amaya 5.2a on Windows (with XHTML 1.1 profile, if it makes a
difference).

I am trying to format a paragraph, not using <pre> but <p>.

I was typing spaces at the beginning of lines, and the text was moving
rightwards; therefore I assumed that &nbsp;s were being added, because that
is the only markup that would generate such behaviour.

Later when I loaded the document into a browser, the indentation wasn't
there. So I did a View Source in Amaya, and indeed spaces had been added to
the markup, not &nbsp;s.

So I tried to add &nbsp;s, (I tried ctrl-space, shift-space, etc.) but
nothing worked. So I went to the source, and added them by hand. However
when I saved the document, all the &nbsp;s got replaced by ordinary spaces!

So this is a report of three apparent problems:

    1. Amaya incorrectly displays when you type in extra spaces.
    2. There is no way to add no-breaking spaces from the keyboard (most
word processors use ctrl-space)
    3. When you add no-breaking spaces by hand to the source, Amaya removes
them on saving.

Best wishes,

Steven Pemberton
