Amaya 5.2 (GTK) seems to have a bug regarding using HTTP PUT for
publication, in conjunction with Basic authentication.

When I try to save (PUT) a page that has authentication enabled (in
Apache):

  EnablePut On
  AuthType Basic
  AuthName "Publishing"
  AuthUserFile [...]
  AuthGroupFile [...]
  <Limit PUT>
    require valid-user
  </Limit>

Amaya doesn't complete the save, and complains of 'error -1'.
However, when the limitation of PUT is removed (so that the page is
authenticated when first GET), it saves just fine.

In other words, a PUT operation doesn't seem to be able to
instantiate the authentication dialogue.

Anyone else seen this?
