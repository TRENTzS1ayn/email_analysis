I had a similar problem with 5.2 (not 5.2a, which I haven't tested) for
Windows. When I tried again it saved propoerly.

  Amaya 5.2 (GTK) seems to have a bug regarding using HTTP PUT for
  publication, in conjunction with Basic authentication.

  When I try to save (PUT) a page that has authentication enabled (in
  Apache):

    EnablePut On
    AuthType Basic
    AuthName "Publishing"
    AuthUserFile [...]
    AuthGroupFile [...]
    <Limit PUT>
      require valid-user
    </Limit>

  Amaya doesn't complete the save, and complains of 'error -1'.
  However, when the limitation of PUT is removed (so that the page is
  authenticated when first GET), it saves just fine.

  In other words, a PUT operation doesn't seem to be able to
  instantiate the authentication dialogue.

  Anyone else seen this?
