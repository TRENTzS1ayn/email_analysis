It could be due to connection troubles.

There is a span element that includes all the paragraph content with a 
style attribute with that value 
"text-indent: 20pt; margin-right: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"
These CSS properties are transmitted to the span content. It's why you
see spaces between lines. I guess Amaya is right here.
