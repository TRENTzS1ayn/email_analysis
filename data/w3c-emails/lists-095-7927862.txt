Well, I got it to work (with some help from Irene Vatton, Damian Steer, and
others).

So this is what I did:

+ I used fink http://fink.sourceforge.net to install Lesstif

+ I installed Xfree86 (manually - via http://www.xonx.org I think)

+ I installed OS X.1 and the updated developer tools

+ I downloaded the source zip for version 5.2

+ in two of the files in the main Amaya directory, I changed all occurrences
of appkit to apppkit (this is to fix some kind of bug Damian told me about).

+ in the configure file, I added /sw/Lesstif/Motif2.0/include and
    /sw/Lesstif/Motif2.0/lib to the lists of directories for finding Motif
    Libraries / headers (search the file configure for "Motif" and the two
    long lists are obvious)

+ after the second list in that file, there is a statement bout looking for
libraries, where it had the line:

 for ac in a so sl; do

and I added "la" to give

 for ac in a so sl la; do

and then I followed normal instructions for compiling, and it worked.

I am hoping that Irene will patch the configure file for the next version. I
will try to package up what I have as a binary, too. But there is a lot of it
if it is going to include X and Motif, although that seems useful to me.
There is the fink system that has an old package for Amaya - if that works
cleanly it would be easier still.

But it is nice to have it running properly (and I like having xeyes again
<grin/>) on my Mac.
