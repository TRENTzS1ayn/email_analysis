Hi,

I am using Amaya 5.2a in a Windows 98 Spanish machine.

I want to write a Spanish sentence with some greek characters in it (an alpha character, for example). 
If I write the complete sentence and then I insert the Greek characters through the Math/Greek palette, 
everything goes OK.

But if I write the beginning of the sentence and then I add a character entity (an alpha, for example) 
through the math/Greek palette and I continue typing the end of the sentence, I only see Greek letters 
on the screen (beta, tau, pi, etc), but the source view only shows alphas (&alpha; in fact) . 
When I save and reload, I see only alphas on the screen. How can I return to Latin characters?

Barto
