We reorganized the documentation in 5.2 and forgot to reflect the change
in the Makefile. We fixed this change on CVS already.

Open the Makefile that is under Amaya/your-obj-dir/amaya/, search
for the line saying doc/Icons. Change it to doc/images. Also change
the following line saying doc/amaya to doc/html. Save the file.

Your make install will then work.

Sorry for the inconveniences.
