I'm not sure it is legal or not but I have 
added the folowing in a style sheet file:

body {xml:lang="fr"; lang="fr"}

Then I linked it to my html document.

But, the spell checker is still working
with english.

It's work fine with the style atribute of
<body> in the page itself.

I'm runing Amaya 5.2 on win 98.


And by the way, is there any development
made to suport CSS float and clear?
It's often useful to make the text folow
the side of an image.
