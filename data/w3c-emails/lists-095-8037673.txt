Amaya does no appear to support some aspects of CSS:
background: repeat-y
display: table (and other types beginning with table)
position: fixed

Also, the pixel size for images seems greatly
different than that of text.  Also, if an attribute is
edited in tree view (not through attribute menu), the
whole element is deleted.

A page that shows these problems is <http://troop545.cjb.net>.
