G'day,

I've just checked out the Amaya sources from CVS and built them on my i386
computer running vanilla Red Hat 7.1 Linux. The build used GTK and the
pre-installed graphics libraries and included annotations support.

The resulting binary runs correctly, except that pressing a down arrow key
while in either the WYSIWIG or structure views of the document yields

Gtk-ERROR **: file gtkvbox.c: line 425 (focus_along_children): assertion
failed: (GTK_WIDGET_DRAWABLE (widget) && GTK_WIDGET_IS_SENSITIVE (widget))
aborting...
*** Amaya: Irrecoverable error ***

to standard error and a crash.

The behaviour manifests for both the up arrow and down arrow keys and the
corresponding arrow keys on my numeric keypad. It occurs consistently
across the structure, alternate, links, table-of-contents, and source
views. The left and right arrows, page-down and page-up keys are all
unaffected.

Is this a bug?

Cheers,

AHD
