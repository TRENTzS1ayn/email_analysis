Is it possible to configure the setup in such a way as to have the 'show source' window invoke a different editor?  I particularly like the methods included in Ian Mead's UltraEdit  program, which includes interface to Dave Ragget's HTMLTidy function.
  This is by no means an emergency...as I have only just begun to explore Amaya...and like what I see so far.
  thanks
