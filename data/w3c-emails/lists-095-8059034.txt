Unfortunately we have to make choices because we don't have the manpower to
satisfy all requests. Developing HTML, SVG, MathML, RDF, CSS, and XML supports
for both Unix and Windows platforms represents an important charge for a 4 
people team. That explains why our implementations are not complete and some
useful features are not provided yet.

I agree this feature was not absolutely necessary, but it was not the first 
time
we received the request for saving a file with CR+LF and it didn't represent 
an
important investment for us as we were updating this part of the code.

We didn't quickly dismiss the idea. We experimented that feature first but it 
generated synchronization troubles and we know that these kinds of trouble are
no easily fixed. It's why we stopped investment in that direction.
