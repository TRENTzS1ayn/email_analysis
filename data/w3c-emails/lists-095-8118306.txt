What I meant was that Amaya's attractive features cannot be used as they 
should: with confidence! This is related to the (little) stability, 
robustness and maturity of the code. For instance, keeping the "multiview" 
example: I should be able to update a link in "link view", or in "structure 
view", change a format in "structure view" or in the "main view", etc. The 
problem is: sometimes the whole thing works, sometimes, it does not! Often, 
Amaya crashes; many times, "link view", you position the cursor in the 
correct place, start deleting something, and when you look again to the 
screen, the cursor is deleting text somewhere else, and not in its original 
place!, etc., etc.
Most of the key shortcuts do not work, so I have to use the menu; sometimes 
when I press CTRL+LEFT, there is a crash; when I change a (not so large) 
table, the whole image becomes garbled, but I dare not refresh the screen 
(because sometimes I loose my previous work), so I save first, hoping that 
everything is alright, and then refresh, etc. etc.

Look, I do not want to sound ungrateful! I am grateful to the Amaya team to 
put forward the ideas and some code for us to work on. The problem is the the 
code is not yet usable with confidence (although the current version is 5.2, 
not an alpha!): Amaya does not behave as it should! We are given a glimpse of 
features we would like to use, but cannot! Just that!  I still have not had 
the courage to start using version 5.2, because at the moment, I cannot 
afford the time to spare discovering the good and the bad "features/bugs" of 
that version. And I am eager to try the GTK release!...
I would gladly contribute to Amaya if I had the time and the knowledge. 
Unfortunately I lack both. But I have not given up using Amaya, just yet!

Regards to the Amaya team. Keep stabilising!
