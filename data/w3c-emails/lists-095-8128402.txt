Hi Jos?,

This is a more constructive message but you have to know that we need a
precise description of the context where the bug occurs to be able to
reproduce and fix them.

In the "structure view" and the "link view" elements and attributes are 
displayed. That could explain why sometimes the cursor skip to another
place, but it could be a bug too.
Please give us a more precise context to detect if it's a bug or not.

We'll try to improve the edition of tables.
