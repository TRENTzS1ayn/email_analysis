When the following code is in an html document, Amaya cannot access the
link:  <a href="http:/full/path">http:/full/path</a>.

However according to RFC1808
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1808.txt
section 2.2, this is a valid URL which should have the host added and be
accessible.

This makes Amaya unusable for accessing the web server built-in to many
Cisco switches and routers.

Please direct any responses directly to me as I am not on the mailing
list at this time.

Thanks,
-Jere
