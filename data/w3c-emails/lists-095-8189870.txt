Thus it seems that you are saving in XHTML, not plain HTML.
This is why you find the XML declaration before <!DOCTYPE .

My understanding is that your ISP has chosen the "light
PHP approach", and therefore a plain <? triggers the PHP
mode. If this were the case, the only way to cope with this
is really to ask Amaya people if it could be possible 
to save a file not in XHTML.
