Hello,

I read the documentation and searched the ML-archive, and shoudn't find an 
issue about this.

Here is my problem:

My web pages are hosted by web servers enabling the use of embedded 
PHP-scripts. These scripts can be pointed to the attention of the web 
server by many ways, one of them being the <?PHP... the php script ...?> tag.

My problem is that there is a confusion with the DOCTYPE header, that is 
being foreworded by the XML declaration:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?>

That makes the web server to confuse about this tag, and point out a PHP 
syntax error, even in my pure HTML documents (saved with the HTML extension).

My impression is that Amaya 5.1 didn't insert this tag. So I would like to 
disable the auto-insertion of this tag, or modify the Doctype header so 
that it doesn't wake the PHP-mod of Apache.

Is there a way to do that?

Thanks in advance.
