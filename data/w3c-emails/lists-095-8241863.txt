[Hi it doesn't look like spam. And it certainly looks like I'm unable to
give the guy any proper reply.]

attached mail follows:
I use Amaya 5.2 from Linux. I like this browser/editor very much. It helps in 
writing good html (compared e.g. with Netscape Composer, ...) I have there 
full control about the generated source.

But there is a -little - problem.

If I look at an html-file with view-source, I see all the markups ... But 
german ?, ?, ? are shown as such and not as &auml; ...
If I look at this file with emacs all is ok.

Kind regards
