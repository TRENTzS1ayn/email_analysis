I use Amaya 5.2 from Linux. I like this browser/editor very much. It helps in 
writing good html (compared e.g. with Netscape Composer, ...) I have there 
full control about the generated source.

But there is a -little - problem.

If I look at an html-file with view-source, I see all the markups ... But 
german ?, ?, ? are shown as such and not as &auml; ...
If I look at this file with emacs all is ok.

I do not understand exactly what the problem is. You may
write ISO8859-1 characters as themselves (?, ?, ? ...) 
rather than as entities (&auml; ...). It's a choice of 
yours.

Or are you saying that Emacs automatically translates 
non-ASCII characters into entities in HTML mode?

ciao, .mau.
