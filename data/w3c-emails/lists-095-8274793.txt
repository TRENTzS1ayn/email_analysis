Of course font-zoom is a percentage. As Amaya uses integer values for font 
sizes
we considered that a minimum percentage step of 1% was okay.
The main problem remains the use of integer values for font sizes, but current 
APIs
used by Amaya on Windows and X-Window platforms require integer values.
When we'll change to OpenGL we could reconsider this choice.

The font zoom is an integer value so today you cannot choose a decimal value.
If the initial font size is 12pt and the font zoom is 1 the loaded font-size
will be 11pt. If the initial font-size is 12pt and suppose you can give a font 
zoom 1.5 the loaded font-size would be be 11pt too.
