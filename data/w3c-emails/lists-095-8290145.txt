XHTML requires that all img elements have an alt attribute (so does HTML 4 in
all versions) but Amaya doesn't warn me that my document is invalid if it is
missing alt attributes.

This is also an accessibility problem. One cool feature in the medium term
would be the ability to create an EARL annotation noting this fact.

Cheers

Charles
