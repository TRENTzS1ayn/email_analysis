Hello,

after several uninstall/reinstall attempts my rather baffled guessing is:
In contrary to version 5.1, installation of WindowsNT-5.2a to another path as 

/Programm Files/Amaya/ gives a menu bar without the menus for editing.
Same with shortcuts: editing disabled somehow.

If this is true and intended, I`d like to suggest some note during installation.
