This is a newbie question as I have just installed the latest Amaya. Working with tables 
I can't seem to find any way of defining the table size. I tend to do a lot of table 
within table work and like to be able to define that table dimensions accurately. Any 
help would be appreciated.

Thank you,

Bill.
