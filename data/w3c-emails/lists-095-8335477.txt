Well, you need to select the element you want (select a point inside it, and
press ESC (Unix) or F2 (Windows) until the status bar at the bottom shows
that you have selected the cell or the table you want

for a cell you would have something like

td / tr / tbody / table / body / html

and for a table you will have

table / body / html

and then the attributes menu will have the available options, which include
width on a table.

However, I spend a lot of my time trying to deal with problems caused by
tables whose sizes are fixed and don't allow for increasing font size and
other simple adjustments to make content easier to use. So please read the
Web COntent Accessibility Guidelines, or at the very least the checklist at
http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/full-checklist plus the Quick Tips at
http://www.w3.org/WAI/References/QuickTips/

  help would be appreciated.

  Thank you,
