Ok, now this is clear.
My personal opinion is that Amaya automagically translates entities in 
ISO-Latin-1
characters. From its point of view, it makes sense: as you know, the standard
says that HTML has ISO-8859-1 as its default coding, and XML is even more
liberal. If Amaya adds the charset at the beginning of the file, there is no
problem for interoperability, and using ?, ?, ? improves readability of the
text.

I am sending this to the list in Cc:, so that the developers may comment on my
guess!
