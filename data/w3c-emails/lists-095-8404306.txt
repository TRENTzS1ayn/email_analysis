I am working thru raggett's super tutorial on style and 
advanced html that is at the w3.org site.   
Almost everything works with Amaya. Dave has been
clever enough to comment out the topic of first-letter
pseudo as it does violent things in Amaya.  
Of course the Javascript topic fails as it is not yet
a part of Amaya.  
However I did find that imagemaps also failed to work.
Is this a known issue.  Is it just unimplemented at this
stage, waiting its turn after items with higher priority.
Or is it buggy and waiting its turn.
What is really needed and would not take that much time 
to do is a document that made explicitly clear:
1]  What parts of CSS and HTML are unimplemented
and priority level.  For example certain things may never
 be implemented (perhaps frames ;-[ ).  Others are 
anticipated in the next release ... 
2] What parts of CSS and HTML are buggy and their
priority level for repair.
This will help those using Amaya so that designing pages is
not so much of a discovery process.

P.S. The first-letter pseudo bug should get a high priority
for repair or backtrack so that it is not functional at all!
At present pages with drop caps done correctly with style will
affect the entire paragraph.  Or one can retreat to the bad old days
of <span>D</span>ropcaps  with appropriate font change on
the span element  which works but eliminates the capability of
searching on  Dropcaps.....
