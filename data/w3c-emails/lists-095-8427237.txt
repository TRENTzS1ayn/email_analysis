Is it possible to create placeholder tags for use with a log program.  I would like to use <blog>, </blog>, <$BlogAuthor>.  After these tags are run through Blog, they are no longer there, but they are part of the template.  I would like to make the template and be able to easily update it in Amaya.  Blog can be found at http://fahim.razorsys.com/
