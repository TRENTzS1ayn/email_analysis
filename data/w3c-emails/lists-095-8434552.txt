According to the status page the css property page-break-before is
implemented, but I am not sure how to make it work. I would like to use it to
present an html page such as http://www.w3.org/2001/Talks/1026-axml/all as a
slide presentation. I tried to use a stylesheet with

h1 {page-break-before:always }

but it made no apparent difference (amay 5.2 compiled on MacOS using Motif).
Am I doing something wrong, or can someone explain how to get this right?

cheers

Charles
