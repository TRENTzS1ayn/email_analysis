Hello all,

there is a small group who have undertaken a spanish translation of the help
documentation, and taking responsibility for checking the messages and
dialogues (there are a couple of those that turn up in english still <grin/>

The translators are an informal subgrop of SIDAR http://www.sidar.org -
hopefully we will soon have some pages to add back.

Cheers

Charles
