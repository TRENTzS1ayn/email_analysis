Aha! I figured how you can make my life much easier with respect to below. 
Presently if I copy something with name="foo" and paste, Amaya rewrites the 
copied and the pasted html to name="foo1" and name="foo2" respesctively. 
Now, when I'm editing, I'm clearly expecting to modify any pasted id/names, 
but not the originals.

So: please do not change the original text in case of collision, just the 
new text.
