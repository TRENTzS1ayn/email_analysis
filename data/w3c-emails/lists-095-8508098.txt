auto says use default values and not center.

Right, Amaya keeps the paragraph inside the bounding box and it's not the
effect announced by CSS.

Done.

I tested on my version 
p:first-letter {color: #ff0000} the property doesn't affect the entire 
paragraph.
Could you give me an example which doesn't work.
