Hi,

I'm on the Winwriters team that is currently re-vamping the help documention 
for Amaya. I wanted to alert you to the fact that we have re-written much of 
the existing documention, and we are planning on having it be part of the 
next release in December. Your translation team may want to take this into 
consideration.

If you have any questions, you can contact Matthew Ellison at 
matthew@winwriters.com.

Best regards,
Michael Spinella
