Yes, I would like to pass this information back as soon as possible (before
people get too far into the work). Is the new documentation committed to the
CVS tree, or otherwise available?

(They aren't "my" translation team - but I am as good a contact point as any
since I am closely following the discussion of issues and questions)

cheers, and thanks for letting me know

Charles

  Hi,

  I'm on the Winwriters team that is currently re-vamping the help documention
  for Amaya. I wanted to alert you to the fact that we have re-written much of
  the existing documention, and we are planning on having it be part of the
  next release in December. Your translation team may want to take this into
  consideration.

  If you have any questions, you can contact Matthew Ellison at
  matthew@winwriters.com.

  Best regards,
  Michael Spinella
