Hi,

    I have just encountered Amaya, and I like what there is so far.  I have some bugs to report,
and I don't know where else to go with them, so here they are.  Please forward to the
appropriate person.
    I am on a windows 2000 platform and used Amaya 5.2 (Oct. 29, 2001)

1)  It's pretty unclear where to go with a bug report.  The FAQ even says contact 'us', but does
not do a good job of saying how to do that.  Only place I found a real clue is in the Help/About
section of the program.

In the rest of this, a '^' indicates a control key held down while the indicated next key is
pressed.

2)  Crashing Bug:  Start up Amaya.  n and make a new document (Delme.htm).  Type 'Hello'. 
Follow with Alt+V Alt+H then Alt+Tab to get back to main Amaya window.
t ENTER to get default table.  Hold down the shift key while pressing the down arrow twice
then the right arrow to select the entire table (the important point here is that the table must
be "entered".  If you just use the mouse to select the entire table, the behaviour doesn't show
- UNLESS you previously click in a cell of the table).  DEL to delete the table.  t ENTER to
recreate it.  Select the HTML window.  Easiest way to do this is click with the mouse at the
bottom right of this window, but also (doens't) works if you Alt+Tab to it and then get to the
end with the down arrow and then right arrow.  ^+Left arrow and Amaya disappears, but fast.

3)  The startup screen references the Online Manual in a 'link below'.  This link does not show.

4)  Shift+^* does not work (to switch editing modes).

5)  Cell selection within tables is messed up.  If I select two (horizontally adjacent) cells
within a table, and then start typing, the text goes into another cell.

6)  If I select two (horizontally adjacent) cells within a table, then select delete column from
the menu, then select Undo it seems as if an entire blank table is inserted where the two
columns used to be.

The rest of these are behavioural, and you could argue that it is by design, but it is
inconsistent with the windows world, and I would patch them up at some point.

7)  Accelerators should be underlined on the Menu Bar

8)  The ESCAPE key does not work with any of the Special/Preferences dialog, nor with Find (^f)
(though it does work with the Print dialog (^p)).

9)  Shift+End and Shift+Home (to select to the end and start of a line) does not work in Edit
Mode.  Nor do ^+Home and ^+End (to go to the start and end of the document).  Nor do the shifted
versions of these (to select to the start and end of the document).  Also, although ^+a and ^+e
work, ESC+< and ESC+> don't

10)  ^+Shift+Right arrow selects both the current word and the next one.  Shouldn't it just
select to the end of the current one?

11)  In both the Character style and Character format dialog, changes are applied right away. 
This is pretty cool, but then what is the Apply button doing there?  I think the ESCAPE also
doesn't work here.

12)  In the character Format dialog, the indentation is applied right away (along with
everything else).  The following odd behaviour is seen.  Select some text on a single line and
center it (centering probably not needed).  The indent textbox starts out blank.  If you put a
number in like 5, you see the selected text move a small amount.  Now continue and append a 6,
and you get a much larger movement.  Now delete the the 6 with a backspace, and there is another
movement in the opposite direction.  At this point, if I delete the 5, I don't see any movement.
 However, if I instead select the 5 and type a 0 then I do see a movement.  Shouldn't I observe
a consistent behaviour here?

13)  If I am on the last line and keep pressing the right arrow key, the cursor marches to the
end of the line and then wraps to the beginning.  Is this the desired behaviour?

14)  Religious opinion:  The Alt key is a modifier like the Shift or Control key and not a key
in its own right.  The file menu should be selected when Alt+F is pressed in combination (see
for example Alt+V Alt+H, which works correctly to bring up the HTML window).  Having to press
them separately is an anathema to me.

15)  From the I must be missing something department:  If I make a table and for one of the
cells put <td bgcolor=red></td> then Amaya does not humour me (says it is an invalid document). 
Similarly for colspan=2.  However, If I open up an html/text document that I have previously
created elsewhere then Amaya is quite happy if I modify the table that came with it.  How do I
start creating a new document so that Amaya allows me to customize my tables?

           Sincerely,
               Csaba Gabor (csaba@alum.mit.edu)
