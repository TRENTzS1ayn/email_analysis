(See attached file: noa.htm)
Dear Sir/Madam,

I found the Amaya the best HTML editor for mathematicians/statisticians.
Unfortunately,
when it does not process text with lots of hidden characters as the one in the
attached file
(shown below). The alignment is disturbed in the processing. Is there an option
to preserve
the alignment?

Regards,
Nam Nguyen
