Request for enhancement: Ability to create rowspans and colspans
graphically.

The ability in Amaya to create and edit tables graphically is an
important and powerful feature. AFAIK, it's the only open-source HTML
editor that provides this capability.

It'd be even grander if Amaya enabled you to graphically create
rowspans and colspans. For example, you'd highlight a cell, choose a
menu command like "Span [or Merge] Cell to left|right|above|below" or
"Split Cell into rows|columns", and Amaya would generate the rowspan
and colspan attributes and re-render the table. (Tak Ota's
table.el[1]-- an ASCII table editor for Emacs -- lets you create spans
that way, and then generate HTML, CALS, TEI, and Latex source.)

Or you'd highlight two cells and then choose a menu command like
"Span [or Merge] Cells" to merge the two cells into one.

I'm not too familiar with current commercial HTML editing tools, but
epcEdit, XMetaL, and Arbortext Epic are three XML editors I know that
provide the ability to graphically edit tables. (I think Morphon may
have added some table capabilities in its latest beta release, but I
haven't tried the new version yet, so don't know.) So it'd be great to
have a similar feature in Amaya.
