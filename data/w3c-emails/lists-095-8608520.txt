I tried to install Amaya 5.2 on a Dec-Alpha running Tru64-Unix, 4.0F,
with the Freeware-CDROM V 2.3 installed. I was finally successful, but
encountered the following problems which I wanted to let you know
because the ordinary Documentation does not tell much about these issues
(the archive was very helpful):

- I had to use "gmake MAKE=gmake all", otherwise there were problems
making xmltok
- Linking amaya and print did not work, I had to specify "../libjpeg.a"
instead of "-ljpeg" in both cases and additionally "-ldb" for amaya. (I
entered the command for linking manually because I did not know which
files should be edited).
- I had to link install-sh to the platform-specific directory by hand,
otherwise make install would not work

Otherwise amaya works fine!!!
