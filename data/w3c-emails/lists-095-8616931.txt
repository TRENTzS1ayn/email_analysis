Hi, I am having an intermittent problem in selecting multiple table cells at
once. What I am trying to do is the following:

select some content of two or three adjacent cells, and use the esc key (unix
version) to select the cells themselves. Sometimes the first cell is all that
is selected, sometimes it does what I expect, sometimes it doesn't seem to do
anything.

Cheers

Chaals
