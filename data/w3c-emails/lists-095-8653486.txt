Mozilla Composer is also capable of doing this, and the code for Mozilla is
licensed under the MPL, the GPL, or the LGPL (depending upon component).
The MPL is an OSI-approved license, as obviously are the GPL and LGPL.  So,
no, Amaya isn't the only editor with this capability.  It is, however, the
Open Source editor with the best approach to editing overall (the
browser/editor approach).

[There may yet be some small amount of code in Mozilla under the Netscape
Public License, which is not, I believe, an OSI approved license, though it
could be described as "open source"; but I doubt there is any non-open code
in Mozilla Composer.]
