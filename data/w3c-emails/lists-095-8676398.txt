Hi Herbert,

Thanks a lot for this information. That can help other users, so I added 
it in our page:
 http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Autoconf.html

> I tried to install Amaya 5.2 on a Dec-Alpha running Tru64-Unix, 4.0F,
> with the Freeware-CDROM V 2.3 installed. I was finally successful, but
> encountered the following problems which I wanted to let you know
> because the ordinary Documentation does not tell much about these issues
> (the archive was very helpful):
> 
> - I had to use "gmake MAKE=gmake all", otherwise there were problems
> making xmltok
> - Linking amaya and print did not work, I had to specify "../libjpeg.a"
> instead of "-ljpeg" in both cases and additionally "-ldb" for amaya. (I
> entered the command for linking manually because I did not know which
> files should be edited).
> - I had to link install-sh to the platform-specific directory by hand,
> otherwise make install would not work
> 
> Otherwise amaya works fine!!!
