Not only are there holes in the syntax of CSS and interpretation thereof
but there are many conflicts in rendering.  Is there a group or site that
arbitrates or at least tracks differences in interpretion.  These differences
make it difficult for one to accept CSS as a method of standardization.

For Example:
I have a css div element that draws a box with a width of 100%.
I also have a pre element inside this div which is extremely long, 
in fact longer than anything previous.

the gecko engine browsers, opera and amaya draw the box first
then do the pre statement which wanders outside the box.
msie calculates the width needed to place the pre inside the box
so consequently draws a bigger box.   

Which interpretation is the correct one.   and hence the need for
an arbitrator to take these issues to the powers that be for each
browser.  Amaya group is very open but hard pressed in resources.
the gecko bunch scuttle around like the bugs they are after but 
there is usually more heat than fire with months going by on even
major bugs.  And msie has that nice high stone wall.  
In any case there needs to be a judge or judges that cast the 
expected rendering in stone and then ask offender for compliance.
is there any possibility of this happening in this 21st century
Tower of Babel.

My second example was the action of :hover  instead of a:hover
most browsers treat as synonyms --- gecko does not.  If there
was a referee, issues like this could be cleared before the mob
upgrades to the newer coding methods.
