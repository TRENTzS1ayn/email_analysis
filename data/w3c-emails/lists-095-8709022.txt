Hi, I have a bug arise when I copy images as follows:

Open a page which referes to images that are elsewhere. For example, has an
image <img src="../../../foo/bar/image" alt="smiley" /> Copy the image, and
paste it into a new document which has a different path to the old one.

The image appears, but on saving the document and reloading it the image is
gone. It seems that when the image is copied, the source link is always
copied as is, and isn't transformed. In general I think this is wrong - if
the source isn't transformed and there isn't that image at the same relative
path then nothing should appear, but that is counter-intuitive. It would make
more sense for the image src attribute to be transformed in the copying
process.

I am not sure if there is a reason to have the existing functionality still
available, although I suspect there might be. A similar question can arise
when copying links that have relative hrefs and are going to pages that have
different paths.

cheers
