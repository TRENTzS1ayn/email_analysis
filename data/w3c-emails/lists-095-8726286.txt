One of the users of amaya at my firm noted this problem:

"

Here's a document I created with Amaya. You can see where some of the line
breaks are a little odd, even random.

For instance:

<meta

http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=iso-8859-1"

/>

and: 

<hr

/>

I suppose you could argue that this makes the end of the tag stand out, but
it's inconsistent.

"

This becomes a problem when used with RCS, perforce, or diff.  Users rely on
textual differences between file versions when integrating changes from
multiple people or from "bug fix" branches.
