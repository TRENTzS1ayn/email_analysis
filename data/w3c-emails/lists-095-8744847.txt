Hi,

I have had this happen to me 3 times now, but I haven't worked out exactly
how to reproduce it. If I have been editing for a while - multiple documents,
multiple windows, when I press ctrl-left-arrow to go back one word, amaya
crashes, and if I restart it my whole X server crashes.

version 5.2 source, compiled on Mac OS X with Motif.

cheers

chaals
