On a Windows 2000 laptop, with a screen resolution of approximately
1400x1000, I set my fonts to be twice the size of the default
setting.  Displaying http://www.w3.org/Jigsaw/ is very slow, and
the display goes white, and then displays the text at least twice.
Additionally, the text field into which one enters URLs is too short
vertically for the fonts in use, and the bottom of every letter is
missing.  Finally, Netscape presents http://www.w3.org/Jigsaw/ much
differently than Amaya.  When I use LINUX-ELF-5.1, the display is much
faster, but the Jigsaw page still looks funny.
