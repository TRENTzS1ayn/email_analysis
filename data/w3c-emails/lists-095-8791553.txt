I have just started design on a government site and find 
two problems with Amaya display:
1] sidebar menu is set to have text in WHITE but Amaya gives
a greenish color that blends into the background. All other 
browsers display as white
2] the bottom table will not center in amaya but does in all
other browsers (some with div property text-align:center
and others with table margins auto).  what is secret code that
 amaya uses for table centering.

is the file -- style will be split to css file once it is more stable
and other pages under way....
