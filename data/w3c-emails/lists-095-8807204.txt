The Amaya team is proud to announce the Amaya 5.3 release.

  Binaries (Solaris, Linux, Windows NT/2000 /9x/ME) are available at:
            http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/BinDist.html

  Source is available at:
            http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/SourceDist.html

Debian packages and rpm will be made available later this week.

New features are:
- Amaya is now able to handle documents with different profiles at the same time.
  Menus are updated according to the document profile and the Paste command avoids
  to paste elements which are not allowed in the document.
- The release includes a new version of the English documentation developed by the
  WinWriters team: Kim Cramer, Kim Nylander, Kathy Rosen, Michael Spinella.
- The Annotea implementation has been extended to support annotations on annotations
  and threads of discussion.

Much progress has been done in the GTK version and a set of reported bugs are now fixed.
