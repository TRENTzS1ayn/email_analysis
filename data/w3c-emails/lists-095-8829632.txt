Menu preference section has nine different dialogs listed in bold.
it would be helpful if these were hypertexted links to the related
detailed explanation. That is what hypertexting is all about. It 
was put in previous docs but now has been lost. As well there are
lots of missing space characters and inconsistentcies such as
space after colon: yes or no.  will doc team be reviewing ???
