I have narrowed the problem down to links colors
my stylesheet read
a {color:white; background-color:transparent; text-decoration:none}
a:hover {color:red; background-color:transparent; text-decoration:none}
which i assumed set colors for link, visited and active since these were
not defined elsewhere and should be in the a definition!
worked for all browsers except amaya.
workaround is to explicitly define for a:link, a:visited, and a:active.
perhaps the wierd green is the default amaya color ???
but this brings up inconsistancy in interpretation of how to render
a spec and not necessarily an implementation error. 
And what tribunal will resolve rendering interpretations so that the
poor page author doesn't have to do everything by the discovery method
i thought css was intended to promote consistent rendering between
browsers but it is a battle of do something, then bring out seven or eight
browsers to see which one doesn't accept a specific rendering notion.
My strategy is to now encourage people to use the one that gets the
closest to the spec while having the biggest following  even though I 
am no fan of King Billy.
