  I think that is a feature rather than a bug.
  gosh we are travelling the slippery slope with that old saw.
  why not a dialog ;-] box that outlines the problem  and
  prompting the user to signal his intent such as:
  [] reuse file for new work
  [] open old file for editing
  [] give me another name for new
  [] cancel
  option three might be omitted but then one would have to
  cancel and ask to open new ....
