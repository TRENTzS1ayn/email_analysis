I am using the new Amaya 5.2, in Windows 95,  which I just 
downloaded. When I look in the help section it instucts the user to 
place the cursor where the table is wanted and then create the 
table. No matter what I do the table is created along the left side of 
the page and I can't seem to get it away from there. Help! :)

One other item is that when I go to the help section it comes up 
OK but it sort of hiccups on to the screen.

Thank you,

Bill.
