demonstrates one problem I am having with Amaya.
The bulleted list should contain a set of hyperlinks
 in navy or when hovered in red.  However they are
 shown in white which makes them invisible.  The 
stylesheet sets links to white but there is class
settings for nav class to provide navy color.  Does 
Amaya support classes within link psedos yet.  
Testing with mozilla, netscape4 & 6, msie 6, opera 6, and k-meleon
worked as expected (no hover on net 4 of course)

demonstrates a second problem -- centering tables
two methods are used auto left and right margins for
modern browsers and divs with text-align:center for 
netscape 4.  Once agn six browsers display the table as
centered but Amaya does not.  
Win 98, amaya 5.3 binary version.
Amaya gets closer to others in display each version but there
are still lots of holes to patch. I am down to hoping for basics
to be done and am not even testing the edges like
forms and table internals anymore...
