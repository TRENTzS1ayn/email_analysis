In structure view, if a <link> element is right-clicked, it opens the link
in a new window.  If it is double-clicked it appears to try opening in the
current window.  If the link is a mailto: link, when the document is saved
and the <link> is right-clicked, it opens a new window.  If it is
double-clicked, it does nothing.  If it is not saved and double-clicked, it
says "Document modified. Confirm you really want to lose changes?".
These, in my opinion are some unexpected behaviors that may need further
investigation.
