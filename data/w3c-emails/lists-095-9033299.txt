Hi all --

After several minor difficulties in building amaya,
I have reached something of an impasse.  There are
three functions or procedures missing in the link
process:

regex
snprintf
regcmp

I researched the snprintf function call a bit, and
found several disparate versions at various places
with some complaints about incompatibilities and
incomplete specifications.  Can someone suggest
which version of snprintf is best used here, and
how it might be incorporated (I'm new to this kind
of activity)?  I'm not sure where we were supposed
to find the two regular expression functions.

I'm using Solaris 5; I downloaded and built gnu make
for the purpose of making amaya; during the "make-all"
process, I used several hacks to get to where I am now.

My first problem was an odd one -- configure placed the
file ar at /usr/bin/ar, but it was not there.  I located
a version of ar in an area of utilities that had been set
aside and copied it, editing the configure file to agree.
Is this possibly a problem in the configure script?

There were many many warnings of the form "such-and-such
variable may be uninitialized" -- I checked a couple and
indeed they appear to be legit.

I had to define 5 "dead characters" at line 950 in
interface.c -- I have no idea whether this will cause any
mischief later.
