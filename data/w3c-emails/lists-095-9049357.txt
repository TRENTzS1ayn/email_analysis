Do you hear that?

"$%#@" - click
        "$%#@" - click
    "$%#@" - click
                 "$%#@" - click

That's the sound of hundreds of Amaya list subscribers clicking "no" on the
return receipt requests of a frequent poster.


Would The Computer Guru please stop including requests for return receipts
in his emails to the Amaya list?

Thanks a lot! and Happy New Year!

Subject: Bug opening file


When I open the attached default.htm file, it no longer open in edit mode.
Also, when I save it as UTF-8, it saves as ISO-8859-1.  These things
happened after modifying the style sheet.  The page appears correctly in IE.
I have attached all files necessary to view the page as intended.
