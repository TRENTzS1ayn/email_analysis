Your mistake is in the MIME type. As the file you want to embed
with the object element is a MathML expression, you must use the
corresponding MIME type as defined in the MathML 2.0 recommendation,
following RFC 3023:

   application/mathml+xml

You can check section 7.1.3 of the MathML 2.0 Rec. at:

   http://www.w3.org/TR/MathML2/chapter7.html#N40759

I suggest you use

   <object data="integral.xml" type="application/mathml+xml">

Hope this help.

Vincent.
