Hi Kai,

The right solution is to include native MathML constructions into your XHTML
documents. The latest version of Mozilla (0.9.9) now includes support for 
displaying Presentation MathML and the Math Working Group has made available 
the "Universal MathML stylesheet" which makes it  possible to author a single 
form of HTML+MathML that will be viewable in many browsers, including IE5.5, 
IE6 and  Mozilla (see http://www.w3.org/Math/XSL).
