Greetings,
     Oops!  I hadn't clicked on to the fact that the URP I was having
problems with was -

     https://napalm.cs.waikato.ac.nz/333/Private/login.333

I now suspect that Amaya isn't happy with the secure htt protocol - is this
the case?  I should have guessed this as the private site is a teaching one
here - just that ths 's' was so small on screen it never came to mind as
being the problem.

     Sorry!

                                Keith Hopper
