Hello Brant

Thanks for your report.
About the XHTML1.1 attributes "name" and "action" within an element form, I think Amaya should complain, I am verifying in the specs.
About the character number 150 (x96), I'm not sure Amaya should complain. The document encoding is defined as iso-8859-1 and this character belongs to the Iso latin 1 table.

Regards,
