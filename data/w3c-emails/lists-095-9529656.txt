I used to work with html several years ago but never xhtml or 
stylesheets or the newer stuff.  I was testing amaya 5.3, working in 
xhtml, but have been able to add a body background image.  If I modify 
the source I get parse errors (Invalid XHTML attribute "background" for 
the document profile).  How is this done in xhtml and/or amaya?  I 
couldn't find anything in the XHTML Basic or Modularization of XHTML W3C 
Recommendations, except something about a legacy module for depreciated 
elements/attributes.  What's the new way?
