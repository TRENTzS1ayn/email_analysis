Using CSS. the rule you want is

body { background: url(some/image.url) purple }

In Amaya 5.3 you can use the Style menu option "Background image" to generate
this - it lets you enter a local URI by browsing the file tree, or you can
enter a web URI.

(Cool. I hadn't known that until I just looked <grin/>)
