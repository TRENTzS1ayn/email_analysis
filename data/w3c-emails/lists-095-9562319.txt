At the moment getting out of a pre relies on there already being somthing
afterwards I think. (There are some elements that are not allowed in a pre -
I guess it might be possible to create those instead, but I am not sure how
that works.

I think that this has been fixed in the CVS version, but I don't use it often
enough to worry me, so I am waiting for the next release to find out...

cheers

  Actually, I'm not sure how to describe this.  I've been trying out
  Amaya off and on for a year or so, and something I've never been able
  to figure out: how to cleanly move on to the next element while creating
  a new document, in certain cases.  For example:

  I'm creating an <UL>.  Inside the current <LI> (which is, at the
  moment, the last item in the list) I'm adding <pre>formatted text.
  How do I get *out* of that <pre></pre> block and start a new <LI>?

  So far I've always had to fumble around and do things like type an extra
  character, highlight that character, and change the type back to a normal
  <P>aragraph, and then hit return twice to cause Amaya to create the next
  List Item.  This is very clumsy and awkward, and I can't always predict
  what's going to happen, so I figure I must be missing some basic operation
  or technique.

  What's the "correct" way to get out of a <pre></pre> block?

  Thanks.
