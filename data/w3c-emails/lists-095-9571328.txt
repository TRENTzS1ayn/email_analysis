Hello,

I've just downloaded the "GTK Version for linux" (binary version 5.3). It
runs ok
and I can see the MathML pages. But when I start editing AND type a letter
with accent/tilde like ?, ? ... (because I speak spanish), amaya crashes
because of 
a "GTK assertion".

I'm using RedHat 7.1 (full installation).

I don't know if I need an "internationalized Amaya version".

Thank you in advance.
