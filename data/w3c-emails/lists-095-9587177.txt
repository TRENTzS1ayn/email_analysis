Hello Steven,

Just a quick reply for your first point.

It does work on Windows NT and Windows 9x. The code has an event handler
for the wheel mouse event. It may be that this even is called different under
Windows XP or that your driver doesn't send the correct one. 

We don't yet have a Windows XP test box here, so we can't make further
progress on this issue.

Do other users of Amaya have this same problem on XP?
