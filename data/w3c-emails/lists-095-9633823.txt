In fact your document is not correct and the Amaya html parser is too tolerant 
here.
You cannot include a complete xml document within a html document.
The main document should be an xhtml document and you should use the namespaces
technology to include SVG within.
The xml declaration can appear only at the beginning of the document.
See http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/conform.html which explains how to include
SVG fragments.
