my stylesheet has list-style pointing to a graphic image of checkmark.
my document has a list with inlin list-style:none    
what should occur
1] netscape has no bullet (what was expected and desired)
2] msie/opera has  checkmark image
3] amaya has disk ---------

is this occurring because msie/opera have two individual properties 
for list-style-type and list-style-image.  I am using the generic list-style
   to set in both cases.    If so what is code word to shut off the
 list-style-image short of faking a bad url. 

and css was supposed to make display more consistant between
 browsers ;-]  ;-]
