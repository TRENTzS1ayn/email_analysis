I was testing the Mozilla with MathML and SVG executable (windows version)
ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla/nightly/latest-trunk/mozilla-win32-svg-mat
hml.zip

Trying to read Amaya generated files. Mozilla complained about some
indefined
tags. Their implementation of MathML is no complete. And like Amaya, the SVG
isn't complete too.

I think Amaya is (yet) the more powerful viewer for mathML, buf for SVG
there
are many specialized viewers:

Changing of subject:

I'd port my MS word generated math pages to Amaya, buf it does not have
(yet)
cookie support, and that is mandatory for my site. I don't see any plans
near
in time for developing cookie support, dosen't it?
