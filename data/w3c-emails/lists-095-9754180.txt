My site uses "session support" (with PHP) for navigation. This is necessary
in my dynamic generated pages, and almost all my site is generated that way.
I think many big and massive sites use this approach.

For mantaining sessions, not using cookies forces me to use weird URLs
in every hyperlink for doing the same. For several reasons, that is not
easy for me at this time.

Why? maybe the fear to some sort of commercial scanning, or nobody seems
to need it? please tell me if you know some better way for tracking user
sessions.


Thanks.
