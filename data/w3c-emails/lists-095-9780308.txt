I dunno how many of you guys cared, but I noticed that with fink/dselect
Amaya has moved into the supported category from unsupported. THis means
more people who have this package manager for OS X can run Amaya (still
trying to get all the new packages I need downloaded myself, I'll let
whomever know how well it does or doesn't work).
