I don't think it's this parameter that irritates Amaya, but the byte
order mark (BOM) that many editors write to UTF-8 encoded files. BTW,
Opera suffers from the same problem.

There have been some discussions about the validity of BOMs in HTTP
responses, but I'm not sure about the outcome. Maybe someone else can
enlight me?
