After submitting many reports on busted display features 
of Amaya, I had hoped that at least a few would be corrected
this round... zilch -- nada -- none.   RATS!  Perhaps I should
have limited my input to the two or three that are affecting 
display on the simple corporate site at www.town.pelham.on.ca
that is bare bones stuff  --> gosh css1 is old enough to be
fully implemented by now. Version should maybe have been
called 5.5 or something as it in no way looks like version 6
of any of the big three.
