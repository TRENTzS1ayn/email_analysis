Well, I have been using the fink package for 5.3 for a while now, and it is
pretty good (although my window manager is a bit buggy).

I didn't manage to compile the release version 6.0 source - here is the
output in case anyone can help me - otherwise I hope Damian will be kind
enough to package up 6.0 for fink:

Amaya configured with libWWW
Amaya configured with SVG support
Amaya configured with Annotations support
Amaya configured with generic XML suppport
Amaya configured with internationalization suppport
Now type "make" (GNU make preferably) to build the binaries

  whomever know how well it does or doesn't work).
