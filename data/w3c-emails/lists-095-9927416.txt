I'm sorry if some of your reported bugs are still not fixed. As I know a
selector you use in your pages is still not well interpreted by Amaya.
Probably we didn't check all your pages (we used the CSS test suite).

We decided to change the release number to 6.0 because that version is deeply
different from previous versions, even if you didn't see immediately these 
differences. This version is based on a new generation of the thotlib and 
its formatter.
Please have a look at http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/New.html
