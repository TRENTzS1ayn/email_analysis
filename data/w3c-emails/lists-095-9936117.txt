So SVG is more developed in V 6?  These results are intersting:

http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/Overview.htm8

I set my default foreground font to white (ish -- actually a lightgrey)
and I usually have a dark bacground.  This page shows up with much of
the text in white == invisible.

Would an algorithm like:

   dr = (256 + rtext - rbackground) % 256;
   dg = (256 + gtext - gbackground) % 256;
   db = (256 + btext - bbackground) % 256;

   if (( dr + dg + db) < 25){
       rtext = (512 - rbackground) % 256;
       gtext = (512 - gbackground) % 256;
       btext = (512 - bbackground) % 256;
   };

be a sensible way to select default text colours in the light of
(literally!) the background colour?  Obviously based on 24 bit colour.

More to the point, the layout is rather odd:  all the boxes with
information which should be on the left are on the left, but the
information which should be in the middle and right is below them.

In the box about books "components for graphics in the internet age"
bleeds out of the box.

I hope these observations are of some help.
