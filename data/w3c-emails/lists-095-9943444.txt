Would it be possible to have a page on the amaya tree at w3.org
where one could fetch the previous version....
As noted, the present win95/98 binary does not react to arrow
keys for moving around the document. i tried profile = browser 
and profile=editor  but no success. And prior to download I used
 control panel to remove all amaya programs except for user settings.
 installation works well and i like how removal does not zap settings.
However i need to retreat to usable version.
This arrow key thing is glitch that is more serious than 
   unimplemented components which is a resources too little thing.
