Hi

What's the real release date of amaya 6.0? On the amaya page
(http://www.w3c.org/amaya) it says 28 april 2002. The download page says 23
april 2002. Is this still a pre-release? Or is something else strange?

btw, check this mail's date, 23 april has passed, 28 april is just to
arive...



CBee
