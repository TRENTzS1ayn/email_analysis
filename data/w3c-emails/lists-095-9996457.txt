hi
the new Amaya version behaves a bit strange to me. It seams to forget the 
line-break after several block-elements. Look at mozilla.linuxfaqs.de to see 
the problem. Also the <h2> is much to big for me.
Another problem is, that it set a little to much borders for me 
(www.linuxfaqs.de) - Amaya 5.3 also didn't really do the right thing there.
