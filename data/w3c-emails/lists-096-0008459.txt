box. OK fine.

A construct that always has worked, and still does in other browsers,
fails in Amaya:

<IMG SRC="EmmausIkonSmall.jpg" NAME="Graphic1" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER=0>

The text following the image does not wrap around the image. Instead it
starts at the lower right corner of the image.

I know the ALIGN construct is deprecated, but actually I cannot find any
working alternative in the spec. HTML Tidy accecpts the construct
without warning. A Tidy-cleaned version of my file fails too in Amaya.

Amaya has disappointed me a bit. I had hoped it was my way to simpler
and maintainable WEB pages with CSS, but just now it does not look like
a
"production" tool. This is a pity, since I really don't want to go with
a vendor/platform specific tool.

I make homepages for a couple of grassroot groups, and till now I have
used emacs/html-helper-mode for most of it, StarOffice when WYSIWYG is
needed for layout.
