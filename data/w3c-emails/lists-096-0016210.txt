Amaya currently doesn't support rendering of floating elements.

In fact the "correct" way to do these is with the CSS property float -
something like

  img.leftside { float: left }

Which works in virtually every CSS-capable browser (except Amaya and iCab)
and can be equally applied to HTML elements - for example the menus on pages
like http://jigsaw.w3.org use a rule like

  div.sidebar { float: right }

Amaya doesn't complain about you using this CSS, and using Amaya means you
can ensure that it will work in environments which don't support CSS (many
mobile systems or voice interaction systems, for example), if you can imagine
the results.

But I too wish that float was implemented...
