Hello all

I wanted to report two bugs I've been noticing lately.

The first is that I've been getting an error message that it is an 
incorrect mime type when I try to save a document and have to manually pick 
the "application: xhtml+xml" option to save it.

The second bug is that occasionally (and I can't figure out why it works 
sometimes and not others) under "style" I cannot select the "character" 
option to do bold or underline, etc.  I click on it in the toolbar but no 
window pops up, nothing.

Other than that, the newest Amaya is wonderful.  Each version just keeps 
getting better and better.  It's a great tool, thanks for all your work.

best,
Amy
