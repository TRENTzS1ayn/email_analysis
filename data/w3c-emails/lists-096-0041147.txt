This is probably due to a wrong configuration of our Apache server.
I have that problem when I create a XHTML page (it's saved through Jigsaw
with the right MIME type "application: xhtml+xml").
When I reload it (or I load it in a new Amaya session), the Apache server
serves that file with the wrong MIME type "text/html". When I re-save it Amaya
keeps the current MIME type "text/html". Jigsaw detects that the MIME type 
changed and reports an error.

Solutions are in preference order:
- fix the Apache configuration
- accept to manually re-set the "application: xhtml+xml" MIME type with Save As.
- remove the option "Use the application/xhtml+xml MIME type for XHTML documents"

This occurs normally when that "character style" cannot be applied.
The menu entry should be grayed but it seems not to be in the Windows
version (we have to look at that problem).
Let me know if when it occurs there is a selection and the document is not in 
Read-Only mode.
