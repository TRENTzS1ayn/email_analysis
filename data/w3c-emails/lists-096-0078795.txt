The support of Windows escape codes seems to be buggy.  If I type 
ALT+0133 for an ellipsis character, I get the letter a.  Oddly, other 
escape codes such as ALT+0169 for the copyright symbol work.

OpenGL version does not seem to correctly draw to the screen.  There are 
times when display is extremely distorted.  Usually, only half of a 
character appears under the cursor.  This is DPI independent.  It seems 
to be related to multitasking since effect become worse as Windows focus 
changes.  My display is Nvidia GeForce MX 100/200 1024 x 768 32bit and 
usually at 85dpi (currently 96dpi).
