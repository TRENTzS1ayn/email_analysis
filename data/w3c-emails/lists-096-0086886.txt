This feature is not yet implemented in Amaya.

I think Amaya is right. The CSS specification at

   http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/text.html#alignment-prop

says that the text-align property "describes how inline content
of a block is aligned". hr is a block but it has no content.
So, the text-align property does not change anything.
You could also consider associating the text-align property
with the li element. But it would not work either, as hr is
a block element, according to the HTML DTD, and the property
only concerns inline content.
