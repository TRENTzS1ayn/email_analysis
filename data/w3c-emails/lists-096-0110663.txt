Isn't the parser supposed to flag errors in html constructs.
I had been using ones like
<h2 id="x"><a name="x"></a>Topic Heading</a>
to give a target anchor for both old and new browsers
(the null instead of 'a' spanning the caption is to avoid
a known netscape 4 quirk.  But my first use of the 
w3.org link checker bled so much red that i had to refill
the video's supply ;-] ;-]    I contacted
  Bjoern Hoehrmann <derhoermi@gmx.net> and he explained
that it was a duplicate id problem.  Neither Amaya nor the
w3 validator flag this problem and i was lulled into a false sense
that i had done things correctly.  Is there a reason why Amaya
does not warn on duplicate id problems. 
Just trying to do things correctly as far as the recommendation
states.  Anticipating this will ease path to XHTML  and trying
to emphasise conformance in my Web Authoring classes.
