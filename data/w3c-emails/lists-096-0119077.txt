Greetings,
     I am at present writing a 'web-book' on web applications, using a
secure server which involves all links being checked by PHP routines - even
though I use Amaya to produce the documents.  Yesterday I threw a page (as
a file, thus without benefit of server script execution) with hand-added
PHP to have a final Amaya check for errors.  The page contained processing
instructions like 

... an <?php glossref("XML") ; ?>-based ....

There was a bug, so I edited the file in Amaya and wrote it out. 
Unfortunately, because of the line length Amaya split the above as follows

... an <?php glossref("XML") ; ?>
-based ...

which, therefore, now produces an unwanted space before the hyphen when
served through apache and the PHP interpreter.  May I suggest that this is
actually a bug which should be avoided??

     I have also noticed that it splits argument strings to processing
instruction functions, etc over lines - which, though probably not the same
error seems not to be correct - it certainly messes up the script
operation.
