John,

somewhere in the transition documentation, I think
they suggest coding that as
<h2><a name="x" id="x"></a>Topic Heading</h2>
which puts the identifier "x" redundantly on the
same tag twice.

(I came away from that piece of the specification
thinking of it as the name attribute and the id
attribute being separate namespaces; but, thinking
it through after reading your paragraph above,
that would not work because href="#x" has to point
at exactly one location in the document.)
