Hi,

Is it possible to link or edit alternate stylesheets with Amaya 6.4 for Windows? I have tried and I have failed to do it. Finally, I have edited the XHTML code (using View / Show source), changing rel="stylesheet" to rel="alternate stylesheet", but then the CSS file is not displayed in Style / Style sheets / Open.

Now that Mozilla can handle alternate stylesheets, it would be nice if Amaya could manage them.

Thanks for your great work,
Barto
