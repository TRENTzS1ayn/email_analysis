Hi,

In Amaya 6.4 for Windows, when I link a style sheet to a document (Style / Style sheets / 
Link... / click anywhere / Attribute / Browse), the "File type" box in the select dialog windows is set to HTML 
files. It would be nice if it would be set to CSS files.

In Amaya 6.4 for Windows, when I insert an image in a document (Types / Images / browse),
the "file type" box is set to GIF files. It would be nice if it would show all the image file types at once (GIF, JPG and PNG). 
Also, in Windows this box can be set to BMP files; but I think BMP is a Windows-only format,
not suitable for Web pages.

Thanks for your great work,
Barto
