Thanks for your reports (and for your encouragements)
There is actually a bug in the Transform menu of the last release for Windows.
This bug has been fixed in the CVS base. Until it is released, you can use the 
few buttons of the toolbar or the Type menu to make transformations.

Concerning yours remaks about StyleSheet menu, some of them have been already 
taken into account in the base version (wider window dialog, file type set to 
CSS), but for unix platforms only.  I'll make them available for Windows also.
