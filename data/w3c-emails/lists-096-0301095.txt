Hurray, we now have history enabled for better navigation thru the gui.

But the statement that CSS is now working on classes is not correct
http://home.cogeco.ca/~ve3ll/home.htm   illustrates the problem
sidebar should be green....  uses sb class in style zestyle.css

Also the about amaya has not been altered for snapshot version
it should reflect date correctly.  running both bin and snap and i 
confuse easily... workaround is to see if history working ;-] ;-]
