If it's part of an installation program/wizard, just make a dialog with 
no title, and each language named in that language. Most people will 
work out that they should choose the option they can read, not any of 
the ones they can't.

    * English
    * Fran?ais
    * Espa?ol
    * Deutsch

If you wanted to the really clever, the OK button would change name with 
the current selection :-)
