Well today i juggled colors and suddenly everything works fine ....
i did remove strong elements from inside address element in menu
don't know if that was the quirk    but now if you view
http://home.cogeco.ca/~ve3ll     you will see good rendering of colors
  maybe it was a peculiar named color that wasn't happening
but links were centered too .... some overall failure of parse that wasnt
showing up on parse view  or in validator ...  but all aok now.   //
