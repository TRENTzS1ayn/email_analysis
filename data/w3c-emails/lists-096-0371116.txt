Now using hr element as separator ... works as i 
expected in msie but not in other browsers .

1]  is the hr element allowed within an address element 
       the mozilla.org groups contend that it cant be nested that way
    but validator does not complain.
2] the short test that i am adding does not do a line return before
   the paragraph after hr element in address... is this a bug ???
3 there are two lines (only spotted this when i made a darker shade
   background ... top line is correct.... where does bottom one come from??
    my assumption is that amaya sets different height than other browsers
     do on the hr element  .
test case is as follows 
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN">
<html>
<head>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=iso-8859-1">
<style type="text/css">
body {background:#d6e0cc}
hr {color:khaki; margin:0px; padding:0px}
hr.s {width:20px}
</style>
<title>test of hr</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>here is a <hr class="s"> short rule for test.<p>

<address>
Here is a test of the hr tag<br>
<hr>
Resume normal programming now.  Why the double line
and isn't hr a block element where it should start a new line

</address>
</body>
</html>
