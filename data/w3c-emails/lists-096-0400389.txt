There are a few issues that involve the <object> element in XHTML 1.1:
 * Amaya will not render object type="text/html"; it should be able to 
since it can render HTML anyway
 * The editing of <object> in structure view invokes the image element 
dialog, other attributes don't work either.
 * Opening a page with <object type="text/html" 
data="http://www.mozilla.org/"> causes Amaya to automaticall add width 
and height attributes which cannot be removed.
