Hello Stefano.

It's very odd. I have never seen such a bug before, we have never received a 
report mentionning it. I have tested a local version of your document and I 
can't reproduce it. Does it arrive for this document only, for a remote source 
save only or also for a Save from the formatted view ?

Regards, 

Laurent
