I find that Amaya crashes when the computer is accessing the hard drive.
And taking longer than a second.
The times that this would happen would be, after loading a document then
scrolling down the page fast.  I get an error

File: fopen.c
Line: 54
Expression: *file != _T('\0')

Or I would highlight some text and changing the color to red.  I will get

Debug Assertion Failed!
File: dbgheap.c
Line: 1011
Expression: _CrtIsValidHeapPointer(pUserData)

On one of my pages I have a couple of the copyright symbol in it.  I have it
on
several pages but this one Amaya did not like.  I changed it to &copy; to
solve this problem but it would eventually change it back to the single chr.

I am finally using Amaya on my pages.  It's more stable than a year ago.
I took my pages written with Front Page Express, ran them through Tidy
and hand edited the styles to match and also update the stylesheet.
