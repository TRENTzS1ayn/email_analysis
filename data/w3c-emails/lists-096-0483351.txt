Hi,

Some Amaya 021028 Win98 Snapshot bugs and questions:

Bugs:
1. The End key does not work.
2. Ctrl+right arrow does not work properly. If open Amaya, it works,
but after a while it does not work (the same behaviour as in Amaya 6.4)
2. I have changed the dialogue language to Spanish and then the Amaya
default page has changed to C:\Program Files\Amaya\Windows\bin\?.
Then, it does not show neither the default page neither the addres bar.
Changing to English does not solve the problem.
3. I can not copy from the address bar

Questions
1. Is it adviced to uninstall previous Amaya installation?
2. What is the new timeline window for?

Best regards,
Barto (http://www.mclibre.org)
