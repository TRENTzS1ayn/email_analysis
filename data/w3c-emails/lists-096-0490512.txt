I must say that each version looks a lot better as i
browse my own homepage and designs that i have done for 
others.  However there are always thinks to point out....
1] help section is now unusable ....  select help  on configuring
you get a small jump table but can't go ay further. at least i could not.

2] there are few pure xml sites on the net to check your engine 
against.  But one that will cause a bit of anguish and maybe some 
analysis as to why so bad is  http://www.opera.com  
yup --- i know !  but if you can sneak your racer out on Mercedes
test track  in middle of night  why not do it....  perhaps you can
 suggest xml sites to use as demo --->> good results.   //
