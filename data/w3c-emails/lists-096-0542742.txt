validates using jigsaw  but generates many parse errors
within amaya  over use of none as a value .... 
things which are unimplemented but within the css rules
should parse ok ...  
there is a need for report of unimplemented properties used
on a page  but that is another issue ... it definitely should
not flag these as parse errors.   //
