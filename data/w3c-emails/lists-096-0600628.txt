is a site that validates and shows no parse errors
however the jpg image on this page does not display at all
and when one moves to next page, three gif files also do not
display although there are no parse errors......

all other tested browsers (net4,msie6 and gecko engine ones)
display the images with no difficulty ...  could others verify the
problem  and is this on the fix or tobe fixed list yet.   //
