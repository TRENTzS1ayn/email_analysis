Amaya GL 6.4 on Windows XP
When I am in structure view, the creation of attributes makes structure 
view lose focus.

To reproduce:
1. Edit option elements in structure view.
2. Press Enter/Return to create a new option element.
3. Insert a value in Amaya's attribute prompt.
4. Press Enter/Return.

Actual Results:
Focus is lost.  Typing does not continue in the contents of the select 
element.

Expected Results:
Focus should return to structure view in the contents of the select element.
