illustrates a problem within the parser where badly formed
html is not flagged as such .... it is basically
a numbered list that was terminated with a typo ....
ie 
<ol>
<li>foo</li>
<li>bar></li>
<ol>

instead of closing with a </ol>........  
Shouldn't the Amaya parser signal all errors or divergences 
from the spec, even if it doesn't cause problems in rendering.
This is in addition to the parser not warning about backslashes
being the wrong separator in image file names although it 
prevents the display of the image...  that is another parser 
problem needing fixing ....  
time to assign someone to the task of tweaking the parser ...
for example splitting html error flags  from unimplemented 
feature warnings either by text wording  or by file separation.
--- things spotted by a teacher using Amaya to evaluate students 
efforts to write valid code that respects the w3.org recommendations.
