Hello John,

Actually, Amaya uses 2 different parsers, one for HTML documents, another one 
from XML documents (XHTML, MathML, SVG, ...).
The HTML parser tries to correct the most common errors (like the missing and 
tags) otherwise, most of the document on the web wouldn't be rendered (as the 
document you mentionned).
The XML parser is more strict and points out each not well-formed document 
(according to the XML spec.)
