That first error is due to an incorrect nested comment in the CSS file.
Amaya is telling you that it has never heard of a selector called

  "background:\s\s#eeeeee;\n}"

(for readability, I've inserted "\s" for spaces and "\n" for newlines)

The rest of the errors are similar incorrect comments or are caused by
these comments (cascading errors).

All these errors are now fixed in Validator CVS and will be in the next
release.

This is the only issue as far as I can make out; the syntax errors in the
CSS make no difference as far as appearance are concerned. The selectors
and properties it found errors with were discarded/ignored and they were
intended to be ignored, so it made no difference in rendering in this case.
