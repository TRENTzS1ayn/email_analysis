It seems my 'ugly' viewing of the validator page is due to 
'float' not being implemented for images... 
Since much of the web is visually oriented and since Amaya is
reaching maturity it surely is time for this to be remedied!!
Even using Amaya as an editor you want to place images and 
see a nice 'look'  without resorting to tables.
I thought using tables for formatting was something to get away from !

With the last couple of versions, many of my pages have started
to look reasonably well in amaya and at times better than net 4.7
Many congratulations for this  but the most universal display issue
i see now is the old unimplemented 'float'.

Is this a complex problem, dealing with interfacing someone else's
graphics package or perhaps the multiplicity of packages provided
by the different platforms.
Is it a difficult problem due to interactions and multiple calls within
Amaya or coding fragmented.
Whatever the difficulty is, I think the issue of 'float' should be dealt with
soon.... obviously not for the release this month  but maybe raise it
in priority for the next release.
