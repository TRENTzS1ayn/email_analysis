Windows version 6.4 cannot create a link after hightlighting "The
Babysitter" until I delete the space on line 582 just before <em>.
580    <tr>
581      <td><p>#37&nbsp;<strong>The Babysitter<br />
582        </strong> <em>Copied From The Original Tape</em></p>
583      </td>
584    </tr>

Also editing in a cell I want to add a <br /> and the cell size will not
resize unless I reload the document.
