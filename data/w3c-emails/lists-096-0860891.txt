I got a bad e-mail address returned to me, so hopefully the attached 
reply gets to the right person.

I only had the GL version installed.  I recently reformatted and now 
have the 6.4 snapshot non-GL installed.  When the next release comes, I 
will uninstall it and install the new GL release.
I don't know if I mentioned it, but my display is usually 1024 x 768 
32-bit color 85dpi Nvidia GeForce MX 100/200.  The problems have spanned 
multiple driver versions (both WHQL and non-WHQL) as well as both 
release version of Direct X and Direct X 9 Beta.  Interestingly, I set 
the clock deep into the future and when I started Amaya GL, it said 
Direct Draw had expired.  I though DirectX was separate from OpenGL so 
there might be some issue with the two conflicting in some way.  I think 
OpenOffice.org renders through OpenGL, and I see no issues with it, though.
