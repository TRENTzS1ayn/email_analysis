Trying to add text (a date) to the right of the "new-yellow.gif" file.  I
place the cursor to the right of the image and I can see the cursor there. I
start typing and the text starts to appears to the left of the image.  I can
place the cursor and using the right arrow key to place the cursor to the
right of the image.  When I start typing, the text again starts to appear on
the left side of the image.  Deleting <strong> and </strong> on both sides
of the <br /> on lines 538 and 539 will not fix the problem.
