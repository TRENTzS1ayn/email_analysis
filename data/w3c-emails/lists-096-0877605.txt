Possibly not the best forum to ask this, but I can't think of a more
appropriate one.

Has anybody heard of an SGML editor called Grif Symposia?  Web searches
yield no information more recent than 1997 (symposia.inria.fr) and
www.grif.fr seems to have disappeared. It was allegedly a collaborative SGML
editor, and I was wondering what happened to it...

Cheers,

Horatio
