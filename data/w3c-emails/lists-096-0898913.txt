Congratulations... this version looks way more polished
than 6.x   Table borders are well under control now and
most of my site looks reasonably attractive.
The only page that still bothers me is 
http://home.cogeco.ca/~ve3ll/sitemap.htm
for some eason the background plaid does not stretch to 
extreme right as it does on all my other pages.  It appears
as if there is a forced margin  or perhaps a table with a blank 
column that is being sized out to look like a margin on right....
but that is a small price to pay ..... thanks for working hard

only things i find annoying now, and many of them are well
known issues and all involve images
1] images are not maintaining their width/height ratios when
 forced sizing on width is requested. 
2] images are not being used as replacements for the default
 bullets as requested. On my site a checkmark gif is requested
and used by all oher browsers i have viewed with.
3] image transparencies are not being done.  
and the biggie of course
4] images cant do 'float'

but sit back and take a break ---- things look well from here.
later reports will be on parser .... ta   //
