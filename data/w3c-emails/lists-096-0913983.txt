I see why the background doesn't bleed to the right edge.
This is the one page that by its nature of being short list items
has no situations where the line maxes out and wraps ... thus
the table that the data is in is narrower than the available...
it is padded with margin ....  it looks quirky and i can force
a better look but it is not an Amaya problem at all .... sorry
so you can really focus on the image issues now  ;-] ;-] ;-] ;-]
and i found another one.
a background with a css request to be fixed, does not stay 
fixed as its told....  when i had my pet rover fixed,  he stayed fixed ;-[ ;-[
