spoke too soon  - there is a problem on 
http://home.cogeco.ca/~ve3ll/sitemap.htm

when i reset my style on the overall table that exists on each
page to allow for pages with narrow lines.
th.sb {width:130px}    // makes sure that the sidebar width is static
td.sb {width:100%}    // to fill out right column to max window
other browsers handle this ok  but amaya forgets to subtract 
previous columns from the width, thus using full 100% and forcing
window to widen , bringing up horizontal slider and other ailments...
is this just a slip in calculating what 100% is based on...
a work around is to assume an 800 px width and force to say
665 (leaving some pixels for the vertical slider .... will test and
put back to relative because i would prefer my pages to adapt to 
wider displays for now.   //
