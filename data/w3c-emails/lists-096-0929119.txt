Hi

I'm happily using Amaya 7, only it didn't show <pre> tags in monotype 
font. I'm in Windows 2000.

I fixed it: the file <Amaya root>\config\fonts.win is linking the "type 
3" font with the name "Courrier New".

"Courrier" with a double "r" is the French (Hmmm!) word for Courier ...

In my file I replaced all "Courrier New" instances by "Courier New" and 
it worked.
After, I replaced "Courier New" with "Lucida Console" and it also 
worked. "Lucida Console" is one of the most legible monotype fonts and 
Amaya shows it perfectly. It can be found in Wnt ans W2K.

As I use Amaya instead of paper many hours a day in my work, having the 
most legible text is of great benefit.

Regards, and thanks to the laborious developers, once again!
