Hi,
     Having had a very brief chance to work with Amaya 7 this afternoon I
agree with other comments I have just been reading - good stuff.

     Having said that, I was disappointed when I read the HTTP fixes to
find no mention of TLS compatibility.  I spend a lot of time generating web
documents from scripts and I cannot use Amaya for most testing as the web
site concerned is secure - it needs both proxy login and site login.  May I
ask if that is on the revised 'wish list' still?

     I note that floats and objects are still somewhat shaky on the
width/location.

     In reading the release notes I am not sure whether to understand that
the SVG improvements have only been done for the Open GL version, because I
haven't got that and use the GTK one - one or two SVG oddities in
presentation/editing (by dragging) still seem to exist in that version.

     All in all, however, my congratulations on a much slicker package.

                         Regards,

                         Keith
