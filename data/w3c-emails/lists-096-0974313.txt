 It seems, there are problems in Windows Installer, it should check
for previous versions of Amaya to upgrade to new version correctly.

 Yes, I removed Amaya 6.4 via Control Panel  --> Add/Remove Programms
before installation and completely removed C:\Program Files\Amaya\
folder by hand. Amaya 7.0 installation completed without problems.

 Still no success. It seems, some DLLs [in C:\WINNT ? ] or Registry records
from Amaya 6.4 conflicts with current Amaya 7.0
