Running Amaya 7.0 on Windows 2000 I am not able to upload an edited page
to a jigsaw server. I know authentication is required but I see no prompt
for authentication.

I have the proxy configured and see in the status line the redirecd to
the jigsaw url. I see an error code of -1 that has no meaning to me.

Has anyone else had a similar problem? Is this a known issue? Is this some sort
of caching?

regards, Frederick
