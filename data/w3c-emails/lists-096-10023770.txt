well some are discussing the look of the interface ...
and i for one think it is reasonable as the main toolbar
does have tooltips .... but of course we all have personsal
lokes  such as 
1] toolbars on Math palette and other palettes if they exist
 (i only use parts that i need)
2] configure switch to turn toolbars off/on  for those who think
   they are annoying.
3] hovering a toolbar menu should have it dropdown  or pullout
as appropriate.
4] once again a configure switch for those who don't want hover 
to drop down the menu .....

Note that #2 and #4 add no functunality  but allow the user to 
 make the interface to his needs .....
Drag/drop rearrangeable menu items may be overkill    but the
suggestions above should not be difficult as tooltips are used in 
some but not all places (need consistency), menus already drop
but could also for the hover event.  config controls are just toggles
so ....

unfortunately i do not have the resources or time for CVS ...  
now if it was in Java ;-] ;-] ;-] --
