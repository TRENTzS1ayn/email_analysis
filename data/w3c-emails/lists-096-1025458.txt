well w3.org going to tableless columns may push amaya to
finally enact float   but net4.7 also looks ugly with that technique...

in fact msie/opera/net7 which does it as expected is still not very
attractive as the background color stops short on left and right column
so  a poor look in good browsers and an ugly look in lesser ones
sure is no encouragement to use the technique ....   was the 
stopping short on background color at bottom of page a goof   or
is that a limitation of the technique ???? 

i hear the sound of more designers clicking over to 'dreamweaver' hehe   //
