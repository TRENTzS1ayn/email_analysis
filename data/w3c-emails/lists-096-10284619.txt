     Up to a point! But whether you like tool tips or not that should also
be customisable - I HATE them! As I commented in another forum recently
what is really needed is not an interface which matches any particular
window manager - but the ability to customise the window manager - far more
important to me. I hate nearly all of them as they do not operate in what
to me is a consistent way - irrespective of application.  This is a really
difficult problem which started out over 30 years ago - when the technology
was not available to do anything about it.

     We are now in the situation that lots of window  managers and
applications have gone their own way - the tower of Babel in a different
guise. While I appreciate that -some- people do not like the Amaya
interface very much for one set of reasons, I dislike it too - but for a
very different set of reasons (inter alia heavy reliance on pull down menus
and so-called keyboard short-cuts - wwhich I can never remember from one
application to another!).

     May I suggest, therefore, that changes to the interface be approached
very very carefully and not in any hurry.  I am quite happy to continue
using the existing interface - provided that some of the rendering engine
style problems are resolved. I am finding more and more that I produce
documents and style sheets using Amaya and then have to rely on other
rendering engines to provide the visual image that the style sheet
specification dictates (from CSS2.1 - even CSS3).
