Using Amaya 8.1b on Win2k Advanced Server (also occurred in 8.1a), 

 

1.Create a new XHTML1.1 document.

 

2.Insert a horizontal rule.

 

3.Place the insertion point immediately after the rule. (You may have
to do this in Views > Show source)

 

4.Select XHTML > Table > table

 

Nothing happens.

 

If steps 2 and 3 are omitted, then the "how many rows by columns" dialog is
shown as expected.
