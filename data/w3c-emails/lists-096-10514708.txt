There is a file davlib/Makefile.dav that should be included by @dav_frag@
You probably have a problem with your configuration.
I agree the comment says "amayaMakefile.dav" instead of "davlib/Makefile.dav"
I will fix the comment.

Normally Amaya reads and writes byte by byte to avoid this kind of
trouble.

No, Amaya doesn't use these libwww features.
If you checkout the libwww from the CVS base, you have to -rAmaya revision.
See the documentation "http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/cvs.html"

There are incompatible versions of libraries like libpng, expat, and libwww.
To fix that problem, tools have no other solution than to distribute their own version
of libraries.

Yes of course.
