This would not be a welcome change. XML Web clients do use these closing
tags, and XML was developed because it was too hard to be sure when things
were supposed to close in SGML.

Processing tools such as XSLT also rely on having the closing tags, even if
not all web clients do yet. This is important as the web moves back to the
variety of browsers and tools that it was envisioned having, and as more
services and semantics increase the number of tools being used to process
information on the web.
