Hi,

Questions:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - -
1. How can an <address> block be transformed to a <p> block in Amaya
formatted view?
If it is not possible, a good way would be Edit > Transform > Paragraph
- - - - - - - - - - - - - -
2. How can a <pre> block be transformed to a <p> block in Amaya
formatted view?
If it is not possible, a good way would be Edit > Transform > Paragraph
- - - - - - - - - - - - - -
3. How can a one level list be transformed to a <p> block in Amaya
formatted view?
If it is not possible, a good way would be Edit > Transform > Paragraph.
The present Edit > Transform > Remove one level is dangerous (see Bug 2)

Bugs

1. <p> within <address>

  It is easy to create in Amaya the following XHTML code.

  <address>
    <p>My name</p>
  </address>

  Amaya saves and loads the document without warnings, but W3C Validator
  says:
    document type does not allow element "p" here; missing one of "object",
    "ins", "del", "map", "button" start-tag

2. characters without tags

  It is easy to create text with no tags. For instance:
  Create a list:
  <ul>
    <li>Hello</li>
  </ul>
  Then select the whole list (two F2 keystrokes) and click menu Edit >
  Transform > Remove one level. A maya removes <ul> and <il> tags:

  Hello

  Amaya saves and loads the document without warnings, but W3C Validator
  says:
   character data is not allowed here

3. Disappearing spaces

  I have three words in a paragraph:
    <p>First Second Third</p

  I select the first two words with the mouse and click menu XHTML >
  Information type > Emphasis:
    <p><em>First Second</em> Third</p>

  I select the last two words with the mouse, and click menu XHTML >
  Information type > strong:
  <p><em>First <strong>Second</strong></em><strong> Third</strong></p>

  The space between the second and third word is inside the <strong>tag.
  Then, when the document is saved and reloaded, the space has desappeared:
  <p><em>primera <strong>segunda</strong></em><strong>tercera</strong></p>

  This problem is not limited to the <strong> and <em> tags, of course.
