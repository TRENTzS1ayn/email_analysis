It seems that there is no way to get it running on a non english version.
Installation is extremely slow.
There is no window custom-typical-minimum (maybe because language 
options are removed)

Reinstallation of 6.4 has been very fast. But that version had an awful 
bug since it added extra line feeds inside <pre> statements on every save.

Any idea?
