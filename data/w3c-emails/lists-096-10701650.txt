The distribution page does not mention support of Win 95
However since version a was able to run on 95 perhaps the
maintainers will put a pointer to that version for historical 
purposes (with suitable flags that win95 is no longer supported).
or if the b version can be patched to work with win95 that would
be even better...  --
