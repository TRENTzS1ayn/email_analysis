Are you trying to unsubscribe from the www-amaya 
mailing list? If so, you'll need to send an e-mail to 
<www-amaya-request@w3.org> with the word "unsubscribe" 
in the subject line (without the quotes). 
 
Or, are you suggesting that I un-install the previous 
version of Amaya, before installing the latest version? 
 Been there, done that, still have the same problem.
