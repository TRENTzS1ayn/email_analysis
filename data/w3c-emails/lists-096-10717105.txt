The Amaya Win32 binary was renamed from Win95 to Win98,
along with the description on the Distribution page, a 
while back. This was around the time that Micro$oft 
dropped support for the old OS; but until 8.1b, Amaya 
continued to install and run fine on Win95.  
 
As a C / C++ developer I know that few, if any, useful 
features were actually added to Win98, so it's unlikely 
 that Amaya itself really requires any patching. I 
suspect that the problem is actually with the 
installer. 
 
It would be great if Amaya would support open tools, 
even under Windows -- including the gnu compiler suite, 
 and an open-source installer program. That would be 
more appropriate than catering Mr. Bill's flavor of 
the month for development suites and OS tweaks. 
 
Thanks for your support!

The distribution page does not mention support of Win 95
However since version a was able to run on 95 perhaps the
maintainers will put a pointer to that version for historical 
purposes (with suitable flags that win95 is no longer supported).
or if the b version can be patched to work with win95 that would
be even better...  --
