The Amaya Win32 binary was renamed from Win95 to Win98 
a while back, along with the description on the 
Distribution page. This was around the time that 
MS dropped support for their old OS; but until 
8.1b, Amaya continued to install and run fine on Win95.  
The 8.1a version is still available via ftp, but I need to keep up with Amaya's latest enhancements. 
  
As a C / C++ developer I know that few, if any, useful 
features were actually added to Win98, so it's unlikely 
 that Amaya itself really requires any patching. I 
suspect that the problem is actually with the 
installer. 
 
It would be great if Amaya would support open tools, 
even under Windows -- including the gnu compiler suite, 
 and an open-source installer program. That would be 
more appropriate than catering Mr. Bill's flavor of 
the month for development suites and OS tweaks. 
 
Meanwhile, I'd be satisfied with a raw version of the binary, unless / until a work-around is available for the installer. 
 
Thanks.

The distribution page does not mention support of Win 95
However since version a was able to run on 95 perhaps the
maintainers will put a pointer to that version for historical 
purposes (with suitable flags that win95 is no longer supported).
or if the b version can be patched to work with win95 that would
be even better...  --
