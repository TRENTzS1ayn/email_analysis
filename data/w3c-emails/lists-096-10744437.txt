I don't know amaya details but I do know that once unix source bundles compile 
and build with gcc and related open tools, then it is fairly easy to port that 
source to all systems for which gcc and the other build tools are available.

One exception is the used libraries. For tools like amaya, most notably the 
windowing libraries. On unix, this is the X11 set and on top of that sometimes 
sets like motif and such. Those libraries are hard to port to M$Windows but most 
of them are somehow ported or such, at least somehow available.

For example the nirvana editor (www.nedit.org). That uses the motif librariy. It 
is also available for M$Windows machines, it 'just' needs a motif library.

With the same route, I think it must be possible to get Amayas unix source and 
build that on M$Windows.

But then again, why would hou? the M$Windows source is also available. if you 
have a compiler and such, you might be able to build it yourself.
