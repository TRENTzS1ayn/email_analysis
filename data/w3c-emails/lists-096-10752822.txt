Hi,

Attributes window has a different behaviour in Amaya 8.1b than in previous 
releases. Before, when you clicked on the Apply button the window did not 
close. It was very useful when you wanted to apply the same attribute to
several elements, because you did not have to write the value each time.
Now, in Amaya 8.1b (windows XP), when you click on the Apply button, the
Attributes window closes.
I suppose there is a reason for this change. If it is not possible to return
to the old behaviour, can a fourth button (apply without closing) be added?

Best regards,
Barto
