There is another (welcome!) behaviour chance: now many dialog windows, 
in not all, can be closed with <esc> as is usual in Windows.
This is a strongly rooted convention, of the kind that should respected.

It would be fine to be able to close with <esc> every other window 
except the main one. For example all views like structure, errors, etc.
Only exception might be a source view with uncommited changes. Notice 
that the source view is different to the other windows in that it has a 
means to be closed without resorting too the mouse, with <alt><f4> in 
windows, the official platform end-program message.
