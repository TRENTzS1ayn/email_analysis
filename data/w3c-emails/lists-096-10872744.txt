In the example at:
    http://www.graphviz.org/bug/hello-world.xml
there is a visible gap between the "hello" node and the edge.

The ellipse is "cy=30 ry=18" implying that is lowest point
should be at y=48.  The first point of the edge is at "M36,48"
and so the two should be touching.

My guess is that there is a rounding problem in the ellipse generating
code.
