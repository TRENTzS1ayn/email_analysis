Using Amaya 8.1B(XP) on WinNT4, trying it out with a pre-existing HTML
document (3.2 with vendor extensions and missing alt text) to see how the
image-map support was.  

It doesn't fare well with client side image maps that it didn't create to it's
liking initially.

(1) The image map was near the bottom of the file, merely referenced by name,
perfectly legal.  Toggling on Show Map Areas gave outlines at the far end of
the file, where there were no images, not on the image that had the usemap=
attribute. Just hovering over text. 

(2) I used View Source and cut the imagemap lines, intending to paste them
adjacent to the image to see if that would help. But the image map polygons
were still displayed in the main window ... when I pasted, or when it
re-synced?, crash.

(3) Tried again, with map areas not showing when pasting; let it resync; now
Show Map Areas looks nice.

(4) The legacy document was not fully accessibility compliant, in that it did
not have alt= attributes on the area's.  Adding them with the menu worked
fine. Adding them by direct typing in the Show Structure view crashed as soon
as I typed the = in 'alt='.

Good luck, I'd like to like Amaya (since the Symantec product that reused some
of my code is out of production).
