Hi

I do not like how Amaya handles white-spaces nowadays. Amaya deletes double white-spaces except inside <pre> tags (at least). But white-space handling can be defined by CSS white-space property and Amaya does not take it into account.

For example, I can not create this file with Amaya:

p.csscode { white-space: pre; }

<p class="csscode">This is a sample of a CSS file:<br />
h1<br />
    {<br />
         color: white;<br />
         background-color: black;<br />
    }</p>

because Amaya deletes the white-spaces.

This behaviour was added to Amaya in a recent release (I can not remember exactly when). Can you change to the old way or are there other benefits from it?

Barto
