As my primary use for Amaya is source file validations (until the
 visual part is working correctly )  i hope you can correct this
parsing error that doesn't ring any alerts  in the show error part....

When a title element has a missed angle bracket on its closer,
the error is not flagged at all ....  some browsers then assume 
rest of doc is title,  some don't need the caret    but it is definitely
a parsing error that should be flagged. i have included both 
html and xhtml examples but it is easy to duplicate.

just hoping it is not to late for next release... as i say, the parse 
component makes tracking fixing syntax  real easy and is used a lot.--
