Several messages about Amaya bugs that i have sent
have not been echoed to the list.  is there a problem
or is there a moderator who may hold some items
for analysis/reply. As i cant do CVS, i don't know 
whether to resubmit bugfinds  or wait and regressive test
with new version.  We really need a reporting system that
indexes reported bugs, triages them, and sets some kind
 of status for repair.--
