Yes, for me too. And is bizarre because the copy and paste works with the
mouse but not with ctrl+c and ctrl+v

Best regards,

|
| Dear Amaya Team,
|
| I am having problems with cutting and pasting in the Open (URI) field on
| Amaya.    For example, doing a ctrl-C in the field pastes some old, copied
| string into the field, instead of copying the new one.  Other times, it
| seems that doing a ctrl-C delects the first character in the string.
There
| are other, related symptoms as well.
|
| I am using Amaya 7.0 on Windows 2000.
|
| Thanks,
|
| Steve
