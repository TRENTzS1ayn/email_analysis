Hi,

In HTML 4.01 recommendation it is said that overlapping areas
are possible. According to the recommendation, clicking in
the center of the circle of this example shall not active the link:

<map name="map">
  <area shape="circle" coords="100,100,50" alt="Inner-ring" />
  <area xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" shape="circle"
  coords="100,100,100" alt="Outer-ring" href="#out_of_here" />
</map>

Mozilla and Internet Explorer work as expected, but Amaya does not.

Amaya behaves as expected (circle center not active) when the code is:

<map name="map">
  <area xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" shape="circle"
  coords="100,100,100" alt="Outer-ring" href="#out_of_here" />
  <area shape="circle" coords="100,100,50" alt="Inner-ring" />
</map>

that is, when the inner circle <area> is after the outer one.
But then the whole circle is active in Mozilla and Internet Explorer.

Amaya seems to analyse and aplly <area> in opposite order than 
Mozilla or IE.

Best regards,
Bartolom? Sintes
