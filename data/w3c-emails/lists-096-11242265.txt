This one has workaround for incomplete fieldset!!!

However when a legend is added it is mispositioned!
It should be placed middle aligned within top border, 
to resemble a tab type of border ....  this is how every
other browser does it as well as java swing borders...

When the w3.org recommendation is silent about how something
is to be done, a good way is to follow the crowd unless there is
 a strong reason not to...  in this case it should be easy to find the
coordinate that is being used for the fieldset border and calc based on it. --
