If you want to click a target with an id, you must show target icons and click the
target icon.
To show target icons you have the choice between
 - Views>Show targets that displays target icons within the formatted view
   (you can force this option for all documents in Special>Preferences>General)
 - View>Sow links that opens a Links view
