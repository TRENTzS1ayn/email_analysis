Sure, though it's weird because if I select text in the text editor so I 
can do a before and after, when I paste it here (KMail), it has all these extra 
carriage returns:

<
a
href="../photo/web/2003/10/31-ny-halloween-critical-mass-gathering-wheel-lights.jpg"><img
alt="NY Halloween Critical Mass" class="thumb" align="right"
src="../photo/web/2003/10/thumbs/31-ny-halloween-critical-mass-gathering-wheel-lights.jpg"
/></a>

But, if I manually transcribe what it looks like, in the Amaya text editor, before, it looks like:

<a href="../photo/web/2003/10/31-ny-halloween-critical-mass-gathering-wheel-lights.jpg"><img ...

and after the paste:
<ahref="../photo/web/2003/10/31-ny-halloween-critical-mass-gathering-wheel-lights.jpg"><img ...

However, oddly enough, I'm not able to reproduce *that* error in Amaya now. (Copy/paste has always 
been problematic for me, especially between Amaya and KDE applications. 
Somehow the copy/paste buffer gets confused... but it's always inconsistent so it's hard to
report a bug.)
