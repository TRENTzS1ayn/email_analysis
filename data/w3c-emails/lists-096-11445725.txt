the attachment is a simple doc with two forms.
Apparantly forms are block elements as they cant be
placed side by side (unless using a table or css positioning ;-]  )
Butwhat i am troubled with is that the gap between them is
different for each browser and not adjustable (nope margin will not do it)
amaya uses a very thin gap  while the other browsers use a size
that seems to be the font-size.  in fact if one sets the body font-size
big the gap changes.  the other browsers do not change the gap.  
but every one does it their own way ....   yet more problems
for the designer  who may just concede that flash is more consistent
and a better solution.  After all this time we are still in the cart and
horse era... --
