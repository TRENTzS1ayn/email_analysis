Using Windows 98 version
i File New Browsed and started a New.html document
then i changed title
then i called file exit 
THERE WAS NO PROMPT TO SAVE AN ALTERED FILE
it exited without saving any file !!!!
this is a nono for windows users who expect a prompt to save 
any changes on exit. this is one that should be fixed before actual
release !!! --
