Hi,

The current Amaya release procedure could be improved if deadlines for
contributions were stated somewhere. Amaya team should take into account
that the translation of messages and help files should be done after English
version is frozen. I suggest the following procedure:
Day 1: Pre-release. Announce the number of days for pre-release testing (a
week at least, say n1)
Day 1+n1: Pre-release testing ends.
Day 1+n1+1: English version freeze. Announce the number of days for
translation
(2 or 3 days, say n2)
Day 1+n2+1+n2: Translation freeze.
Day 1+n2+1+n2+1: Release.

Best regards,
