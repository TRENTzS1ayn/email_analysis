I just noticed that setting the background value to none does remove the url.
Although other browsers do this implicitly, they are probably incorrect as
a 'transparent' pattern should be able to have its underneath color changed
without turning off the pattern (amaya's no transparency is another issue).

I will alter my cascaded style to explicitely set background to none to shut
off the pattern ....  sorry  that is not really a bug 

but pleeeeese  fix the bold monoface spacing for the space char !!! --
