Many font sizes are not even close  12pt is very small and is
not 12/72 inch high. Pt measure is supposed to be absolute!
Other browsers manage this better.
72 pt is not even close -- it should be exactly 1 inch high. 
I used the standard font and applied font-size to successive 
span classes for the letter I ....   reveals much abt scaling algorithm!!!

maybe this can be fixed at same time as mono bold space char ;-] ;-] --
