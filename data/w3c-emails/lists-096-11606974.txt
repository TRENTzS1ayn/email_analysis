>From looking in the Fonts folder it seems that Amaya uses hard-coded
fonts instead of scalable ones ... and a limited choice of 3 families at that.
Is it not time to progress.  Other systems use scalable fonts.  Even if the
number of families does not increase, being able to replicate the final look
seems like an important factor in a VISUAL editor!
