Hi,

is it possible to set a preference for including the <?xml ...?> directive at
the start of XML documents? There are some browsers and other applications
that misinterpret it, and I believe that it is optional according to the XML
specification.

So if it were possible to leave it out, this wuld make it easier to work with
other (admmittedly badly implemented, but widespread) technology.

My specific problem is for php processing - the fact that Amaya allows me to
edit PHP documents is a great help, but at the moment I need to edit this
line in the source before finally saving :(

Cheers

Chaals
