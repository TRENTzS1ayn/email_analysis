Joseph,

Yes, Amaya ignores the spaces you mention, but I think it is right
in doing so. Quoting the HTML 4.01 specification:

In order to avoid problems with SGML line break rules and inconsistencies
among extant implementations, authors should not rely on user agents to
render white space immediately after a start tag or immediately before an
end tag. Thus, authors, and in particular authoring tools, should write:

  <P>We offer free <A>technical support</A> for subscribers.</P>

and not:

  <P>We offer free<A> technical support </A>for subscribers.</P>

Refer to the end of section 9.1:
  http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/text.html#whitespace

Vincent.
