Well, that just displaces the problem, as Amaya is the authoring tool 
that creates the text. In particular, it creates this HTML that it then 
ignores, when the <a> elements is within the <strong> element.

If I have this text, which works fine:

              <li>E38.2160 <a
                href="http://www.nyu.edu/projects/nissenbaum/courses_values_2003.html">Values
                Embodied in Info/Comm Technologies</a> LEC 3.0 Nissenbaum

and I select this takes and make it bold, it turns it into:

              <li><strong>E38.2160 </strong><a
                href="http://www.nyu.edu/projects/nissenbaum/courses_values_2003.html"><strong>Values
                Embodied in Info/Comm Technologies</strong></a><strong> LEC
                3.0 Nissenbaum</strong>

and the spaces in the above text are no longer rendered by Amaya -- though they are by other browsers.
