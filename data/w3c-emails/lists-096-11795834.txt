Hi,

I am testing the MathPlayer 2.0 beta (MathML Internet Explorer plug-in) from
Design Science . It does not render documents generated by Amaya, but if the
doctype declaration:

<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1 plus MathML 2.0//EN"
      "http://www.w3.org/TR/MathML2/dtd/xhtml-math11-f.dtd">

is changed to the following one:

<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1 plus MathML 2.0//EN"
      "http://www.w3.org/Math/DTD/mathml2/xhtml-math11-f.dtd">

the document is shown OK (Mozilla works OK with both declarations).

I can change the DOCTYPE in source view, but every time I edit the page,
Amaya changes the DOCTYPE.
Are both dtd the same or one of them is better than the other? Should Amaya
use the second dtd by default?

Best regards,
Bartolom? Sintes
