Hello,

I've just installed Amaya 8.2-1 on my Debian Woody workstation.

Nice evolutions like colored source editor, as I suggested to the team a while, but the browser is buggy when tables are present even simple ones : all text and pictures are shifted on left. I've tried it on several web pages.

So I downgraded Amaya to the 8.1b version.

Best regards,

Benjamin.
