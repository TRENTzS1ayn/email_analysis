Having studied Jukka Korpela's 1997 paper and also reviewed the April 2003 
discussion, which I must admit had not followed, I have come to the 
conclusion that, regardless of interpretation, Amaya does not handle SHY 
correctly.

This is not the time nor the place to reopen that discussion. However, 
taking a pragmatical view on this, Unicode 4.0 certainly defines SHY as a 
hyphenation hint and most web-browsers do the same [IE and Opera; 
Mozilla/Netscape suppress' the SHY and does not use it as a hyphenation point].

Correct or not, as a historical aside it might be interesting to know that 
my interpretation of SHY derives from the mid-1980s and the late Klaus 
Appel, sometime secretary of one of the ISO 8859 working groups and also a 
colleague of mine.

In defense of Amaya, it should be said that the original ISO 8859 
definition of SHY is obscure.

My reading of the the HTML 4.01 standard differs from yours and seems to 
support my interpretation of SHY:

"Those browsers that interpret soft hyphens must observe the following 
semantics: If a line is broken at a soft hyphen, a hyphen character must be 
displayed at the end of the first line. If a line is not broken at a soft 
hyphen, the user agent must not display a hyphen character."
