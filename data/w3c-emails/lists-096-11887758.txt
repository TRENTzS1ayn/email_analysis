The current solution, as it has been explained to me, or at least as I 
understand it, is:

It may not be possible to validate pages which contain multiple 
technologies.
so for instance SVG and html or svg and rdf or....
there may be exceptions.

I was advised to save svg as .svg rather than embed.
This seems to work well, however it degrades extremely poorly, no 
viewer no content.
This might be considered a user agent problem for the present.

It might be appropriate for you to provide links to svg content from 
xhtml pages
the svg specification chose this option, using png as an alternative, 
for example: http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/paths.html#PathData
For slightly complex or perhaps political reasons, the svg files don't 
validate, but this would be optional for you.
