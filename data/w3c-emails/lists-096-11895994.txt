Hello,

I work at the national kapodistrian university of Greece and have been trying to compile amaya for the past couple of days now, in order to extend it and use it in a project of ours. But there seems to be something wrong with the source. I think that the raptor files are not correctly included in the workspace, or in the libraptor project. I ve hit a wall in trying to compile this. Could you please help?

thanks for your time
Alex Banagos
