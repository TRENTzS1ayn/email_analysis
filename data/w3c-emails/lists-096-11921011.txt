But there seems to be something wrong with the source. I think that the raptor files are not correctly included in the workspace, or in the libraptor project. I ve hit a wall in trying to compile this. Could you please help?

I propose to add the libraptor dependency (in the Project menu) for the project amaya,
or to select the subproject libraptor and launch the build of that library by hand, then come back
to the amaya project.
