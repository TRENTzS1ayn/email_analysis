Hi

In Amaya 8.2 (Windows XP) if I insert a SVG element using the SVG palette
the document lost his doctype, and then the document does not validate.

a

>Normally it should work with the <object> tag.
If I insert a .svg file with the object tag, the image is shown in Amaya but
the source code is empty (<object></object> and when I save and reload the
document, the image is lost. But if I choose a .gif image instead of a .svg,
the
image is shown and saved. By the way, the object insertion dialog is the
same
than the image insertion dialog and it does not offer a *.svg filter.

>> Is there a solution to this problem?

>This solution should work with all browsers.
As I have explained, <object> seems not to work in Amaya 8.2 for Windows
XP. Can you check it?

Best regards,
