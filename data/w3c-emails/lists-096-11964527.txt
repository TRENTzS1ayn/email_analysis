You noted that the document should be XHTML 1.1 and not XHTML 1.0
transitional. Amaya doesn't do the change automatically if the initial document is 
not XHTML 1.1.
If you select the entry File/Modify doctype ... Set doctype to XHML 1.1 + MathML 2.0
you will add the doctype " XHTML 1.1 + MathML + SVG".
Hum, I agree it should be renamed to " XHTML 1.1 + MathML + SVG".

Okay, we'll fix these bugs
