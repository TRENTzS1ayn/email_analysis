Hi,

is there any way how to use BibTeX while writing an article in Amaya? I 
meant some program which would pick some tags (not sure, what they would 
be <a> directed towards some particular document?) and replace them with 
proper citations in the natbib style and create a list of references in 
the end of the document.

Thanks for any ideas,

Matej Cepl
