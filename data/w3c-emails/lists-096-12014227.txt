Well, that's not what I meant -- I thought more about some kind 
of BibTeX replacement which instead of LaTeX document worked 
with XHTML document, went through the document, picked up all 
references cited, get citations and references from BibTeX 
database, and put them back into the document. What bib2html 
does (and many other script of this kind) is that it goes 
through all BibTeX database and covert it to HTML page. I 
thought about something much more sophisticated. Oh well.

Thanks for the answer though,

Matej
