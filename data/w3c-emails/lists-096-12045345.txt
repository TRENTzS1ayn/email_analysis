Hi,

The CVS Amaya changes is showing improvements in table support. I would suggest the following improvement:
- colspan and rowspan support is now very annoying, because it breaks the tables layout. When a rowspan is applied to a cell, the cells under it should be deleted and their content merged. When a colspan is applied to a cell, the cells on the right should be deleted and their content merged.

By the way, if a column can be selected, will the <column> element be supported (not just created)?

Best regards,
Bartolom? Sintes
