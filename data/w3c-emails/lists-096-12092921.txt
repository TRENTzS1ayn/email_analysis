>> Hi folks,
>>
>> I am using Amaya again for a course on accessible design. And 8.2 has 
>> some
>> neat new features. But it meant I discovered a minor issue - the style
>> sheet
>> http://www.w3.org/Amaya/amaya.css includes the rule
>> h1 {font-size: 24pt; color: red}
>>
>> using pt as a measure breaks the WCAG checkpoint 3.4 -
>> http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/wai-pageauth.html#tech-relative-units
>>
>> Replacing the pt measure with em or % would be the best solution to 
>> this.
>>
>> (There is a problem that CSS defines pt as a relative measure, 
>> because it
>> depends on the user environment, but WCAG defines it as an absolute
>> measure because the user can't change it...)
>>
>> Also I noticed in the contributors list that you have Emmanuelle Guti 
>> - it
>> should be Emmanuelle Guti?rrez (or Guti?rrez y Restrepo). Some of the
>> translation was also done by the Sidar "traduce-amaya" group - Barto 
>> does
>> most of the work in that, but there are contributions from assorted 
>> other
>> people. We would love to be listed :-)
>>
>> cheers, and keep on with the good work.
