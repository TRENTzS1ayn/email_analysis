Hi folks,

having used Amaya 8.2 for a course recently (thanks - it makes teaching 
accessible web design much easier) I came across the following bugs:

The lang attribute not working. I would select an element or some text, 
select a language to apply (via the attribute menu), but it would often 
not put content into the attribute - i.e. end up with
     <span lang="">

I can't add a map element from the XHTML menu. I think I should be able 
to select a block of text and make it a map (in the same way as I can 
make a div). This is valid behaviour in HTML 4.01 and above (in HTML 
4.0 it either needs to be a set of area elements OR a block - since 
HTML 4.01 it can mix the two).

Cheers

Chaals
