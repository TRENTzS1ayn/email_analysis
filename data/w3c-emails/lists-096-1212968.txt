First Amaya Welcome Page Competition[4]

  Call for Participation

  Amaya[5] is a browser/authoring tool that allows you to publish documents
  on the Web. It is used to demonstrate and test many of the new
  developments in Web protocols and formats. Amaya is a complete web
  browsing and authoring environment and comes equipped with a WYSIWYG
  interface, similar to that of the most popular commercial browsers. With
  such an interface, users can easily generate HTML and XHTML pages, as
  well as CSS style sheets, MathML expressions, and SVG drawings. Amaya has
  also an advanced I18N and annotation support.

  The Amaya developers invite their user community to help design a new
  Welcome page (this is the default page that the Amaya browser displays
  when launched). The proposed page should not only showcase the different
  features that Amaya supports today, but also show how these features can
  be combined.

  The winner of the competion will be mentioned in the Amaya Welcome page.
  The winner can decide to forfait this right.

  The Amaya team reserves the right, after discussion with the authors, to
  modify the winning submission in the manner it feels fit to best suit its
  shipping inside Amaya.

  The competition begins on Decemberr 10, 2002 and ends on February 3, 2003.

  Submissions must be sent to www-amaya-contest@w3.org. Your submission
  must include a copy of the copyright waiver[6], duly completed, all
  related files (images, CSS stylesheets, ...), as well as an image
  capture. Incomplete entries won't be reviewed. Please indicate in the
  copyright waiver[7] if your submission can be made public or if it should
  be kept confidential.

  You may participate more than once. However, each submission must be sent
  in a separate message.

  Contest home page is available at http://www.w3.org/Amaya/contest.html[8]

  Rules

   *  It must be possible to display your submission with Amaya.
   *  A submitted page must use Markup when possible. Pages that are made
      of only a single bitmap image will be rejected.
   *  Try to combine all the possible Markup languages that Amaya knows
      how to handle today (XHTML, MathML, CSS, SVG, ...). (sample[9])
   *  The submitted page must be WAI[10] friendly.
   *  Submitted pages must be valid[11].
