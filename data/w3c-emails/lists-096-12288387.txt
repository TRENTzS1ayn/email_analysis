http://www.w3.org/2003/02/06-dom-support.html  checks 
the user agent and reports conformance with dom recommendations.

Amaya does not score well ;-[  ;-[  ;-[
A] This could be that the amaya agent message isnt being recognized.
   If so some coordination of Amaya group with DOM group could repair.
B] If Amaya really doesn't conform, then maybe here is another target 
   to shoot for [as well as SVG, MathML, and GUI repairs]. Boy there 
   is a lot on the plate for a half dozen workers eh... Got to liasson with
   universities where there are lots of lab rats [aka seniors/masters candidates]
