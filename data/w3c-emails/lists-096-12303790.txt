Well i have found a way that works but it aint pretty
by throwing a break element after the rule and  applying
a clear:left to the break,  the effect is the same as msie/opera
provides with a simple text-align:left  
i guess they are no longer following the mantra that code should 
be concise and readable ;-[ ;-[     soon only css specific editors
will be needed and no text-editors need apply. 

The attached file semos a simple list with a rule as a break
between items.  Rule is aligned to list as desired in msie/opera
using text-align property.   
However Amaya and mozilla style browsers continue to center align
so i can only assume that there is a more acceptable property for
aligning a rule...  i tried the float property but it fails to give a new line
for the next item so looks like cr**.    What is the magic decoder ring
setting for something that used to make sense....
