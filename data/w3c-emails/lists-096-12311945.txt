I have included an example of a simple list that uses
a rule to break the line items. This is occasionally needed
to maintain the item count while segregating items into minor divisions.

The approach uses CSS  float and clear properties and works well
in the mozilla/netscape group of browsers.  

Amaya does not display in the same way ...  which browser is correct if any??
and is there a more universal way ...

Opera and MSIE do not render well either.  Opera has another interpretation
and msie  wants one to use text-align   to move the rule to the left ;-] ;-] ;-]
    but it is a geezer browser, over two yrs since revision and pretty frail now.;-] 

I wonder if there is any universal way that respects css ????
