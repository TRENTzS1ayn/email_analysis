Thank you for the latest release. As usual it is a stepwise
refinement that clears many reported errors and is well 
documented as such.  This is the product of a very small
support team and they are working hard to make a 
conformant editor that also browses and is a testbed for
mathml, svg, cooperative development  and annotation...
a mighty big target...
Things that I noticed right away were 
1] better table rendering.
2] legends now position similar to other browsers.

Once again thank you ;-]  ;-]
