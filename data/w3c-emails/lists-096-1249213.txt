As part of my attempt to isolate problem  I tried using browse buttons
from within existing programs.
Using jigsaw's 'validate css by download'  browse button 
  --- fails to work but doesn't bomb program.
I can also confirm that cut/paste from the address bar does not work
in Windows 98 version.
Using my own forms tutorial  http://home.cogeco.ca/~ve3ll/htmlqwkf.htm#fi
the browse button fails to function.
testing both of above in msie 6.   obtained folders starting at Desktop
testing in netscape 4 obtained folders starting at !homepg  which is 
my shortcut 'start in' setting.......
so it may be how you are handling the initial start point.....   should
be from the start in setting.... that will avoid issues with drives/networking
etc.   //
