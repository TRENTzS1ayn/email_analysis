Hello, Amaya team,

Pages are being saved without a colon in the date/author or Id stamp, 
and thus the CVS keyword is not being substituted. Is this a CVS bug, 
an Amaya bug or something that needs to be fixed on the markup end?

For two examples, and I suspect there are many more on the w3.org site:
