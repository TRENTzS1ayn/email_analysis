I encountered the same issue on a Mandrake 9.0 installation

To fix this issue, I added -D_LIBC to the C_FLAGS in the Options file, which
removed the in-line redefinition.

A later mismatch of the exception specification on wcstok() I found simplest
to resolve by editing the source in .../thotlib/Unicode/ustring.c to add the
" throw ()" to the end of the definition that was there in the system
declaration.

There were also persistent warnings about the ordering of include
directories.

Dear Amaya team.
To build recent Amaya releases on my Redhat 7.3 stations has required 
compiling from the source distribution. I'va been able to do so 
successfully until version 8.3. But with version 8.4 the build fails 
during make. The preceding configure run reports no errors.
I attach the output from make.
Best regards
