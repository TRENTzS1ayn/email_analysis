Is the copyright waiver something that needs sent in via snail mail and 
if so, to what address?  Do you realize that the XSL stylesheet 
reference on the sample page is bad which may also reflect a bug in 
Amaya.  Also, the sample page is not validating.  How WAI-friendly do 
you want?  Priority 1, 2, or 3?
