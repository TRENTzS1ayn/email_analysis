We added some compiling flags because events are managed differently
on W98 and NT/XP/2000. So it's normal that the WinXP version doesn't work
on W98. But we detected no special difference concerning image management.
Image libraries are included in the Amaya package and it works on our Win98
platform.

Do you have VisualStudio available to trap the problem?
Did a previous Amaya version work on this box?
