While looking for ways to make a table a little more the way I want it, I was 
looking trough the amaya documentation on tables.

There (C:\Program Files\Amaya\doc\html\Tables.html) it nicely shows the way to 
work with tables in Amaya.

However, I wanted to know a little more about the values of the attributes that 
can be set on a table and what they should do. Since w3c is also the base of 
those definitions and such, I somehow expected a pointer to the table definition 
in the html or xhtml documentations.

Is it an idea to update the amaya documentation with pointers to the type 
definitions?

I know I might ask a lot but on the other hand, it shows the power of html and such.

For now, thanks for Amaya.
