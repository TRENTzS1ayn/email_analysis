I happily ran Amaya for W2K or NT in my W95 notebook for years, it 
worked fine. So I downloades only one version.
It's as of 8.3 that this problen started to show.

Yes I have VS, only I don't have C++ installed, I don't know how to use 
  it. I'm sorry I can't help as I'd like to.

Yes, many.

Maybe it's a problem with the Spanish version of Windows I use, and 
"JuanMiguel Signes" sounds like a Spanish name maybe close to my 
neighborhood.
Besides our's I don't see any more complains about this.
I run the English version of Amaya, no translation. I have yes the 
Spanish dictionary installed for spell checking but I don't use it.

I'll try to uninstall Amaya completely and reinstall 8.4 to see what 
happens (are there any registry keys I should delete to be completely 
clean?).
