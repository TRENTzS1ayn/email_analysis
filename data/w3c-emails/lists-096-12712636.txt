Hi,

Question:
Is the support of the white-space CSS property planned?

RFE:
The Amaya beaviour of deleting automatically multiple white-spaces is
sometimes annoying. For instance, when I want to copy word1 over word2,
 I would like to double-clik the word1, copy it, double-click te word2 and
paste, but Amaya deletes the space after the word2 and word1 is 
concatenated to the following word. I would prefer that multiple white-spaces 
were only deleted when the document is saved (with CSS white-space support,
of course :-).

Best regards,
Bartolom? Sintes
