I was opening with Amaya the attached document (index.html), hosted on IIS (Windows 2000 
professional) on the same computer and the application crashed with the messagebox shown in the 
attached image (amayabug.bmp) when I chose Edit/Transform (Ctrl t Ctrl x).

The release is Amaya 8.4 (14-Apr-2004) with dialog language set to 'it' in the general preferences..
The platform is Windows 2000 Professional SP4 (for client and server, as it's the same machine).
There were no critical or heavily demanding applications running at that time (an e-mail client and an 
Opera browser window).

Thanks for your kind attention

Luca Balbi
