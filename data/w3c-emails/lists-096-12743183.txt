I don't have development tools in that computer but the following may 
help your debugging:
- I've been using some previous versions of Amaya on that computer.
- I had the same problem after installing Amaya 8.4 W98 on a different 
directory to prevent bugs related to the spanish version.
- I reinstalled Amaya 8.3 and it works fine.
- I didn't mistook amaya-WinXP-8.4.exe for amaya-Win98-8.4.exe. By the 
way, their sizes only differ in 211K, much less than what it is 
announced on the amaya download page.

Saludos cordiales.
