Spellchecking with Amaya 8.4 NT build on Win XP Home, a search/skip started
before any of the following strings - assuming no intervening spelling
issues are detected - will cause the Amaya session to silently vanish

superhurricanes

supersymmetric

virtualization

underambitious

Given that previously the word "superintendent" caused such a crash, I
suspect that there must be something anomalous about the handling of the
"super-" prefix.
