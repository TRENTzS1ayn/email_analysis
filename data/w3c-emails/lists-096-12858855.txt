Dear Amaya team.

Upon the release of Amaya 8.4 I reported problems with the build on my 
Redhat 7.3 station. I was advised to add ' -D_LIBC'  to CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS 
in Options. So I did - but with no success.

Unfortunately I have no better luck with Amaya 8.5. I attach the output fra 
make done with Options patched as abobe described.

Any further advice how to complete my build?

Best regards
