Not a crash this time (yet) - but having previously observed unusual
behaviour in strings starting "super-" I tried the new build against the
unfair test string "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" as well as
regression cases (which passed as I expected).

Amaya 8.5 reports that it has no match for "supercalifragilisticexpialido"
and separately for "cious".  I spot a fixed length buffer (30 characters
including a nul?) being used rather than the check being made on a range of
references into the document.

Conversely I also spotted that if a word contains markup e.g.

compl<em>i</em>ment

that it is taken as separate strings delimited by the markup as well as the
surrounding whitespace, which is what I'd expect from a single reference
range check rather than through any assembly of the word into a separate
buffer.
