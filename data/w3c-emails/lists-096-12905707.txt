I have some strange display bug on my win xp (pro) machine:

    In the Special->Preferences->Color dialog, whatever I set the colors 
to, the displayed colors are totally warped. For example the 
<Amaya>\amaya\AmayaPage.html page, wich I have attached a screenshot of.

Before the screenshot was made, I uninstalled Amaya, removed both the 
remaining install dir and the user directory (c:\documents and 
settings\...\amaya), then installed again. No settings have I changed.

Thanks.
Thomas.
