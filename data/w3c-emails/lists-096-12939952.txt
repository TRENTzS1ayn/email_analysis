Implement it correctly.  Trying to accommodate bad practice won't promote
interoperability in the long run.  This bug effectively kills an attempt
to use the same style sheet with different rules for HTML and XHTML,
using different case for selectors.

Note that I'm only talking about XHTML/XML documents served as XML.
It's OK to treat selectors case-insensitively when an XHTML document
is served as 'text/html'.
