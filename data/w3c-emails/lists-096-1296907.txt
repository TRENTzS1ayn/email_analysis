No, you only need to save the file, fill it up, and then include this file 
in your submission. I added this info to the waiver.

Well, it wasn't a bug, because there is a comment on top of it telling
you where you can download it. It was done so that you could open the
local Amaya page without having to make a web request. I updated the
link as this page is on the server now.

I also fixed some broken links.

It's a problem with the validator and the Math entities.

Priority 1 is the minimum. I modified the CFP to say it.
