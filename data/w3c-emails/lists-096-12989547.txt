Hi,
     I have just - after a few old document cache hits on the way -
downloaded the gtk rpm version

amaya_gtk-8.5-1.i386.rpm

and freshened with rpm.

     Before (apparently) completing it reports

/bin/ln: `/usr/bin/amaya': File exists
execution of amaya_gtk-8.5-1 script failed, exit staus 1

     However, the new version seems to be running quite happily! Perhaps
there is a minor glitch somewhere?

                         Keith Hopper
