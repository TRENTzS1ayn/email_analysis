Hi folks,

I wonder if anyone out there uses Amaya for representing MathML, and has
thought about different ways to plot equations.

I am assuming that currently there is nothing that Amaya does, and that
people use other software if they want to do this, but I don't know what
software is available.

I am also intersted in what would be necessary to allow Amaya to do this. It
seems that using XSLT might permit manipulation of MathML to generate SVG. If
the transformation code could be told to use an XSLT transformation and not
just a T one, that would be one interesting way to do it. As far as I know,
the T language isn't really powerful enough to write transformations directly
- in particular I think that some arithmetic is necessary and I don't recall
there being enough in T to do that.

Interested in people's thoughts and experiences.

Cheers

Chaals
