Hello all,
I want to use Amaya, because it support MathML, in a Java application? I want 
to use it to show XHTML document (with MathML in) but I don't want open an 
Amaya window, I want able to show document in my application window without 
any Amaya's, I just want use the graphical motor for MathML and XHML.
Ymer.
