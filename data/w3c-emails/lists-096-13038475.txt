Hi

I don't know if it is just a problem or a bug.

Running amaya 8.5 (xp variant) on M$Windows2000. A document (forced to type 
html4 transitional) that ends in a table as the last element.

How to create a new paragraph (or any other element) after the table?

In the past, I expect repeated <ctrl-return> should finally get me there. 
However, it now just creates new paragraphs in the last cell.




CBee
