 XML Spy (Authoring Tool) can do this.

Q. I want to edit the XML file while seeing changes in the
Browser View, how can I do this?

A.  If you have an XSL stylesheet associated with your XML document,
you can display the browser view in a separate window by viewing the XML
file in the Browser View first and then choosing from the Browser menu the
"separate window" option.
This allows you to take a look at the document source in the Enhanced Grid
or Text Views and browser preview side-by-side, so that it can easily be
refreshed directly from the editing view (just hit F5 in the editing view
and
the browser view is automatically updated).


P.S. You do not need to invent XSL Trnsformation Engine. I think, it is
possible to introduce a "hook" to external XSLT engine from Amaya,
