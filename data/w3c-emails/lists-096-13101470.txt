It appears that there is not enough search pattern checking done
 before the replacement date is implied. 
Strings to be replaced are of the form: 
$date: some_date_format $
so a minimum check should be for the bracketing $ AND the
pseduo command date:  !!!  
That would have prevented accidental replacement where not intended.
It would also allow those who do use $ ..... $ for dates but not want
a replacement to use something like $creation_date: xx xx xx$
which would not fit the search pattern and thus not be changed. ;-] ;-]
