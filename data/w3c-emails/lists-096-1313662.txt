There is a transformation engine in Amaya already, using the T language.
Normally tht runs a transformation over part of a page, but I thought it was
also what is used to gather multiple documents into a single compiled
document via the make book function. If the API that this uses to get to the
content could be exposed in the form of an XML source fragment then it
shouold be possible to do transformations not only of a whole document via
XSLT, but also to use XSLT to extend the transform function (I believe more
people are now writing in XSLT than in T).

A really rough hack to apply XSLT would be to open the source view, select
all, copy, paste into a temporary document, apply the XSLT through a command
line tool, paste the output over the source, and synchronise. This could be
done using extrnal scripting, but it is hideously unpleasant to contemplate.
A little work might make it invisible to the user.

Of course finding someone with the time to do the work is another question...

cheers
