hangs Amaya on my Windows98 binary...

could someone find out what the problem is .... 
is it Amaya  or just a poorly designed site....

the strange thing is that they are actively promoting w3
access standards so you would think that they would be tweaking 
to the recommendations themselves ;-]  ;-]  ;-]

anyways  is it just very slow load / rendering  
or design   or  a bug in Amaya    ???????
