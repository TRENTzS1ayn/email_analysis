Laurent's comment on it happening in the images/white.gif  is correct
Commenting that file out makes everything look ok.

Apparently white.gif is a 1 pixel by 1 pixel by 256 colour  image ....
and the time taken to replicate it 850x600 times is swamping the 
image display utility.

Perhaps Carmen (the webmeister of bigmouthmedia) may
check out why either background:white   or an image file 
that is more appropriately sized was not used...  

And the Amaya group should check out why the image display
utility is slow to render.  I have noticed that sites with lots of
graphics cause slow rendering as well. This may be a good time
to work on that component.  Others seem to have no problems
with image display any more.....
