This SHGetFolderPath API is not easy to use for a developper (.h file not available).
But after a lot of work and experimentation, I finally found how to get the profiles directory.

I didn't work on this API yet.
It could help if you give me the name of the dll we have to load and how to find
or generate the .h file.

The print process is done by a dll. Does the issue concern the loading of
the print dll itself or how print accedes the printer?
