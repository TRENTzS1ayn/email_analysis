My system: linux-2.4.26, gcc-3.3

I tried to compile amaya-8.5 with:

--with-x --with-motif

and had to make some changes (see amaya-8.5.dif) to be successful.

Offering the file 'amaya.html' to amaya I found that amaya is
unable to handle CSS correctly.

- The 'margin-left'-handling is broken.

- The overlapping by means of 'margin-top' seems to be not in sync
  with the CSS-Specification. My (CSS2.1-)Version runs:

9.9 Layered presentation

9.9.1 (...)
      Each stacking context consists of the following stacking
      levels:

      1. the background and borders (...)
      2. upto 7. follows


I have added a small test file (amaya.html).

MOZILLA and OPERA handle these layers correctly. First the back-
grounds are handled: the background of box FIVE overlaps the
background of box FOUR. Then the contents are handled: the text
of box FIVE overlaps the text of box FOUR.

But amaya handles both background and text of box FOUR and then 
handles both background and text of box FIVE: thus the background 
of box FIVE hides the text of box FOUR.

The display of 'Help.Index' is broken.
