Hi -

I am building a site where I want the visited links to reset and become 
links again. In other words, I do not want my visited links to be dead 
for the rest of the visitors web experience. How is this done. (the 
site I am working on is www.sweetgrassfibers.com)

All my best,

Mekael 'Kale' Volimte
