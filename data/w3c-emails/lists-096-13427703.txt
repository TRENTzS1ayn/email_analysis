The keyboard shortcut "Alt =" to "Zoom in" does not seem work on a Swedish 
keyboard layout on an English Widows 2000 system. Since the "=" is located 
in the upper shift of the numeral "0" you have to do an "Alt Shift 0" which 
of course gives you the characters "0=" instead of the function "Zoom in".

It is probably possible for the customer to customise this to use another 
control sequence, but this should work right out of the box.
