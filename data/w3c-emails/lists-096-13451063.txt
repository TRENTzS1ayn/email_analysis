Hi,

First of all, thanks to the Amaya team for this new version.

I just gave a try to the new snapshot, with a special focus on
table stuff.

1) At first glance, I have noticed a weird bug. If I just
create a new XHTML 1.1 document, add a table and give it a
style="margin-left:20pt" and then a "width=100%", the bottom horizontal
line of the border will extend  far beyond to the right of the
right border. The same defect shows in a printout of the
document.
I use the GTK binary version in Linux Redhat 8.0. It did not happen with
GL version 8.2 on the same platform.

2) At start, I have been missing the "Enter key functionnality in tables
but I must acknowledge that the new interface offers more possiblities. As
matter of fact having *both features*, the "Enter" behaviour for the
regular table stuff and the new menus for special things would be make me
happy.

3) A more complicated document (I can send it off the list to anyone who
is interested in) fails now to print. The generated PostScript is wrong at
some point : an "ellipse" function (with a wrong number of arguments) is
called for a list bullet for particular item when the "cer" function is
called for all the other bullets !

Anyway, I think the layout problem is the most serious issue.

Thanks to the Amaya team for this new version.

Best regards

Serge Torres
