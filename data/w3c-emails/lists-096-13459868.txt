The visibility property is used to hide/unhide elements when
making dropdown menus.  Even though Amaya does not use
javascript, it can at least make these systems readable by 
implementing the visibility:hide  setting 
For example http://home.cogeco.ca/~cipher/cyhome.htm 
encorporates a dropdown menu.  one table presents a 
bar menu [of pages]. normally hovering would unhide another
table that presents topics on that particular page.  In Amaya
these dropdowns are PERMANENTLY VISIBLE.  If Amaya 
implemented HIDDEN, the dropdowns would not appear, leaving
an uncluttered screen with navigation bar to pages ....

Is implementation of visibility:hidden a possibility?
Can it be done for the next scheduled revision?
So far each revision has improved the look of my pages
in Amaya considerably. Not quite like any other browser yet
 but getting to the readable level now ... ta
