The default geometries for source and errors are not well 
chosen for 800x600 screens, especially in windows where
the taskbar wasn't allowed for and covers the bottom edge
Could the next version use smaller windows. It is much easier
to 'grab' an edge and move it on larger displays  then it is 
to move the window around to find edge, move edge and move
window again.... especially on bottom if titlebar is already at
top and taskbar covers botom edge....

What file contains the saved geometry so one can use
a sledgehammer when needed .... and is this easy to find
in help docs ???? --
