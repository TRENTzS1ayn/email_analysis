I guess the display is done too early when  the table formating is not complete yet.
I'll continue to work on this problem.

The "Enter" key functionnality in tables is still available, but you have to select the
cell (F2 or Esc keys let you do that selection) to create a new cell and its column, 
or a row to create a new row.
With the previous approach, it was impossible to create empty paragraphs
within a cell.

I'm interested, of course.
