* Summary of Amaya bug: (8.2+ WinXP)  Selecting "Lang" from the Attributes
menu does not insert the correct language codes (in fact it doesn't insert
any, as detailed below). Since correct language markup is a Priority 1
Accessibility checkpoint, it ought to be fixed.

Detail: The bug isn't new to 8.2+ (I noticed it in 8.2). Try the following:
select some text in a paragraph, open the Atrributes menu, select Lang,
choose a language (French, Spanish) and press Apply. Amaya inserts <span
xml:lang="" lang=""> ... </span> around the selected text in the source,
i.e., the lang attribute is set to "" (empty string) instead of inserting
the correct two-letter language code, "fr" or "es".
You can also try selecting a higher-level container element such as the <p>
element, using the F2 key. Apply the language attribute and you get <p
xml:lang="" lang=""> (empty again). Try selecting the entire html using the
F2 key and you get <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang=""
lang=""> .
