Would it be possible to get the rendering of Unicode characters
fixed in the Windows version? While references like &larr; (and &#x2190;)
are rendered correctly, references like &#x2500; are not rendered.
Inparticular I need to use the Box Drawing glyphs (x2550 - x257F). I've
tried various fonts (fonts.win) but nothing seems to work - do you have a
solution?

Thanks,
