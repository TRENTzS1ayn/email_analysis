the following doc has multiple ids with same identifier
but more important is the fact that a missing <tr> start tag
is not flagged as an error with html parser ....
the xhtml parser traps it as badly formed if it was 
defined as xhtml .... however i still have lots of html 
files that will not be switched over until the problems
of xhtml and javascript are ironed out ... right now 
there is a big misfit between the two....  --
