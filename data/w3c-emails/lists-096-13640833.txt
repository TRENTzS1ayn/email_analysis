Hi,

I have installed Amaya 8.2 on Mac OS X.3 using a new install of fink and
taking it from the unstable package list, with fink commander. In
general no problems, no need to touch the command line (except to type

  amaya &

at the end of the installation :-) and things seem fine.

But my bookmarks menu is inactive - and I can't find an explanation in the
documentation. My profile has the line

+bookmarks

in it (after &CreateRuby and before +davbase) and that was as far as I could
get in debugging. Any suggestions?

Cheers

Chaals
