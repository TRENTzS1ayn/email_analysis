A small bug in styling the form 'input' element occurs in Amaya.
This only occurs when the type is file!!!
When the width is set to a specific size, the input box is drawn to that
width, forgetting to deduct the space used by the button component.
Since the element contains both a box and a button, the TOTAL space
including space between box and button must be included in the 
calculation.  Once again this is only for the compound <input type="file>
tag .... 
But mozilla group does worse, they don't even try to use width measure
when type = file ;-[   ;-[  ;-[ 
Keep up the good work. Each version gets closer in following the CSS
styling rules.  Once nested box calcs get figured out, most pages will 
do ok. --
