Thanks for your message Dan,

I still have your previous problem in my bug list and I'm continuing to search 
it's source.
I presume you tried the config fonts file that Rigo sent you with the same 
result (crash). Did you try to start Amaya without the Amaya/config/fonts.unix 
and Amaya/config/fonts.unix.deb files ?

Regards

Laurent
