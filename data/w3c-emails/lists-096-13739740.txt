Dear Amaya,
I downloaded your program last night.
When I click on it, it opens. when I click on "Help", then Amaya a little page opens, I click "confirm", Nothing happens.
When I click the index , the index comes up but the subjects don't respond when I click on them.
When I click on subjects in the "help" list, pages come up with headings, but the headings do not respond when clicked on so I am not getting any help.
Did I need to download something else/ I downloaded 
amaya-WinXP8.2+.exe and am running Windows XP on my computer.
Thanks, Nora
