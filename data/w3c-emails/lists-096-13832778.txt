Hello

In my experience more and  more universities offer online tutorial via
email. Especially   science faculties  would  need a  mail  tool which
allows to edit and display math. Mozilla supports  mathml to a certain
extend, but does not include a math editor in its mail program.

Amaya has  an excellent matheditor but no   mail program included, are
there any  plans to do  so in the  future, maybe include some existing
mail programs.


Thanks and regards


Uwe Brauer
