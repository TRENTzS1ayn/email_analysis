I'm running Amaya 8.2 under Windows XP.  Trying to load the attached
"bad.htm" file (using File -> Open document...) causes the send error report
dialog to open with this summary:

AppName: amaya.exe AppVer: 8.2.0.0 ModName: ntdll.dll
ModVer: 5.1.2600.1217 Offset: 000083a1

For comparison, the attached "good.htm" loads without a problem (the two
differ in that good.htm has attributes on the html tag).

I know bad.htm is invalid, but presumably it should not crash Amaya.
