Sometimes when I've been editing alot in the source view and have had 
some ill-formed xhtml, the main wysiwyg window gets locked as if a modal 
dialog was visible, it's just that there is none, and I have to 
ctrl-alt-delete to shut down the process.

I have v8.2+ and windows XP pro on a pentiumII 400mhz.
