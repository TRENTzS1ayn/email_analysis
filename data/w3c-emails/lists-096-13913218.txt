As in the attached image the button with the signaled word is overlain by
the possible selections list.

This happens on WinXP Home at 1024x768 but not on 2k server or XP Pro at
1600x1200 (quoting screen resolutions because that seems to be the only
thing that seems likely to make some impact - I've not tried the experiment
with altered resolutions) with any of the 8.x versions.  The screenshot was
taken while using 8.2+ on the XP home box.
