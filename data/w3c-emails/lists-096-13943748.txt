Hi All,

I am doing a ontology annotation project and just found out Amaya and 
Annotea. Could you please allow me to ask some questions about it:

    1. When I try to post some annotation to server, it always says "failed 
to post the     annotation: cannot contact server". And the server I am 
using is "http://annotest.w3.org/annotations". Could you please tell me 
what is the problem?

    2. Can Amaya and Annotea support OWL and DAML file? From the 
introduction I can just know it support RDF file.

Thank you so much,

Best Regards,
