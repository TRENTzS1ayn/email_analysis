Release number : 8.2+ GTK
Platform : Linux Debian 3.0r1 Woody GTK

Description of the bug:

There is a printing bug occuring with the US Letter Portrait format (8
1/2 inches x 11 inches).  Approximately 2,7cm (~1 inch) of the top
printed page is wasted in a white (blank) margin.  Trying different CSS
"margin-top" or "padding-top" settings does not change anything.

That problem does NOT occur in A4 Portrait format printing.

The bug is easy to reproduce, just print to a ps file and check the 
result with ghostscript. Feel free to ask me any precision about that 
bug behavior, I'd be glad to help.

N.B. It's the second time I post about that bug (last time in july 2003) 
but it's recurrent. Irene gave me that answer the first time :

"I cannot test this format. I could try to reduce the wasted top margin, 
but the best should be to make a test after the change.
Could someone, able to compile Amaya, adjust and test values defined in 
the presentation schema Amaya/amaya/HTMLP.P?

#ifdef US_PAPER
#ifdef LANDSCAPE
         Width: 23.8 cm;
         Height: 18.2 cm;
         VertPos: Top = Enclosing . Top + 0.8 cm;
         HorizPos: Left = Enclosing . Left + 2.7 cm;
#else { LANDSCAPE }
         Width: 16.2 cm;
         Height: 23.8 cm;
         VertPos: Top = Enclosing . Top + 0.8 cm;
         HorizPos: Left = Enclosing . Left + 2.7 cm;
#endif { LANDSCAPE }
#else { US_PAPER }
....."

Wish I could test this but I don't know much about compiling (I'm a 
Amaya user, not much of a hacker :-)
