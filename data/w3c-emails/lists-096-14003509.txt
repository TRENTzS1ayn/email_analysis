  Hello,

 I?m using Windows 2000 (SP3)

 I?ve tried the four versions available:
Snapshot 8.2+ (Windows NT/2000/XP) (get by http)
Snapshot 8.2+ (Windows NT/2000/XP) (get by ftp)
Release 8.2 (Windows NT/2000/XP) (get by http)
Release 8.2 (Windows NT/2000/XP) (get by ftp)
 I?ve also tried  
Release 8.2 (Windows 98/ME) (get by http)
Release 8.2 (Windows 98/ME) (get by ftp)

 I?ve uninstalled every time, before re-installing.

 Always to the same results, a dialog box:
Title: ?Error?
Message: ?Indent?
Button(s): ?OK?

 None of the six installers gave any errors, so a
corrupted download, as Irene suggested
(http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-amaya/2003OctDec/0163.html),
is excluded.

 Trying to find out from where the problem comes, I?ve
also tried:
?amaya-WinNT-8.0.exe?
?amaya-WinNT-6.0.exe?
?amaya-WinNT-7.0.exe?
?amaya-WinNT-7.2a.exe?
?amaya-WinNT-8.0-pre.exe?

 ?amaya-WinNT-8.0.exe? gives the same results ... But
the ?amaya-WinNT-6.0.exe? up to the
?amaya-WinNT-8.0-pre.exe? ... are working ... at least
from this point of view.

 Two reasons for this problem come to my mind:

  1. Something (very important) changed between the
8.0-pre and 8.0 version.
  2. Something (also very important) changed in
Service Pack 3 (Windows 2000), which is (more or less)
considered as the equivalent of Service Pack 1
(Windows XP). Maybe Mark Daly (from the pre-cited
post) could confirm if he is running on Windows XP
(SP1).

 One, or both of them ? could be the cause of this
problem.

 Greetings. Looking forward to test this 8.0-pre
version I?ve got ... :)

 On a side note: the installer/uninstaller from
?Snapshot 8.2+? fails for an unknown reason to delete
the folder where Amaya was installed (no files are
present in this folder).
