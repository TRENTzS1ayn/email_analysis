8.3- is looking good.

The few things that I find to be the most significant - but still minor -
niggles with Amaya are now down to

- Text comes out quite small by default (on Windows at least) 

Just create a new document and put some text into it - the
Special>Preferences>General Font Zoom property has to be set to about 140 to
match Mozilla's Text Zoom of 100% or the default text size in IE

- Spell checker doesn't understand English word endings (the little
inflection we do have)

The -n't -'d -'ll and -'ve contraction suffixes in English baffle it
(checking this text it'd tell me that "doesn" is not a word); and doesn't
have any pluralisation rules (e.g. it has "indigent" but faults
"indigents").  That I have to teach it English as opposed to the USAn
variant is something I expect, but those things are at least common.
