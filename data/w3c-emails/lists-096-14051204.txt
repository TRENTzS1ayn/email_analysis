Amaya Developers:

In the midst of all the early reports on bugs in the new version, let me 
simply say that upon installing this version I immediately saw fixes for 
two problems that I often had encountered. That's great! Progress is a 
wonderful thing.

Let me also say that I truly enjoy using this program. It meets a need 
for me that no other program does, and at a very good price.
