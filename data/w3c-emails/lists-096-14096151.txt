  I've tried your suggestion ... and it did work ...
Thanks.

  Unfortunately, I can't tell if that was the thing
that solved the problem, since un-installing/deleting
the $AMAYA_USER_HOME variable/restarting/re-installing
... didn't bring back the old behavior (the Indent
error).

  So, I currently have the 8.3+ version (without the
$AMAYA_USER_HOME variable set) and with the conditions
described below.

  The concatenation of $HOMEDRIVE and $HOMEPATH was
pointing (and still does points) to a read-only
directory (which I use for storing important files
that I don't want being modified).

  Even if I'm still not sure which was the solution
for this problem (your suggestion or the installation
of version 8.3+ after 8.0-pre) ... I hope this could
help others, which will encounter the same problem.

 Thanks for your prompt response...

 Regards
