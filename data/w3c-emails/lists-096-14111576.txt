First, I love this program, use it every day, and hope to continue doing 
so for the foreseeable future. It simple meets my web page content 
development needs better than any other piece of software I've tried 
(and I've tried most of them). Yet, there are, of course, some problems 
that I keep noticing. Many are small matters. But...here are some of them:

1. I can move the text insertion point rapidly to the Left, skipping 
form the beginning of a word to the beginning of the word immediately 
previous, by using the [Ctrl] + [LeftArrow] keyboard shortcut. But if I 
try to go to the Right, using [Ctrl] + [RightArrow], the insertion point 
locks up and won't move. I can get it moving by using [Ctrl] + [Shift] + 
[RightArrow]--but that invokes a selection functionality, not mere 
cursor movement. This annoys me every time I use the program. The sort 
of insertion point behavior I'm expecting is simply a convention for 
text processing software. My text editor (jEdit) does this, as has all 
text editors I've ever used. All my email composition software does 
this. Dreamweaver does this. MS Word does this. Amaya does not. Why not? 
This is a BASIC functionality, and it doesn't seem to work well enough 
at this point.

2. If I want to call up program Help information, on most programs, I 
need only press the [F1] key. This, too, is a widely respected 
convention. But not in Amaya, which simply makes me work harder, as a 
user, and that's never a good thing. This is especially so when what I 
have to do is abandon keyboard control of the program and reach for the 
mouse - virtually never a quick solution to anything. Why is not this 
convention respected in Amaya?

3. There are many informational dialog windows, such as the program 
"Help > About" dialog, which accept no user input, but have a "Confirm" 
button in them which must be pressed to make the dialog vanish. Confirm 
WHAT? If there's no input, there's nothing to confirm. It seems to me 
that the button would be correctly labeled if it said "Close". And this 
is not the only place this anomaly appears in the program.

4. In the above mentioned "Help > About" dialog window, when the program 
version is identified, IT IS IDENTIFIED INCORRECTLY. Ouch! I couldn't 
believe it. I happen to know that I'm running "Amaya 8.3 pre-release" 
version. The About window really ought to confirm that, don't you think?

OK, now I'm really out of time. I do want to reaffirm that I do much 
like the improvements I see in this version. If just one of my 
complaints is attended to, I would wish it to be #1 above. That problem 
just makes NO sense.
