When spell-checking text, I cannot get the "Skip (+ dic)" button to do 
anything but skip a targetted word. There appears to be no way to update 
the dictionary with words the program user gets to choose--this button 
is labled as if it will do that update, but in fact does not. This makes 
the spell checker tedious to use.

There also needs to be a "Skip all" function, to augment the 
"Search/Skip" button, I think.
