Hi

Today I have updated the Spanish translation of Amaya help and message files
and I have sent them for comments to other Spanish translators (Emmanuelle 
Gutierrez, etc). What is the deadline for sending you the files?

By the way, every time I update Amaya using CVS, I get some directories that 
seem to be useless and I have to delete them each time. Can you delete them 
from CVS?
