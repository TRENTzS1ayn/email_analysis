When building with the spec file that's shipped with the package, the
compiler bailed with a long list of "could not find" errors relating to
the internal graphics files.

I'm in the process of building again, after adding a --with-gtk to the
configure command in the spec file. If this works, I'll have RedHat 7.2
source and binary RPMs available for anyone who wants them.
