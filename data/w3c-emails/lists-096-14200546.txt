The ESSTIX fonts distributed with Amaya are a pre-cursor to the real
STIX fonts.
Are there any plans to migrate to the STIX font distribution, and is
anyone actively
looking at this or working with the STIX fonts project?
 
The STIX fonts project page shows over 6,000 glyphs - 4,000 of which
appear
to have been added since the ESSTIX font was donated to the project.
 
If anyone has any updates on the STIX project or experience with how
well the existing ESSTIX font covers Math, Chemistry and Physics
disciplines
- I would welcome the information.
 
Regards,
Chris
