OS:    Windows 2000 Service Pack 4
Amaya: The "normal" version (not the OpenGL version)

Graphics card: ATI Radeon 7000
Monitor:       NEC AccuSync LCD 71VM
Resolution:    1280x1024
Color depth:   16 bit

BTW: I recently changed my monitor.
Before this I was using a CRT at a resolution of 1024x768.
It seems like Amaya worked on my old monitor but does not on the new 
one.
Could that be? (Sounds strange to me.)
