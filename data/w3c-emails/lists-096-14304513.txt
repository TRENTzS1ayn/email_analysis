It could be a problem with images, because Amaya has to manage directly 
the image rendering, but not for the text (the text is managed thru standard
Win32 primitives).
We had and solved a problem with screens which are declared 16 bit depth but 
actually are 15 bit depth.

Could you try to configure differently your display (in 24 or 32 bits)?
