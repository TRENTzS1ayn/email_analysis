To:www-amaya@w3.org


using win98 o/s and 800x640 rez

the included file calls the validator at w3.org which uses a 
technique to learn the page that called it and then pass that info
to the cgi script.  This works in other browsers as long as the 
demo page is on the internet (not a local copy)
However w3.org cant get info from Amaya browser .... 
is this an http protocol problem ???

<h1>W3.org Validating By Referral Mechanism</h1>
<p>Amaya 8.3 does not send info that w3.org referringmechanism needs.
Place this document on-line and use Amaya and other browsers to note
that Amaya doesnt provide page info needed while other browsers do.
I am unsure of what the cause is !!!</p>
