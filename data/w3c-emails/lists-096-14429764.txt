Yes other browsers send the referer information (the URL of the 
page that includes the link) with the Get request.
In this case it could be useful, but there are also commercial
use of this information. 
Amaya doesn't send it by default, but it should be sent if you
change the value in the thot.rc file.
SEND_REFERER=yes
