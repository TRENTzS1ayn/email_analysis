It depends of the locale, but you can also control the output format
with a Amaya configuration variable.
There is not a menu entry in the current version to change this variable, but
you can set it in your $AmayaHome\thot.rc file.

ISO_DATE=Yes (default value) generates "%A %d %B %Y - %H:%M:%S"
  %A = The full weekday name according to the current locale.
  %d = The day of the month as a decimal number (range 01 to 31).
  %B = The full month name according to the current locale.
  %Y = The year as a decimal number including the century.
  %H = The hour as a decimal number using a 24-hour clock (range 00 to 23).
  %M = The minute as a decimal number (range 00 to 59).
  %S = The second as a decimal number (range 00 to 61).

ISO_DATE=No generates "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"
  %Y = The year as a decimal number including the century.
  %m = The month as a decimal number (range 01 to 12).
  %d = The day of the month as a decimal number (range 01 to 31).
  %H = The hour as a decimal number using a 24-hour clock (range 00 to 23).
  %M = The minute as a decimal number (range 00 to 59).
  %S = The second as a decimal number (range 00 to 61).
Did you suggest to change this second format?

That's a good idea.
