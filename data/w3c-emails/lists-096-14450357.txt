Thanks for your prompt reply on the 'refere' issue.  Thot.rc was
modified and works as you say...
Another user also had a question that could be solved by 
modifying thot.rc as well.
I searched thru the Help file and could not find anything on
parameters and usage of this file. I looked thru the online 
documents and they seemed to be more for those who are
using a compiler to extend or modify their version of Amaya.

What is needed is a new help file or even a simple readme.txt
for the thot.rc file that lists each parameter, its meaning or usage,
and the acceptable values that it can take.  A short document that
could be included in the distribution and  referenced and pointed to
by the existing help doc (including index). 

Some of the thot settings are GUI acessible but this probably is
not required for all settings. The document should point out which
parameters could be overwritten by gui .... 

And i have a win-thot.rc file in /config. Does this need fixing too ???
