Hi Irene,

Thanks for the quick update. The ISO setting took care of it. By the way, in
the Windows install the config file is named win-thot.rc. Not sure why it's
a different name from the other OS installs.

Thanks, also, for all your--and the Amaya team's--efforts. At some point I
hope to contribute more than bug reports!
