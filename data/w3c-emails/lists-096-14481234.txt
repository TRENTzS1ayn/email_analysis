Our plan is to provide menu entries to change a large set of options.
But a new Amaya GUI is in progress, and we hesitate to add new options

The win-thot.rc file defines default settings for Windows platforms and 
unix-thot.rcdefines default settings for Unix platforms. These files can
change with each Amaya version. It's not the case of the user's thot.rc file.
