My environment is Amaya 8.3 and Windows 98:
A] Ctrl-F [Search/Replace] works for me
Check to make sure you are in EDIT mode.  When edit mode
was turned off, i could duplicate your result

B] Ctrl-Shift-Right Arrow selects TWO words at a time !!!
but Ctrl-Shift-Left Arrow selected only one word ....  
but this operation still needs repair !!!


Two problems, working in a text file:

1. I'm having no luck at all with the [Ctrl] + F search-and-replace 
function. It just never works, period. Strange.

2. Selecting words in a line, using [Ctrl]+[Shift]+{[LeftArrow] or 
[RightArrow]}, I find that the "...+[RightArrow] function initial 
selects TWO words instead of one. One then has to do a [LeftArrow] to 
get the cursor where it should be in the first place.

I'm working on a WinXP machine.
