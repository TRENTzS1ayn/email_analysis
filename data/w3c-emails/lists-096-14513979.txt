Hi,

I've just upgraded to Amaya 8.3 and the improvements are such that I no 
longer know how to end a table and insert a paragraph between the table 
and the next element or end of document. If there is already a paragraph 
(or any of a number of other element types) there then there is no 
problem, but if the table is immediately followed by </body> or </hr> 
then I need to do something complicated like edit the source.

What I used to do was repeatedly hit return but this just inserts new 
paragraphs into the current cell.

TIA,

Jim Wright
