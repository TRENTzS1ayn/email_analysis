Hi again,
I have been using amaya to edit CSS for a while now and have always had 
this problem.

When I save the css document the editor scrolls to the top of the 
document, which makes me have to scroll back down a couple of pages 
after I've looked at any changes in the webpage, to return to where I 
was editing in the css file.
This happens whenever I'm editing a css which is long enough to be 
scrollable across about 2 or more pages.

I'm currently using Amaya 8.3 for Windows Xp, however I  remember this 
artifact from  8.2 as well.

Thomas.
