When you save the CSS file, Amaya reparses this CSS file and recomputes
the CSS cascade for all open documents that link this CSS.
This explains why other documents are reformatted and redisplayed.
Why Amaya should do is to register the current position of the displayed
document and to scroll automatically to that position when the document
is redisplayed.
