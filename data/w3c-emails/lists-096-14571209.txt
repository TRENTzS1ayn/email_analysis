Yes, I think this is a good idea. That happens when I hit the Reload button.

Oh, and I also have this suggestion:
It seems hitting the Reload button causes the css editor to:
  1. Reload the document (obviously ;)
  2. Colorize any new /**/ comments.
  3. Scroll to the position where I was editing.

I think that it would be great if points 2 and three would happen also 
when I save it!

Another suggestion (this is a quite luxurious dream-feature ;):
It would be really cool to be able to 'Contract' and 'Expand' multi-line 
style definitions in the CSS editor, kind of the thing Mozilla does with 
XML documents and some code editors can do with, for example, different 
methods.

Illustration:

- div.VMenu A {
    Color: Black;
    Background-color: White;
  }

Would when i click the Minus become (perhaps with an alternate color for 
easy spotting):

+ div.VMenu A

Note: This would only be a visual presentation and should not alter the 
document buffer.

Also (this is the last one, promise ;):
Wouldn't it be great to have the Tab key add, say, two spaces right 
before the current insertion point (when editing Source code of 
Webdocuments and CSS) ?

Regards
    Thomas.
