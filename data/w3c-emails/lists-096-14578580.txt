Since installing Amaya v. 8.3 I have been unable to start it either from 
the Windows start menu or from the icon in the Amaya Bin folder, but when 
I try to delete it and reinstall the delete is rejected because access is 
denied as the programme is running. Things were fine up to v. 8.3-.

I have Windows 2000 Pro and the display setiings are 1162 x 864 pixels and 
24 bit colour.
