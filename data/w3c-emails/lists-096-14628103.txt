Greetings,
     I am sure that I am not the only Amaya user who works behind a secure
proxy server. I seem to remember that in a much earlier version Amaya would
give me a proxy login prompt and then serve files.

     I haven't actually tried this for a long time, but today using 8.3
under linux there is merely the flicker of a 'Cannot load' message even
though I have configured the proxy as required.

     Has anyone any idea what may be going wrong?

                         Keith

PS   As a matter of interest could Amaya not automatically pick up the
proxy settings from something like /etc/wgetrc ??
