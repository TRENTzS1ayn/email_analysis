Following the definition of url-s or uri-s, you should be able to put the 
account info in there:

http://username@proxyserver:port/ (this hould ask for a password if needed)
http://usernname:password@proxyserver:port/ (sends password raw...)

I expect amaya to accept urls in this form and pass them on as needed.

Basic security tells me that the password is send raw over the network hence a 
potential seciruty risc. However, since it is only from the machine to the proxy 
server and not over a public network (that is only at the other side of the 
proxy server). And in most (larger) local networks are switched and somehow 
controlled, I considder it as a not so potential risc.
