Having to understand that Amaya has some interenal mechanism for colouring
source code that breaks its ability to search across colours is not very
intuitive for users. I think a much better solution is to change the search
algorithm so it can search across element boundaries and find text as
it is rendered in a particular view.

just my personal opinion
