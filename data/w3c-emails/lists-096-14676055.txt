From both the Unicode character map, gucharmap, that
comes with GNOME and Umap
<http://umap.sourceforge.net/>, I can paste Latin
characters like an accented "e" (what &eacute;
represents), but not em-dashes (what &mdash;
represents) or ellipses (what &hellip; represents).
Gucharmap produces a semi-useful result by, for
example, pasting the string "\x{2014}" instead of an
em-dash, but attempting to paste from Umap into Amaya
yields nothing at all.

This is with Amaya 8.3, the GTK+ build.
