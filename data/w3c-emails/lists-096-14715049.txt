It would help reviewers if there were lists of unimplemented html attributes
and css1 and css2 properties.  That way only bugs in implemented stuff
need to be reported and unimplemented items could maybe be listed with
priority of implemention!   With the recommendations rapidly moving ahead,
it is helpful to know how the project is moving.  I think right now the 
development group is focusing on the GUI metaphor and that is important!
But bug repair of the underlying rendering engine is also very important...
No need on banging out a dent in the fender or giving the auto a new 
paint job  if the engine is missing on one cylinder or transmission is whining!!!
