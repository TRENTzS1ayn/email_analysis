I know that the Amaya group is working on the GUI to solve 
big issues like font setting and using fonts already installed on
clients system   and better toolbars for MathML 

But I see a few big holes in rendering with CSS  
1] list-styles  --- lists are a very common structure in documents and
     numbering styles as well as image bullets are very important.
2] background - fixed images 
3] positioning .... even the w3.org styling page uses a menu system [badly] 
that is based on css rather than javascript.   this page does not render well
in amaya.....  
I realize that each of these holes requires lots of work to implement but am
stating my priority in what should come next.  I invite others to comment on these
and make their own requests.  That way the workers can pencil in a development
roadmap ...
