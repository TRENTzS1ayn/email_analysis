     I see a few more holes in SVG support. I have many files like the
attached (zipped file) which Amaya 8.3 reads, mentions some style
properties not supported - and then leaves a blank screen!

     This situation is improved, since previous Amaya versions struggled
for a long time and resulted in a coloured screen - but no image!
