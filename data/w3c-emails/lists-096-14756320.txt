The Amaya GL version handles transformations and so doesn't display a
blank screen. But yes, Amaya is not a complete graphics tool and doesn't support 
100% of SVG.

Without any additional manpower, we could not make Amaya a complete SVG tool.
A possible short term objective would be to provide a good support for a subset of 
SVG (needed for technical documentation).
