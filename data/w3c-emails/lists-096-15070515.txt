I've been thinking that annotation is but a special case of metadata.  Just
another object containing data that describe an object.  If we were to wave a
magic wand to whisk away the problems of addressing annotations to a version
and/or partial-object (byte ranges, etc), an annotation server could use the
same interface to list annotations as it would for more general forms of
metadata on objects it served.
