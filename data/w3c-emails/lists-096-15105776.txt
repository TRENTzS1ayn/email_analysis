Jacob,

Just a caution....instead of getting in to the negative cycle of definitions
why don't you propose what you want to work on. The working groups were
setup not as debating circles, but to see if we could do some "work" together. 

So, want to propose a definition for annotation (or whatever it is you want
to work on) that you like and talk about reference implementations, and how
to get there. Go ahead, make my day...
