Leslie,

You raise a very interesting point:

We're doing some work that might help for this problem, at least within the
context of a single group.  We're developing support for a notification
system based on the Athena Zephyr system.  Basically for our purposes this
support multicasting lightweight notices within a cell/realm/<whatever>.
So far we've integrated it with our Mediator system for controlling and
tracking access to a group's shared web space.  I hope to be able to
integrate it with our group annotation system sometime in the future; then
we should be able to provide notification in both directions--writer's of
annotations can be notified if the annotated document changes and document
owners/authors can be notified if their document is annotated.
