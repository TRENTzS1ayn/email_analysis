An annotation system does not need a large central data base.

The main principle should be that annotations are stored close to the
server which stores the annotated message. It is possible to design
an algorithm for finding the closest annotation site as follows:

If you want to annotate a document stored at www.foo.bar.net,
then first check if www.foo.bar.net has an annotation server. If so,
store it there. If www.foo.bar.net does not have any annotation
server, check if foo.bar.net has one, and store it there. If
foo.bar.net has no annotation server, check for a server at bar.net.

In the beginning, when annotations are little used, many annotation
will end up in the central servers at "net" and "bar.net" in my
example. But as annotations get more widespread, more sites will
run their own local annotation server.

It is important to design the naming scheme for annotations, so that
an annotation originally stored at for example "net" or "bar.net"
can be moved to "foo.bar.net" when foo.bar.net gets its own
annotation server, without having to change the name of the
annotation.
