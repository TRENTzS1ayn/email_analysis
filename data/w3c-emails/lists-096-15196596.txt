I like the idea of splitting reponsibility by url.

I'm curious about a couple of things: 
- What would motivate sites to allocate resources for hosting their own
comments, given that they'd know that if they didn't, someone else would
pick up the slack for them? 
- If lots of sites (even a sizable minority) chose not to host their own
comments, how would the central servers (.net, .com, etc..) get funded?

Thanks. Exactly my point.

Hmm. I think Jacob's got a pretty good answer on how to find the separate
server. In principle, the system could easily be refined further, with a
single site taking care of a*.com, another for b*.com, and so on. 

Seems to me that the real problem in the kind of system that both Jacob and
I are describing (ie- one where you can see _all_ the comments related to
_any_ page on the web, versus one where you only see comments in the sets
you're subscribed to) is that you're talking about a lot of storage, and a
lot of requests. You can propose a system with multiple servers (as Jacob
does), but that might just distribute the problem more broadly rather than
solving it.

Say the databases were centralized but independent of the servers being
commented upon. Would it be possible for the comments to be encrypted so
that the system administrators couldn't alter or remove individual posts?
(This isn't a rhetorical question- I'm not as familiar with security as I'd
like, and would be curious as to what headaches this would create).

Agreed.

That's why I think the really critical and interesting part of designing a
universal-comments system is figuring out how to create motivations
(financial or otherwise) for comment-hosts. My paper touches that issue- I
plan to develop it  more.

has to be?
