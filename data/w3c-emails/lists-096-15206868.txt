Do I understand that the intention is to allow anoyone to create
annotations on any web document, and that these annotations will
then be visible to anyone who looks at the web document?

Can this be implemented without support from the web server for
the document being annotated?

One might also allow the author of a web page the right to put
some meta-information into the head of his/her web page,
specifying that public annotations are not allowed on that web
page? In the Web4groups project, we plan to allow the authors
of pages control of whether discussions are allowed or not on
their papers.
