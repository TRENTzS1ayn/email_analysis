Jacob:

I honestly do not think that there is any way to "force" people
to view public annotations.  Either the content provider (i.e the
web server) has to agree to participate or the content reader
(i.e. the web browser) has to explicitly do something to solicit
the annotations.

Yes.  An exmample of a related technology is PICS, the technology
that allows an independent rating service to provide ratings
(e.g. P, PG, R, X, etc.) to web documents without requring any
cooperation from the web server.

For your system, it is your choice.  Other people think that it
is imperitive that author's not be given the choice of disallowing
public annotations.  A range of choices is available here.

Let me reiterate that given the current web architecture,
there is no way to force the viewing of public annotations;
some sort of content providor or content reader action is required
to make them viewable.
