I might be suggesting something like this usenet idea (if I understand
you) in

  http://union.ncsa.uiuc.edu/~liberte/www/scalable-annotations.html 

Here is what it said:

In this you say:

"" Issues of annotation are being discussed by the Annotation Working
"" Group of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).  The focus of the group
"" now seems to be firmly placed on providing distributed working groups
"" tools through which to use the Web for collaboration- a notion called
"" "annotation sets" would provide small-to-medium sized groups with
"" tools for sharing web annotations. The system being discussed doesn't
"" preclude the possibility of a universally commentable Web, but the
"" group generally views the possibility as a special case which should

"" their published literature is found in the backlinks scenario, which

"" the system's design.

This might be a misunderstanding.  I don't remember anyone saying that
a universally commentable web should not be given a high priority.  I
think it is probably the opposite.  On the other hand, your solutions
to universal commentability seem to tend toward gargantuan,
centralized services, and it is those we considered not a high
priority.  Distributing the annotation services has been our general
approach.

I'm not clear on what the legal issues are, and they probably vary
from country to country.  If there were hundreds of such parallel DNS
trees, there might be no problem at all since there would be too many
to fight.  But if there were only a few, which is what seems required
to have just a few places to go to get public annotations, then these
might be targets for trademark infringment lawsuits.

Yes, servers could volunteer to run annotation servers for annotations
of their own documents.  And they would likely want to control the
content, and in many cases the readers would be happy with that
arrangement.

Trademark concerns the use of a name in any context where its meaning
is understood, or something like that.  So a parallel DNS tree
containing something like www.microsoft.com.comment.net and many other
.com sites might get people up in arms.

Distributing the 3rd party annotation servers in a fashion that
doesn't mirror the DNS tree would distribute the legal problems as
well, but it also makes it harder to find annotations.  In other words,
making it easy to find public annotations for any particular page may also
make it easy to attack them legally.

Not if the page owners have anything to say about it.
