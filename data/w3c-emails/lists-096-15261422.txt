Daniel- I'm just rushing out of the office right now and then leaving town,
so I'm going to try and bang out a quick response while I still have acess
to my mail. Forgive me if I get a little sloppy...

I suspect I am. I really like the ideas in the public annotations paper. I'm
working on a more detailed proposal for a Usenet-based annotation system
with the help of an online friend who's got a little more technical
background than I do. I'd send you info on it, but the other guy's the
primary author, and I want to get his permission before distributing it.

Hmm. Hope I haven't misrepresnted the goals of w3c-annot too badly. I may
only have made my point less clearly that I should have- By "Universally
Commentable", I mean a system that allows users to see _all_ comments added
to any page, regardless of what set they may be in. This would require
either being able to search for annotations across all known sets (which
would presumably be really impractical), or setting up a single set of the
size and scale of the backlinks one- which is specifically given low priority.

Have I misread the w3c-annot literature, or was I just not clear enough in
what I was describing as low-priority? In either case, I'll fix my
description of the w3c-annot project when I get back into town.

Agreed. I'm no fan of gargantuan, centralized services either. I just think
they may prove pragmatically necessary if you're to allow for a system that
lets users see _all_ the comments that have been added to a given page.

They really shouldn't be. You can write a book or magazine article called
"All about Microsfoft". You can run TV ads for a store saying "Our prices
are lower than Wal-Mart's". Trademark law just means I can't start a
magazine called "Microsoft Mag" or open a store called "Misha's Wal-Mart".
You can _mention_ trademarked terms in all sorts of contexts, and I'd be
very surprised if a parellel DNS tree were considered trademark infringement.

In any event, couldn't the parellel tree just work using the IP numbers
rather than domain names of the servers being annotated?

Gotta run and catch a train now...
