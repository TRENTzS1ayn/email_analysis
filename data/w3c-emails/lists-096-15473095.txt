your archive pages appear to be broken. some just trail off,
others seem to have gotten mangled into an infinite loop
repeating 30 posts or so. see, for example:

  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-annotation/

same applies to the collaboration archive and i've sent them
an email too.

i'm using netscape navigator 4.03 on windows 95 in case that
has something to do with it.
