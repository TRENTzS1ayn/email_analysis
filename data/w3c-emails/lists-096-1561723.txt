illustrates how after all this time one can not rely on css
to give a consistent rendering of a design...
using amaya 7.1  there is no menu box at all
using msie 6.0 sp1  the menu box scrolls off the screen
using mozilla/phoenix  the menu box stays in the corner so that
it can be accessed no matter where you scrolled.  
I think that the mozilla way is the intent of the designer but it 
sure doesn't work for all....  Designers sure lose a lot of time
finding out what works where .... this nonsense is similar to
having auto horn in different locations only to be noticed
at point that you need it....  oh yeah that's right auto horns
can be on the signal arm --- pull to beep,   or push into column
to beep, in center of steering wheel, on edge of steering wheel
or on a cord (the big 16 wheelers)......
STANDARDS would be nice to have... and even nicer if they
were followed
