We did until some months ago; however the Web4Groups architecture turned
out not to be as flexible for our needs. We are working on two new projects
(an educational remake and a commercial relaunch of Web4Groups), but
annotation is not a topic anymore in those projects.

You may visit our annotation commander prototype which pops up in a
separate window if you launch it from your bookmarks list at
http://thing.at/pvl/annotation/

Maybe I should also mention that we have also published a book on "Voting,
Rating, Annotation" within the Web4Groups framework.
