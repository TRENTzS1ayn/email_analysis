I know little about the Web4Groups architecture.  Could you summarize
in a couple of sentences why the architecture was not flexible enough?

I had the same 404 NOT FOUND problem as Laurent, plus after reloading
I got the following error message:  

  Web4Groups Annotation Service requires JavaScript cookie support!  

This was somewhat odd since I have both JavaScript and cookies enabled
in my Netscape 4.05 browser.  Perhaps you use a proprietary Microsoft
Internet Explorer mechanism?
