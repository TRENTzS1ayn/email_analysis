Yes, I think it was Mosaic...

Good : and people would start using
annotations if, for instance, they
are able to send an annotated URL to
their friends by email (not the
whole document, but the URL with extra
parameters).
I'm working on such an idea for my PhD.
XML, and more specifically XML Pointer,
is a good candidate to code
annotations within the URL
(adding parameters like
#ROOT()STRING(3,"string to search",0).

The problem with existing annotation
systems (see www.crit.org) is
that they rely on a server. I think a
client-side program is better,
for privacy concerns.
Then it may be possible to share
annotations
by email and, for people who need that,
to publish them and
share them via a server (not necessary
public).

Yes, once personal annotations are
created, you can imagine people
would submit them to Search Engines of a
particular type (annotations).
