Maybe, but then: If third party annotations exists, why should they
hinder them?

Scalability is the keyword here.  I've done a lot of research on
annotation systems 2 years ago (see also my publication, which lists
most of the annotation systems that were available at that time).

A scalable third-party annotation service does simply not exist. 
Thinking about it, such a system must be runnable without modification
of existing Web servers.  Good luck finding an appropriate architecture;
people would get a Ph.D. and more for it... ;-)

Other problems include: on what granularity do you want to annotate
(word, HTML/XML object, URL)?  what about all the ASP sites and cookie
driven pages?

Nope.  I don't think that chat is particular useful, but ICQ skyrocked. 
It's just the enormous technological challenge what's keep people away
of creating such a service. 

BTW: Annotation services for small to medium groups exist.  See as
examples the Web4Groups initiative and the BSCW service.  You'll find
more approaches in my paper about active annotations published in the
book: voting, rating and annotation (see my Web page).
