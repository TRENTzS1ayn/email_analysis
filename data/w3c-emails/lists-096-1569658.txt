Amaya 7 fails to save carriage return characters, although the
"Export CR/LF" checkbox is checked in the Special |
Preferences | Publishing dialog.  
  
This problem occurs when creating new documents; also, any CRs are
removed from existing documents. Have tested only with files saved to
the local hard drive. 
  
Currently using Windows XP, but could also test on Win95 if that
would help. 
  
If this is a known bug, is there a work-around? 
  
Thank you.
