Ken,

I agree that abuse, self-interest, etc, are big potential problems for any large-scale annotation system. I also think that human review at some level is the only solution.

You describe this solution as having "huge costs and scalability issues". Am I right in assuming that you're imagining a regular staff (paid or voulnteer) who comb through the posts? What about a more distributed form of human review, where users rate posts for relevance, etc? This addresses some of the issues of cost and scalabliity (and, of course, introduces some of its own problems).

I wrote a rant about this a couple of years back. It's at:

The part that specifically addresses collaborative filtering of comments is at:

Hope these provide some ideas to chew on.
