I agree that also other annotation systems are needed.  Especially,
annotations for group members working on the same project are valuable. 
Systems exist for those annotations.

Yes, but you're only aware about them, if
a) you're member in one of these foren, or
b) the visisted Web page actually supports them (has a link to them).

Not sure about it.  Before something is invented there is rarley a need
for it, what means: Nobody can tell you, before you have a running
system.  Then you may look on the acceptance rate.

I would classify Alexa (www.alexa.com) as a first step in that
direction.  While Alexa only offer links to related Web pages it shares
some properties: It's independent of the Web sites and shows you also
links, which are not in the interest of the visited host (e.g.
competitors).  However, while Alexa includes also a basic rating system,
links are mainly generated by user statistics.

Third party annotation may be very powerful:
- Users that visit a Web page share a common interest.  You could look
on annotations of an URL as a newsgroup with the URL as topic.  As well
as you need a powerful filtering system for reading highly frequented
newsgroups (kill file, recommandation system, others), you'll need it
for annotations of frequently visited and annotated Web pages.
- Annotations do not need necessarely be persistent (forever).  They
could expire as postings in newsgroups.
- Annotations may be synchron.  Then you would be aware about who is
visiting the Web page at the same time as you.  You could combine it
with a chat tool.  Something like ICQ, but with URLs as the common
denominator.
- Competitors will love them.  Now Netscape can advertise their
advantages over IE on the Microsoft pages :-)
- Scientists will love them.  Leave an online review of an article as
annotation and have a link to your publications.
- Consumers will love them.  If I'm going to buy the new vacuum cleaner
from X, I would be delighted to see the promotional offer by Y, which is
10% off.

I have a lot of use cases, where third party annotations may create
value-adds.  However, it can be assumed that most annotations are crap. 
So you need also a powerful filter.  On the other side: How do you find
right now interesting Web pages?  You perform also some filter
operations either manually or automated...
