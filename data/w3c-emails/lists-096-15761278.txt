All this talk about collaborative filtering, abuse, and trust, brings to mind the Sixdegrees site at htttp://www.sixdegrees.com/

The site lets users enter lists of their friends, acquaintances,etc, and maintains all the information in a database. The system then knows who your friends are, who your friends-of-friends are, etc.

The applications they've set up (movie reviews, discussion boards) don't strike me as more than kind of nifty. But the database of personal connections is potentially tremendously useful. You can find how you're connected to anyone. This seems like a great mechanism for systems to filter out spam, abuse, etc, in any open communication medium (like annotations, and ratings on annotations).

Anyhow. Definitely worth a look if you haven't seen it already, and if you're interested in social networks as part of a solution for filtering annotations.
