You have the same problem with the third party annotation systems.
You need to know where they are located in order to find the annotations.

Yes and no.  I can see a potential here, but the problem is still the value 
of the information being provided.  If you use straight statistics, you have no
idea how useful the information is.  It may just be well published.  Also, Jane
Graduate student looking for collaborative research would not interested in 
Joe Internet's opinion about collaborative software, while she might be interested 
in Jack PhD researcher extrodinaire's expert opinion.  The web rings and link pages
provide a lot of the functionality without the overhead.  I trust Prof. Jill's opinion who
references Jack PhD and so I follow a link to Jack PhD's site to collect his opinions.

While one host probably won't contain links to competitors, you can often find 
reviewers and interest groups that list all the related sites.  Many of the "for fun"
type pages and groups include comments on their link pages that say things like
"good pics", "slow connection", and  "don't bother".

But what valued added is provided beyond someone's favorite URL list?

The web ring provides a set of sites of similar interest for the average hobbyist.
Researchers on common projects already have a connection with each other
and provide forums or email lists like this one to collaborate.

The original question was what has stalled software development in this area?  
I think the answer is there is no pressing need for it.  People have found 
other ways of doing more or less the same thing.  Like it or not, a lot of the
software development seems to be driven by good enough.  If you've got a
way to do something, corporations and funding groups don't seem to be all 
that interested in investing in something niftier.

This would help with the space problem, but I don't see the relevance to getting
people to use an annotation system.

There has been talk about collaborative systems that do things like this.  I don't
see this as an annotation feature, but more a collaboration feature.

Competitors already do this with "50 reasons we're better than they are" type
pages.  You still haven't brought me to your annotation server.  I'm most likely
to hit a series of related competitors from a search engine or a reviewer's page.

None of these reasons (or the ones below) describe situations that aren't being
dealt with in other ways already on the web through search engines, links, rings,
newsgroups and forums.  

I'm not saying that you couldn't put in a service and potentially get lots of people
to use it,  IF you convinced knowledgeable people to provide the annotations and
IF you can get your annotation sufficiently widely published to so people know to 
hit it.
