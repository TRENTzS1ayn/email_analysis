Beth and all others,

to clarify my position:
I'm just curious about annotations systems, since I've done some time
ago research on them.  I'm no longer in that research, exactly for the
reason we have collected on the list:
1) huge technical challenge for third-party annotations;
2) unclear advantages.

Said that, some remarks to your mail:

Not if they are closely tied to the URL I'm just visiting.
Example: If I'm visiting a Web page and my third-party annotation system
is triggered by this (e.g. through a NN plug-in, as Alexa does), I have
all annotations for this page in my annotation systme, which can then be
tailored to show me only those annotations, I'm really interested in.

[Alexa... and others]

I agree.  I've the same problem with all the hits, which are returned by
search engines right now.  There's no way to see how useful the
information is, without visiting the Web page.  Nevertheless, search
engines are great and used a lot.

Yes.  But that assumes that everybody updates their Web pages and the
links.  This is unfortunately not true for most people.  For example, my
Web page about groupware systems was last updated two years ago, because
I just haven't the time to maintain it...

I agree.  The main problem here is that they are not integrated within
the Web page I'm visiting right now.  If I find such recommandation
sites by "back-links" from the page I'm visiting, it would be
woderful... ( and we would have such a beast of annotation system :-)

Having truly shared bookmarks would be such a value-add that you could
create a start-up for it.  Trust me: If you come up with a valid
architecture (and some integrated filtering), you'll get funding by
venture capitalists.  And that means: There is a demand.

Unfortunately not.  This means: Yes, we collaborate by emails and have
our newsgroups/mailing lists, but no: I'm always suprised how many good
publications I find by accident or by searching the Web with an author's
name, if she/he has a publication in a conference proceeding.

I disagree.  If you can offer a service better than others, then you
most probably will get the funding.  The value is generated just by the
number of persons, who will use your system.

See it that way: An annotation, which wasn't accessed since a long time,
is probably irrelevant.  It's a very trivial solution for the space
problem and a kind of filtering system.

Yes.  But it's basically the same technology.  So you can integrate
both.

That's exactly my point:
You have to use another service (serach) to first find the potential
competitors, then you have to evaluate the hits.  Very time-consuming. 
If it was integrated, you just click on the annotation...

Yes, it makes life just easier.
1) There is no need for IP telephony, since it doesn't offer you a
better service than normal phone companies.  Nevertheless, more than 30
start-ups are competing in this sector.
2) There was no need for ICQ.  IRC and other chat tools already offered
chat.  The idea was the combination with a very basic awareness system
(which, btw, was also included within IRC).

I agree with the second IF, but not with the first one.
If you want to have contributions only by selected people, then you're
building a totally different system than I have in mind.  The Web is so
wonderful, because it does not discriminate people.  A third
party-annotation system must be designed the same way.  If you want
filtering (and this is needed), you must do it on the receiver side.


Cheers,
