Resources for Research on Third-Party Web Annotations

By third-party Web annotations, I mean annotation systems with a
global reach that do not require the explicit cooperation of the Web
site administrator whose pages are being annotated.  

For example, Lotus Notes' web annotation system does not qualify
because of the lack of global reach.  Lotus lets me share annotations
with the person down the hall who is in the same workgroup, but does
not let me access the annotations of strangers on the other side of
the world.  

Explicit HTML links placed voluntarily in Web pages by Web site
admistrators who link to discussion forums does not qualify either,
because the explicit cooperation of Web site administrators is
needed.  



Active annotation systems:

CritSuite:  <http://crit.org>

Web4Groups:  <http://web4groups.at:9000/>

IBM's Aqui:  <http://www.aqui.ibm.com/>

Netscape "What's Related" is a third party web annotation system as
well, although it does not currently allow non-Netscape people to add
comments or links.  Annotation links are automatically generated to
statistically related sites.  <http://www.home.netscape.com/escapes/related/> 

 

Defunct annotation systems:

Web4Group's Annotation Commander is new but was broken last time I
checked:  <http://thing.at/pvl/annotation/index.html>

HyperWave and Hyper-G:  

Terry Stanley's Annotator:  <http://www.foresight.org/WebEnhance/Annotate.html>

ComMentor: <http://www-diglib.stanford.edu/diglib/pub/reports/commentor.html>
