I too would recommend you use a different syntax then your "extended
url" syntax.  Using something like 

   http://localhost:3128/http://www.yahoo.com?note=selected

Has the disadvantage that this "extended url" is not a valid url,
according to the url standard.  This means there is no guarantee that
future browsers will be able to handle extended url's.  

Therefore at the very least you will want to escape any invalid characters
using the %xx notation.
