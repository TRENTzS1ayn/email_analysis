The notion of intermediator used in my paper, is an adaptation of the term
defined by Barrett,R., and Maglio, P of IBM. It is similar to the mediator term
you had suggested, but is much more general. For details, refer to:
[BM98] Barrett,R., and Maglio, P., "Intermediaries: New Places for Producing and
Manipulating Web Content", in Proceedings of the Seventh International World Wide
Web Conference, 1998, URL:

This is incorrect.
proxy based annotation system (like crit.org) have inherent HMI limitations:
The HMI is totally limited by the HTML\JAVA languages. Since these languages were
tended to be
platform independent, they have poor HMI support. It is obvious that with native
languages
(e.g. Visual C++ on 95x/NT platforms) one can achieve much more effective HMI.
client-intermediators don't suffer from this limitation. To see what can be
achieved by client-intermediation,
as far as HMI is concerned, refer to:
[Alexa] Alexa Home Page, URL:  http://www.alexa.com
[Sideware] " Sideware Home Page" , The Net Notions Product, URL:
http://www.sideware.com

I believe you'll be convinced that such HMI capabilities are not achievable by
proxy-intermediation.
