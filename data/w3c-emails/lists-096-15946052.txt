As far as i can tell, what Barrett and Maglio describe in their
paper is the same thing.  They write:

    We define intermediaries as computational elements that
    lie along the path of web transactions.

That's what a mediator is.  The following is excerpted from my
1995 definition:

    ... a mediator is a service that functions simultaneously as a
    server on its front end and as a client on its back end,
    which acts not only as a proxy for the user's request but
    also performs some useful type of processing on the retrieved
    document. 

The second feature which i specified, modifying the link URLs
in a document to cause subsequent fetches to also use the mediator,
was my way of implementing a mediator to be universally accessible
to all browsers, despite possible lack of proxy support in the
browser and any firewalls that might get in the way.

Sorry, please allow me to be clearer: that a mediator is limited
by the abilities of HTML in its user interface is granted; that a
user may be "disturbed" by the addition of buttons or extra
information in the page has nothing to do with the mediator.

You are absolutely correct on this.  It's an issue of trading
off the richness of the user interface against the
platform-independence of the system.
