First, let it be noted that I think your definition should be mentioned, as well
as your important work.
Still, as far as defs. go, I'd have to disagree. What you probably had in mind
when first defining the 'mediator' term, was a proxy based annotation system. For
instance, you write: "...also performs some useful type of processing on the
retrieved document...". This implies that the 'mediator' term is well defined only
for document retrieval. The 'intermediator' term defined by Barrett and Maglio
speaks of ANY web transaction which is more general than document retrieval.

But this observation is pure semantics, and is of lesser importance.
What I find much more interesting is the matter of scalability.
Do you use some kind of distribution ?
Have you made any capacity estimations for crit.org ?
Can you describe the technology used by crit.org to store annotations and to serve
multiple clients ?
