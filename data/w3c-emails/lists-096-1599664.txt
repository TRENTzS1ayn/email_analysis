I got "The document name you requested 
(/Amaya/Distribution/amaya-7.1-0.i386.rpm) could not be found on this server." 
clicking the link to http://www.w3.org/Amaya/Distribution/amaya-7.1-0.i386.rpm 
on the BinDist.html page below.  I didn't find an alternative link to the 7.1 rpm.

Btw, can a Types | Space command be added to Amaya?  Currently i seem to have to 
add &nbsp; in the source view if i want more than one consecutive space.

thx,
georgeh
