I discovered the hidden trove of old web-annotation projects a year ago...
and just recently to get back into dev/standards issues. For one, I was
inspired at last week's WWW8 conference, particularly Tim's keynote, which
mentioned the muted interest in annotation in recent memory.

Secondly, just yesterday a startup company called ThirdVoice announced the
availability of plug-in web annotation beta software! I was a bit
disappointed that I hadn't gotten moving last spring, but so it goes, I
have a job doing something else now. (Web stuff is related, but not fully,
my job at BBN).

The software only plugs-in with IE4/Windows. A NN4 version is forthcoming.

The plug-in architecture is brilliant-- it is much superior to crit.org in
performance, due to the new architecture. But there are some limitations,
and I'm hoping to rally some people to get some standard development.

The "White Paper" accompanying the software is severely lacking (join me in
annotating it-- http://fb.thirdvoice.com/about/WhitePaperPage1.htm
