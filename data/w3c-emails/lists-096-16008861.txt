Sorry about that last send-- hit Ctrl-E prematurely.

What the ThirdVoice White Paper is missing is a sense of meeting some sort
of standards for annotations. (Not that w3 has offered anything just yet).
They do not seem to anticipate an open client/server model, which would
allow client users to pick whichever servers they want. Currently the
client is stuck with using the ThirdVoice server.

This may be good for a start, but it seems that eventually users,
especially institutional ones, will prefer to run their own servers and
manage their own community.
