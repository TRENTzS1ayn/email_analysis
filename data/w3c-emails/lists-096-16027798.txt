This is a problem either way.  In addition to the privacy and control
problem, A single central server can't possibly serve all the
annotations for all users for all web pages.

But as soon as there are many replicas of the annotation service so
there is a chance at being scalable, users will have a problem finding
the right service to use.  This will only work if users are happy using
a few such services, such as services for workgroups, friends, or
special interests.

I don't see a problem with identification of annotations themselves.
Certainly a system *could* avoid providing URIs for each annotation, or
make them unreusable, but the only value in doing that would be to make
it impossible to refer to a particular annotation, and I don't see any
advantage in doing that.

But perhaps you are raising a different problemd: how to make a URI for
where an annotation is attached in another resource.  Xpointers could
address this, or something like what you suggest.
