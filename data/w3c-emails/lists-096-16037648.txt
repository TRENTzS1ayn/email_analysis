I'll concede that. I didn't think XPointers described a whole annotation
system though.

Of course-- following RealAudio's lead. I sent them a note about this; I'll
wait to here from their project manager.

But it seems like annotations are so much simpler, that if 3V doesn't do it
someone else will.

Indeed, we'll have to trust P3P and auditing systems, unless all we need to
do is trust our friends who are running their own 3V servers.

I've had no problem with this just yet. First approach: use both flavors of
browsers at once! With 3V you can even have one IE window using it, and
another window with it turned off (I'm led to believe that). Furthermore, I
happen to concentrate all of my comment-minded browsing in one "session,"
and then I'll turn it off and go into sites that I don't need comments on.

Also note that in 3V, as far as I can tell, the annotations are not loaded
until the proper page is fully displayed.

No.

Yes, a good standard.

I wish I had the experience and expertise (and necessity) to recussitate
this working group... all I have the desire.
