Possibly so. This is a performance issue, I don't see it any value in
discussing it in depth at this time.

Dynamically modified-- no mass redrawing of the screen. The icons are
inserted inline, text is moved aside in a very neat way.

Note the original page is returned when you either View Source or Save As
File.

Show me the proposal. I can't see this adding too many benefits. I never
thought that URL's were supposed to carry data-- that's quite unintuitive.

With an open client/server model annotation system, the annotations do not
necessarily live on the same server, anyway.

Dan works with the w3c, I hope he can give us some guidance.

How would the w3c take action in a case like this? Contact the software
developers and say, "We have a good feeling that this technology will be
standardized some day, we'd like to work with you to help that process."
