I invite members of this group to take a look at RichLink Author, a new 
authoring tool that allows multilevel annotations of words or phases.  

As the data sheet  ( http://www.sentius.com/sentius/downloads/rla_bw.pdf ) 
indicates, RichLink Author allows you to create multiple layers of annotation 
for any word or phrase on the page.  The annotation can be done automatically 
using databases of information. You can also use our WYSIWYG editor to add 
custom teacher notes or web links.

The authoring tool is free and we sell collections of databases that allow it 
to annotate text automatically.

The Language Annotation Suite (LAS) is the first set of RichLink databases 
relesased.  It allows you to automatically annotate any document with any or 
all contents from the American Heritage English Dictionary as well as six 
bilingual dictionaries:
    Japanese
    Spanish
    French
    German
    Italian
    Dutch

Other databases are in development and include Webster's Medical and Legal 
Dictionaries, Academic Press' Dictionary of Science and Technology, the 
Dictionary of Cultural Literacy , a Children's Dictionary and the Columbia 
Encyclopedia.    In addition we have the ability to create custom RichLink 
Databases for clients and will make an advanced version of our authoring tool 
available so users can make their own databases.  (For the time being, I am 
willing to work a limited number of clients to create some custom material.)


We are also developing the ability to integrate our RichLink Automate service 
with e-mail systems.  In this way a reader of English language e-mail will be 
able to have it RichLinked on the fly.  This can extend to listeservs as 
well.  

Demos are available on the web site.
