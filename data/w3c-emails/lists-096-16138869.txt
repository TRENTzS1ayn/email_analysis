I've started putting together a page highlighting some key differences in
web annotation software architectures. Included are some existing,
prototype, historical systems.

It's only a draft now. I shall need to better organize the references. Feel
free to make comments. I'd like to nail down some definitions for
annotation system components:

In the meantime, ThirdVoice is getting hammered by a newsworthy amount of
Internet smarty-pants (see nototv.hypermart.net; stories in Wired News,
Christian Science Monitor). Unfortunately, no one is trying to get at the
heart of the problem, which is the software's faulty architecture.

I wish there were a viable movement among this group to ensure that
properly-designed annotation systems get developed and reach the marketplace.
