Jon, you might want to take a look on an earlier comparison between
various annotation systems.  This coparison is part of an invited paper
for a Web4Group conference in 1997 (so it's a bit old).  However, I've
used a similar approach as in your draft.  You might want to copy
information about systems that you haven't included yet (e.g. FutPlex,
Hyper-Wave/Hyper-G, and the OSF approach).
