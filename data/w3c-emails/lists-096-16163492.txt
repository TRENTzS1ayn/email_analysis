Hi.  I like your taxonomy.  It's nicely organized.  You may wish to
add a row to your table for Laurent Denoue's "YAWAS", mentioned on
this list a little while ago.

I have a couple of corrections to suggest for the CritLink entry.
The "Location" category for CritLink is currently just "tail", but
CritLink does support inline display of comments as well.  (Actually
it is not so cut and dry; see my annotation for more details.)
Also, what you refer to as "flavours" (cute term!) i've been calling
"link types".

For my comments on the draft, see:

Yes, this is quite unfortunate.

By that, do you mean the fact that it uses a root note server?
