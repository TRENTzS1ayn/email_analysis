Thanks, your paper is proving quite useful.

Yes, your comments are useful as well, I am working on them. Now I have a
better idea what ought to be in this draft. I should finish some major
revisions within the week.

Yes. Their architecture does not suggest a multiplicity of servers.

Perhaps I should not these web armchair critics so seriously, given that
they seem to be of the same cut of technically-proficient people who
protested popular standards:{cookies, frames, PICS} due to paranoid reasoning.

Nonetheless I cannot help but think that we'd be better off if ThirdVoice
were involved in this discussion, and somewhere on the path towards
standardization.

Note, to take a break from 3rdVoice, I was very much interested in the
"dictionary-based" anchoring method that RichLink offers. I think it will
come naturally with XML, though.
