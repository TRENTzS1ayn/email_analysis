Jim Levin, an ed-psych professor at UIUC, has introduced a web-annotation
project which got some media coverage [*] recently. Too bad neither he nor
the media appears to have recognized existing & historical
research/projects in this field.

I'd suppose that the authors of IPP should have looked at the
www-annotations page at w3.org (not that they would have been much
impressed by the dead link to Wayne Gramlich's site). Or the writer at
Wired magazine should have contacted W3.

Maybe W3 would have had nothing to say, as annotations are officially not
active projects. But we do have people discussing it, to go with a web page
that should have links to active/historical outside projects. Also we can
try to nail down to definitions so that new software can be easily classified.

But we should really need to put the work in on updating the annotations
web page. (http://www.w3.org/Collaboration/ -- though there is much
overlap, do these two areas still go together?)

I may invite Professor Levin about the list; should somebody (with more of
an official role) contact Wired News?
