This is Karen MacArthur, and yes, I haven't worked at W3C since 1996
and so no longer maintain that page.  I still follow the annotation
list, however, and would be glad to contribute if W3C provides access
or a new home is found.

I can't find a current policy on collaboration and annotation on the
W3C site.  Can someone from W3C enlighten us on current activity, and
on whom we should contact?

Cheers,
  Karen
