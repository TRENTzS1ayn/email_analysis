Hi,

It seems that there's a curious bug in the win 9X version of Amaya 7.1
when writing an annotation.  If you start typing text then all is well until 
the annotation window starts to scroll.  At this point the cursor jumps to
somewhere in the middle of the text that you just entered, and of course
the text you're typing is all jumbled up.  

I didn't get this effect in the linux-elf version of Amaya 7.1 that I've also
been using.

Thanks

Richard Kaye
