I've been reviewing all the resources I can find for information 
about annotation software.  Most of the work that is published seems 
to revolve around public annotation capabilities.  I was hoping to 
use one of these tools in our intranet project, but for various 
reasons nothing seems suitable.

I know of a few tools suitable for intranet use, such as Lotus Notes, 
but would appreciate any pointers to other resources.  At the moment 
it looks like we'll be implementing a custom solution - probably 
using an SQL database and perhaps PHP - but before I go down that 
path I'd like to eliminate other possibilities.

Thanks
Mike
