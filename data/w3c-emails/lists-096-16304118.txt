I can see that you've already tried out the demo so that you've seen how
the annotations are easy to send using your existing email program,
without the requirements of Lotus Notes (and Windows 2000) for everyone
to be in the same workgroup and use the same client software.

PageSeeder already uses an SQL database, it needs a Java servlet runner.
(I don't know what PHP means) and can be run on any server (we think).

We have just released the beta2 for testing. We are a small self funded
company and interested in any possible partnerships.
