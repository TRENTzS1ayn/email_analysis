My glossary-style annotations code is on the way. I've been working 2
months on it, several hours every couple of weeks, and expect to have a
demo and doc in perhaps another 2 months. 

I'll also get around to clearing it with the licensing people here. I'd
like to open-source the Javascript code.

I'm expecting I will be proposing some XML/DTD tags.

Not really sure if I should aim to present at the next W3 or SIGWEB. Before
I get to that I may try to organize a workshop here (in Boston). I'm not so
experienced on how this is done-- how many people would we aim to get?
Would W3 be interested in helping? I suppose we'd need publicity, a
facility, refreshments.
