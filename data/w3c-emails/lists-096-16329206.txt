Hi Mike.

Crit can be installed on an intranet, either as its own stand-alone
server, or running as a CGI under Apache.  It's free.  All you need
is Perl 5.

If your machine is internal to your firewall, then all the
annotations you make are private to the intranet.  If you permit
access to web pages from the outside world, then everybody can make
private annotations on public web pages, as well as making annotations
on everyone else's intranet pages.
