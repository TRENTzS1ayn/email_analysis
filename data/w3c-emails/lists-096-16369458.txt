I don't think it's beneficial to focus on Crit or any singular product on
this list.

I think our energies are far better directed towards working on agreeing on
what set of features comprise an "annotation system."

Ping has acknowledged this before. A proxy solution is a good prototype,
but not scaleable to many users, and not compliant with conventional URL
space.

The cost/benefits of redundant server solutions is not unique to
annotations-- most Internet services have to address this problem.

These are among the known features of the annotation systems.

Mind your jargon.

Your "back end" is commonly known as an "annotation server."

Your "local proxy" is commonly known as... well, we still don't have a
name. I'd suggest "client helper", it's the place where the annotations are
collected and prepared for the user; "local proxy" sounds too much like
"server proxy" (one instance of that being the CritLink Mediator).

I'll get to working on that glossary. If anyone wants to help, but doesn't
have time to code, the least you can do is help out in defining the
terminology. Not only do we need good names and definitions, but we need to
recognize all prior names.
