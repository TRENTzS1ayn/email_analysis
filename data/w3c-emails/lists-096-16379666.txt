Yes, we do.  The name is "mediator" (1995).  A "proxy" is something
which attempts to transparently stand in place of the thing it is
serving for.  Its goal is to mimic the original thing exactly.  A
"mediator" is something which stands in the middle and attempts to
produce an augmented or processed variant of the original.

So, the term for Crit is a "remote mediator".  The term for what you
are talking about is a "local mediator".
