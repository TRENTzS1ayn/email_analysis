Ok. Good point. My page's listing covers most of the software which has
been announced here, at least a half-year back...

Annotations: associate a word/point "anchor" on a web page with a set of
data supplied by a third party.

* glossary-style: the anchor is a phrase. 
* pointer-based: the anchor is the position within a specific document.
* document-based: the anchor is the document itself.

Cool. I have some more ideas for the development effort, but I'll work with
you on them off list.
