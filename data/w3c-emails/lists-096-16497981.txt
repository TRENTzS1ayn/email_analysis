Ok. FTR, Bjarni & I were going into the details about my rev-eng'ing the
ThirdVoice protocol.

I got a good head start on the project, but the brash sunny weather for the
last weekend in August drew me outside enough to preclude me from getting
the time to nicely format my notes. Give me a few more days...

I can report that the basic 3V annotation encoding format uses *some* XML.
While the poster, title, and content are wrapped in XML tags, the other
fields are wrapped using the '|' as a delimiter. I have been able to decode
most of these unnamed fields. Pointer-reference uses an XPointer-inspired
system for navigating through tags.

Anyway, I set ThirdVoice another friendly note to see if they could release
their protocol specifications.

The protocol exists, there must be more than one brand of client and more
than one brand of server which supports it! A protocol, once out-ed, must
not be tied to particular clients! If there is any lesson that the Internet
has brought to me, that is it, and I will not rest!

This is the 3V client, not the protocol.
The client alternately can present the threaded posts with the help of a
collapsible-outline GUI.

Correct.

You have just described the "fascist-server scenario," which is not
inherent to ThirdVoice; it is possible with *any* Internet service. What
defeats the Fascist Server is Comparative Trust. If I no longer trust my
current webserver/mailserver/newsserver, I can simply use the free market
to switch to a server I trust more.

What defeats Comparative Trust are Fascist States, and to some extent
media oligarchies, but that's outside our purview.

That's my plan.

If you can translate the "Annotator" from the CritLink Mediator, to a
client plug-in or local proxy, I'd like to see that.

Yes, much agreement in that. (Though it is more accurate to say "mime-type"
and "encoding format" than "file format".)

Ok. Comparative trust: I don't think I'm going to trust Ann's annotation
server any less than I do the integrity of the user account of Noah (who
posted the note) on Webster's web hosting service.

If I need better trust, give me Noah's note signed with his DSig.

Back on May 20th, Steve Epstein of Sentius announced a product which can do
 just this. I pointed out that it didn't fit in well with WWW standards, to
which he acknowledged, and to which I took it upon myself to write a
standards-based prototype.

And yes, my immediate career goals are to get a staff to help me write all
this code. :-)
