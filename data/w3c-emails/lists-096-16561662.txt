I defined this term earlier in the message - I meant on-the-fly filtering
and censorship of the annotation text itself, performed by the remote 
mediator or annotation server.  The example I took was a mediator admin
who didn't like the word "potato", so he had it filtered from all
annotations.

The Crit architecture doesn't have this problem (although the current
implementation does), since the "mediator" functionality could easily be
local, and thus under complete user control.

Ugh.  That sounds terrible, and does not inspire confidence.  I would tend
to agree that something minimalistic would be more appropriate.

If the normal HTTP proxy syntax is used, you will have the exact same level
of functionality as people stuck behind a "traditional" firewall/proxy
implementation.  If applets don't work in such an environment then I'd
venture that they were broken by design already, considering how pervasive
proxies are - especially where people are doing Real Work and not just
surfing...

This is true - but it's an implementation issue, not an architectural one.
The current Crit implementation is a balanced trade-off between creating a
"flawless" system and one that works with the WWW today.  Tighter
integration with the user's browser would eliminate this problem - but that
doesn't mean we can't take advantage of the rest of Crit's current
functionality.

I think Crit would make a really good annotation server, but we should agree
on a standard for client<->annotation-server communication as soon as
possible so better clients can be written that work with Crit, and will also
work with any new servers people come up with.

Why not?  I don't understand how putting the code in the browser suddenly
makes it irresistant to change... ?

Agreed!

No, that's not mandatory.  Check again - the mediator allows you to
reference documents anywhere online, not just on Crit's local web site.
Crit nicely provides unguaranteed storage to make using the system easier,
but it isn't required.

Exactly - we agree again, and so does Ping.  Isn't that nice? :-)


Someone here (sorry, I forgot the name) was going to draft an XML
specification for client<->annotation-server communication.  I'm looking
forward to seeing it. :)
