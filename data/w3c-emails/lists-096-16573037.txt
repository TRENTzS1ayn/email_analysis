I have to respond to this: this is not the case at all!  This is a
very important difference between ThirdVoice and CritLink.  The Crit
system permits annotations to be stored *anywhere* on the Web, by
*anybody* who can put up a web page in the normal fashion.

It does permit you to post your annotation on crit.org if you wish --
but only for convenience's sake.  You can choose to post your
annotation anywhere you like, and even password-protect it if you
want.  ThirdVoice users have no such option.

I agree.

Not just in theory.  CritLink is an application of the theory
that yields an actual, usable solution.
