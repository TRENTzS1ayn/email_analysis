Time out.

Wow, a lot of posts! So much that we've lost a subscriber due to the deluge!

Well, it's not so unusual in even the most savvy lists for a user to forget
how to do list admin. See http://www.w3.org/Mail/ to get a refresher.

Anyway, if you're posting your intentions to leave, it would be very nice
if you could explain (either to all, or to one of the loudmouths who appear
to have taken on the moderator roles) why it is you no longer wish to
participate. 

On to the new of the day:

Laurent, I'm not sure what you mean to say here. If you mean to say that I
am saying something misleading on my page, please point it out.

I think we've had plenty of discussion. Just nothing documented.

Yes. I made the point that this can be addressed with the principle of
Comparative Trust. And that's why I'm working to liberate the protocol from
the autocratic vendors/system which contains it. (to answer ping's challenge).

ThirdVoice may be guilty of many things: (1) binding the protocol with the
service with the company name, (2) not recognizing ANY prior research.
That's not enough to turn the US Justice Dept. on them. The best way to
make ThirdVoice conform is to bring them into the research sphere. (a
little help from W3 would be nice!)
