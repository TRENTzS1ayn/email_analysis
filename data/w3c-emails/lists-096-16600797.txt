No, Crit doesn't use XPointers (such that they are -- if it did use
XPointers a few months ago, they wouldn't be XPointers any more now,
since the standard has changed).  All i meant was, Crit works.

So... Crit doesn't have this, though it uses its own mechanism for doing so.

Crit has this (it gets it from the "Last-modified" date sent by the
web server when it serves the annotation document).

Crit doesn't have this.

Crit has this.

Crit has this.  One could debate the various annotation link types 
for quite some time; all i'd like to say is that it's best to
encourage a small, simple set of types, where it's fairly obvious
what type anything should be.  If you present the user with too
many types to choose from, they lose the patience to think about it
and are less likely to bother selecting any type at all.

Yes, i think that could work.  Indeed, it would make it possible for you
to put text wherever you wanted, as you speculate.  But i initially ruled
that out because it restricts you to an extremely limited audience.
Perhaps that is less true today than two years ago, but i still have a
tendency to stick to things that are simple and universal instead of
bleeding-edge browser features.  I'm sure, though, if you really wanted
to give it a go you could probably pull off a pretty slick interface
with DHTML and layers.
