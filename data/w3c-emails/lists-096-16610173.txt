I don't know about the others (I haven't been keeping up) but HyperNews
allows you to reference an arbitrary public website which is used as the
"base article" for a forum.  As an example, see:
http://www.hypernews.org/HyperNews/get/w3c.html. The reference to
http://www.w3.org/ is invisible, but it could easily be made visible.
The ability to set up such forums is restricted, but it could easily be
opened up to allow anyone to create forums, if you want to deal with the
administrative and server scaling problems that might cause.  Instead, I
had hoped people would install their own copies of HyperNews, and that
has worked reasonably well.  Most people just want the forum features
regardless what is at the top of the forum.

This feature was also turned into a general annotation service usable by
certain limited versions of Mosaic and HotJava, where the annotations
can be sent to the browser without necessarily marking up the page being
annotated.  

HyperNews does not support any embedded or "invasive" annotations - I
looked into doing that, but there are many user interface issues I
didn't have time to fully consider.  CritLink does a good job in this
area.

HyperNews does that, but it is easy if you don't have to embed
annotations.  Another optimization (supported by HyperNews) is to make
use of a cache of the pages being annotated.
