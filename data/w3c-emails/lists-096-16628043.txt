WWW9 is 5/15-19 in Amsterdam
ACM Hypertext 2000 is 5/30-6/4 in San Antonio

HT00 Full papers are due on 10/1/99, notification on 12/1
HT00 short papers are due on 1/17/00, notification on 2/1/00
WWW9 papers are due on 11/22/99, notification on 2/1/00

Harumph. Looks like one needs to make a strict choice where to submit
papers... but I have no idea which to choose. From my experience at WWW8, I
learned that it's nice to get a block of presenters together at one
conference.

Any thoughts? I have checked out the ACM/Sigweb web pages, but there has
been very little information there about web projects in general. Also I
guess this list is closer tied to W3C, and hence WWW9, than ACM.

Still hoping to see the W3.org/Collaboration pages updated...
