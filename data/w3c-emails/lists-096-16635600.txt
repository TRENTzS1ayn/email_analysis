Amsterdam would be nice! And after making this great connection through
submitting a poster to WWW8  I'll at least try again for WWW9. Unless we make
more commercial progress with Pageseeder though we'll be unlikely to actually
get there.

We'll be releasing the full version 1 next week, there's already a pre-release
available which is lacking only the ability of the moderator to administrate
the topic user registrations. The database is settled. We haven't put it up in
Linux yet but we're working on that.

I've been trying to respond to the discussion about nomenclature but we seem to
have a different enough approach that I'm not sure what we do is really just
annotation. We're more directed at we communities and group work I suspect.

It would certainly be fabulous to get together with everyone at a conference to
agree on some vocabulary.
