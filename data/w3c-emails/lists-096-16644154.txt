Hello,
I'm sorry if this is a technical question, but I'm wondering
how ThirdVoice (3V) works to include a new window (the annotation window) in
each instance
of Internet Explorer ?
Do they use a IEHelper Object ?
If they do, then how do they place it in the Explorer window ?

Also, I've tried to download the new version of 3V for Netscape, but nothing
appears.
Laurent.
