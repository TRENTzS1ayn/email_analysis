Hello,
I've attended the ECDL'99 conference in Paris last week,
and Robert Wilensky from Berkeley presented a new browser
that supports different formats (pdf, ps, gif, html, ...).
The nice thing about this browser is that it lets anybody extend it
so we can include new functionnalities for different document types.

In the current implementation (see
http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~wilensky/MVD.html)
you can annotate HTML, GIF and other formats.
It supports many other things.
I think it's worth a look.

Laurent.
