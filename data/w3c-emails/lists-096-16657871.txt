I'm very very pleased to be able to tell you that we have released version 1
of our collaboration/annotation/listserver/discussion system. It's java and
we expect that it will run on any web server that has a servlet runner
available, it also needs a database for storing the comments and we have
currently tested MS SQL, Oracle, MS Access and Informix so far. The database
uses XLink/XML open standards.

Our basic assumption is that the owner of the page will manage the additions
to their page. We didn't approach this from a traditional annotations point
of view where you're adding your comments to someone else's content and it's
something for yourself, we approached it from a group perspective where the
whole group was always intended to share comments.
This is part of why we have used the seeds - it means that a decent chunk of
the original document is commented on, allowing the comments to be
accumulated at logical intervals rather than breaking up the document so
much that you can lose the plot.

You can try out sending in a comment at our demo page:
http://www.weborganic.com/pageseeder/demo/demo.shtml
be aware that this is just part of what you can do with pageseeder - you can
also organise email lists and create groups associated with various sets of
pages.

Hope you like it

Julie
