hello,
It's been a while I've not posted anything to this mailing list, but I found
yesterday
a new program to annotate any Web page.
See www.imarkup.com
This is very well done, you can highlight any text, use brushes to draw on the
page, also attach
notes...
You can send an annotated page by email.

It only works for IE, but a version for Netscape should come.
It is in the spirit of Yawas (the little javascript-based annotation tool I
wrote last year and which I'm still
improving) but the user interface of IMarkup is much better !!

A great thing with Imarkup is that when you visit a page you've annotated, the
software automatically inserts the annotations once the page is loaded. They
must have a kind of ActiveX attached when an instance of IExplorer
is loaded so that this ActiveX can receive events from IExplorer.
I found out a way of doing that also using Band Objects (history and favorites
are kinds of band objects). But if the user closes the Band Object, it seems it
is no longer able to receive events from IE, and then cannot automatically
insert the annotations on an annotated page. IMarkup does that even if the
IMarkup Window is closed.

So maybe somebody here knows more about the technology... I would be interested
since some users have requested I implement this in Yawas.

Thanks,
Laurent.
