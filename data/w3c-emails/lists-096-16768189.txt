But with imarkup you can't exchange annotations with a server. Pfui.
Probably because there is no W3 standard for doing so. Which we'll need to
do one of these days.

I still want to find the time to develop a compatible ThirdVoice server...
anybody else have interested in this?

FYI, I've been having a lot of fun with my glossary-style annotations, but
nothing is ready yet to publish, I just have a custom solution which works
with our cvsweb program. So I'm not presenting at WWW9 or HT00. Too bad.
Anybody for a BOTF at either one?
