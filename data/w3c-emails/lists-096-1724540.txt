If I type <strong>a b</strong> then I get a space between "a" and "b".
Why don't I get a space when I put a space just before </strong>?

I do not see why this form is more correct than the one that I have posted.
I also do not understand why do you say that, in your suggestion, the space
"will be something as important as to go marked as <strong>". Finally,
and the most important aspect of this, according to the HTML rules the
space should appear.
