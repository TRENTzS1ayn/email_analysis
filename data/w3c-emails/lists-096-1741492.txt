It is my understanding that Amaya doesn't even need installation so why 
not make a ZIP distribution and for those who need something simpler, 
use a self-extacting ZIP which also puts an icon in %DESKTOP%.  Perhaps 
if an installer is still used, a free, relatively open installer such as 
Nullsoft's NSIS could be used?
