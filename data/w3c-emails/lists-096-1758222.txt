has a well designed menu  (but float messes it in Amaya)
The problem however is that Amaya doesn't color the window
WHITE but uses whatever the user has set as default....
html validates.  each of style, screen, print, ie6hack css files
validate .... why no color  .....he uses FFF  instead of FFFFFF
but i think that is in the specs.   //
