Actually I believe it is just validating processors that must report it 
because the error is outside the document root and non-validating 
processors only need to check well-formedness within the document root.
"Non-validating processors are required to check only the document 
entity <http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#dt-docent>, including the entire 
internal DTD subset, for well-formedness."
"The *document entity* serves as the root of the entity tree and a 
starting-point for an XML processor 
<http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#dt-xml-proc>."
It sounds to me that the XML prolog is outside the document entity.  
Although I am still unclear on what exactly the document entity is, so I 
might have this wrong.
