illustrates how monospace looks in Amaya 7.
examples using the pre tag are rendered
 green in color and 10pt bold monospace
note the large gap in the whitespace (single space
between attributes).  this does not look this bad 
in other browsers and amaya has few font families 
to work with ....  is there a great deal required to allow
font families associated with a particular platform to 
be used in amaya ... sure would look nicer with platform fonts.
