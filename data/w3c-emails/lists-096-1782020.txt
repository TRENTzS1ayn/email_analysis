Even if it's valuable the fact of not needing an "installation" in the 
sense of those cryptic Windows setups that are impossible to undo, it's 
valuable to have simplified process to put the program to work.

For example, unzipping from a regular ZIP file into a directory is 
daunting for many people.
I'm writing on behalf of them, not me. I'm a software developer and I 
work with computers of all sorts since ages ago. I can manage a .ZIP.

In my professional work I'm involved in the "usability" view of systems 
and programs and as such, I consider other people's needs and capabilities.

And I think that Amaya's fate is to spread and be installed in millions 
of PCs all around the world and be used by many.

For most of those people the Amaya setup is very good. It works, it's a 
known program, it doesn't ask weird questions, it's simple.
But as the installed base grows there will be appearing problems of 
people that installed the new version in a new folder and end up with 
two Amaya and only one uninstall.
Many people can't track the directory location of the executable program 
and if ever there, they can't identify which of the several Amaya 
folders to delete.

That' the problem with Windows installs: users without a clue. Maybe 
smart people in their professions who couldn't care less about the PC 
internals.

The same as my wife (an artist who cares less about motorcars and the 
like) can start her car and drive around happily, everybody could be 
able to install Amaya (or any other program) without worrying about the 
PC internals.

That's why Windows programs must have an installation process that 
checks for disk space and older versions on behalf of the non technical 
user.

Even if Amaya can be set by simply copying the files into a folder.
