Hi, John

I'm seeing the page with Netscape 7, MSIE 5.5 and Amaya, and it looks 
almost the same with all three browsers in my W2K workstation.
I've compared spacially the part of the page with the teapot row.

I have set all browsers to render monospace with Lucida Console, but I'm 
sure it would be the same with Courier New, the default mono font.

Saludos
