Hi Jose Carlos and Juan:

I don't really know why it happens that in Amaya, or better, why it
happened, because today I have tried to reproduce it and I have not gotten
it. But I believe that the element <strong> it is a structural markup and I
don't believe that a space is structural information. I believe that if what
is wanted is to include the space to obtain a certain presentation effect,
it should use the element <span> in the following way:
<span style = font-weight: bold">Note: </span>Note </p>

Best regards,
Emmanuelle
P.S.: Jose Carlos: Boas festas. Juan: Felices fiestas :-)

| If I type <strong>a b</strong> then I get a space between "a" and "b".
| Why don't I get a space when I put a space just before </strong>?

|
| I do not see why this form is more correct than the one that I have
posted.
| I also do not understand why do you say that, in your suggestion, the
space
| "will be something as important as to go marked as <strong>". Finally,
| and the most important aspect of this, according to the HTML rules the
| space should appear.

| Thanks, but I am portuguese.
