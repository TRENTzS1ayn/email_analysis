i found the fonts.win file but have some problems ----
1] i could not find a block for western european typeset !!
2] i searched the doc folder but could find no reference to this file.
Methinks there should be a help topic on how to alter this file
to obtain good results with monospace.
And perhaps add a gui menu item for it in the future... other
browsers allow users to pick default font-families from their gui. 
a temp try will be to force a specific family in the doc itself
this will check whether it is just the default family amaya chooses
(and alterable from font.win i hope)   or  something deeper ...
will be testing   ... thanks for the good info ... it is a help

John:

Now I understand. The gaps I see are the same you see in Amaya. Only 
that they are OK for me.
Try changing the Amaya monotype  font.
The fonts.win file lives in the config subdirectory of your Amaya 
install location.
Edit the lines starting with "3" with the name of your favourite 
monotype font, the font name must be written exactly as it appears in 
the fonts list.
Then restart Amaya and you are done.

Good luck!
