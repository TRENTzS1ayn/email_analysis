Emanuelle:

Spaces are not structural.
I only say that thay might have different sizes for the same font size 
if they are into a >strong> or not.
See the image: THere are no monotype spaces, but it's the same as all 
characters are the same size.
The "[exe]" partr of the right list are not vertically alignes because 
some items are bolded.
That's all.
This is not a problem with Amaya. All browsers I use do the same.
As I see it, it's a design problem of the font.

Ssludos!
