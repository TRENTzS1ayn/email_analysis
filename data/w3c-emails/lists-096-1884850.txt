Sorry for trying to run AMAYA on a non WIN98 system :-)

The 7.1 ftp distribution does not start either.

file details tell
amaya.exe Version 7.0.0.0 french

My windows 2000 is german and differentiates between upper and lowercase 
filenames.

The installer displays the names in lowercase.

Any idea?

Is there an archive so I can downlaod 5.3 which worked?
