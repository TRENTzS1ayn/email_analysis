After installing 7.1 LINUX version which at least started I can not help 
but show my disappointment.

The editor display is garbled and does not show the last part of the 
file after synchronising.

It seems that I totally misunderstand the use of <pre> tags now for years.

Mozilla changes newlines inside a <pre> block to <br />
Amaya inserts a newline after a <br /> on every save.

So most of my files became unusable and had to be edited with a text editor.

Also AMAYA forces a maximum lenght of line inside a pre tag to be about 
60 chars and inserts a newline.

NOT FUNNY ANYMORE

It seems there are about 50 people left which are interested in a w3c - 
conformant editor.
