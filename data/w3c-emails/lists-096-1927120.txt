Could you provide an example of a file with that problem?
That would help to understand what happens.

Yes, I have just checked. That's a strange behaviour. I don't see any
reason to make that change. In a <pre>, a newline is enough to indicate
a line break and it is perfectly valid.

Right. That's to make the source code more readable. But this is an issue
within a <pre>, especially when Mozilla has turned all newlines into
<br/> elements.

I have made a change in the CVS base. Newlines are no longer inserted
after <br/> elements within a <pre>.

Are you sure? I have tried and the only newlines Amaya added within a <pre>
where after the <br/> (but that's fixed now).
