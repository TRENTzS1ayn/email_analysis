Jochem,

Did you count me? (you should).

I use Amaya for HTML editing, because it's a lot more predictable and makes
simpler HTML than other tools I've tried. Sure, there's a lot of features I'd
like, and a few bugs to get rid of, but it's being actively supported, and minor
bugs are fixed pretty quickly, and I haven't seen anything better for my needs.
