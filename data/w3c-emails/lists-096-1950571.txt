Isn't the Amaya project a "testbed for W3C technologies".  In my 
opinion, that means it should not only implement HTML, XHTML, MathML, 
SVG, CSS, etc., but it should also be a model browser and a model 
editor.  However, it doesn't seem that a significant amount of people 
use Amaya and only about three people develop on it.  Once you get 
beyond the learning curve of it, it is a tool that writes documents that 
are fairly well structured.  However, it fails Karl's first two points.  
We should encourage its usage and development to make it that model tool 
for both developers and users.
