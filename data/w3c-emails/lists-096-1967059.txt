Hello,
Amaya (7.1 running on Windows 2000) has a gray background making the 
foreground text difficult to read.  I saw a copy of a similar note less 
than a month ago and would like to know what the solution is.  A white 
background would be wonderful.  Am I just missing something obvious?
I note that the help functions, such as the index, flash gray as they are 
activated but then stabilize with a white background for me.
Any ideas? Thanks
Bill
