I solved the problem by giving all of my documents a standard stylesheet
with the following information for the body:

 BODY {  font-family: Times, serif ;
               color: #000000 ;
               background-color: #ffffff }

That gives you a black Times or serif font on a white background. You
can do it either by creating a separate stylesheet (which is what I did)
or by opening the source window and entering it in the header, using
standard style markup. The stylesheet was easier for me.

For documents you're viewing off the web, I really don't have any idea
what to do. For some unknown reason, gray has been the default ever
since Mosaic.
