Amaya doesn't format the whole document when it's a large document.
So when you scroll down and up, Amaya frees the undisplayed
formatted part and regenerates the new displayed part.
Doing that, it has some problems when it reaches the top of the document.
It could allocate too many space and a blank area appears at the top of the page.
One solution should be to format the whole document, but that will decrease the
editing performances.
