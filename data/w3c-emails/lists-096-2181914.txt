Hi,

I pasted about 1500 lines of source code from one document into another and
when I synchronised Amaya crashed. When I started it again it knew that I had
unsaved documents before the crash but it failed to find them :(

Amaya 7.2+ running on Windows 2000

(I was working with source because it was not copying/pasting large blocks
properly - I think it might happen if the doctypes are not the same but can't
tell. It just collapses everything into one paragraph, no links, etc. The
file I was copying was the lists from
http://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG10/uaag10-chklist.html (I had deleted the other
stuff before trying to copy) and I pasted it into a local file of about hte
same size).

Any clues?

cheers

Chaals
