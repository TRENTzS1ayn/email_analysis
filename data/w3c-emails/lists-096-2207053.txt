Hi,

I've had a repeating crash with Amaya 7.2 running under X windows/Mac 
OSX. The following sequence of events regularly produces a crash:

Open: http://www.w3.org/2003/04/09-w3m.html
Open in new window: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Team/w3mreq/2003Apr/
crash

Most of the time when I re-start amaya I do not even get the option to 
recover. The crash log is attached.

Thanks,

Danny
