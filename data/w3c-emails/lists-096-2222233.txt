Hello Danny,

We don't have a Mac version of Amaya and the Linux and Windows versions don't 
crash with those documents.
Do other Mas users (Charles, Carine,... ?) can test the same scenario with 
Amaya 7.2 or later and give us more info about this bug (that occurs when 
Amaya loads a style sheet, as mentionned in the crash log).

Thanks in advance

Laurent
