I used Apache 1.3.27 with mod_auth_digest and 
AuthDigestQop auth auth-int
in the main apache configuration file, as well as my own Digest
Authentication implementation in PHP. As I can't use the apache module
on my public web server, I have created a modified version of that
script which will tell you whether your browser works correct.

URL: http://www.ploetzli.ch/test/doauth.php
username: guest, password: guest

Note: Although the script asks to use qop=auth-int (to trigger this
bug), it is not implemented. However, currently I don't know of any
browser that supports auth-int.
