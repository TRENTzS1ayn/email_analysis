Hi,

I've never had much luck with Amaya's clipboard functionality under 
GNU/Linux, specifically copying between Amaya and other applications. I 
can copy between Mozilla, terminal windows etc, but not into, or from, 
Amaya.

Occaisionally I can paste once using the middle button and that's it. I 
can't find any specific mention of this in the documentation or 
archives. Is there a definitive, working way of using the clipboard with 
Amaya under X?

(I've tried Debian 3 and RedHat 8, both using GNOME 2 if this matters).

Thanks,

Leon...
