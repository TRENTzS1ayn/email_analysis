Hello all

At the last stage of installing Amaya on my mac (with Charles' very 
kind and very patient help),  while in the x11 window, after typing 
"amaya &", I briefly saw the Amaya program, but then Amaya shut down 
and I got this error:

Gdk-WARNING **: locale not supported by C library
gdk_imlib ERROR: Cannot load image: /sw/share/Amaya/amaya/annot.gif
All fallbacks failed.
*** Amaya: Irrecoverable error ***

in the terminal window.

If anyone has any suggestions on how to fix this, I'd appreciate it.

Thanks very much.
Amy
