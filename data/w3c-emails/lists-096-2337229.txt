To All

I have a prostate cancer web site that I maintain form men with prostate
cancer.  It is all done free - no ads, etc.  I have paid all of its
expenses.  It is accessed by 90 countries around the world and around
50,000 hits a year.  It is the best there is on its subject.

I created it with an old program (Quick Site) and have maintained it
through the years with this program that went out of business long ago.
Yesterday I loss lot of the program connections but I still have the
files.

Will Amaya convert my present web site  (http://www.prostate-help.org)
of almost 400 pages and let me maintain it with Amaya.  Or is there an
easier way.

I would even be willing to pay someone to convert it (if it isn't too
expensive) and send it all to me.
