How to copy from Amaya to the X-Window clickboard, then into an xterm?
1- Select a string by drag, double-click, or with shift+arrows in an Amaya window.
2- Click on the top of the Xterm window to raise it and paste the string.

How to paste into Amaya from the X-Window clickboard?
1- Select with the left mouse button, without drag, double-click, or shift+arrows 
     to have an insert point and change the X-Window application focus.
2- Then click the middle mouse button to paste the X-Window clickboard.
     Irene.
