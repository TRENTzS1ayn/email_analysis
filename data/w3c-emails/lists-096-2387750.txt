Update to my message of earlier today...

I completeley deleted my Fink (unix ports/dpkg util for Mac OS X) directory
(i.e. sudo rm -rf /sw), reinstalled Fink and then reinstalled Amaya. I now
have no problems launching the browser.

I suspect that my previous Fink installation included unstable libraries
which Amaya didn't like. If deleting your whole Fink installation is too
radical a solution for you, you could always try downgrading to stable
versions of all the packages on which Amaya depends.

Regards,

Patterson Waltz
