So this is an error in the dependencies declared in the fink package I guess.
If someone with a mac has a loko at
/sw/fink/dists/stable/main/finkinfo/web/amaya-7.1-3.info

(I think that's the right directory path...) you can see what the
dependencies are. Maybe Damian already had imlibs so forgot it was required.
Also there is an unstable package for 7.2 that should be checked...

Cheers
