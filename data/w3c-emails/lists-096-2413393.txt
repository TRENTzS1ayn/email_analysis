The Amaya team is proud to announce the Amaya pre-release 8.0-pre.
As this release includes a lot of changes in the internal code, the Amaya 
team prefers to make a pre-release before providing the public release 8.0
next week.
We hope many users will test this pre-release and will send us feedback to
have a more robust 8.0 version.
