Woohoo! <smile/> A couple of notes from my buglog/wishlist:

3. Bug: Not all id are shown when "show target" is selected. For example,
  http://www.w3.org/Team/Reagle/Overview.html#Ongoing
isn't showing the bullseye.
4. Wish: bounce (increase/decrease) the nesting level of nested
lists easily.
5. Wish: A shortcut key for skipping/replacing+next in the spell checker so 
I don't have to rely upon the mouse and compex navigation to quickly move
through the document.
