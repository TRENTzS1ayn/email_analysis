http://home.cogeco.ca/~ve3ll/htmlqwkh.htm  is a tutorial that uses the
pre tag quite a bit for examples.   However the rendering of monospace
as requested in z2style.css   adds too much white space as well as 
 losing the <strong> emphasis requested in one of the topics....
and i cant find a menu selection for setting the default type families and
sizes ..... the gui needs a dialog for user tuning of font families and sizes
when the stylesheet generic term is encountered.   //
