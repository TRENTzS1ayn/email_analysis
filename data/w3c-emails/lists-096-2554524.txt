  exhibits a problem with table sizing after an image.....
 there is an image called welcome. gif   that is directly
above the main contents table ........
the table is being placed after the image and the image is being considered
for resizing the table...... 
the student designer used a br tag to place table below image   which is
valid and works in other browsers   but  Amaya doesn't allow for line break
in its recalculation of table sizes .....   this may explain why other 
positioning constructs are going wrong too 
personally i would have done it by starting a new row  ......
however  the construct   
<table>
<tr>
<td>
<img src=...><br>
<table>.... </table>
</td>
</tr>
</table>       should compute table dimensions correctly .....   
is the break element being flagged and dimensions adjusted appropriately.
