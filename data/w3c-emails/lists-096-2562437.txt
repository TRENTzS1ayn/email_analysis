The standard way of dealing with an input text box once text fills the
available area (unless maxlenght has been set of course)  is to scroll
the text to the left and continue adding characters......
Amaya actually opens up the box vertically ( but text boxes are supposed
to be one liners) and adds material on a second line .... and a third if one 
keeps typing  ....  way wrong as it alters the layout of any form design
as a user adds input .....  
Perhaps observing what other browsers do may be a good idea .....  or 
soon we wil have something akin to cars with gas pedal on left    and
switches that are thrown upwards to turn the electricity off. ( sorry GB!)
