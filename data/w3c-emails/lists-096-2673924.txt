http://www.mozilla.org  illustrates some real problems in how 
table calculations can mess up displays in Amaya 8.0
on that site the contents slurp over the borders ....  while
digesting the problem into a 'small' file for testing as the 
attached illustrates, the contents now go the other way 
they do not file the table cell fully....   some math problems
in formulating where to position contents once the borders
are set is what i think problem is ....  akin to the last statement 
flopping into the middle box on the www.w3.org site .....     //
