Hi,

I know this is not an Amaya problem, but since I cannot run Amaya I'm asking for help  to you.

I downloaded Amaya 8.0 GTK and unpacked in a temporary directory (/zan/tmp/).
I ran /zan/tmp/Amaya/GTK/bin/amaya, the program starts buyt after showing for a relly short moment the introduction page, the program crashes.
What I get is:
libpng warning: Application was compiled with png.h from libpng-1.2.2
libpng warning: Application is running with png.c from libpng-1.0.13
libpng error: Incompatible libpng version in application and librarary
gdk_imlib ERROR: Cannot load image: /zan/tmp/Amaya/amaya/amaya.png
All fallbacks failed.

So I downloaded libpng-1.2.5, compiled and installed it, but I got the above errors.

Pls....help me.

Thank you and happy easter to you!!!
