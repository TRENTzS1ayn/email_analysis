I gave it a try and was able to recreate the error.  CSS2 states that 
background may be one or more of the values of background-color, 
background-image, background-repeat, background-attachment, or 
background-position in any order.

none is a valid value for background-image so it is valid for background 
even if it is not valid for background-color.  I think that Amaya may be 
thinking that because it appears in the specification with 
background-color listed firsted then that is what it should be 
interpreted as, but a look at conventions for the || separator would 
tell otherwise.
