Hi

1- The keyboard access to views has changed: now source is not any more 
atl-v alt-h in my Win2K pc but ctrol-u ctrol-h.
Using the menu it could still be alt-v alt-h but it's alt-v alt-u.

It would be fine to have the same keys for both menu accelerator and 
access keys ... Whay did you change the former bindings?

2- Bartolom? says alt+space crashes his Amaya. It doesn't happen here in 
Win2K. But, BTW, it doen't open the "control menu" as it should under 
Windows. Alt+tab should be like clicking the small icon in the upper 
left corner of almost all windows.

3- There is a small inconsistency. In the main window, as in the 
structure view, I can set attributes for the selected item. But the 
structure view window lacks the colors dialog. Try seting a table's cell 
background color and you'll notice how you miss a colors dialog in the 
structure window. It reduces it's "usefulness".

4- Now the litle bug: create a small table and give one cell a 
background color. Now select the cell (I must resort to the structure 
view for this), open the Style ==> Colors dialog and click "Default 
Colors": nothing happens (in prior versions it crached, now it does 
nothing).

5- The URI close to tne "Open" label remains "selected" even when it has 
  lost the focus. All other programs de-select text that doesn't have 
focus. This is a usability issue: trying to cut or copy the URI is 
tricky because you don't know it it's selected or not by simple inspection.
Test case: open any HTML file with Amaya using the Windows explorer for 
example. The URI is selected. Hit ctrol-x to cut it: it doesn't work. 
Click the page content with the mouse: the URI remains selected. Click 
at the right of the URI, the URI doesn't change but when ctrol-X then 
it's correctly cut.

6- Also, I was unable to move focus to the URI with the keyboard. In 
MSIE and Mozilla this can be done with ctrol+tab, which means moving 
from one focus cycle to another one.

With each release Amaya is becoming a more useful and dependable tool.
Thanks to the developers.
