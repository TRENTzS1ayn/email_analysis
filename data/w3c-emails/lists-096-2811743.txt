does amaya have xpointer support?? i tried to follow an xlink within an 
xml document and either i have it wrong or else the support is just not 
there.

i have a xml file that is similar to the one below. the xlink shows up 
in blue, but nothing happens when i doubleclick on it, but if the href 
value is something like "gomi.xml" (a file that exists), the xlink is 
followed properly. this suggests that xlink is working, but xpointer is not.

i'm using the latest 8.0-pre release

thanks,
--nitin
