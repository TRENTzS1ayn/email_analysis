I'm using Amaya and Emacs to produce an XHTML 1.1 plus MathML 2.0
document.  The document validates and has inline equations.  If you
read this document with Amaya 7.2+ or 8.0pre, make a modification, and
then save it, Amaya's XML pretty printer inserts spaces after each
math element.  This is bad if a math element is immediately followed
by punctuation.
