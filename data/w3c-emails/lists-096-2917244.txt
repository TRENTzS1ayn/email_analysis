Is there a way to use the vi text editor key bindings in Amaya?

If not, might this be added?  There would probably be a lot of interest
in this.  For example comp.editors has lots of posts like, "Does anyone
know of editors that let me edit XML using vi key bindings?"  Also, elvis,
a vi clone, can display html side by side with the html source that's
being edited, and this seems to be quite a popular feature of elvis,
suggesting that there's a lot of interest in simultaneously editing and
browsing editing html / xml / css - like stuff using vi key bindings.
