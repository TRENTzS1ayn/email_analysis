I guess you have not read the warning message... It does not ask if you want
to save, It just asks if you are sure to exit while there are unsaved
changes... (I found out the hard way)

Most other editors (of what ever kind) do have an option to save the
changes, it would be a nice additional feature for amaya.

On the other hand, Amaya has more details in which it differs from other
editors. Then, keep in mind, it is both an editor and a viewer and, above
all, just an example implementation of the html and related document
languages...
