well i tried to consult the help index on key bindings ....
the words are jumbled so close together -- ie no spacing
between lines, that it is virtually unreadable ...

and as an enhancement there should be a searchbox
dialog for one to type the subject into.

  what is the document name for setting bindings ....
i will use that method to see if info is that that i wish. --
