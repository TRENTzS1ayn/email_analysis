well i found a student with very good eyes and used to 
foreign language character sets ;-] ;-]  to read the menu
we found the right menu item shortcuts -- configuration
but it is extremely hard to click on because its zone
runs into that of the one above and the one below.  

this brings up another important item that is missing.  
most browsers indicate the target of any hot link  in the
status area of the display window.  Amaya should at least
give the option to turn this feature on or off.   that way i could
at least recover the name of the file  by using above student's
steady hand to move the mouse .....

or perhaps  just some spacing ;-] ;-] --
