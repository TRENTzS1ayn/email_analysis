i just realized that i had not stated that this is on the Win9x  platform.
other viewers may not be seeing this.

and i thought that the index file might be a html doc and as such that i 
could read the source to find the reqd name ( and purhaps a temporary 
workaround thru css to cure problem)  

however when in index  i can't view source (it is grayed out)  so that 
   ends that effort .... rats. --
