I have found a workaround ;-] ;-] ;-]  
by doing a zoom the problem is cleared.   and i can then zoom back to 
smaller and smaller font sizes with it retaining the line separation
clarity ....  when the index window opens it is ok  butthen it redisplays
without line separation. zoom repairs this for as long as window stays open.
so it looks like an initial  redisplay is what causes problem! 

still would like to see:
1] searchbox for item  rather than scrolling thru long list and search
finds could be more than on index list !!!
2] option to display the target of a hovered hotlink.
3] if index file souce cant be available like other source files even if it
   cant be editted. --
