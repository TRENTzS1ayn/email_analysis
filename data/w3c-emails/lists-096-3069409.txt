I installed Amaya 8.0 on Mandrake 9.0 and still does the same thing.

Previous message was running Amaya 8.0 on Windows 2000.

 

The tables are centered, but the background colour is left justified. If I
scroll down to the bottom

of the page and then scroll back up, the table is left justified along with
the background colour.
