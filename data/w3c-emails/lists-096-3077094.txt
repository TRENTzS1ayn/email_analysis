so i finally decided to learn how to use amaya as a sans-html  editor
i fired up 8.0 on a win 98 platform, selected file -- new -- xhtml1.0
 transitional  and got a dialog to enter a url ... i selected browse
nothing happened --- clicked on browse a second time and it popped me
out of amaya altogether .....
this is similar to the situation i am having when i try to:
  file -- open document -- browse  

is this just happening to me or is it restricted to win98 platform or ???
seems like not being able to browse is limiting me quite a bit. --
