was able to find out how to do background colors on most elements
  (( but the color template is extremely limited ))   but could not 
figure how to color the entire document. 
if one ends up going into the source code to do things, this defeats
its use as a sans-html editor....    once one learns html, then a 
hard core editor with browser view is a better approach.   i am hoping
to develop a sans-html   web authoring course and now am searching
for an html editor that is both flexible and produces good code ....
these are very scarce indeed ....  most either limit one severely or
   produce unverifyable code.   Amaya has promise but if one needs
to rely on touching source then it is not sans-html.--
