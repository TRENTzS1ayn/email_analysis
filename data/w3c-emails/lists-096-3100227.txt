if i ask to create a new xhtml1 transitional document and i get the
dialog for url ....  
if i use the delete button to attempt to erase the default,  amaya freezes 
after i delete two characters.   i then must use three finger salute to exit 
to windows.  
if i use hilite technique to remove the default it works and i can enter 
c:\temp\new.html  as desired     ---- really quirky  this one

and i went into style to add a background image   but once again the
    browse button failed --- first click dropped out of menu selector
and second try  popped me back to desktop again ...   
linkage from browse function to windows op system is really busted
at least in my case on a windows 98 platform. --
