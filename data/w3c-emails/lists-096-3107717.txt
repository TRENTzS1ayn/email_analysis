The included small file shows an interesting box dimension calculation error.
it is miscalculating the width for the table at the top forcing an extra wide 
box .... perhaps it is because the contents are h1 and h4 determined size
so wraps are wrong ????
if i delete the img references at bottom of page, the problem goes away...
the problem also exists where the images are there. refer to 
http://www.tmason1.com/   for the original that i extracted from and digested

another interesting point is that the missing images DID NOT bring up the 
alternate text --- i thought this was part of accessibility --- alt text to be 
displayed when file missing or not downloaded ..... --
