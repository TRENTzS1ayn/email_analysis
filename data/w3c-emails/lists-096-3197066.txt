Another bug, this one very annoying in a minor way:

9. I encounter many instances that when 
(a) the cursor is before the first letter of a next word and after a space 
and the preceding word 
(b) and I hit the delete key 
(c) not only does it delete the first letter of the next word, but the 
preceding space.

For example, where the carrot "^" represents the cursor position:
  "foo ^bar" [hit delete]
  "foo^ar"
