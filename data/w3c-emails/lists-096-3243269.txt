Hi,
I know this isn't any help to you, but I'm glad you asked this because 
I downloaded fink and apple's x11 with the intent of installing amaya 
8.0, and then couldn't figure out what to do next.

There seems to be some instructions about how to compile a version from 
source, but I didn't know which version to start with or how to go 
about it.

Thanks,
Sam
