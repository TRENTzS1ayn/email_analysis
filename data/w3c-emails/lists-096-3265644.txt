Hello,

there seems to be a bug in Amaya 8.0: A table data element with width=5% that 
contains a centered image of width 90 pixel will stick out to the left of the 
table if it's the first column, but the right side of the image will be 
clipped. Furthermore it seems that most browsers extend the width of the 
column to at least the width of the widest element. (Frames would display a 
horizontal scroll bar, but tables don't, right?)

Maybe have a look at the attached image and page source.

Regards,
Ulrich
