Hi!

I am running amaya 7.2 on MacOS X (compiled and installed with fink), 
but now I often have amaya crashed, e.g. when I use the slide bar. This 
is what happens:

> [cumulus:courses/2003/] claus% amaya index.html
> gdk_imlib ERROR: Cannot load image: 
> /Users/claus/.amaya/1/valid-html40STeEOF
> All fallbacks failed.
> *** Amaya: Irrecoverable error **

I also have tried to delete ~/.amaya directory, but without success.

Any idea what is going wrong??

Claus
