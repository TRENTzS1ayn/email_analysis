I just loaded Amaya 8.0 GL on my P 4 system running win xp pro with all
current upgrades etc.

I have discovered that when I move or close or minimize the graphics, SVG
library, or the timeline windows both windows including the browser/editor
window close and I have to restart the program. The same thing happens if I
open one of the above with the menu button and then click the button again
as if to close.

Upon opening I first must make a selection in the Confirm popup window ?your
previous Amaya session failed. Do you want to reload backup documents?

Any suggestions?

Eli
