after upgrading on a Win2000 system from ver6.1 to ver8.0 (downloading the
autoinstaller exe file, double clicking, starting after ending of setup) I
can't see anything: after opening a valid htm or html file (formerly edited
and wiewed by several browsers, as Opera, Netscape, MSIE) on the screen is
nothing to see only the title of the page in the appropriate field. In the
source wiew I see an empty sceleton of a new page, but not the loaded page.
What to do to enjoy the newer version?
   What to do if somebody want to help and make the hungarian language
   version?
Best wishes from
Bela Gyarmati
