Hello Bela,

Version 6.1 is quite an old one. We had a problem with the install
shield update maybe about that time.

You should uninstall Amaya, then install the new version. That
should set you up.

For the language translation, you can read the doc available at:

http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/Amaya-dev.html#Translatin

(there's a typo in the anchor name)

If you hurry up, we can use your translations and demo Amaya in
Hungarian in the Web conference :)

Regards,

-jose
