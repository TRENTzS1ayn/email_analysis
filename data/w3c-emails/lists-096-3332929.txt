Hello List,

My fansite http://www.hoehnermusikfan.net/index.xhtml  with many images
looked nice in previous versions, but it is a complete mess in Amaya 8.0
I downloaded yesterday, though I did not change anything. XHTML 1.1 and
CSS validate.

It is served it as application/xhtml+xml and looks nice  in Opera 7.0
and Mozilla 1.3, but now in this new Amaya release it is really
terrible. I think a very terrible bug must exist in this version,
especcially in floating images.

Greetings
Ineke van der Maat
