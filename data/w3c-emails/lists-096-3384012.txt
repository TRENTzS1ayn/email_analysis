http://home.cogeco.ca/~ve3ll/htmlqwkf.htm#st illustrates an interesting
problem with form nesting of elements

form.r  correctly centers the form {margin:auto} and colors it skyblue.
however the NESTED fieldset is drawn to the left of the container
as is all the form controls (they seem to be contained well in the frameset)

the problem is that the frameset is not positioned in the contained element
even though the container has used its info to get the width/height dimension
correct...

the algorithm that positions the start point for the contained is not being
set by the container...  this may be what is happening in all the nested
table problems as well .... positioning of elements works great on all 
first level stuff but fails in nested structures ....  suggest looking at 
indexing .... info is probably established but not pointed at correctly by
the rendering routine.   --
