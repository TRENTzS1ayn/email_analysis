just as an experiment i tried to use amaya for editting....
have already filed enough viewing errors ...

tried out xhtml forms 
1} there is no menu item for legend
2} if i try to place a control, amaya forces a form element
container.... this is incorrect. controls do not need to be 
placed in forms unless submission is required....

although amaya doesn't do javascript, this is the most common
use of controls today  and even submission is done thru javascript 
after verification... so  controls should not force forms...
unless you intend amaya as an editor for amaya only....
i am still finding tagging editors much easier to use than wysiAwyg
A stands for almost.....
mathml lacks a user configurable pallette to make it efficient.
that is user who is stats oriented   or logic oriented could set up
a pallette with their own frequently used symbols .....
have not tried svg yet ....    but it is only these specialty areas
that offer anything  better than other editors.....
