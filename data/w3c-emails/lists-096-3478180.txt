An SVG may contain a number of images or groups. from the source one 
can extract the code for these individual images. would it be possible 
to enable non-technical users to copy parts by being given a list of 
the contents, or even better for non readers, this could also be via 
right click on the objects.

for instance photo of politburo in Red Square, option to copy: whole 
SVG, Stalin, Trotsky, Molotov, background..... at the authors 
discretion.

or still life, option to copy: whole SVG, bowl of fruit, lobster, 
glass, bottle, dead duck :-)

thanks
