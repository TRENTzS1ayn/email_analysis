Hi

At our site, we have to use a style sheet that is somehow not accessible by
Amaya (it is only accessible by M$ software :-(() If I load a file that uses
the stylesheet, it just waits forever and only after I stop the transfer, I
can edit the file.

Currently, I just start on my document and once finished, I hack the
stylesheet into the html code using an ascii editor. However, I would like
to use a default page that already includes the link to the stylesheet but
have Amaya ignore the stylesheet in the edit mode.

In the print mode, there is an option to enable or disable the stylesheet
for printing. There it works. Can such a preference be made for the edit
mode? Or have I skipped an option and is it already available?


Thanks for Amaya (and the style view, superb)


CBee
