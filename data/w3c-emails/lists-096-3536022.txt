Reading this, I had a similar experience in an HTML document. I can
reproduce it with the default amaya startup page:

Put the cursor at the beginning of a word in the middle of a line,
space-character at the left side, word at the right side.
Press the delete key and keep watching what happens in screen.
As soon as there is also a space at the right side of the cursor and press
delete once, both spaces are removed.....
