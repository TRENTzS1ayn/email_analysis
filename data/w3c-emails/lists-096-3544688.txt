What it changed in the 8.0 version is the better control of spaces in HTML documents.
The goal is to avoid to display a space that will disappear as soon as the document
is saved and reloaded.

Perhaps I find the bug you wanted to report.
If after a delete there are 2 adjacent spaces, Amaya removes the space at the left and
not the space at the right. So if you continue to delete there is no longer space.
I fixed this problem, but I'm not sure it's exactly the bug you reported.
