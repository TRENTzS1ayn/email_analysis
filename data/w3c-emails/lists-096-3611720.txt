Is it possible to use one SVG to contain other SVGs, in a way that also 
enables the visitor to copy the contained SVGs and paste them into 
another document for instance into ms Word?
(That is by right clicking and copying or dragging etc not by digging 
around in the code)

if not, is this an enhancement request, or an SVG standards request?

thanks

Jonathan
