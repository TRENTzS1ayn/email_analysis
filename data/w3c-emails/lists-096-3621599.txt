by SVG do you mean SVG separate FILES ?

the svg  <image> can contains a separate SVG files...
The <use> can reference a part of a separate SVG files...

Word does not support nor understand SVG, 
so the only solution should be to take a screenshot of a SVG into Amaya, 
and then copy as an image in word.

An implementation, I think...
