Paul,

I really appreciate your efforts to understand this issue, as you'll 
realise I am still confused, it would be really helpful if you had a 
link to a <use> example, I've put one that uses <image> here 
http://www.peepo.com/svg/image.svg, it does not seem to display except 
in amaya.....

Repurposing graphics is really essential to our work, teachers need to 
be able to copy images from part of a single svg to the clipboard, as 
in to drag one egg out of a box of them, and paste them in a different 
document.

there are at least 2 issues:

1 does SVG prevent this, assuming not, does any implementation such as 
amaya allow this?
2is there another application/word processor that lets one paste them. 
Jim Ley believes this is possible with word*

If you visit peepo.com. you'll immediately see we use lots of SVG 
created images as links, unfortunately they are currently saved as gifs 
or jpgs. Teaching staff need to be able to easily copy these and paste 
them in another document. I  want to make sure that if the Amaya people 
can get their part in place, they are at least aware of the need. 
Naturally this could take months or years to achieve, if it isn't 
possible already.

thanks

jonathan

*Word would be able to embed SVG document into it as a COM object as 
PPT or otherwise if ASV is installed, I have no idea how it would print.
