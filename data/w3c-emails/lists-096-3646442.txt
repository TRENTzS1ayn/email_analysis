Ithink latest adobe svg player display embeded SVG (but doesn't animate them)...
Here's a use example http://tuan.kuranes.free.fr/svg/New.svg

I think the use mechanism is what SVG provide for those needs.
I only know Amaya allowing <use> with a external document contaning the SVG.

The problem is that the clipboard isn't really aware of what sort of infomation it's carrying,
 so if Amaya fill the clipboard with SVG (which is basically text) other will understand it as text...
It only can if in your Word processeor there's a "paste as SVG"

I've hear of some work on SVG within openoffice and abiword... maybe it's possible to import SVG 
(using a file import mechanism). you should check them.

Using Amaya and SVG images, you sould be able to Copy/Paste selecting the SVG then using CTRL+C in the view browsing peepo.com
and then CTRL+V in the view you're currently editing. (It even work now, with the gifs.)
But you must use Amaya to edit documents instead of Word. But why not ?

We cannot change the clipboard mechanism in order to make "he paste as SVG" possible in word processors... you should check and contact you word processors makers.
