Paul,

your example does not display in amaya7.1 on max os x10.2, or amaya7.2 
on msXP for me, the colorbox looks great when linked too directly.
Please can you post me another? assuming it works for you, can you 
confirm that the colorbox only is copied as a single entity and not a 
part of it, or the <svg> containing <use> . These are my main concerns, 
one reason not to use amaya, is that print preview is limited, but this 
is perhaps not critical, only a consideration.

Jonathan
