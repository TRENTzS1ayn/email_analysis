It worked on my local hard drive...
I found out a problem in file mime-type problem with my provider !
Until I can solve the problem, you should download the two files locally in the same directory :

http://tuan.kuranes.free.fr/svg/New.svg
http://tuan.kuranes.free.fr/svg/colorbox.svg

test them from here...
(you should try the 8.0 version (specially the OpenGL that is far more stable on XP now and allow transformation and animation...))

> the colorbox looks great when linked too directly.

It's a sample from the SVG library that's in Amaya (XML->SVG->Show SVG LIBRARY)
There's more in (the SVGs are in the Amaya/config/libsvg/ directory)
You should definitly check it out... Did you manage to use it ?

Not sure to understand the statement here...
The svg containing the colorbox could contains lots of <symbol> tags containing graphics entity,
the results would be the same, as the <use> specify to link only the one named "colorbox"
(as in <use xlink:href="colorbox.svg#colorbox">)

Look at the new version I've done in order to be more explicit:
in colorbox.svg there are two group defining a different box..
And in the main view (New.svg), you can add them separatly or add the same twice,
even change some inherited properties (stroke), etc. 
try removing in New.svg the first box (select it then usr the del key.) other box from the same file 
are still there.

It's important that you point out your needs in order to make us aware of them.
If we found out that it's a big need, we can consider adding "print preview".
