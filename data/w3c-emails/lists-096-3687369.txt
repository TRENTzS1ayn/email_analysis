Paul,

Examples are so great!
I had the impression from 
http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/struct.html#UseElement
"Unlike 'image', the 'use' element cannot reference entire files." that 
image might work, but not 'use'. Your New.svg shows me the way to go.

So far I can cut (CTRL-C) a colorbox out from New.svg, but not move it 
or paste it into the same, or another document.
Am I being dim? how does one paste it, or move it?
This only works on the PC not mac. and like you when uploaded to 
http://www.peepo.com/svg it fails to work :-(

thanks

Jonathan

I upgraded to 8.0,
