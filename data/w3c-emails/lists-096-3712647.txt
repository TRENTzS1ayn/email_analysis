Hello,

I just built Amaya from CVS along with libwww from CVS as per instructions in
http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/cvs.html
so that I can use it with a WebDAV server (Jakarta Slide).

It appears that it is working, as I can write to the server from Amaya, but I 
don't see a Cooperation menu as described in
http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/WebDAV.html#L654

I built it --with-dav.

What am I doing wrong?

Thanks for your help.
