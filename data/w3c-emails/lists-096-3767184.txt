It works here Amaya 8.0 using X11 forwarding and ssh
(on a Xfree 4.3 from a Xfree 4.1, both using gtk 1.2.10)
Perhaps it's a special homepage page with some special fonts ?

Does other gtk apps works fine with remote display ?

which version ?

Using Mesa ? 
Just download it from mesa3d.org. I just do a 
./configure && make install
If it's too slow, you could try http://fabrice.bellard.free.fr/TinyGL/

But did the GL version worked ?
