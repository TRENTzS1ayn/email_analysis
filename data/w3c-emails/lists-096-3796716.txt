Unfortunatly those error doesn't help us much... as they are internals to gtk

We need some information about your configuration...

Could you give use the results from 

#xdpyinfo
do you see a line with "MIT-SHM" in the extensions list? 

#echo $DISPLAY

could you try a homepage without any image (perhaps it's related to MIT-SHM ?)


if you can compile Amaya from the source, 
try adding this line :

gdk_set_use_xshm (FALSE);

just before 
   gdk_imlib_init ();

in Amaya/thotlib/dialogue/dialogapi.c:1966:
