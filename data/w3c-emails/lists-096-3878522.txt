Quick follow up on this. The maintainer of the imlib package has fixed
the problem, and (I believe) it is in unstable now. We'll move it to
stable as soon as we've confirmed it's working ok.

In response to Damian's comment above and the previouis messages, I 
have tried to install Amaya on Mac OS 10.2.5 just today (May 24, 
2003) and there is still a problem with gdk_imlib:

[macaudy:/sw/bin] mcaudy# amaya
GUI can't be initialized
gdk_imlib ERROR: gdk has not connected to the display
*** Amaya: Irrecoverable error ***

Is anyone else having (still) having this problem, or is this a new 
or different problem with gdk_imlib?

Thanks

Michael Caudy
