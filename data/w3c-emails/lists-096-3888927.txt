Well, if suse follows closely the rpm spec, it should, but it's not the best method...
Did you try the binary tgz distribution ?

Usual the first time, this is why we copy options.orig as options

If it cannot found gtk.h, gdk.h. gdk_imlib.h, there's two possibilities :

A) You didn't install the gtk-devel.rpm and gdk-devel.rpm that installs the gtk headers on your Suse

B) Our Configure didn't find your gtk headers. If you have slocate on your suse, could you try a : 
#locate gtk.h
#locate gdk.h
#locate gdk_imblib.h
and then send us the output
