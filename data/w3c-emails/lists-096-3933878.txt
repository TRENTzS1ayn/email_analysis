Paul,

sorry for the delay, it occurs to me that we should test for recursion.

that is how does your amaya cvs represent a file that uses <use> to 
call itself? if you post me a test file I can host it.
alternatively if that is asking too much how about a tertiary use, that 
is one where a file uses <use> to link to a file that <uses> use.

This will certainly be used by me if possible, for instance perhaps the 
sunglasses on people in a scene.

thanks

Jonathan
