In principle it shouldn't work. You need to construct a DOM tree or
equivalent, so you should get caught in an infinite loop.

In practise there was an exercise in doing this by putting the tiger picture
into a little spot on the eye of the tiger picture, and I believe it did work
(it might have used an image element, but that shouldn't be much different.

The idea of streaming, probably being introduced in SVG 1.2, should change
that. And there are demos where you get more content as you zoom - it
requires a bit of extra magic beyond the tiny module that I believe is what
Amaya is currently aiming at.
