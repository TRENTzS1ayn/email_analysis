Recusive use does work.
check the Sierpinsky triangle at  http://www.mecxpert.de/svg/fractals.html

But If a symbol contains a reference to himself using a <use>, there's a problem :
 Amaya never stops loading uses and goes into infinite loop until it succeed int freezing the computer...
It should exists a test to see when a use is useless, based on pixel rendered state (< 1 pixel or something like that...)
 or a hard limit (no more than 15 recursive <use>)... but it's hard to tell what solution to implement...

But I'm not sur that it's what you're looking for ? Real recursive use ?

You can have a external svg defining sunglasses, an other set of files containing people, and a SVG that use (external) people using (external, but the same) sunglasses.
This should work. Try it locally (on your hard-drive.).
