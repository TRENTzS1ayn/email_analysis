I have had a regular problem with Amaya 8.0 - perhaps someone can have a 
look?

Imagine a page where the markup ends up like this:

<h2>Placeholder 1</h2>
<h2>Placeholder 2</h2>

If I try to hit a carriage return between the H2s, either in source view 
or the regular view, Amaya crashes.

I have had other crashes, but this is the one I can most easily repeat.

Thanks for your attention to this!

Janet
