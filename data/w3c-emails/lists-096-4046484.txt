FYI,

When Amaya doesn't like the home page, it still (Amaya v8.0 on WindowsXP)
refuses to show its pretty face: I could see amaya only in the WinXP task
manager.  It'd be a nice feature if Amaya could recover from a bad homepage,
maybe by giving up and showing a "your homepage setting is not viewable"
page.  Because otherwise, if the user doesn't find his Amaya config file, he
has a real problem:  even uninstalling Amaya and reinstalling it will not
correct the problem and Amaya will remain unusable.

Amaya 8.0 spells thotrc "thot.rc" on WinXP I eventually found out.

The Amaya mailing list archives do not hide correspondents' email addresses
enough to frustrate harvesting by spammers.

OTOH, amaya's great. 

thanks,
George Herson

The file that defines settings is

AMAYA-INSTALL-DIR\users\username\thotrc on Win 98
 C:\winnt\profiles\username\Amaya\thotrc  on Win NT
C:\Program Files\Amaya\config on Win 2000
