GDK is part of GTK.  I think gdk-imlib is an interface to imlib which is
somehow friendly for applications using GTK, although I'm not entirely
certain.

I'm not sure what the canonical source is, but you should be able to get
the sources from a Debian mirror (because Debian distributes sources as
an archive and a separate patch for the Debian specific changes, you can
just take the archive and use it on other systems).  You'll find that at

http://www.mirror.ac.uk/sites/ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/i/imlib/imlib_1.9.14.orig.tar.gz

although I must confess that I've never built it from source.

An alternative might be to build the GL version, which doesn't appear to
require gdk-imlib.

I imagine so.
