Hello all,

I have been using amaya like a word processor and I have been impressed
advanced Web spec and language support.

But, I am wondering out loud why you have not considered porting to Gecko. 
Personally, I dont know anybody that likes Mozilla's commercial side and it
feels like Gecko needs to be rescued from [ big conglomerate deleted ].

Also, it seems that everything you write for amaya will have to be rewritten
for Gecko.. and.. lots of folks speak highly of XUL.

Just wondering,

John
