Hi Irene,

I'm not sure exactly which Debian packages you're thinking of.

I have the luxi fonts that appear in /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/TTF/ and I 
have a set of Microsoft fonts in /usr/local/share/fonts/ttfonts. 
xfontsel can see all these fonts, so I suppose they are accessible.

I confess I still don't fully understand what's going on with fonts and 
I've yet to find some document that clearly defines how 
Debian/Linux/XFree/etc should be set up (or why it should be so 
difficult with each application behaving differently!)

I have looked at the Amaya font.unix config file and checked that 
xfontsel can access at least some of the fonts listed there.

Thanks, Dave
