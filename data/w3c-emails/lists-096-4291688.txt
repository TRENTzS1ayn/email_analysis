This element has long been neglected by the development team
even though search engines and cgi bins need forms to provide them
with data ....   some of the ills are

html attributes not implemented: maxlength, tab-index, and disabled

css style properties not implemented: background, border, width  to 
name the most glaring misses

element insertion widgets .... many required attributes are not prompted
for... it would be nice if each insertion  opened up a dialog similar to 
the one for tables  where  the most common attributes could be inserted
in a block ...  this dialog would also serve as a learning tool for students
or learners as to what can be set on a specific control.
for example each control should allow name and id attributes to be set
 and perhaps class for those that use style ;-] ;-]    

trying to place a control forces a form element container which is not
 required by html spec and is undesirable in many instances. Forces
should only be made to maintain spec.....

The dialog approach could be applied to all elements for a consistent 
approach to element insertion.  Compulsary attributes could be flagged
as such and dialog reprompt if not completed correctly!  This would
 certainly help programmers who are html unaware...
