what happens if you need to change an attribute on an
element....  are you forced into using source view ???
 This would imply that every user is html format aware!!
To try to keep the user away from the code as much
as possible (and to enable more error checking like
  unique id, bad value trapping for attributes) it would
be nice if one could put cursor into element and then
use right click to bring up dialog box to check/alter
 common attributes.   Along with multiple attribute
   dialog, i think this would be a big step towards 
 making Amaya useful for a certain class of user....
 those that are newbies and would rather avoid html syntax...
For those that understand html and are comfortable with it 
there are other solutions ;-] ;-] --
