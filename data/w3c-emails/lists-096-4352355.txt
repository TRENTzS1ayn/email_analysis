I know the specification changed since we implemented forms
and now you can create an textarea outside a form which
can be handled by a srcipt.
This change will be done as soon as possible.
okay

When you select the textarea the attribute menu displays
all attributes applicable to it.
It's what I tried to explain in my previous answer.
nope IT DOES NOT
a fresh textarea has rows and cols attributes set to 
someone elses preferences ... the attribute menu does
not display rows OR cols for access
(workarround is structure or source views i know) 
and once again this is awkward to select one at a time
rather than a single dialog with all attributes sitting there
i also suggested as a right click from mouse so one 
just needs to set focus on item and right click rather than
looking for menus ((attribute menu could be left as a redundant method))

anyways this is just my take of the gui .... 
but i think your time should go to fixing things that are wrong first
then things that are unimplemented after 5 years in the spec (any ccs1)
-----   just stick gui improvements on the wish list for later days --
