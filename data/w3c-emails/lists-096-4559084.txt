I have no idea what can be wrong. I did the rtfm. I hacked a few chars in
and changed their style. As described I marked an area and clicked on create
rule. Nothing, absolutely nothing happened.

 

I opened an existing formatted page. Marked a contiguous area that had a
different style and clicked on create rule. Nothing, absolutely nothing
happened.

 

The document had an inline stylesheet and I saw it (and the styles) in the
treeview but no luck in creating or modifying. I am no complete ignoramus
with html nor css nor different tools but I am completely lost since
obviously nobody but me seems to have had a similar problem.

 

I checked also that Editor mode was turned on. So what else did I miss?

 

Thank you in advance (I feel pretty silly having to ask such a question)
