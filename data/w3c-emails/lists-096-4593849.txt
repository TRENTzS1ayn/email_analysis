Hello,

I recently downloaded Amaya for windows 2000. I have a
problem. I try to use the background-image property
for a table cell, and it is not working. In the CSS
review of Amaya, it says that the property is
supported. my page is validated as well-formed. It
shows all , except the problem i just explained.
besides, it loads completely in IE, Mozilla, and
Netscape.

What can I do?

thanks in Advance.
