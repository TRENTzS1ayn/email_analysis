Sorry if this is a newbie question, but why doesn't Amaya support onClick?
Is JavaScript not allowed in XHTML or something?    :-S

<img scr="image.png" alt="let's hope this works"
onClick="javascript:alert('cool, this works!);" />

If you click on this resultant image in IE, you get a box saying "cool, this
works". In Amaya, zilch.  What am I doing wrong?

Thanks.
