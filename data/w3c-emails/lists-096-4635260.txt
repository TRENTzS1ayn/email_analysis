Ah, I didn't realise.  I thought onClick was perfectly OK in XHTML.  I
didn't know I was breaking standards!  I'm just someone who's learning about
web design by making a personal website.  I found some sloppy but cool HTML
for making a side navigation menu and tidied it up to make it comply to
XHTML 1.0 Transitional, but it seems it's still not good enough if it won't
work in Amaya, or even in Netscape (as I've just realised).

I'm running the latest versions of Amaya, IE and Netscape on the worst
operating system in the world: ME.
