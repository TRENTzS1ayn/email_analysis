  Oh, I don't know anything about Netscape 4.  My memory doesn't go back
that far.  Is that something that ran on the Commodore 64? (lol)

  Ah right, I was wondering about that.  So, all the so-called XHTML pages
on the net are just hacks, really... HTML pages dressed up a bit to look a
bit like XML.  I'm living a lie! Maybe I should go back to HTML 4.   :-(

  Nah, I reckon I pretty much get it.  I've been reading a lot on www.w3.org
and www.alistapart.com recently.  I was just hoping it was possible to get
my nice dynamic menus to work without breaking the rules.  My site does have
an alternative navigation thing as well: drop-down menus with the following
(X)HTML

<form name='jump1' lang=fr-fr>
<select name='menu1'
onChange='location=document.jump1.menu1.options[document.jump1.menu1.selecte
dIndex].value;' value='GO'>
<option class="item" value="Item2.x.html">Item 1</option>
<option class="item" value="Item2.x.html">Item 2</option>
</select>
</form>

I hope that's okay.
