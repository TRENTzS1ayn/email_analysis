I don't know if this is same or different problem - I just installed 
amaya using Fink on a new Mac OS X (Jaguar) with X11 installed.  When 
I try to start amaya it starts okay, gets the initial screen for a 
moment, and then crashes.  The error reads:

Gdk-WARNING **: locale not supported by C library
gdk-imlib ERROR: Cannot load image: /usr/share/Amaya/amaya/annot.gif
All fallbacks failed.
*** Amaya: irrecoverable error ***

Since this is also a gdk related error, thought I'd mention it in this thread.

Apologies if this was discussed before (and I'd love a pointer to a 
solution) - I tried searching the archives w/o any obvious success
  thanks
  Jim H.
