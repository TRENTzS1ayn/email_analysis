Should not be dangerous, tough it show a strange GTK installation...

When you start Amaya from the command line with a webpage as parameter :
#amaya http://www.w3.org
or
#amaya test.html
(it will try to create an empty html file)
Do you get the same results ?

The probleme seems to be related to gdk-imlib, which is a subpart of gdk.
This library is supposed to handle pictures format.
Make sure it is well installed on your computer.
