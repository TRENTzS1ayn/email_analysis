OO design is possible in C of course.  C++ facilitates this to some
extent, but is not without its own problems.  An example: It is not
as dynamic as other languages, and if one is moving away from C then
the case for avoiding other OO languages must be made.

My opinion: definately not in the short/medium term -- you'd have to
be sure that porting to C++ didn't break anything, for a start.

The problem is basically too few developers. I don't see how moving
to C++ would help there.
