My concern is the that there aren't enough developers for Amaya and that all
the added features in Amaya will have to be rewritten for Mozilla.

When you google on free html editors, Amaya comes up first.  It seems there a
large number of people at least want to use it in their everyday lives.  A huge
problem for public software is quality assurance. 

I have found that amaya crashes often and unpredictably.  On the Mozilla side,
Bugzilla has been shut down, creating integrity problems for millions of users.
 Many products are built on top of it. 

Gecko has been embraced by Gnome making it sanctified as a public project, but
the rapid changes in the renderer is making the Gnome source difficult to
maintain.

Here is a company that seems to want to build a whole desktop from Gecko where
their version of Gecko is Penzilla.  They are open and seem to be aiming for
the embedded markets.

If amaya were to work with Gecko then it seems that the Netscape product would
more closely adhere to the goals of the W3C.
