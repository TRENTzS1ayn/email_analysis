Hello,

I installed Amaya for Linux / Drinou distribution (drinou.tuxfamily.org) with X-Window.

It works fine, but I have a problem I cannot solve alone and it makes it very difficult for me to read web pages.

I cannot change the default colour of fonts and so I have a kind of greyish-black window on which hyperlinks in page appear in grey (these can be read quite easily), but normal text appears in black and cannot be virtually read, my eyes distinguish it with difficulties from the back of the page.

What should I do to solve the problem? I found nothing about this in the documentation, this is why I decided to disturb you.

Thanks for your feedback and best wishes for your job. I hope I will see someday an office package based on Amaya...

Regards.
