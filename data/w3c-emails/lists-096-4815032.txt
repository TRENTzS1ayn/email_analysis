I did that because the whole text of the paragraph was selected and not
the paragraph itself. A simple F2 (or Esc on Unix) changed the selection
to the paragraph. The bottom line of the window informs you about the
current selection.
It makes sense to apply a style to whole current text and not the paragraph
itself. This style won't apply to new created text after the span.

I suggest you select within the span, hit F2 (or Esc on Unix) to select the
span and remove the class attribute (with the Attributes menu), then you
hit F2 (or Esc) to select the paragraph and re-apply the class.
