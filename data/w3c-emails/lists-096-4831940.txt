We have a number of folks using Amaya 8.0 on Linux (Red Hat 9.0).
For the last 66 buttons as well as the 1st button, the buttons are
not labeled. (This makes math mode unusable, since the missing
labeled buttons include essential characters like greater-or-equal,
plus-or-minus, approximately, set operators, logical operators,
summation, root, differentiation, etc.)

If clicked, the buttons do generate the correct characters, so it's
just a problem of labeling the buttons. Perhaps the wrong font is
used by default. (The main Amaya window has no problem with
displaying those characters, so it's not that the machines don't
have a suitable font installed.)

If the problem indeed turns out to be the choice of font used
for the palette, then given that Red Hat is such a common Linux
distribution, perhaps a different default font could be used
in the next release?

In the meantime, any ideas on a workaround? Perhaps advice
on some font to install?

    Thanks in advance,
