Thank you for the suggestion. We went through these steps but the
problem persisted. It appears to be an incompatibility between Amaya
and the GTK version in RedHat 9.0. Here's why:

1. We managed to install RPMS package version of Amaya 8.0 (GTK
   version), which was downloaded from w3.org, onto RedHat 9.0.
   We experienced the font problem on the Greek Letters palette.

2. We installed the same RPM (GTK) package on a PC running
   Mandrake Linux 9.1. No problem with the Greek Letters palette.

3. We compiled Amaya 8.0 from the source code with GTK option
   on RedHat 9.0. The resultant binary still exhibits the same
   font display problem on the Greek Letters palette.

4. We compiled Amaya 8.0 from the source code, using Motif (lesstif)
   instead of GTK (ie.  --without-gtk). No problem with the Greek
   Letters palette, even without installing the esstix fonts.

5. On Solaris platform, we compiled Amaya 8.0 from the source code,
   with GTK option. No problem with the Greek Letters palette.

Our RedHat 9.0 (not 8.0!) systems were created with the vanilla
installation process, and should not be the cause of the problem.
It should be easy to replicate the problem by trying step (3) above.
Hope this info is useful.

    Thanks and regards,
