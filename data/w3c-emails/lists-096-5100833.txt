If you put this into your user stylesheet (called amaya.css in the directory
where local info is stored - ~/.amaya on Unix, and I don't know where in
Windows) then it will be applied to all documents, although overridden by
anything with its own stylesheet.

You do need to remember that documents you are editing don't have a
stylesheet applied to them except for your own use, so you might need to add
the rules into a stylesheet explicitly linked.

I think the Amaya style interface is due for an overhaul, but I don't know
the details about when that might happen. (I also think it is still about the
best styling interface I have seen, although the options it presents are
limited and not all good ones)
