Emamanuelle is right. As long as there is no indication for preserving spaces, 
spaces and new lines just after the start tag and just before the end tag are ignored.
So "<strong>     a and b      </strong>" is equivalent to "<strong>a and b</strong>".

In your case you have to put the space after the end tag.
