I have not been following this thread very closely, so if I am off the mark 
please excuse me. Consider the following two cases:

Case 1:
<strong>a b</strong> c

<strong>a b </strong>c

Case 2:
<strong><span style="font-size: 200%">a b</span></strong> c

<strong><span style="font-size: 200%">a b </span></strong>c

In Case 1 both examples yield the same result, while in Case 2 the space 
between the characters "b" and "c" is wider in the second example.

Note that this is at variance with HTML 4.01 recommendation:

"In order to avoid problems with SGML line break rules and inconsistencies 
among extant implementations, authors should not rely on user agents to 
render white space immediately after a start tag or immediately before an 
end tag."
