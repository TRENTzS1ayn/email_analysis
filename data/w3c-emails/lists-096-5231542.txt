Doesn't look that way. I tried to compile 7.1-GTK, then used a 7.1-GTK
package that someone else compiled, and in both cases, I got the exact
same result when I attempt to start Amaya: 

Gdk-ERROR **: 86
  serial 110 error_code 86 request_code 51 minor_code 0

This was under RH7.2, though, so it may be different under RH8.0.
Haven't tried it yet, though. Because Amaya 7.0-GTK is still working
just fine for me.

Don't know what's going on, but it's obviously in the code that was
changed between 7.0 and 7.1
