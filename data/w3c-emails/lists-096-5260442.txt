Some suggestions about FTP possibilities for AMAYA using HTML Interface : 

 The FTP utility that adds a new button to Browser, the FTP button, that shows a FTP Toolbar in a similar way to Radio Button in Internet Explorer.

The buttons that would appear in the FTP ToolBar would be ( like the WS FTP buttons) : 

- Connect (to select the FTP server).
- Cancel 
- Options
- Exit ( the download/upload can continue even if the FTP button has been loosen ).

In the Browser?s  Window would appear six frames: 

- One LOCAL SYSTEM ( para el disco duro local )

- The second, near the first, with the necessary buttons to manage local files ( change Dir, Make Dir, *.*, View, Exec, Rename, Delete, Refresh, DirInfo, los mismos de WS-FTP, pero en formato web)

- Central with transfer buttons ( -> y <- ).

- Fourth for REMOTE SYSTEM

- Fifth to manage local files ( change Dir, Make Dir, *.*, View, Exec, Rename, Delete, Refresh, DirInfo) 

- Sixth, under the rest, would be the Status one.

In Browser?s Edition  function  would be included a command "Save with FTPWebbrowser" that would open Internet Explorer with the local address of the file to transfer - and if saved in Options - the remote address to upload the edited page.
