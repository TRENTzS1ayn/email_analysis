Ciao a tutti,

I'm using amaya-gtk 7.1 and I've discovered that .png files are not supported.
Including a .png in a file causes the crash of the program.
Wel, I changed the picture from .png to .jpg and everything returned ok.
Is there a reason for this?? I see that .png is a really used format.
Or there is something wrong on my machine???
