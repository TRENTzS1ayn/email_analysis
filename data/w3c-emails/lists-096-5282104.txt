Sorry for repeating my question about the handling of PRE tags in AMAYA

I use PRE tags to display aligned columns of monospace text.

AMAYA garbles this in two ways.

1) On every "save" there is an additional LF inserted after a <BR> 
inside <PRE>.
(These <BR> are inserted when touching the file with the Mozilla Editor)

So after a few changes the file becomes ill formed.

2) There is an AUTO wrap feature within AMAYA that inserts a LF after a 
certain amount of characters. WHY ?

Any comments how to get rid of this annoying behaviour are most welcome.
