I have been attempting to install Amaya for several days now and I am
unable to complete the installation. In addition I don't know describe
what is happening. I'm still trying to find my way around in this
system.

I have gotten the output from the terminal when the program is
installing and I hope that a knowledgeable person will be able to tell
me what I am doing wrong. I appreciate your assistance.

I am using Mandrake 9.0. Let me know what other information you need and
I will see if I can find it. 

I used gurpmi to install amaya on my system. Below is the output I got
as a result of the attempt to do the install. I can't even describe what
is going wrong because I don't know what I have done. I am sure that the
dependencies are in.



[john@localhost john]$ gurpmi /home/john/Amaya/amaya-7.0-1mdk.src.rpm

What must I do to complete the install and use this program?

Thanks,
