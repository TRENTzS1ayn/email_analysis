Hi,
     I am working on an XML Schema tutorial and have been checking example
files of instances using Amaya.  One of the files contains the following
document root element -

<memo xmlns="memorandum.html"
      xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
      xsi:schemaLocation= "memo.xsd"
      date="2003-01-01">

     I spotted an error in the text which I edited with Amaya and it then
wrote out the file.  The document root element is now -

<memo xmlns="memorandum.html"
 xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
xsischemaLocation="memo.xsd" date="2003-01-01">

Note the missing colon in "xsischemaLocation"!!

I also note a couple of other oddities - 

     The second line above starts with a space and the third doesn't

     The entire output is not 'pretty' - ie there is no structure based
     indentation.

     When I seek to set an attribute on one of the elements, the attribute
     list offered includes all of the attributes defined on any element in 
     the schema.  The schema validates using the W3C beta test service, so
     there should be no problem on that score.

                Over to you!

                                Keith Hopper

PS I am still using 7.0 as I can't seem to get the linux GTK version of 7.1
