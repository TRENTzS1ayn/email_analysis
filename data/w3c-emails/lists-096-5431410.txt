Hi,

I'm using Amaya 7.1. Sometimes I have multiple Amaya browsing
windows open, say A and B. A has a link to B and B has a link to A.
If I am in window A and double-click the link to B, then window B
becomes highlighted and receives the focus. This is what I expect.

If I minimize window B first, the focus remains in A. Is there a
feature or option that I can set that causes window B to be un-minimized
and receive the focus in this case? 

Thanks,
Robert
