Hello Brant,

This bug is now fixed. Actually, it was due to a modification I made before 
the last release to manage the BOM issue.

> Amaya has an XML parsing issue that causes it to not report an error

> [Definition: *Validating processors* must, at user option, report

Amaya 'only' uses a well-formedness processor for XML documents and checks 
validity for some known formats like XHTML, SVG and MathML.

> Expected Results:
> A message similar to the following should be given:
> XML Parsing Error: xml processing instruction not at start of external entity
> Location: file:///F:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Brant%20Gurganus/My%20Documents/Personal/brant.xhtml
> Line Number 1, Column 2: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
>                        -^
> 
> Please not that the above sample is from Mozilla which is not a validating processor and by the definition of such is not required to check for this.
