Yeah, me too. I even like the source view, although I didn't think it was a
good idea at the time...

There is an option to annotate a document in the annotations menu, which is
the functionality you are asking for. But it would be interesting to have
some more control in the user interface over how context URIs were
constructed - should it be an Xpointer, or an IDREF, or someting else? I
suspect that in the first two cases there should be a simple choice, perhaps
made automatically so if the thing being annotated is a target it gets a URI
like http://example.com/#foo and otherwise it gets an Xpointer (idrefs are
likely to change less often than xpointers, I suspect). But it would be good
to have an opportunity to edit the annotation target it is keeping - for
example to allow the use of RDF "fuzzy pointers" or other mechanisms that are
more robust over changes.
