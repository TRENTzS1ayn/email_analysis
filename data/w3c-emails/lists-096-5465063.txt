I am running Windows 2000, as of a couple of days ago Amaya 6.4 was running 
fine.  Then I suddenly began receiving a messagebox:

(source: WIN_TtaSetToggleMenu(1) Error 1401 : ERROR_INVALID_MENU_HANDLE)

This appears every time I move the cursor up or down between lines, either 
by clicking or using the mouse.  The messagebox always appears twice. After 
dismissing both occurences, I can continue to edit.  The application appears 
otherwise to work fine, although I haven't done much additional work, as 
this behavior makes the app pretty unusable.

The "suddenly" broken (but now completely consistent) behavior is extremely 
puzzling.  I've checked the Amaya directory tree to see if there was some 
sort of corrupt config file (registry too, just in case, I kind of assume 
Amaya doesn't use the registry, for platform independence).

I uninstalled 6.4 and installed 7.1 and am experiencing the same behavior.  
While I personally haven't made any changes to my system, I am on a 
corporate desktop that is managed by another group, so I do not know for 
sure that they haven't installed a service pack or hotfix recently, I am 
trying to determine this.

Any thoughts?
