I cannot reproduce your bug on my Windows box but I'm not sure I made the 
same test. Could you give us more information about the context:
1. Does the bug appear as soon as you start the application and select?
2. Does it appear when you have only one open document?
3. Do you have open a dialogue before?

The message  WIN_TtaSetToggleMenu(1) is displayed when Amaya tries to
change the status of a toggle entry in a menu and it receives a bad menu reference. 
It could concern either XHTML->Information type or XML->Charater element menus.
