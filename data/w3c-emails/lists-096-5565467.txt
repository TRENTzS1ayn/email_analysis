   I have this problem too. It seems that Amaya looks for the 
configuration file in c:\winnt\profiles\user_name instead of the right 
directory (c:\Documents and Settings\user_name). I don't remember what 
is the right way to get the correct profiles directory under windows, 
but I remember there's some function that do that.
