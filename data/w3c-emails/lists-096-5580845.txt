The installed files is this one?
C:\Program Files\Amaya\Windows\bin\amaya.exe

Because I am using XP chinese version, I'll try to
translate the "terms" in english the best i can.

If I right click -> property -> General (1st tab) :

(at the bottom) mode: Read only , Hide <- both are
unchecked

Advanced... : everthing is unchecked

So, is this the "execute/read/write access" you are
talkinga about?

Thanks all.
