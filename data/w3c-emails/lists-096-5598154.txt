Hello,

I see nothing in the FAQ about that.

With Windows ME, french version, If you try to open a file with amaya and
this file lies in a directory with a letter with accentuation in it (like ?
or ? ) , Amaya open an empty window.

Changing the name of the directory "solve" the problem.

Be seing You

A.G.
