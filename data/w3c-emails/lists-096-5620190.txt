The solution is not necessarily to rebuild configure from configure.in
(although I did throughout this process).  I ended up having to do a full
text search and replace of all calls to sed with gsed throughout the
configure script.  I did this because not all references to sed are
eliminated just because you put gsed in configure.in.  The problem is
apparently a little more fundamental than that.

This is obviously a band-aid, but I'm not going to sift through the
spaghetti known has configure.

Anyway, it's working now.

Thanks,
