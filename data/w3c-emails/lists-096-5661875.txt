I made one of the normal (restricted) user into an administrator , and Amaya can be opened in that user.
So i think amaya can only open in user with administrative privileges. May be some of the files needed is in restricted directory.
If that is the case, is this easy to fix and when ?
Thanks.

The installed files is this one?
C:\Program Files\Amaya\Windows\bin\amaya.exe

Because I am using XP chinese version, I'll try to
translate the "terms" in english the best i can.

If I right click -> property -> General (1st tab) :

(at the bottom) mode: Read only , Hide <- both are
unchecked

Advanced... : everthing is unchecked

So, is this the "execute/read/write access" you are
talkinga about?

Thanks all.
