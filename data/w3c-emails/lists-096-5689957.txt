Hi:

Thanks for the note.  I was messing around with the W3C validator for
various specs.

The 'doing badly' was trying to come up with a CSS that would replace using
tables for rendering layout presentation.  I was having difficulty finding
_anything_ that would render the same under Amaya, Mozilla, and Internut
Exploder.  I must say I'm not encouraged by what I've seen so far.
