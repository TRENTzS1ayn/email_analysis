Hello Mauricio,

Right now we don't have any special code for Windows XP. The
default behavior for Windows NT is used throughout. That is, 
the users Amaya directory is considered to be

windowsdir\profiles\username\appname

Where windowsdir is returned by the GetWindowSDirectory() WIN32
system call. It is the syscall that is returning winnt and not something
hardcoded into Amaya. If you get it, maybe you presevered your Amaya
thot.rc file from a previous Windows (non XP)? Or maybe it's normal
it returns this value.

Can you tell me what is convention for Windows XP (or quote
a reference). Also, if you know what is the syscall to get that
directory, that could save us time!

Many thanks,

-jose
