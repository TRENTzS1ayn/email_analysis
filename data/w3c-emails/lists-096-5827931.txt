Vim (http://www.vim.org) has pre-compiled binaries for the mac.  It
supports syntax highlighting for many languages and has loads of other
features.  Personally, I don't use the syntax highlighting, but I know
it does a pretty good job.  If you're not a vi user, there are also GUI
versions that allow a little more "usual" interaction model in addition
to the keyboard commands.

Cheers,
