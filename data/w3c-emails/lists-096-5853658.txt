Are you clicking it with a list (not just a list item) selected?

I realise now that you might want to be able to make the transformation for a
couple of items out of a list.

If there is no applicable transformation you should get a message in the
status bar. Otherwise there might just be a bug somewhere, but I would be
surprised because I use this feature a few times a week, and have done across
many releases...
