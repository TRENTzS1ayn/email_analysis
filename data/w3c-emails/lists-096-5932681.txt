Hi to all  
  I have downloaded  Amaya 7.1 . It runs normally when opening local files.
I have set the proxy as 10.150.1.254:80 from which I can access Internet via
IE . But, there is no message that I  can obtain after inputting URL in the
browser. Of course, I can't access Internet via amaya. Please help me.
Thanks!
  
     Best regards!

                                       chris
