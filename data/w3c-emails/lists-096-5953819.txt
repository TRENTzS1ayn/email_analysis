Hi,

Amaya will launch if the user has administation
privilege.

I think this is what you are talking about here. A
normal user do not have administrative privilege to
write in c directory. As soon as I change the user
privilege, Amaya runs ok.

So , is there anyway that someone can change this
setting? Try to create the temp directory/files in the
user's directory in "Documents and settings". Just
like Mozilla, it create a profile in user's directory.


Bye.
