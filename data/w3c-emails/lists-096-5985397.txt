Chaals,

as I owe you a few, and i had a moment there is a line:

</td><td align="left" width="100%">

which is not in a <table>, it is roughly one third of the way down, 
line 69 according to validator.w3.org.

remove this line and the page opens OK, it no longer looks great 
however.

best wishes

Jonathan
