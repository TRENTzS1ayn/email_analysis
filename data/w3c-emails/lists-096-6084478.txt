I have just obtained 7.1 for win98 and it seems much better than the
6.x I was using before.  Thank you.

I've a question about access key support.  How does the user of
Amaya, when using it as a browser rather than editor, determine that
elements of the current page have accesskey functionality defined,
and which ones they are?

I could not find this in the help, and since these are defined by
page authors they cannot be simply deduced. The help information
concentrates on how to create the accesskey items and how to make
use of them once they are known.  To be fair, this is not
only a problem in Amaya: Mozilla and Internet Explorer both seem to
be rather quiet about what has been defined.  I could find no
mention of how one is supposed to discern this information whilst
reading the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines, so if there is a
general principle for most browses, I have missed it.

A similar issue applies to targets.  When the viewing of targets is
enabled, the round target correctly appears next to links of the
form <a name="x">x</a>, but as far as I can see there is no visual
display of what the name or id is, for example when the pointer is
over the target.  This would be useful when browsing sites to which
you want to create links; the information on what form the link
should take would be immediately to hand.

        Thank you,
        Hugh
