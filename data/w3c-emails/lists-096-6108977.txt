Yes, there're obviously several problems related to proper encoding. 
Maybe they're easier to reproduce by using the ??? character for people 
working on Western computer systems.

Amaya - I'm using in 7.1 with Windows XP - will output a character 
reference &#x80; with US-ASCII, and a "raw" ??? character with ISO-8859-1. 
In the both cases, its behaviour is wrong. It should use &#x20AC;, 
&#8364; or &euro; instead.
