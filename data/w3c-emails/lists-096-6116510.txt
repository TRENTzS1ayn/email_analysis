In a previous message I stated that numeric entities give the code 
position in the document character set. Someone has pointed out to me that 
"document character set" is a fixed concept with respect to SGML 
applications like HTML and XML, so my commentary about Amaya being correct 
in outputting Windows Code Page code positions is misguided. Ah well, what 
can you do when the reference implementation is broken? :-(

Too many years with MIME I guess...

Apologies,

Archer

End.
