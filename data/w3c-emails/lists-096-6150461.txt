I have always been curious with regards to Amaya not rendering most 
complex web sites correctly.  This makes me wonder as I thought Amaya 
could be used to check whether a site was compliant with w3c standards. 
  For example, www.lds.org does not appear at all as it should.  What 
forces are at play here?  Is Amaya eventually going to be able to 
render more complex sites such as these?

Thanks for any info.
