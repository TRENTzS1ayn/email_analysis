Hi,

For this particular site, www.lds.org, they use
javascript to write some of the HTML code, and Amaya
does not support javascript.

As stated in their FAQ (
http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/FAQ.html#L670 ):
Due to a lack of manpower, we have no plan to
implement them. Any external contribution is welcome
in this domain.

But I myself also wonder what is the position of Amaya
in the browser market and its future. I use Mozilla
and it is a great browser, and it is open source.

Amaya's target users are developers, web
designers/programmers. Amaya does have some cool
tools, but until it can render pages better ,  and
becomes more stable, it's use is limited.

Is there in any way that Amaya can utilize some of the
codes in other open-source browsers and give itself a
leap in rendering ability, such as CSS, javascript,
etc. ? Or join efforts with other open-source project
?

I understand that there are lots of loyalties and
prides involved in this field. I don't want to offend
anyone at all. I don't know anything about programming
a browser. So this is just a thought coming from a
"user" and a supporter of "open-source" and the
"standards".
