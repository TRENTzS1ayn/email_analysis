Hi again,
 
Problem solved:
I had to add the DOCTYPE
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN">
to the top of the file set as my Home Page for Amaya to run.
 
Though this file opened fine in the past, I thought the home page setting
might be the problem, but I couldn't find where to change that setting in
WindowsXP manually, outside the program.  
 
In any case, I think crashing because of a missing doctype can be looked
into.
 
bye,
George Herson

Subject: Amaya 7.1 on WinXP will no longer start



hi, 

As of this morning, Amaya 7.1 on WinXP won't start.  

Amaya was working fine when I left work yesterday, but despite its
uninstall, a Window XP System Restore to two days ago, and three amaya 7.1
reinstalls, Amaya will only flicker on the screen for an instant, then
disappear, when I try to open it.  The only way I can get Amaya to stick
around longer than that is to right click its icon on my desktop, choose Run
As, then Ok (with the defaults: run as Current user and Protect my computer
from unauth. activity).  Amaya will shows its face, so to speak, but doesn't
work: garbage shows up in the location field, I can't open any files, copy
and paste doesn't work, etc.  The only error message I've seen from this
problem so far is when I tried to browse http://w3.org/amaya
<http://w3.org/amaya> . I got:

Debug Assertion Failed!  
Program: C:\Program Files\Amaya\Windows\bin\amaya.exe  
File: fopen.c 
Line: 54 

Expression: *file != _T('\0') 

Suggestions? 

thanks, 
George Herson
