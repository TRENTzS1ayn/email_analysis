With that doctype, Amaya uses its HTML parser instead of the XML expat

The file that defines settings is

AMAYA-INSTALL-DIR\users\username\thotrc on Win 98
 C:\winnt\profiles\username\Amaya\thotrc  on Win NT
C:\Program Files\Amaya\config on Win 2000

You're right, even if the page cannot be displayed due to an error in the parsing
it should not crash.
