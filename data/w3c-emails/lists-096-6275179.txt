Greetings,

I've only been using Amaya (7.1 - Dec 12 2002 on WinXP Home) a
couple of weeks, but I'm thrilled to have what appears to be a reasonably
powerful, fairly up-to-date, XHTML-compliant editing tool at the right
price: free!  However, from the very beginning, I've experienced what
appears to be an annoying oversight in a package that otherwise handles
i18n issues fairly well:

I can't have high-ASCII characters in paths (at least locally)!
The problems constantly pops up when I try to view or edit a file in my
personal My Documents folder in Amaya.  Since my WinXP username is
"Roberto Ord??ez" and it seems to work for any other path that doesn't
contain non-7-bit-ASCII characters, I believe I've isolated the problem.  
However, I don't see why this is a problem (then again, I haven't dug into
the source code to try to isolate this, either).

Can anyone shed some light on this problem?  I don't currently
subscribe to this list, so please reply via email.  Thanks!
