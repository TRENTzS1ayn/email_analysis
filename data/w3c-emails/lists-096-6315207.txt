I have downloaded the Win98 version of this, and ran it.  I got the
box with the perecentage bar as for 7.1, but the installer never
came up , and I have no amaya.exe installed.  I got no error
dialogue boxes either.  I obtained it by http, so as to avoid any
filetype=binary/text issues, as I have in the past.
Any idea where the diagnostic messages would have hidden themselves?
