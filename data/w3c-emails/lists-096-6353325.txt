Hi,
     I have just downloaded the GTK version of 7.2 for linux - it works out
of the box - BUT!

     It seems as if the margin-left and margin-right 'auto' for tables is
not working yet - is this still a bug?

     If you wish to look at an 'offending' document, try

http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/Teaching/0657.333A/index.html

which has such a table (class="mid"- see the style sheet) at the bottom.

     Another minor idiosyncrasy - when scrolling the document window, the
background image gets plastered in all sorts of positions during scrolling
- offset laterally by about two thirds of a window (the background image
has a 'spine' near the left edge which makes its appearance elsewhere
psrticularly noticeable).  This may be an artefact of the relatively slow
CPU (~300MHz) showing up a bug which isn't visually apparent when using a
faster machine!

     On the other hand, it seems to be a great improvement over 7.0.

     Well done all!!

                        Regards,

                                Keith Hopper
