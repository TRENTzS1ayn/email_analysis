Hi folks who have trouble with the windows 32 bits version.

The problem comes from the double dot used in the name of the software
(.2.exe)

For my part i had the ability to add the .2.exe as a binary extension inside an
external download manager and i am running Amaya 7.2 on Windows XP
very well.

Irene : please remember for the next version not to include a double
dot :-)
