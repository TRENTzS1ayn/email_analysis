this version executes aok but first new bug is seen on
http://home.cogeco.ca/~ve3ll/home.htm
there is a logo image beside a navigation section.  
This is a one row two column table. cell one for image
and cell 2 for the navigation info.  however the left table
cell does not have its coordinates calculated correctly and there
is overlap of right cell into image .....   this occurs thruout site
as the navigation table is used to give consistent look....

is this one to add to bug list --- table cell width precalculation
   for content other then strictly text as it is image that determines
size in this case ?????
