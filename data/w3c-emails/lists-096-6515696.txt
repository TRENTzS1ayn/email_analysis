ok -- i prefer to leave the bugs in if the display is good on the major
browsers. this way i can spot when things are fixed rather than filling
my documents with workarounds.  I have recently dropped doing most
of the net4 workarounds cuz they aren't needed as only dead guys are
using it.  Thanks for info though ... hoping fix comes fairly soon.  each 
version of amaya becomes more readable (except for forms of course).

The bug is in the image ratio recalculation that doesn't resize correctly its
box.

Until a bug fix, you could  precise "by hand" the height in you css file on 
the
image nav class, so that amaya doesn't have to incorrectly resize the cell
based on the aspect ratio.

Thanks for the report.
