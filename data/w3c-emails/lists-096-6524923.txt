http://home.cogeco.ca/~ve3ll/htmlqwks.htm#re
has a topic on repeating images ... apparently this
is not implemented yet in amaya ...
however the image should at least appear once!  
and how does one place an alternate text for background
urls not found such as in this case if it wasn't inline style 
but as style element or in stylesheet???   //
