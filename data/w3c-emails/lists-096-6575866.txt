i know these fixes are tweaks that will show up in binary format
with march version....  what i am hoping for is that someone finds
one of those catastrophic glitches that force immediate repair and
rerelease of 7.2 .....   but i can wait ....   or maybe test deeper.
right now i am just evaluating look of existing sites  for  really 
  noticeable stuff...   not very systematic but it sometimes catches
  stuff missed by the test suites or scripted tests...

This bug was generated by the new support of CSS attached to object.s
It's fixed now.
