http://home.cogeco.ca/~ve3ll/htmlsked#student
shows a very messed up table of student sites
was this fixed at same time you fixed recalcs for the
other page i presented yesterday ... if not maybe it
can be looked at too .... table is so mangled, it cant
be used at all to get at sites that i wanted to test amaya on.
these sites are all basic stuff -- hopefully valid as that is 
what i emphasis in course, and no tricks.   //
