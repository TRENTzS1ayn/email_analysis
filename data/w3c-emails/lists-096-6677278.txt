http://home.cogeco.ca/~stampclub/     is a redirect page
but in amaya it doesn't do the action.
1] is this a philosophical thing --- we don't think it should 
be done so it will not be
2] its a time resource priority issue --- it is on list but not
   soon
3] it is a bug in the bug queue

oh and we are changing it to at least add a manual link 
statement for those browsers that do not redirect automatically.. ;-] ;-]
