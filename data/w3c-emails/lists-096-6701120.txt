  Subject: Variant to Amaya-s make-book and Section-numbering


  Hi 

  Amaya has the Special->MakeBook function. Is there a tool that does the reverse? Roughly: create sections from every <h2>-tag (or other chapter-header-level) and create an index? Of cource, I'd like some tuning in there but I'd save that for the next step.

  Then, the amaya wysiwig view has Special-SectionNumbering. It's nice inside amaya but once outside amaya, I miss the numbers. Is there a tool that generates the numbers in the title so they show up in all browsers?

  It would be nice if amaya had such stuf build in but some external tools will do. I hate to say it but preferably on an M$Windows platform since I have to convince the webadmins...
