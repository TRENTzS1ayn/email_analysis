Hi,

I too have had problems linking to local targets without "name" attribute, even when "Show targets" is activated. But this problem does not always happen, sometimes it works, sometimes it does not work. I suppose this kind of intermittent bug is difficult to solve, but the problem does exist in Windows 98 SE.
