The little "drop/list/display" you see on many word processors would address 
this issue. That way I can easily see and change the class of any element 
I'm within. Also, presuming there are doctypes that don't stupport "class" 
(I've never used one), if I had such a mapping, couldn't it just be 
ignored?
