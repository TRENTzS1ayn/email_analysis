Am I the only user of amaya7.2 (GTK version) *and* emacs under linux 
experiencing that activating amaya's exit keyboard shortcut ^X-^C does 
not only influence an amaya window but is 'inherited' (with a definitely 
unwanted effect) by an emacs job running under the same X server? I 
don't remember to have encountered that 'behaviour' with prior amaya 
versions.

I'm running Redhat7.3 and have configured my Gnome window manager to 
focus a window by mouse pointer.

Bye
