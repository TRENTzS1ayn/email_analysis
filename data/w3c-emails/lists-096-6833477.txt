I want to be able to easily change the "attributes" of some item. One 
possible way would be a quick keyboard shortcut to the Attributes/Class 
dialog. Another way is common to word processing tools. If you look in the 
upper left hand of Openoffice (Default) or Abiword (Normal), these are 
nifty little widgets that let you easily see your type/class and changeit.

Yes, but I can't ever imagine having a doctype without class attributes, 
*and* if I did, if I had "alt-a" mapped to Attributes/class, and there were 
none, then no harm done, right?
