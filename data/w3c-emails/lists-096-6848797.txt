I encounter ^X-^C quitting both amaya and emacs even after having added the 
above elisp snippet to my ~/.emacs! However I can't see any pattern in when it 
happens and when it doesn't. And I encounter that very behaviour on 2 
different linux boxes both of them set up with Redhat 7.3 and both of them 
using the sawfish window manager.
