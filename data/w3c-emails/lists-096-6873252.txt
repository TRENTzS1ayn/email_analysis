I answered a similar question last week. Please refer to

This page uses a lot of advanced features of CSS. Many of these
features are not yet implemented in Amaya, such as absolute
positionning, float and list-style.

Amaya did a better job with the default style sheets that were
used until yesterday (Blue shadows). But I guess this is the
purpose of the style sheets used on the Style area of the W3C server:
to demonstrate what CSS can do, and to stimulate browser developpers.
Some recent progress has been made in Amaya to render these pages
better. The Gold style used by default now will set a new target for
future releases of Amaya.

You can certainly use Amaya to create such HTML pages. 
If you look at these pages without any style sheet (or with the
Handheld style), or if you just check the source code, you will
see that they are pretty simple. The secret is in the many class
attributes they use to refer to style properties defined in style
sheets. You can perfectly use Amaya to create XHTML pages, to link
the style sheets you like to these pages (command Style/Link...),
and to put the right class (command Style/Apply class...) on the
XHTML elements.

You have some info in the on-line Help pages. There is a FAQ:
http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/FAQ.html
You can also check:

> Which stylesheet editor does the w3c use?

I guess most people at W3C just use a plain text editor and create
their style sheets by hand. But you can also check:
