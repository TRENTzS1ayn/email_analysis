Hello Brant,
Thanks for your bug report.

Actually, I can reproduce this bug on Linux but only for an empty anchor 
element with an attribute name (or id) and only if I select the anchor in the 
structure view and try to delete it thru the formatted view.
I guess it's a problem with the selection. We are investigating

Regards,

Laurent
