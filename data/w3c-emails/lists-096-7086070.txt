Hello!
I would like to submit some ideas for future Amaya versions, regarding basic 
editing. I wish amaya would
- allow repetion of previous command
- allow column selection
- allow application of a command/attribute to a selection and apply it to the 
adequate element within. For example, select a row and apply commands to 
cells.

Regards
Jos?
