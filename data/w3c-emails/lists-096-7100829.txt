Yes!
Maybe at first we'll be happy with an "Apply to all cells in row | 
column | table" choice that seems much easier to implement.

As of the repetition command, the vi editor has the "." command to 
repeat what you have just done, while Word and Excel have F4 for the 
same puepose. All of them are very useful.
Imagine being in the structure view, selecting elements and clicking a 
key to apply the same edit sequence to the newly selected element! 
Fantastic!
