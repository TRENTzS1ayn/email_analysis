It doesn't work. May be I wasn't able to explain the problem.
Well... On a page I have:
<body background="bgtrb.jpg">
but Amaya doesn't display this image. In 7.1 abd previous versions it was OK.
Other images are shown correctly.

>> On the same problem... is there a way to set the default background to white?

This works.
