Amaya 7.2 is much better than 6.3 on Windows XP.

However there remains a major problem with the configuration and 
installation.  It affects many users and should be simple to fix.

My amaya is using C:\AMAYA as it's user configuration 
directory.  WHY!?  This will ruin any chance of using amaya with either 
multiple users on one machine, or with network roaming user profiles.
Actually, on the 'General Preferences' panel it shows 'C:\\amaya' for the 
'Amaya user directory'.  Why the double \\ ?

INSTEAD, amaya should do what any good windows software does and use the 
Windows environment variable APPDATA as the path to the parent directory of 
the amaya user directory.  This works with Windows2000 and XP.

OR, if you want to read the registry there is an entry that works with 
Win98 and WinME as well as Win2K and WinXP.  It should point to the same 
place as the environment variable APPDATA:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell 
Folders : AppData

PLEASE make this single change to the next version of Amaya and I can 
recommend it to the network administrators to add to their campus-wide lab 
image.

And thank you for making the www a better place.
