Hello,

Idea for M$Windows installations: Can Amaya be added (registered) to the
html filetype? Preferably under "Edit with Amaya" or such? It will make live
a little more easy: select the html file in any explorer and
right-mouse->EditWithAmaya to open it in Amaya.

It also applies to all other filetypes known to Amaya like other html types
and xml types.

The title is preferably not just 'Edit' as that is (ab-) used by many other
html editors.

Or does someone have some code to register all Amaya known file types to
Amaya? I hate to do it manually.

CBee
