Hello!

I just joined, and I just downloaded and installed Amaya.  I'm studying 
Tim Berners-Lee's stuff about the semantic web (something I am 
interested in and so figured that I should d/l and learn about Amaya 
while I am at it, since he talks of it in his book "Weaving the Web").  
And so I was wondering where I might go to learn: how people are 
actually using Amaya; how it compares to other web-authoring programs (I 
suspect it would make a really useful replacement for a word-processor 
program, just playing around with it; since I write a lot and don't need 
stuff formatted exactly as if I were going to publish it in physical 
print, and want to rather create many things for the WWW.)  Also I want 
to know where to get caught up on the doings of this mailing list, so 
that I do not waste your time with any more stupid questions!  :-)

Thanks in advance,
