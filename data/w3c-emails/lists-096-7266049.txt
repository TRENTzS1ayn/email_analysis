Following some requests on this list, the Amaya user directory for
NT, 2000, and XP architectures is now being stored at:

$HOMEDRIVE:\$HOMEPATH\Amaya\config

This is documented in the Configuration help page (note that I have
a typo there and added two \\... cut and paste problem from the source
code).

Can you tell me if those environment variables exist in your 
box?

The double \\ seems to tell that you don't have a HOMEPATH environment
variable defined.

The problem is that this is the third change we do to this code for
finding the Windows user home dir. It seems it's not always the same
even in the same architecture. Some of the solutions that were proposed
require a new system library. That is, all users would need to apply
a service pack on their boxes to be able to install Amaya if we used
functions from that library. This didn't sound reasonable to us.

I'm willing to change it again, but we need to make sure it's the
standard way. I've not found much documentation on this so far.

Ideas are welcome.
