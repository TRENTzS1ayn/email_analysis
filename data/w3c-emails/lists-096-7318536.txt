The Amaya team is proud to announce a new Amaya snapshot release.

   Binaries (Linux, Windows NT/2000/XP /9x/ME) are available at:
             http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/BinDist.html
 
   Source is available at:
             http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/SourceDist.html
 
   Debian packages are available at:
             http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/BinDist.html.
 
 This release mainly comprises bug fixes, among which:

   * Edition: auto margins were computed to early when the document
         includes tables. 
      Transparency for PNG images on Windows platforms. 

   * CSS: Background images declared in style attributes were not
     displayed.
  The CSS parser didn't accept attributes if they were not
  placed between quotes.
  CSS were not reapplied when background images are loaded.

   * HTTP: Content-Location headers that gave a relative URL were not
           being converted correctly into absolute URLS (related to
   publishing "page" rather than "page.html").
