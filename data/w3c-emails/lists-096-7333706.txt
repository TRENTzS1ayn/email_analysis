exhibits three gifs that illustrate station layouts for a
model railroad.   All have yellow backgrounds in all
browsers but amaya ...   amaya misses the background
 in two out of three .....   they are not TRANSPARENT
gifs as the yellow is set in the gif itself and not as part of an
background on an img or table tag ....   what is happening
in amaya ???   //
