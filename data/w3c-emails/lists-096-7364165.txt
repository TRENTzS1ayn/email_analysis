Because of a confusion, an old Windows (NT, XP, 9x) snapshot (6.4+)
was uploaded instead of the latest one (7.2+). 

If you have already it, open the Help / About Amaya menu. If it says
6.4+, you'll have to uninstall, download the snapshot again, then
reinstall it. 

Sorry for the confusion and wasted bandwidth.
