http://home.cogeco.ca/~ve3ll/htmlsked.htm#students shows a very
crude display of a table...  compare with other browser renderings !!!

Also if one starts at http://home.cogeco.ca/~ve3ll/htmlsked.htm
and selects the students link at top of page .... the address bar does
not update to include the #reference !!!!

http://home.cogeco.ca/~trains/rrdiary.htm  shows three railroad
track plans  in .gif format, only one of which has a yellow background
other browsers show each with a yellow background. no transparencies
involved.  //
