http://home.cogeco.ca/~ve3ll/home.htm
is my homepage with a basic logo  and a searchbox (which
    doesn't work cuz its javascript -- no problem)

1] logo looks ok on first load  but if one scrolls down to bottom of doc
and then back up, its size has changed to scrunch it    huh!!!

2] the search item 'go' button should appear beside the entry box
instead of under it... still some forms issues ....

so i am seeing   tables,  images and forms problems  with only 
three pages looked at so far ... i am almost afraid to view some
of my student sites.   //
