The mark of the end of an orgainization or company is when
more time and energy is spent on new corporate facilities,
organization structures, images and logos  then on the core
business ...  in amaya's case the business is tomake the 
browser render valid sites correctly and predictably, and 
to incorporate authoring and coauthoring tools for building
sites that are valid.   With a minimal crew left,  keep rowing
don't spend time sewing new flags ;-]  ;-]   ;-]   //
