I think Brant Langer Gurganus is on the right track.  The one and only 
CSIDL you want to use is CSIDL_APPDATA (0x001a):

from 
http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/shell/reference/enums/csidl.asp

>CSIDL_APPDATA (0x001a)

Basically 'Version 4.71' means it will work in any version of Windows 
except Win95.  And it will work in Win95 if the user has the IE4 integrated 
shell.  In the rare case of Win95 without the IE 4 shell, MS provides 
Shfolder.dll.
