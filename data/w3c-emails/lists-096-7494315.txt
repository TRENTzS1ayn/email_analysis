sure -- changing the look of the application helps when it leads
to user comfort with a metaphor for accessing menus, changing
items, or even a comfort zone with the look and feel...
i am currently going thru the 'getting used to'  java swing widget
look instead of windows......  
but fussing with an icon is just a time waster, unless the old one
is under copyright challenge or there is a significant product line
development....   apple still has its apple,  cocacola has its outdated
but well recognized script,  as does  mercedes benz star  ...
oh well ....  off to spot more quirks...

I don't agree with you, improving the look of the application is
also important.
Of course our main work is to help users to generate valid pages and to 
render them correctly. We also spend time to display invalid pages and try to
show what is wrong in these pages just to convince users to progress in the
right direction.
