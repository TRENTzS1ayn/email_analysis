exhibits a busted table .....
although there is plenty of room to widen the table, amaya prefers to
fold cell contents thus lengthening the table.....
it then shows another mistake by not moving following elements
down the document and thus overlays them .....
so a second calculation error (height calculation) is revealed
by the first error ....  i know math is hard ... taught it for 25 years
before retiring ...  but someone can do it right   please.   //
