Hello all

I have downloaded the latest version (7.2) of Amaya and am currently having 
problems with using the enter/return button to create a new paragraph <p> 
when editing the 
http://www.w3.org/Team/Admin/2003/timeline/tpcambridge.html page.

When I hit return to create new paragraphs, nothing happens, if I hit 
return several times the program freezes. I've stopped and started the 
program three times.

I note the combination of the ctrl/enter to produce <br>  does work.

Any
