is one of my students projects.  it stays to simple
constructs , must verify to be marked at all (tuff teacher)
and actually looks pretty good in Amaya ...   
just seems that my pages show quirky stuff like images
that resize by themselves, form controls that are placed incorrectly,
table calculations....  maybe just too much complexity.   //
