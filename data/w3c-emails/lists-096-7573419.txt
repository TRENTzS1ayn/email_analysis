Hi Laurent

Thank you very much!

I have no idea why there were two doctype lines in there -- a couple of us 
edit that page, but I don't know how that would get added.

I used an earlier version of amaya to create the document.  I note Susan 
Westhaver (who just updated to 7.2 recently) had problems editing the 
document yesterday, but I don't know if the different versions would create 
a problem.

Now I can use the enter/return button to create new <p> elements.  Thanks 
again.

Amy
