Why can't I copy text from the "PARSING.ERR" window in Amaya (from the 
"Views" menu) in Windows?

What I mean is, there's a list of errors, and I wish to select them with 
the mouse, and click <control-C> and then paste them someplace else (or 
peraps save the whole window as a text file, and open it there).  It 
doesn't work, however, and I have to re-type them all by hand.

Is this a feature or a bug? ;)
