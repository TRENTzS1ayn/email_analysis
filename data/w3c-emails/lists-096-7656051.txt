Curious.  I noticed that on my copy of Emacs in Windows, I could not use 
  <control-V> to paste text into Emacs from the Windows clipboard; but I 
could do it if I used "Paste" from the edit menu.  Later I realized that 
in Emacs, this was done with <control-Y>--just like in Linux!  :)

Later today I'll try doing a middle click (I've only got two buttons on 
my laptop, but I think I can reconfigure them to do a middle-click in 
combination with a control key or something). I'll try that and other 
Unix-y things to try & get copy & paste to work with Amaya.

Thanks,
