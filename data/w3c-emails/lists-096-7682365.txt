In order to have a more configurable and open installation system for 
Windows, I am working on a script for the open Nullsoft SuperPimp 
Installation System.  If possible, could I get a list of what files go 
with the current installation components (Amaya Itself, Documentation, 
Other Languages, etc.)?  Also, what license should I display for Amaya 
and is it available in other languages?  What languages should the 
installer work in?  Thanks for any input.
