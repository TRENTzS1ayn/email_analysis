The "Installing Amaya MacOSX" page  
<http://www.w3.org/2002/09/amaya-darwin> has a broken link for " fink  
repair script for Apple's X11 libraries" which is currently :
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/*checkpout*/fink/fix-finkl/ 
install_name_fix.pl
I think this should be:
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/fink/fix- 
fink/install_name_fix.pl
However, as I understand it, it looks like maybe with the most current  
version of X11 from Apple that this patch isn't necessary.
Sadly I installed Virex before realizing that I was interested in Fink.
Maybe I will wait a little longer before trying Amaya on OSX.
