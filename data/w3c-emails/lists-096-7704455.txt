I use amaya-6.4 .

1. Attached is an archive containing an HTML file and threee small image
files. amaya is unable to compute the correct size for the text in
the top table.

2. 'http://www.rexswain.com/index.html' shows a test file for browsers:
the sampler.html. It contains test code f?r the <DIV> tag.
amaya fails to show two of three tests. <DIV ALIGN=LEFT> is shown
correct. <DIV ALIGN=CENTER> and <DIV ALIGN=RIGHT> is show incorrect:
the text of the list elements is indented correctly, but the bullets
are not.

3. Why does amaya lack FLOAT support?

4. Rereading the HTML 4.01 Specification I could not find a hint why amaya
starts a preformatted text at the left and inserts an empty line before
this text. Why is that done? Shouldn't it be possible to write
the following<pre> preformatted text </pre>like a<tt> text </tt>?
