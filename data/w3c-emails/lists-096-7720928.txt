(Amaya 7.2 Linux)

The editing menus in the structure view are not initialized in accordance with
the selected element. To see what I mean, do the following:

- open the small document below in Amaya
- select the b element (<b>test</b>)
- open the XHTML/character element menu (from the Amaya main window). The menu
  shows (correctly) that Bold is active.
- now open the structure view and open the XHTML/character element menu from
  the structure view (while the b element is still selected). The menu does not
  show that Bold is active.

If you click "Bold" in the XHTML/character element menu from the structure
view, the b element is removed. Now the XHTML/character element menu in the
main window shows correctly that Bold is not active, but the XHTML/character
element menu in the structure view has "Bold" activated.
