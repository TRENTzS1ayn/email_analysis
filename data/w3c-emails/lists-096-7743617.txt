I use Amaya and other browsers quite heavily.

But I very often miss (in all of them) a simple tool.

I propose a "red-line" which can be positioned free and independant from the 
displayed content in a browser-window (in this case for Amaya).

With this simple tool I could "underline" long lines, tables, ...
This would help me a lot in browsing and editing Web-documents.
