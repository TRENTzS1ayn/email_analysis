Is what you are proposing an accessibility feature, analogous to the use a 
ruler or bookmark to keep track of the current line of text that the eye 
is scanning on a printed page? Or have I misunderstood and are you 
proposing an editing feature?

In the case of an accessibility feature, I presume the line would be 
dragged by the mouse and stay in its last set position. The line therefore 
would need some kind of "handle" one could click on to reposition it.

Your idea is intriguing.

Cheers,

Kade.
