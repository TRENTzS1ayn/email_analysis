I'm developing a website which is currently located at
http://www.canada.kicks-ass.net/.  It renders as I expect in IE6, almost
as I expect in NS7.  When I open it in Amaya 7.2, it renders VERY badly.
Is this due to my coding or is there a bug with the tables.  I assume
the menus don't show up because Amaya doesn't support JavaScript.
