Dear Development Team;

I have just installed the current release, V7.2 and observe that the above
proiblem still exists, so I thought it was worthwhile to let you know.

Platform: WinXP SP1
Amaya Version 7.2a

The easiest way to describe the problem is to show you using an example
page...  Just start Amaya and open
  http://www.datsamore.com/tamenu.html

You will see that the description of the pizza overlaps almost completely
the name of the pizza which is a separate paragraph.  The page uses Styles
referenced by Class and looks ok in IE or Netscape.

The "p.itemdesc" style has a "margin-top: -1.5em".  There is no problem with
positive values in the margin.

Hope this helps.  Any questions, just ask.


Regards.
