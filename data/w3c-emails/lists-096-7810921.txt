The following is from the Help>Loading XML documents in Amaya 7.2

Anaya can display any well formed XML document and associate a CSS
stylesheet with these documents.


Sounds like a real nifty app, that Anaya - any idea where I can dowmlaod it?
;-)

Best wishes - and keep up the much-appreciated good work .. the new version
is a great improvement, btw.
