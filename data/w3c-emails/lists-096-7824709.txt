Hello,
as a software company releasing products on many platforms and 
Web-technology environments, we
are considering the possibility of integrating in our products an 
Html-editor derived from your sources.
What we need is a full understanding of the limitations/fees/rules in 
using and distributing your sources
embedded in our products.
Therefore we ask if you'd be so kind as to let us know whether we need 
some contract-like statement or any other kind of agreement.
Thanks in advance.
Best regards.
       
                W.Pasqualone
