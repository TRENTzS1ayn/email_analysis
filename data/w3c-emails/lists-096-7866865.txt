RALPH: The Irish love of wordplay humour does not translate well 
     to non-native speakers ....
IRENE:  What Ralph was attempting to say in a humourous way was
   that he detected a typographical error where Amaya  is printed as Anaya
   in the documentation ..... just a misprint error.....   

I am noticing that my student's projects look pretty good in Amaya except
for the chap that uses lots of tables .....  so i guess that may be coming
 soon.  Personally I hope all your heads are together and working on float
 so that the w3.org  stuff looks better ...   float is used in a lot of pages
now ...
