Hi folks,

I have updated the information on installing Amaya [1] again. Major 
changes are
 + how to resolve missing dependencies (for people installing the latest 
"unstable" package from fink)
 + libwcs (needed for the internationalised version) is now in fink 
unstable - helpful for people pushing the limits.

I note on the amaya-dev list that Damian is trying to build a version 
that doesn't depend on X...
