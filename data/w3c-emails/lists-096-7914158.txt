Amaya has nothing to do with this.

Apple's X11 uses the same copy/paste mecanism as usual X11.
You have to copy/paste using the "middle" mouse button.

In X11's preferences, there's an "input" section which enables
middle and right buttons emulation (option click and command click
respectively).

Hope this helps
