Hi,

Amaya crashes on this site:
http://emingcompany.com/clubelamor/

Acutally, amaya does not crash on
http://emingcompany.com/clubelamor/index.php .

But it does crash on other pages such as :
http://emingcompany.com/clubelamor/information.php
http://emingcompany.com/clubelamor/news.php

This is not a valid (well-formed) site but i have
these questions:

-. Amaya crashes because it is not valid/well-formed ?

-. Amaya crashes because it has japanese characters ?

-. Amaya crashes because it has flash ?

-. In the status, i see amaya is downloading the
flash, but it does not play the flash. Is amaya able
to play flash ?

Thank you all very much. Great work on amaya.
