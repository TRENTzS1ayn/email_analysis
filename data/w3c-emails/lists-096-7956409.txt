Amaya can help you to edit XML in a WYSIWIG manner. We hope to 
make significant progress in that direction in the next release.
The transformation XML to (X)HTML can be done by a XSLT processor.
But Amaya doesn't provide a specific XSLT processor. You have to
call that processor by yourself.

At W3C we use CVS to store the history of our Web pages.
Amaya + Jigsaw + CVS allow us to manage versions.
We should use WebDAV to have a real collaborative environment.
There is an implementation of WebDAV in Jigsaw and Amaya, but we
never tested them together.
