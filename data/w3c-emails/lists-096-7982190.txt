Hello,

I make a trial run of Amaya(7.2+ Feb 21 2003) on 
Windows 2000sp3.  
A problem in browsing XHTML, font overlaps, and 
it is indicated in Japanese XHTML. Specially, 
when a Latin text lasts following Japanese text, 
a font overlaps, and it is indicated.
This problem can be reproduced in the XHTML of 
the Web site (http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~JC5M-OOTK/) 
which I am making . 

TANKS.
