it would be nice to have a view that says ---  show stylesheet
some of my students are using stylesheets but making errors
your parser flags them nicely   but i can't see in context...
when there are parser errors in source, i can use source view
for context .....
trying desparately to use Amaya in a student learning environment
but as their techniques develop with tables and nested tables,
amaya loses rendering....   //
