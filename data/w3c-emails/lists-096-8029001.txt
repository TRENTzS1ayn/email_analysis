the spec says that any uri with an &  in it should be replaced by
&amp;  --->>  seems logical to me  
however it is still being flagged as an error in Amaya,  validator.w3 and WDG 
validator   ---  what gives and is there a method to get a clean validation!!! 
  
it appears as if the substitution of & for &amp;  is being done before the 
check  thus even corrected uri's show errors ...   can this be fixed.
