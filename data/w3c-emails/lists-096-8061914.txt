Hum, Amaya draws a top line with the foreground color and a "white" bottom
line. When the height of the <hr> is too short, the colored line is covered by
the white bottom line. I changed the write order of top and bottom lines to
avoid that problem now. Meanwhile, you can see the colored line by encreasing
the height of the <hr>.

WHY MUST IT DRAW A 'WHITE' LINE UNDER THE FOREGROUND COLOR LINE...
THIS STRIKES ME AS A ''CONTROL'' ISSUE.  Can the white line part not be 
handled as styling --- ie  treated as a bottom border line ....   that way you 
can default it to what you like to see ( a 1px white line)  but if an author 
wants to style it differently they can ....   this is exactly how opera 
handles it...  a bottom border defaulted to thin white  but under user control
using styling .....   
if you change it, i know it will not be this round  but maybe next... and i
 think that a change will be philosopically correct...  to put styling into
  style sheets   not in browser hardcoded.....   //
