Hello!

Amaya 7.2a states that <http://gg57.s7.domainkunden.de/> which has a 
MIME type of "application/xhtml+xml" is not well-formed. The reason
for this behaviour is that there's no document type declaration ("DOCTYPE")
present in that document.

I consider this a bug in Amaya. The error message is plain wrong, the 
document *is* well-formed. Furthermore, a document type declaration is 
only mandatory for "strictly conforming" XHTML documents. If a document 
doesn't contain entity references, it can easily be rendered without 
one. Mozilla e.g. renders that page properly.
