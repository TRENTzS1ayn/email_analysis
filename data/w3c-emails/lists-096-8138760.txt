The page: http://www.fs.fed.us/r2/mbr/rd-laramie/upcomingevents.shtml will start to load and open and then my version of Amaya 7.2 February 3 2003 will unexpectedly close the browser window. I have Windows 2000 service pack 3 and all current patches. This page would open in 6.2, but I updated to day and the new version fails. I'm new to using Amaya so I hope I've sent this message to the correct site, if not would you forward it to the appropriate location and if I'm notified I'll use that address in the future.
Thanks,
Jim
