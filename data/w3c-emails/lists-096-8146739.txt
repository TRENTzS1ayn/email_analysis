I have authors who create documents for our Intranet based upon a standard HTML document which includes references to files that may not necessarily reside on their own PCs - things such as external style sheets, script files and logos.

The latter seems to cause problems when printing.  Each document contains a reference to our standard logo <img src="../../images/KCSdivlogo.gif" width="45"height="57">, which works fine when the document is published, but the image generally does not exist in a relative location on the author's PC.

Should they attempt to print the HTML document, it invariably crashes with a C++ assertion error:

"Debug Assertion Failed!
"Program: AMAYA.EXE
"File: fopen.c
"Line: 54
"Expression: *file != _T('\0')"

Clicking ignore will generate another error dialog:

"Error - Source: GifCreate(1)"

The HTML works fine if the image can be found.
