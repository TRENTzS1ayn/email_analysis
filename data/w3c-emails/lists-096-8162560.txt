Hi

This is to report a small issue with scrolling.
To see it please open in your Windows 2000 PC   :-)
     http://www.w3.org/Amaya/
in a window with a height so you can see up to the "Open Source" H2 title.
Now press the cursor down key until the end of the page.
Last step is to scroll back with page up 2 ot 3 times: a blank area 
appears now at the top of the page.
I enclose an image of the effect in a rather small window for the 
Windows-challenged Amaya users who want to see it.

Saludos
