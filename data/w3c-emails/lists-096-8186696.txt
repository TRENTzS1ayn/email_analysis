Hi,

I have sent this message to www-amaya-doc but, as I do not see it
in the list, I am sending it again to www-amaya.

I have been improving the Spanish translation of the manual and I have some
bug reports/questions/suggestions regarding the English version:

1. The SVG button image file "SVGLibrary.gif" does not exist. This image is
linked in "SVG.html.fr" and "UseSVGLib.html"

2. The final lines of the "ChangeSVGLibPresentation.html" are confusing. I
understand that the file that should be edited is "default_cat.lhtml" in
config/libconfig directory, but the class names in this file are in French
(titre-graph and commentaire). By the way, this file has no doctype and
the extension is "lhtml". Why?

3. There are two files ("timeline_help.html" and "WebDAV.html") not linked
to the other help pages. Should they be translated?

4. There is no reference to "Manage SVG library" in the manual main page
(manual.html)

5. In "configuring_amaya/menu_preferences.html" it is said that only three
languages are available. At least there is a fourth one (Spanish).

6. Navigation through the manual pages using the arrow images is sometimes
confusing.
6.a. I think "Document.html" and "creating.html" should be merged in one
page.
6.b. The next arrow in "Views.html" links to "Changing.html" instead of
"Document.html"
6.c. The next arrow in "about_access_keys.html" should link to "forms.html"
6.d  The next arrow in "elements/exiting_anchors.html" links to
"creating_nested_structures.html" and then
"elements/changing_the_document_title.html", but in "Creating.html" the
order of the last two links is the opposite.

7. In several files ("HTML.html", "Changing.html",
"HTML-elements\40styling.html", "HTML-elements\address.html",
"headings.htm", etc) link arrows are aligned to the right. Should they be
aligned to the right in all the pages?

8. Will the next release be 7.3 or 8.0?

9. I think that the help and images files should be separated in different
directories (en, fr, de, es) in order to make the translation and
"maintenance" easier .

10. I would like to translate "amaya/amaya/HTML.trans"? Could Amaya use
"HTML.trans.es" when Spanish language is chosen?
