Release number : 8.0 GTK (april 23 2003)
Platform : Linux Debian 3.0r1 Woody GTK

Description of the bug:

There is a printing bug occuring with the US Letter Portrait format (8 
1/2 inches x 11 inches).  Approximately 2,7cm (~1 inch) of the top 
printed page is wasted in a white (blank) margin.  Trying different CSS 
"margin-top" or "padding-top" settings does not change anything.

That problem does NOT occur in A4 Portrait format printing.

The bug seems to happen with every xhtml/html file, so it should be easy 
to reproduce.  Feel free to ask me any precision about that bug 
behavior, I'd be glad to help.
