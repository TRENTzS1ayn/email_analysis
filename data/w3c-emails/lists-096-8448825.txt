It could be a problem with the "fonts.dir" file or the "XftCache file".
I published a copy of my esstix directory at
 http://www.w3.org/Amaya/Distribution/esstix.tar.gz
This directory is  installed on my box at /usr/local/share/fonts/esstix and there
is a refenrece 
dir "/usr/local/share/fonts/esstix" in "/etc/X11/XftConfig"
and  catalogue = ..... /usr/local/share/fonts/esstix, in the file "/etc/X11/fs/config"

This Motif version doesn't use truetype fonts and xft.

Perhaps RedHat 9.0 uses a different font server and needs another configuration.
