We believe Redhat 9 does use a newer version of the X font server
but we have followed the new configuration guidelines, so we don't
think the font server is causing the problem.

We've also tried using the copy of your esstix directory, but the
same problem remains with the Greek Letters palette.

It would be nice if someone could verify a workable compilation
under plain vanilla RedHat 9 with GTK support (with regard to the
Greek Letters palette).

We are currently using the Motif version as a workaround, bit it has
minor incompatibilities e.g. with the clipboard for cut-and-paste.

Thanks again for your help.
