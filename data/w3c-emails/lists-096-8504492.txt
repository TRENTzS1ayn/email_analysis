Hi, Jon

Your problem is explained in a help page:
Help > Creating elements > the Enter key
"In the same way, you can create a new paragraph after 
the table by selecting the whole table and pressing Enter."

Also, you can click in the last cell of the table (bottom, right)
and hit Enter several times (6 times). Every time you hit enter
a new higher element is created:
paragraph in cell -> table column -> table row
-> table body -> table foot -> paragraph after the table

And please, be polite,
Barto
