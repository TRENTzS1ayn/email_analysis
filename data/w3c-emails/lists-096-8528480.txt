Using Amaya 8.0 for Windows XP,

I created an XHTML 1.0 Strict file which has an h1 element:
<h1>Brant's Projects</h1>

In an attached stylesheet, I added the rule:
h1 { font-size: larger }

Instead of making the text larger, the text was made smaller.  The only 
other rule applying to the h1 element is text-align: center.
