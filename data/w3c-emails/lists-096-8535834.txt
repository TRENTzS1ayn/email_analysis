The Amaya team is proud to announce the Amaya 8.1 release.

  Binaries (Linux, Windows NT/2000/XP /9x/ME), Debian and RPM 
  packages are available at:
            http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/BinDist.html

  Source is available at:

This version includes several bug fixes and also the following new features:
  - Implementation of the Annotea Bookmark schema using the Redland RDF
    Application Framework (only in Linux platforms for the moment).
  - An "Apply CSS" option in the Special>Preferences>Browsing menu that
    allows the user to work without CSS.
  - A "Current screen type" option in the Special>Preferences>Browsing 
    menu that allows to choose one of the CSS pre-defined screen types and apply
    the appropriate CSS Media Type rules.
  - Right TAB order and sensitive ESC keys in the Windows pop-up menus.
  - Error lines in the PARSING.ERR window are now active links to source files.
  - A Beta version of the OpenGL print (only in Linux platforms for the moment).

For more details see 
           http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/New.html

Some reported bugs are not fixed yet by lack of time.
We'll work hardly to fix them in the next release.
      Irene.
