Thank you! I think I'll be able to move back from from 7.2 to use this 
version; initial report for Amaya 8.1 follows. Item 5 is now supported in 
Windows only? (Is support for Linux forthcoming?) Item 11 is a new variant 
of item 10 which has largely been addressed.

PENDING in 8.1

4. Wish: bounce (increase/decrease) the nesting level of nested lists 
easily.
5. Wish: A shortcut key for skipping/replacing+next in the spell checker so 
I don't have to rely upon the mouse and compex navigation to quickly move 
through the document. Also, using ESC to dismiss pop-up dialogs 
8. Wish: Can it open a new window in parallel? If the other window is slow 
to load it holds up all of my windows.
11. Bug: Sometimes when I want to click on a fragment in another window, I 
hit click, then click the target in the other window but the hypertext only 
contains the URI of the other window, *not* the fragment id.

APPARENTLY ADDRESSED in 8.1

6. Bug: Not all id are shown when "show target" is selected.
7. Bug: When I click on the S030 hypertext in this document:
  http://www.w3.org/P3P/2003/p3p-beyond-http/Overview.html
it opens the other document in a new window, but then resets my view to the 
top of the page in my current window!
9. Bug: I encounter many instances that when 
(a) the cursor is before the first letter of a next word and after a space 
and the preceding word 
(b) and I hit the delete key 
(c) not only does it delete the first letter of the next word, but the 
preceding space.
For example, where the carrot "^" represents the cursor position:
  "foo ^bar" [hit delete]
  "foo^ar"
10. Bug: When I want to click on a local fragment, I hit click, then if I 
hit page up or down I loose the "click activation", if I scroll then click, 
it opens another blank dialog.
