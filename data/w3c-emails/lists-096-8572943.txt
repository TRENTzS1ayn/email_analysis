well i am disappointed in the lack of progress on CSS rendering!

Amaya 8.1 even messes up the www.w3.org home page !!

And it gets table cell calculations wrong in 

http://home.cogeco.ca/~ve3ll/jssked.htm#students

it seems to calculate width column width on data in first row rather
than prescanning each row -- note how even though there is space available
for width adjustment, it has chosen to wrap the data .... blahhh

WYSIWYG only works if What You Get is what others will get ...
and others will not be using Amaya !!! 

and http://home.cogeco.ca/~ve3ll/jssked.htm also illustrates that 
box calculations are off for images inside tables ....  tables again !!! --
