The error mechanism for badly formed XML works well
(just converted html docs to xhtml, passes w3.org ok  but 
Amaya catches & in addresses ;-[  ;-[   
The feedback indicates line and position of error well ;-] ;-]
but when i enter source view to find it only line number is provided!!
A better feedback mechanism would be to have current cursor posn
   displayed on the status bar ....  or at least user selectable to display
   there.    Just an author who makes mistakes occasionally and needs
to be pointed to the problem....   like a pooch who needs his nose pushed
 into his peedle until he is trained ;-[  ;-[ --
