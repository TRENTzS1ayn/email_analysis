the following short file passes thru both w3.org and WDG validators
however Amaya 8.1a signals an error because of the omission
of a space after the quote mark....  is this 
1] a bug in the Amaya parser
2] a bug in the w3.org and wdg parsers
3] a grey area in the XHTML recommendation where the requirement
for spacing is vague....  tokenizers have no difficulty recognizing 
end/begin of these tokens and normal convention is to disregard
spacing except where absolutely required for correct tokenization.
