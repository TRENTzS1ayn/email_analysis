the following short test program shows that Amaya doesn't display 
title attributes while all other browsers tested show them as tooltip
like popup boxes.    These can be extremely useful to page readers as
longer explanations can be offered as to where a hotlink may take them
or  perhaps a definition of a rarely used word or term.  Consistency 
between ways browsers render attributes and properties help both the
author and the reader  as  one can't enforce tools other uses.
