Many sites use input boxes to accept data for submission to a 
site search utility.   However the following simple test program will
show that Amaya 8.1a  offers no control over the sizing of this control.
Older programs use the size attribute and newer ones the width property
to design clean forms. these re messed up by Amaya. Note how the go
button is presented when you view the site search on w3.org with any 
other browser ... then observe what happens with amaya.... and this is the
tip of the iceberg.... Is it not possible to get attributes (circa 1990's) and
css1 properties (circa 2000) working correctly. Some of the Amaya page
blurbs seem like they are written by advertising firms  or Bush's speech 
writers ((( now that is harsh -- your blurbs are not blatent lies ;-] ;-]  )))
