Can anyone confirm whether the browse button works on loads
or saves in amaya  on a Win98 platform...  it has not worked for 
me in several versions of amaya   but  have not had feedback from 
amaya team or others whether browse works....
on my machine first click on browse button does nil .... second
click throws me out of amaya completely .... --
