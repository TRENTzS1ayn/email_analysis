Just checked and width, height, background and color all work on textarea 
control.  To have the same actions on the input control must have been a 
missed step and not something that is technically a challenge.  I am hoping
that someone can find the time to fix up all the broken stuff in forms....
if you want a list just ask .....  many attributes and properties gone awry.--
