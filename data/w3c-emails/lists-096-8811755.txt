ok -- as long as this is on wish list!
i realize that there are many priorities and this may be one that is
   low  compared to others...  i use the title attribute as a redundancy
   for javascript tooltips but javascript also fails ;-]  
thanks for responding.

Hello John,

Unfortunately, it would be a rather important work to have such a mechanism in 
Amaya.
All we can do for the moment is to display the title attribute with the href 
attribute in the status bar when one click on a link.

Regards,

Laurent
