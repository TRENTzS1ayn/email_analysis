Hi,

  There are a couple of entity bugs I noticed. The glyphs for &phiv; and 
&phi; have been interchanged;
this was a bug that was fixed in Unicode 4.0 
(http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode4.0.0/erratafixed.html).
We also have a strange little problem to do with &thetav; in Amaya, it 
shows-up okay,
but when we save the file, it becomes "&thetasym;".

  There are also some display problem associated with integrals while using 
<mrow>s and some space getting eaten-up
here and there (I use Windows 2000, with esstix fonts switched on).

But overall, I am optimistic that these problems can be fixed and Amaya 
will turn-out to be a very useful editor/browser,
especially for the XHTML+MathML+SVG profile.
