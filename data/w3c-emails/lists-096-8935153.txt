A couple of requests/bug reports, if I may:

(1) under Special/Preferences/General the user directory is greyed out. 
Could there be an option for users to set their own default data 
directories, please?

(2) when writing mixed English and Chinese, using Copy/Paste results in 
later attempts to write Chinese appearing as repeats of the clipboard 
material. The only way to clear this is to exit Amaya and restart it.
