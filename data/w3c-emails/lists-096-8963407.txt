Albert,

Can you check that redland was compiled when you compiled Amaya
and that the binary Amaya was linked with it?

The obj/Options file should say something like:

  -DBOOKMARKS -DAM_REDLAND

If that works, it may be that you're using a profile definition that
doesn't include bookmarks. Try to disable the profiles by changing the
name of the profile file in Special/Preferences/Profile by something
that doesn't exist.
