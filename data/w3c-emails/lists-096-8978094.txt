Hi Amaya Team

This is a usability related suggestion for some remote future realease :-)

Amaya, compared to other HTML editor, excels in "tag resolution". What's 
the meaning of this?
Well, for example open a page in Netscape Composer and try to tell what 
tag is the cursor into when there are tables into tables. Even with tags 
on it's difficult or it does not work as advertised.
With IBM's excellent HPB you see the tag name all the time but not the 
hierarchy.
And so on.

In Amaya there are two ways to pinpoint a tag which into a tag whirc etc ...
One is the structure view, a very good idea.
The other is the tag hierarchy in the status line at the bottom og the 
browser window, another excellent idea.

My suggestion is about this status bar.
I'd like to ba able to click in any of the tags listed there to select 
it's content, or right-click the tag to open it's Attributes menu.
This will be of great help in my case: I work with many pages at the 
same time so I can't open a structure view for each one (unless they 
were focus-related).

In short, the idea is to turn active the tag list in the status bar.

Saludos!
