Hi,
     This one is reproducible - unfortunately!

I discovered it after installation on my new laptop when configuring it.  I
have managed to cause the bug to happen after opening the General
preferences and, for the home page typing

file:///srv/www/htdocs/index.html

or just

/srv/www/htdocs/index.html

and then applying and closing the amaya window - no other actions were
taken.

     On restarting amaya, the amaya main window comes into view - no
content yet - and then disappears with the command line shell window
showing

Floating point exception

     The document has been validated - it just has a line of text on an
image background - and happily loads when the URI is typed into the URL
icon on the main amaya window - with no parsing or other errors!

     The problem does not arise with a fictitious file name, however, so
since it is very small I attach it for reference. The error still occurs if
the background-image line is deleted.

     Sorry about this - but it seemed kind of important!

               Regards,

                              Keith Hopper
