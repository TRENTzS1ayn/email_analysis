I have tried compiling amaya-src-8.1a several times with a variety of config options.  Yet, I always receive some error like the following, missing SVG.h:

gcc -O2 -W  -D_GTK -D_SVGANIM -D_SVGLIB -DXML_GENERIC -D_I18N_    -DMATHML  -D_I18N_  -DXML_DTD -DXML_NS -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I.. -I../../thotlib/include -I../../amaya -I../../amaya/f -I../../amaya/xpm -I../../libpng/zlib  -I../libwww -I../../../libwww/Library/src -I../..../libwww/modules/md5 -I../../../libwww/modules/expat/lib       -I/usr/include/gtk-1.2 -I/usr/include/glib-1.2 -I/usr/lib/glib/include -I/usr/X11R6/include   -I/usr/X11R6/include -c ../../amaya/AHTURLTools.c -o AHTURLTools.o
In file included from ../../amaya/AHTURLTools.c:18:
../../amaya/amaya.h:35:17: SVG.h: No such file or directory
make[1]: *** [AHTURLTools.o] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/src/xml/amaya-src-8.1a/Amaya/LINUX-ELF/amaya'
make: *** [amaya_prog] Error 2

What package is SVG.h from?  I would have guessed that it was from the svg lib, but I have librsvg-2.2.4 installed and this file is not in there.  I have tried compiling with --disable-svg, also without effect.
 
I would be greatful for any pointers.
