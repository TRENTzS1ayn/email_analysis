in win98 version, if i go into a paragraph or whatever then
SELECT THE TEXT TO BE COLORED then STYLE --> Color -->pick one
it works ....  it sets a span style="foobar" to do color with style 
property ok.....   but if nothing selected only span is set ... if 
you do style/color then type text without moving cursor , you will 
see new text in selected color ....
---------- replying to -----------
In Windows2000 pro I do:
  + select some text (usually in <pre> tags, but any)
  + open menu Style ==> Colors ...
  + right click a color
The background color is not set. It only sets the <span> tags, no colors.

This bug is new as of 8.1a, in 8.1 it worked like a charm.

Thanks as always to the Amaya team
