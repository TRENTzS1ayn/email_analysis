A bug that hangs the program --- three finger salute to continue
this is occuring in win98 version

1] File --> New --> XHTML doc
there is a dialog box with a preset address
2] Cursor at front of address
3] Press Delete key   ok
4] Press Delete key   oops hung system
I was trying to just change front end to local drive folder.....

If one uses the mouse to select all text and hit delete key
  everything works ok .....   but without mouse usage it is
 easy to hang system at this point .... amaya 8.1a and win98--
