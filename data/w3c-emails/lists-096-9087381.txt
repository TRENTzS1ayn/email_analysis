tried to clear front end with mouse-select then delete button
that seemed to work but then i could only add 1 character at front 
before it hung --- not good if one wants to retain name

the minor tweak is that after pressing clear button which works
the FOCUS should be placed in the text input area !!
that way one doesn't need to keep reaching for the mouse..... --
