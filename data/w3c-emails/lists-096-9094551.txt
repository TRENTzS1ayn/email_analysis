selecting Style --> Create Rules...
ellipse implies dialog box will open 
but nothing happens 
i had expected to be able to set a style element ....
perhaps i have to have an element selected and it will 
add a style to that element ... 
if that is intent  then how do i add a style element
and write some rules for it    using the menu system ??? --
