I am fairly new to the development of XML and I am trying to see what SVG 
MathML and other various languages are all about by downloading your AMAYA 
browser but to no avail I get an error as followed:

and I probably should not be sending this but I am at a loss for words and 
have no clue as to what to do. Can your program be used on a 98 system? To try 
and make an even longer story shorter I downloaded and followed instructions 
from the executable file and then tried to open the program to explore the 
possibilities of new technologies for myself but that's when the aforementioned 
error code came up. Please help or shed some light on this subject so I can put a 
project together for myself to learn more about languages and technologies 
offered for web development or is their a way to order this program in a CD-ROM 
version as to bypass the Internet downloading process.
