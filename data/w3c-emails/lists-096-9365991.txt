Help is not often helpful !!
For one thing there is not a free form search box to enter a 
term to see if it exists in help documents...  i do better from
msdox with a simple word search utility...  and that doesnt
seem right as surely we have made progress in 15 years !!!
a simple item like self completion should bring up at least one hit--
