Hi Jose, Irene,  ...

I,ve just been seeking something in Tucows, the massive sowtware 
download network, and noticed that Amaya is not listed in the "HTML 
Editors" category, see
   http://velocom.tucows.com/htmledit95_default.html
or any other mirror (velocom is here in Argentina).

Should Amaya be there then it could reach a much broader audience.
Also, this is the Windows HTML editors category, but Amaya is entitled 
to many other plattforms..

It may happen that many people get to know and use Amaya and then this 
newsgroup might become a mayhem ...    :-)

Saludos
