There was no message about iframe in the last month.

The document validates with an iframe tag but I have to put it in with 
an texteditor.
Opening a document including an iframe will loose the contents of that 
tag when saving.
Simply annoying.
Is it generally possible to comment things out instead of throwing them 
away without notice.
Whole chapters were lost that way.
Also a word of warning when memory gets low while editing would be helpful.

AMAYA does a great job when converting old non standard HTML to XHTML.
A big THANK YOU for this.
