I would like to add a new SVG library.

Using the directions in help I
   select an SVG element
   press Control "l" Control "a"

and nothing happens

I have tried
   select an SVG element
   press Control "l" Control "f"
   and saving into the default catalog
That seems to put the element into the default catalog, but I can not 
save the updated library.

I tried creating a new catalog and failed. :-(

Is there more documentation on using the SVG library?

Thanks,

Gary
