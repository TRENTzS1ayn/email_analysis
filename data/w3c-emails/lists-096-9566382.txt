If I understand, your suggestion is to remove the xml declaration and to add a doctype
+ meta element. This is an HTML document, isn't it?

As I explained before,  Amaya is able to generate and edit HTML documents.
In your case I suggest you generate HTML documents instead of
XHTML documents (we can also add the HTML option in the New menu).

The xml declaration is there not only to define the charset. It also allows browsers able to read
xml documents to use an xml parser instead of an html parser and so to check that the 
document is well formed.
What HTML guys think about that?
