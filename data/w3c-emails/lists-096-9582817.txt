Then I'm unfortunately going to have a problem again if I edit and save
my docs with Amaya.  I put together an example.

See the enclosed xhtml file (without xml declaration).  The graphic
withoutXMLDecl.gif shows how this will look in IE6 and, for example,
Amaya, Netscape 7.1, Mozilla 1.3 and Opera 7.

If I edited this slightly with Amaya and it added an XML declaration, it
would continue to look the same for all browsers, except IE 6 -  the
graphic withXMLDecl.gif shows how it now looks in IE.

I am now authoring new pages in Standards Mode. With the XML
declaration, IE is now in Quirks mode because the DOCTYPE wasn't the
first thing in the file.  If this were some small new browser I wouldn't
care, but since IE has such a huge market share, this is going to affect
(and break) the look of my page for the majority of my readers. 

That's why I don't want Amaya to add the declaration without my
permission.
