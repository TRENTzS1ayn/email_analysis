Hi Amaya People,

This is an ill-formed file I made by cutting and pasting some 
programming information in the web. It's name, in Spanish, means "notes".

THe file has two <td> blocks with no <table> nor <tr> enclosing them.
More linient browsers like Netscape or MSIE show the <td> blocks one 
below the other.
Amaya sets the second <td> over the first one, overwriting it.

This is not a bug in Amaya but in my file. But it shows so horrible that 
I wanted you to know about it.
You might want to do something in those huge chunks of spare time we all 
software developers have  :-)

Saludos
