Menu XHTML provides an entry to create an iframe element:
"Inline frame (iframe)", but this entry may be disabled if you are
editing a HTML 4 strict document (check the field "Document Type"
in the dialog box diplayed by File/Document_information) or a XHTML 1.1
document. Element iframe is not allowed in these document types.

Could you send a sample document? It does not happen here.

When a XHTML 1.0 Strict or XHTML 1.1 document contains a iframe element,
Amaya discard this element, but it keeps its content and displays a
message. The log file provides detailed information (Views/Show parsing errors)
