using 8.1b on win 98 platform
File - Open Document dialogue
browse and clear work aok
but if i put focus on first character of the displayed file and
start pressing delete key to clear from front end.
AFTER TWO KEYPRESSES THERE IS A LONG FREEZE. 
THIS TIME I WAS DRINKING COFFEE AND NOTICED THAT AFTER
A MINUTE, THE DELETIONS OCCURRED AND I COULD CONTINUE.
I am wondering what kind of loop is it falling into ???? 
annoying and some with slower machines may think the program has 
hung.  Someone with debugging tools should set a trace on this !!
