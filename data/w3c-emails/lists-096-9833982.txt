One of my common uses of amaya is to verify students
documents quickly. amaya catches a few problems that
the w3 and wdg parsers miss. I really like that.   However 
I am now seeing a couple of badly formed documents 
(according to w3.org and wdg)  that amaya does not raise
alarms on ....  one is invalid characters and another is on
 invalid nesting. the two test files are included. 
Are these things Amaya  should flag?
Are they now on the 2.do list? --

<p>which is really "agent?s" work</p>
<p>The above line rings alarm in w3.org and wdg validator.
Amaya doesn't show parse errors. Should it not ???</p>
