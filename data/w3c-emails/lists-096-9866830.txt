We did that at the beginning, but we abandonned the idea to do a too
strict control on loaded documents.
We let that role to validators.
Today, Amaya does a minimum of control on loaded documents:
  + it checks that they are well-formed (if it's a XHTML document)
  + it fixes a set of important errors (misplaced end tags, <td> outside a <table>
  + it detects the use of invalid or unknown tags.
But new created documents with Amaya are valid, and it only allows the user to
add new elements at a valid position.

I agree with you, we probably have to flag invalid characters.
