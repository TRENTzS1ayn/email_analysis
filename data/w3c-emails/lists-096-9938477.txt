Laurent:

I want to leverage this oportinity to report another <hr> annoyance.
Try this (I'm on W2K pro):

1- new document
2- insert table, accept 2x2 default
3- select the first row by dragging the mouse
4- Edit ==> Transform ==> Heading cell

Either the first row shows bad (save and reload fixes it) or you get 
this message:
    (source: TtaShowDialogue(1) Error 1400)
in a popup.

Saludos!
