Thank you very much for the implementation of my suggestion
    AMAYA_USER_HOME
I use it under Linux and Windows 95/98/NT/XP and can use Amaya
from an read only share with a preconfigured user directory on
that share; thanks again.

Now I have a much bigger suggestion (and I don't expect that 
you can implement it very easy). First of all there are http frontends
which provide that functionalty (Netscape 4.77 does); so my suggestion
is no complete nonsense. And my suggestion is:

Change the http-authentication dialog from:

      /--------------------------------------------------------
      |  Authentication Dialogue
      +--------------------------------------------------------
      |  Please Authenticate for realm ..... at server .....
      |
      |  Name:
      |
      |  _______________________________________
      |
      |  Password:
      |
      |  ________________________________________
      |
      |  [Confirm]  [Cancel]
      |
      \--------------------------------------------------------

to
      /--------------------------------------------------------
      |  Authentication Dialogue
      +--------------------------------------------------------
      |  Please Authenticate for realm ..... at server .....
      |
      |  Name:
      |
      |  _______________________________________
      |
      |  Password:
      |
      |  ________________________________________
      |
      |   /
      |   |
      |   |  HTML-Response from PUT command
      |   |
      |   |
      |   \
      |
      |  [Confirm]  [Cancel]  [Close]
      \--------------------------------------------------------

where "HTML-Response from PUT command" is a regular browser window
(perhaps without menu, buttons and location bar), but with working
link-anchors. This allowes more specific error messages for the
http-put server (perhaps not apache, my my personal http-server).

To keep the HTML-Response visible the dialog has to stay open, therefor
the addtional [Close]-Button.

Kind Regards

PS: A perhaps much simpler implemention for the display of the
    "HTML-Response from PUT command" is:

      /--------------------------------------------------------
      |  Authentication Dialogue
      +--------------------------------------------------------
      |  Please Authenticate for realm ..... at server .....
      |
      |  Name:
      |
      |  _______________________________________
      |
      |  Password:
      |
      |  ________________________________________
      |
      |  [Confirm]  [Confirm and Show Http-PUT-response]  [Cancel]
      \--------------------------------------------------------

Where the button [Confirm and Show Http-PUT-response] opens a complete
regular Amaya Window with the "Http-PUT-response", this window may hold
a Amaya generated message "No HTML-Response from PUT-command"
