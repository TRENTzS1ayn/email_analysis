Hello gabriele,

I'm currently working on amaya user interface.
You're right, amaya's icons are ugly and we're looking for nicer one. Of 
course icons change is not enough to have a user friendly interface ... 
so if you have other remarks about amaya's user interface, I will be 
happy to take into account all what you say.

Regards,

Stephane
