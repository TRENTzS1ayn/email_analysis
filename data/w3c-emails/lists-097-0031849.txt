We have a LEAD project in W3C, where we are developing an annotation system 
based on a general metadata infrastructure. It has an annotation server 
that stores annotations as RDF and we use Amaya as a user interface for the 
annotations. The tool will be demonstrated at the developers day at www9 in 
Amsterdam.

Right now we are quite busy finishing some details of the tool and writing 
a paper that will explain more thoroughly what we are doing. I'll send more 
info to the list after the conference and other related travel.
