CritLink is a mediator-based annotation system which, to the best of my
knowledge, is currently the only way for users of any browser on any
operating system to make public in-line annotations on any web page.
There is a server running at http://crit.org/ which you can use to make
annotations anywhere on the Web.

The code for CritLink is open source.  Although you don't need to set
up any software to use the public server, you can set up your own
server if you like.  (This would enable you to keep your own private
group of comments, or make annotations from behind an Intranet firewall,
for example.)  The code is also available from http://crit.org/.

I'm pleased to announce a new release of CritLink today, version 0.9.2.
This version contains some small fixes, and brings the release tar up
to sync with the various tweaks that have been done to the main server.

    - A separate log of published annotations is kept so that the
      list of recently published annotations can be quickly generated.

    - The bug that caused the "Contributors:" field to keep growing
      has been fixed.

    - URLs containing certain special characters previously could not
      be annotated; now the URLs are properly escaped.

    - The lexical analyzer is a little more tolerant of badly-formed
      comments and badly-formed quoted attributes.

    - Some display elements have been tuned to look better in Lynx.

    - For people who were unsure of what "support" and "issue" meant,
      the drop menu now says "support (agree)" and "issue (disagree)".

    - If there are problems writing out an annotation document,
      complain instead of silently failing.

    - Complete the migration to the ":words:" prefix for fragment
      identifiers (we are now fully consistent with the draft RFC).
