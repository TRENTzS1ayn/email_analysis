Marja- Is there a web page detailing the new work in Annotations? Last I
checked, http://www.w3.org/Collaboration/ still has Karen MacArthur's name
on it; it was updated on 1999/11/30-- what was updated?

MK: Sorry, the late answer. I have been traveling around too much lately.

The old collaboration page (http://www.w3.org/Collaboration/) is still 
pretty much the same, we just added  some links to our work.

Information about our presentation at WWW9 developers day can be found from
http://www.w3.org/2000/Talks/www9-annotations/

More detailed information is in 
http://www.w3.org/2000/02/collaboration/annotation/papers/annotationinfrastr 
ucture

Although basic things are working we are still in an early phase in this 
project.

JG: Also, where is the discussion list which will track this W3 project. This
one? Or another?

MK: I think this is a perfectly good list for discussions around the 
annotations. Some things are related to RDF so there was a suggestion to 
have another thread there, but let's first see if we need that.

It would be nice to get all the annotation developers that we met in 
Amsterdam to join here too.

JG: Perhaps w3 might also move towards some of the advanced discussion group
systems on the market. Many are much more flexible than plain ol' email lists.

MK: If you have suggestions about good features that you are missing could 
you send them to the list. At times it might be possible to improve something.

Asking everybody to buy a selected collaboration system is not going to be 
very successful as we want to include as many people to the discussions as 
possible.
