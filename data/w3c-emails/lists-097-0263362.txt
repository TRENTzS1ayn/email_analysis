Just wanted to introduce the group to Lucid Fried Eggs, php-based
collaboration software.

I've put together a little collaboration page at www.memes.net.
Feel free to modify any page you see there, or add new notes.

Lucid is similar to Wiki, except that links from one note to another are
structured. Each link must be of a specific type: parent, child or jump.
This creates
a nice navigation scheme.

It's a bit chaotic, because anyone can modify any page. On the other
hand, that feature
makes it useful for annotating other people's work. The biggest problem
is scalability.
If two people are editing a note at the same time, the last one to post
the changes will
override the other one.
