Hello everyone, this list has gone very silent, and there doesn't seem to be anyone at
all in Australia - I was asking so that i could invite them to the launch in Sydney of
our new agreement with Allette Systems to host PageSeeder and make web sites available
which can carry pageSeeder annotations.

I you're still interested in annotation software take a look at us again - we've set up
more demos than we had before. http://ps.pageseeder.com/
and we have some trial sites available if you want to try it out with your own content.

Cheers
Julie
