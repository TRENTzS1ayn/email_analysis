Hello everyone,

  I just discovered this mailing list (thanks Julie!) and wanted to let you know about one more Annotation system. It is called
Annotator; developed in 1998 at USC under Annotation Technology project. The URL is http://www-hbp.usc.edu/Projects/annotati.htm
Also, a paper about that system contains an extensive review of existing annotation software (up to 1999).

Best regards,
-- Ilya
