In my last mailing I neglected to add a link to Jon's summary now on our site.
http://ps.pageseeder.com/ps/ps/papers/default/annot/annot.pshtml. It has quite a few newer references than the collaboration page, but
lack some of the older ones - it would be sort of nice to use the annotation capabilities of our site to add the extra info.  I don't
see any mention of PageSeeder in your page Dan - I'm getting a little paranoid about why noone in this list takes us seriously so I'd
really appreciate some feedback.

In spite of being classified as "commercial" we're still living off the smell of an oily rag, though now that we have a server we are
very happy to host reasonable use projects gratis, and when our new version emerges in November we'll be glad to provide it to anyone
in this list wanting to set it up.

Lower maintenance is one of our aims - with seeded comments that can be added to a page and emailed to registered users then the page
keeps itself up to date, it can get messy but at least when you get around to creating a new version you have all the info in one
place to work from.

This is the other sort of problem we can solve with PageSeeder, because we allow cross memberships to groups and pages shared by
multiple groups you can accumulate a lot of comments on a page that are only visible to the group for whom they are relevant. It takes
some deep thinking to set it all up but avoids the problems that related interest groups can have.

I hope that Dan's efforts to get something moving are effective.
Cheers to all
Julie
