Folks,

I'm normally a lurker on this list, but I thought I'd alert everyone to a
new annotation product called E-Quill.

E-Quill is a free Internet Explorer plug-in that lets you mark, highlight,
and post sticky notes on web pages. E-Quill remembers your old marks so that
when you return to a page, you see them again.

With E-Quill you can send your marks to _anyone_; the recipients do not need
_any_ special software to view your marks. (When you click "send," the
plug-in generates a new page on E-Quill's web site; recipients simply need
to follow the generated URL to see your marks.)

While E-Quill perhaps doesn't (yet) fit the bill as an annotation system in
the sense that is often discussed on this mailing list, I thought everyone
might be interested in giving it a spin: http://www.e-quill.com/

E-Quill was founded by three students from the Brown University Graphics
Lab; the team has a rich UI and hypertext background. E-Quill aims to make
extremely useful and usable tools for the web, and we're keeping a close eye
on web annotation research and developments. Please let us know what you
think!

Cheers,
Dave Peck
