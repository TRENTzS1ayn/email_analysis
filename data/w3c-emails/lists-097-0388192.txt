I have moved the Annotation technologies page so that it can have it's own list attached. It is now at
http://ps.pageseeder.com/ps/ps/papers/annot/jongar/jongar.pshtml and is part of an area I have set up for annotation discussion on our
site.
It was a moderated area before because it was mainly for our use, now it is a public space and comments will no longer be moderated before
being posted.

If you have an entry on it and there are errors please let me know. Jon created definitions to use in the table also - these could be
clarified and extended - you can send in comments about this.

It would be possible to enrol this list as a member of the group associated with this area of our site but since I don't detect a lot of
support from the list about this I will do the opposite and make a seed a member of the list instead.

Regards

Julie
