I can nearly always be persuaded to talk about what I'm doing.

For background, Sun Microsystems Star Division - in Germany I believe,
has
had a comprehensive office suite "Star Office" on the market for some
years.
It's not often seen on Windows desktops in the US, I suspect, but it's
real (and really quite nice).

This year, Sun announced that they would release the source under terms
similar to the Netscape/Mozilla relationship;  the Open Office
Foundation was created to receive it and run with it.

We live at <http://www.openoffice.org> and chat on
<mailto://discuss@openoffice.org>.

As discussion groups will do, especially since we haven't yet seen any
code, we were chattering about many things when someone mentioned
"Groupworking".
Several thoughts were floated about on how a productivity environment
should support collaboration.  Anyone who wants to search the archives,
look for "Groupwork."

We haven't said or done anything concrete yet, we want to look at means
of cooperating on a document: commenting, editing, a.k.a. annotating.
Naturally, we also want to use the Open Source concept to "borrow" the
very best of everyone else's ideas!

So, any of you here who are interested in the future of "productivity"
software, come and browse - and stay to hack.
