You give a nice concise motivation for the question.  I'll open
with the caveat that there might not be one "best".  We can
share our ideas and see which of them survive the test of
implementation and time.

That sounds nearly identical to what we've been doing in
an annotation service design here in a "live early adoption"
project at W3C.  We talked about it at WWW9 DevDay and
have continued to work on it as time permits.  We're very
close to being comfortable showing it more publicly again.

We have defined a generic annotation class and then subclasses
of that to declare 'types' of annotations.  We use the rdf:type property
to convey the class of a specific instance of an annotation; that is,
the semantic intent of the author when the annotation was created.

We believe that annotations can in general have multiple types; that is,
a single instance of an annotation can simultaneously belong in
several classes.
