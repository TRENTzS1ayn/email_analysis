Ralph,

I think we are in broad agreement, looking at your Annotation schema
slide (http://www.w3.org/2000/Talks/www9-annotations/slide6-0.html) and
your paper on the annotation system.

The obvious difference that strikes me though is that in this diagram,
all the info, ie the content that comprises the substance of the
annotation, is contained within a separate document, linked to the
annotation with the body property. This is clearly useful in creating
links between separate documents (you could have, as the body, a url
that pulled out a catalogue record from a subject gateway, I guess).

However, for our project we're producing a metadata set for evaluating
health info Web sites, and I think we see these metadata as also being
properties of the annotation object, in addition to the metadata _about_
it. (Although after subsequent discussion with Libby Miller, who has been
developing our RDF comment store technology here, I'm not so sure about this -

she'll be sending in her own comments on this later).

It seems then that there are these two approaches - the information
comprising the annotation being a separate document linked to an
annotation object using the body property; or the information consisting
of separate bits of metadata, each being a property of the annotation
object. These approaches seem to me to be compatible in terms of the
underlying understanding of what the annotation object actually
represents, that is in both cases the metadata or the separate document
are simply constituents parts of the overall annotation.

Phil

PS I've been chatting to Libby Miller, who has been developing our RDF comment
store technology here, about this and she'll be sending in a further reply to
this .
