FYI, the Amaya 4.0 release (dating from last Friday), includes a first
implementation of annotations. Although there's still room for improvement
and some bugs remain, it's already useful in most cases.  You can do both
local and shared annotations and we have a sample test server on-line,
along with its source code.

We encourage all discussion on these implementation to take place in this 
list.

I'm forwarding the official announce that we sent to the www-amaya mailing
list.
