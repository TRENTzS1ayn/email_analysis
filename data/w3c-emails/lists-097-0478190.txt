Hello everybody,

I am trying to integrate Web co-navigation with annotation in real-time,
using a standard browser. With this tool users will be able to exchange
ideas referring to specific portions of the shared web document.
Asynchronous annotation will also be supported as a subclass of this more
general type of annotation.

I have not come across too many references in this area. I would appreciate
it if someone could point me to some past/ongoing related projects.
Likewise, any comments on the significance or usefulness of merging
co-navigation with annotation sharing would be appreciated. I wonder why
there is so little work in the academic/public press.

This work is part of a larger framework, called e-coBrowse. I will come back
to it if there is enough interest.
