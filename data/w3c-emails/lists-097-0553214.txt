For those who are interested in shared annotations on the Web or 
applications using open RDF infrastructure:

Annotea now has a public page: http://www.w3.org/2001/Annotea

We are developing Annotea further and therefore very interested in your 
experiences in using it or your help in setting up new annotation servers 
or building other clients for the servers.
