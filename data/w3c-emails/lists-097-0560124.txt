Hi.

The examples found in the Annotea Protocols document at [1] consistently
include both a:created and d:date properties. Usually, they have the same
values but the example in the "Updating an annotation" section shows that
they have different values.

Is the d:date property meant to indicate when the annotation was last
modified? The RDF Schema at [2] includes an a:modified property, though.

The examples also include a d:creator property while the schema defines an
a:author property. Are these interchangeable?

Finally, I'm curious as to why each example includes two r:type properties?
Each annotation is declared as being of type a:Annotation and also of type
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/annotationType#Comment (or #Question or #Example).
All of the classes specified at [3] are sub classes of a:Annotation so isn't
the first type property unnecessary?

Thanks,
Jason.
