Consider a (small) group of co-workers busy with a task. They monitor
several (web) newssources related to the task on daily basis. Old-way
they have a newsgroup or mailing list there each can post a brief note
with URL of what s/he has found interesting. A problem with it is that
the url-ed page may be already visited by others (and presumably
considered not interesting enough to be shared or annotated). New-way,
there should be an awareness-spreading mechanism that will simply tell a
group member who of the group have already visited the page. Looks like
the long-time-here mechanism of marking visited links in any browser but
extended group-wide (and, as mentioned, telling a user namely who have
alreaday visited the link). At a glance, this could provide substantial
time savings allowing to avoid duplicated efforts. Annotation feature
should integrate with this quite naturally, though such coupling is not
absolutely mandatory.

Has anyone heard of tools enabling this?

Mike Yakoubov.
