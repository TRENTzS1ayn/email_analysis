Charles McCathieNevile suggested[1] to produce RDF and post an
annotation with the date a document was last checked by the W3C link
checker[2].

A cool thing would be to tag broken links with annotations. Editors
could see what links are broken, people could suggest replacements,
etc.

The link checker does not grok XML right now, nor does it speak
XPointer, so this mail is just to keep track of this idea and get
feedback. I have updated the link checker to-do list[3] to reflect
that.
