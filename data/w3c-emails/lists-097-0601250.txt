As some of you know, we in the Web Accessibility Initiatiatve Evaluation 
and Repair (ER) Group have been working on a language, EARL [1] that 
describes accessibility of web sites to people with disabilities.  The best 
way to implement EARL may well be as an application of Annotea.  Would you 
tell us your thoughts on the following features?  (rather than cross 
posting, I figure it's best to keep them on the Annotea list.  I'll put a 
pointer to this discussion on the ER list),


1. How does or will Annotea deal with documents that change?  For example, 
if a part of a document changes, comments regarding other parts of the 
document may still be valid, and we'd want those comments to stay useful.

2. Can there be annotation of annotations?

3. Will there be structured annotations?  In other words, in addition to 
free form comments, comments that involve new machine readable statements.

4. Accessibility of Amaya to people with disabilities is improving but 
there still seem to be some remaining problems, like need to use a 
mouse.  Will annotea be accessible to people with disabilities, per the wai 
user agent guidelines [2]
