First, they work fine with iCab, which is very cool - thanks Art for doing
them.

Second, it occurs to me that it would be cool to find a way to refer to a
part of a document.

The simplest way would be to put a checkbox at the start of every paragraph,
heading, list item etc, and use that to identify the element - this is a
reasonably feasible XSLT transformation.

Another alternative would be to get the selected text, search for it in the
document, and identify every applicable context, then ask the user to choose
which one they meant. That could be ugly, but where there is only one
applicable context you can go straight on...
