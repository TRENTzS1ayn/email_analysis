The Xpointer uses the nearest id's whenever it can find them. So if the 
document contains them e.g. for titles, it is quite possible that many 
comments stay valid even after the document has changed.

For documents that don't have id's and the beginning changes it is possible 
that annotations become orphaned. Orphaned annotations can still be seen at 
the beginning of the document and they can be reattached.

Also some annotations can be in a wrong place. We have been thinking about 
ways to know that the document has changed after the annotation was made to 
warn people about that, but have not implemented anything yet. One simple 
thing could be to store also some textual context that can be compared with 
the annotated context.

If we have a document that we cannot write to or control it's change we 
will have this problem regardless of annotations.

If we can write to the document, it is good to add enough id's. Of course 
the info can be also added to the document but then it is more difficult to 
look that without the annotations.

If we have a group we can control this with a social process e.g. we don't 
touch the old version, that is annotated but create a new corrected version 
based on that. Then there could be some easy ways of moving annotations 
between documents too.



>2. Can there be annotation of annotations?

We are just implementing that. We are adding also discussion list type 
replies. We will be very interested in getting feedback about these 
features and if you need both or only one of them.

The annotation can be structured already. It is now an XHTML document. 
Adding some specific RDF is more a user interface question than anything 
else. I mean how to make it easy for users who don't know RDF to add some 
evaluations.

Please send amaya team suggestions of how to improve the accessibility of 
Amaya. I cannot talk behalf of them but I'm sure they are interested.

We do aim that annotations are accessible and the first thing is to learn 
about the problems. Charles has promised to help also.
