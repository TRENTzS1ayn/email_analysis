Hi Leonard,

I have been working on the Annotea bookmarklets and their
associated servlet and hope to make a public release by
the end of this week or early next week.  I intend to 
announce the availability to this list.

I do want to make it very clear that the stuff I will release
does NOT allow one to create fine-grained annotations.  It
only allows document-level annotations.  I do hope that
someone will have some suggestions on how to do fine-grained
Annotea annotations via bookmarklets.  Better yet, I'd like 
to some volunteer(s) to take what I've started and add the 
fine-grained support.
