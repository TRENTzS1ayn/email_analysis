I have been working on some bookmarklets and a servlet so 
that the W3C's Annotea annotation system:

 [1] http://www.w3.org/2001/Annotea/

can be used with browsers that support JavaScript.  I
have done most of my testing on Netscape Communicator
and a little testing on Mozilla and IE.  

Please note that these interfaces allow document-level 
annotations only - there is no fine-grained annotation
support.

This experiment is documented at:

 [2] http://www.w3.org/2000/02/collaboration/annotation/JavaScript/Annotea-JavaScript.html

To use these bookmarklets:

 1. Visit [3] and create a user account at the W3C public 
  annotation test service:

  [3] http://annotest.w3.org/access

 2. Add the bookmarklets described in [2] to your browser

 3. Try it and let me know how it goes
