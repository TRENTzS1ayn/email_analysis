Hello there,
I have changed my email address from Laurent.Denoue@univ-savoie.fr
to denoue@pal.xerox.com

I have some feedback for Annotea:
- I don't like to login and type my password each time I create or look at
annotations: could you set up a mode where there is no need for password
and where my login is read from cookies?
- I don't like to have to click on the annotations in the "Select" checkbox
in order to see the annotations.
- I love the name Annotea !

Laurent.
