Hmmm - the user and password should be stored in cookies
so you should only have to enter them once for every
browser session.
 
What browser and version are you using?
 
Have you turned off cookies?

Yeah, I also thought about doing it that way and perhaps an
option button is the right way to go.  

I decided to make it two step process for a few reasons. First,
the Annotea protocol is such that you can't get all of the data
with a single GET.  First, the client sends the URI of interest 
to the server and it sends back a document which contains a list 
of all of the URI's annotations.  Then a second GET is done 
to get the actual annotation since each annotation is stored as 
a separate document.  Second, I didn't want to take the hit of 
preloading every annotation since I think the list is itself
useful.  I was concerned about how long it would take if a
document had lots of annotations but perhaps some buffering 
could be done.
