LRK: When you're annotation a document to specify web accessibility issues, 
as in EARL [1] you may want to label a tag, e.g. a frame that has no title 
or a bogus title; or an IMG that has no alt text or bogus alt text.  In 
these cases you can't simply attach a comment to content, at least not to 
content which is a text string.
