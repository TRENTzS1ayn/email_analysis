I guess your comment is not as much about using XPointer, but about attaching
the annotation to the structure of a document. You can make an XPointer
expression that points to the content of an element.

In some cases, you want to annotate the content. In other cases,
like Len noted, you want to annotate the structure. In other cases, you
don't have the choice. Imagine if you're  annotating an SVG image or
a MathML expression (you can do both with Amaya today). It all depends on
the type of document (static, dynamic, legacy, working draft, ...) and the 
kind of annotations you want to generate. In my view, we should be very 
flexible on this issue to not limit annotations to one kind of application.

The problem that must be solved in either case is to be able to detect
when an annotation becomes orphan or misleading. XPointer has some provisions,
such as specifying a chain of XPointers, where you would go thru each link
of the chain until you find an expression that resolves to something. However,
the real work is in making those elegant XPointer expressions which are
short and correct.

Thanks for the URL. I'll read the paper and comment on it later.
