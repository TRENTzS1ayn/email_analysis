I have spent a little time working on a sidebar for the Mozilla browser to 
display Annotea annotations. As you may know, Mozilla handles RDF itself, 
so it is possible to retrieve the RDF from the annotations server and 
manipulate it directly in Javascript. However, this seems to require that 
the data is served with a content type of "text/rdf", not "text/xml" as it 
is currently (if the "forceText" option is used).

Is there any chance that an option could be added to serve the results as 
text/rdf?
