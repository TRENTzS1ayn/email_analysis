Mozilla's a little ahead of itself here, since there is no such content
type (and may never be). Perhaps the Annotea server could be tweaked to
allow some chosen content type to be specified as part of the URL? (eg.
&t=text/rdf appended...). Hacky but might allow for some interesting
prototypes.

Anyway, if you make your code available, let me know and I'll link it from
the Mozilla page at http://www.mozilla.org/rdf/doc/SmartBrowsing.html
too...
