I agree that using same ID for different news does not help much. In W3C 
page we now use ID's that are based on time so they are different for each 
news item to prevent this happening. The same problem exists also without 
ID's so it is not a specific ID problem. On the contrary ID's usually make 
the pointers more reliable and that's why we use them when we can. You have 
the same problem when pointing to the 3rd H2 element on the page or 3rd H2 
element and 2nd paragraph and 5 word, which you can also do with XPointer.

The Annotea team did discuss quite a lot about different ways of making the 
pointing more robust and some of the same ideas are in the paper you 
referred to. We haven't had time to concentrate more on that aspect yet, 
but what we have done so far does not prevent adding more robustness later. 
For instance, we could add a schema that captures some part of the (textual 
or mark-up) context to annotations that need to be extremely robust. These 
annotations might be handled, for instance, as different annotation 
subtypes with some extra properties. I rather would not use them everywhere 
as they are not always necessary  e.g. in cases when the social process 
already prevents users from making annotations to changing documents.

The first thing I would like to add is getting info that the document has 
or has not changed after the annotation was made.
