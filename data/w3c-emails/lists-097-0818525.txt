Many people believe that dc:creator should point to a new RDF resource, with
properties coming off of that, as opposed to just a text string. Something
like:

<#annotation> dc:creator :X10101 .

:X10101 
    dc:title "Aaron Swartz"
    foaf:given "Aaron" ;
    foaf:family "Swartz" ;
    foaf:mbox <mailto:me@aaronsw.com> .

I'd think this is perfectly acceptable, because it contains the structured
information, as well as the dc:title value for simpler processors that just
want a string.
