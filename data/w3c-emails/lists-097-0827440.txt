I basically agree with this, but I'd suggest doing it as a non-binary
relation (RDF M&S section 7.3) and using rdf:value instead of (or in
addition to) dc:title.  The RDF processor might not know that the property
dc:title is more appropriate than the others as a default literal value.
It does know that rdf:value is special.

As an aside, two vocabularies that lend themselves to describing structured
personal names are vCard and X.500.  Perhaps the following:

<#annotation>
  dc:creator     :X10101 .

:X10101
  rdf:value      "Aaron Swartz"
  x500:cn        "Aaron Swartz"
  x500:givenName "Aaron"
  x500:sn        "Swartz"
  x500:mail      <mailto:me@aaronsw.com> .

Ideally, you'd infer the rdf:value statement from the x500:cn (or dc:title)
statement rather than duplicating the literal "Aaron Swartz" in the source
statements, but expressing the inference rule would have to be done outside
of RDF.
