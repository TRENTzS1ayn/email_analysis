Yes, but in this situation, I think rdf:value might be too special.
rdf:value seems to imply that the other properties are qualifications of the
primary value, not properties of a resource. The example given in the spec
is:

    rdf:value "500" ;
    :measurement :pounds .

resulting in "500 pounds". We're not doing that here, we're instead
providing a title, so dc:title is more appropriate.

I'm a member of the DCMI Architecture WG and we're working on a "dumb-down"
system to allow Dublin Core and RDF applications to receive literal values
from complex data like this. Using dc:title and rdfs:label are both
acceptable according to the spec.
