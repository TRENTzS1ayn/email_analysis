My code for interfacing to Annotea via Mozilla is now available at
   http://annozilla.mozdev.org

A list of annotations is displayed in the sidebar, with the capability to 
display the bodies of the annotations, and an attempt to find the section 
of the document being annotated.

There are instructions on installation, screenshots, and the source code 
can be browsed. Bugs can also be filed. Please feel free to comment.

Thanks to Art Barstow for sorting out the problem with the content type.
