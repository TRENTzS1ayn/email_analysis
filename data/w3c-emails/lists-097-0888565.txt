I just wanted to pass on some info that may be helpful
if you want to try Matthew's Annozilla:

o It didn't work for me with Mozilla 0.6 but worked fine after
 I installed 0.8.1 [Linux, x86, Red Hat]:

 http://www.mozilla.org/releases/

o If you need to create an account, see:

 http://annotest.w3.org/access

 [Note that a '+' sign in the user name causes a problem
  so don't use that char until the problem is fixed.]

o In Edit->Preferences->Annozilla, set the Annotation server to:

 http://annotest.w3.org/annotations

o To see some annotations, go to:

 http://www.w3.org/2001/Annotea/
