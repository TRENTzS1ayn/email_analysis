Kudos, Matthew; this is wonderful work.  I'll buy you a beverage
of your choice at our first face-to-face opportunity :-)

I was puzzled at first why clicking on one of the annotations
in the sidebar seemed to do nothing after prompting me
for my username/password again.  Then I discovered I
should scroll the Annozilla sidebar down to see the body
text box.  Can I configure things so the body text box pops
up in a new (desktop) window?

Thanks for this hint, Art.  It certainly tripped me up
since I had registered as swick+annotate in
http://annotest.w3.org/annotations.  I just had to
re-register for a new account.  (Note to Marja: don't
double-count me as a user for WWW10 :-)
Do you know where this problem might lie?

I also notice that annotations on my 'home' page are not
displayed immediately after restarting Mozilla until I go
to a different page and then back to my home page.
I tried Shift+Ctrl+R to reload my home page but this
doesn't seem to have changed anything; still have to
visit a different page then backup.
