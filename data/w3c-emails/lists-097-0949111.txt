Version 0.2 of Annozilla has been released and can be installed from 
http://annozilla.mozdev.org/. It fixes some bugs reported with version 0.1, 
namely:

: usernames could not contain a + character
: annotations were not loaded for the user's home page

and has improvements including
: the type of an annotation is listed
: annotation bodies can be loaded in a new window, instead of in the 
sidebar (at user option)
: an interface to the Bookmarklet Create Annotation functionality
: identifying the section of the document to which the annotation refers 
(which is SLOW) can be disabled at user option
: slightly better XPointer hacks

Annozilla is an Annotea client designed for the sidebar of the Mozilla 
browser. Feedback is welcomed.
