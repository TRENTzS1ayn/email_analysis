Hi,

If we forgot to say this... the whole Annotea team is attending WWW10
this week.

We're presenting a paper about Annotea on Friday afternoon, track XML &
Tools 2. We're also giving a presentation on Saturday, at the DevDay 
Semantic Web track (Discussion threads + annotations in Amaya, Annozilla,
bookmarklets, RDF generic server). 

Feel free to look us up if you want to chat.
