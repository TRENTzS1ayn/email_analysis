Hi,

During the WWW10 presentation of Annotea and the bookmarlet written 
by Art. (available at 
http://www.w3.org/2000/02/collaboration/annotation/JavaScript/Annotea-JavaScript.html 
), I tried it with my Macintosh under Mac OS X and IE 5.

A report of a first world in Annotation world. I can't use Amaya on 
my laptop (powerbook).
I know that for people that are not used with bookmarlet, some 
screenshots can help. But hopefully I had already experience with it. 
I just made one when I have written for a validation bookmarlet 
http://www.la-grange.net/2001/02/15.html

First, for a very newbie, and lazy reader ;), it's not evident that 
you must first register before to use the annotation system. I have 
added the two bookmarlets in my Favorites Toolbar and called it 
PutAnnot and GetAnnot.

Select a piece of text, click on PutAnnot... and it just did it, 
great !!!! GetAnnot works just fine too! That's a wonderful tool, 
need promotion.

I think for a first user, when I'm not authorized to put an 
annotation, send the user to the registration form.

Another idea, explain to the user it can change the title, and 
encourage the user to do it,  to have a meaningful title.

Another idea (the last for this mail ;) ) if it's not done, send an 
email to the author of the web resource to be informed that there is 
a new annotation on the page.

I tried also to put a <strong> and it has worked... but what about 
the validity of the document if someone type invalid html inside. :) 
conformance manager's speaking.

Some design improvments too, ;)

CONGRATULATIONS!
