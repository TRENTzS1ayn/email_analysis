The clients should not break if they were written properly.
If adding such a property to the RDF that encodes an annotation 
breaks a client then the client doesn't understand a key feature
of RDF - its extensibility.

Adding a new property to an annotation should not cause problems 
for Amaya or the Annotea bookmarklets.  Of course, these Annotea 
clients may not do anything with the new property but they certainly 
should not break.
