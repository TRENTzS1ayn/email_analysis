Is, or is connected via ? The idea that a conglomerate of devices IS 
an ontology is an interesting and (to me) novel idea.

Yes, I wonder quite what 'scalability' is supposed to mean. Maybe an 
example of something that isn't scaleable would be helpful (?)

Ah, that is a different sense of 'search' than the one I was 
understanding. We need to distinguish between searching-1 the web for 
relevant content, and searching-2 for valid inferences from a given 
ontology (one that has maybe been constructed as a result of a 
searching-1 process, for example.)

I agree entirely. For example, without some security at the lowest 
transfer-protocol level, one is dead in the water. This seems so 
obvious that I have always assumed that Tim's cake-top was meant to 
denote something like 'reasoning about trust' rather than 'functional 
security', and to refer to the no doubt rather arcane inferences that 
an agent might use to conclude trustworthiness, rather than to the 
low-level machinery of secure information transfer and so on.

Again, I agree this work is relevant.

For what its worth, there is some ongoing work (not yet published) on 
applying DAML+OIL to reasoning about software agent 
actions/permissions/obligations which several of the participants 
here are involved with, I believe.

I would urge that the basic picture should be that access to the 
content expressed in the DAML+OIL is the primary resource that needs 
to be made secure, since that access would enable any 'higher' 
information about trust issues to be tampered with. In other words, 
it cannot possibly be sufficient to have an insecure ontology of 
security, since that cannot guarantee any security over content.
