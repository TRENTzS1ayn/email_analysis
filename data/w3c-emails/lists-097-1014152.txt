Sensible RDF applications should always "expect the unexpected", ie.
not be suprised to find a variety of additional pieces of data
("annotations", in a broad sense of the term) decorating RDF graphs. From
what I know of the 3 Annotea clients, they should all be OK with
additional properties attached to an annotation, since they use an RDF
parser rather than match against hard-coded XML encodings of the data
structure.
