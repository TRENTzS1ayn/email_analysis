Pat,

One general comment: the first section (point 1) was simply extracted
from mail messages mostly from Jim Hendler (and I think Jeff Heflin)
which tried to summarize the use case responses from the membership
homework up to that point. I just passed this on as a starting point and
it does not represent my thinking. 

Some additional comments below.

I agree. RDF is the first rung for semantics, if you will, and in
principle enables XML and XML Schema schemas to begin to have a
semantics (beyond simple datatyping and local constraints). So as far as
content interoperability is concerned (as opposed to format, structural,
read: syntactic, interoperability -- which XML and XML Schema enable),
RDF/S and DAML+OIL, and the WebOnt language are the only web candidates
which can represent semantics. Outside the web, other languages include
KIF, conceptual graphs, various description logics, CYCL, UML.

Yes, I don't agree that RDF does this. No language currently does this.
Some folks use XSLT (style sheets) for creating mappings, but there is
really no intent to preserve/map semantics in any formal sense. A
question: should there be a language (or part of the WebOnt language)
for expressing semantic equivalence statements between 2 different
ontologies. I would say, yes. 

But automated detecting and mapping would seem to need an application.
And I think only semi-automating the process is possible, since it
generally requires a human being to interpret the semantics of both
sides and make the associations. Again, we would need to define content
interoperability and semantic interoperability (and assert they are
equivalent or not, for our purposes). To me, semantic interoperability
(between 2 ontologies) is looser than semantic equivalence. The latter
formally is something like sharing the same set/s (subsets) of formal
models. Perhaps our WebOnt language can aspire to expressing this
(assuming it has a formal model theory).

Same as my previous comment, i.e., I don't think the languages can. I
think the languages enable you to formally specify the semantics you
want (i.e., the ontology concepts, relations, axioms, etc.) but you have
to map the DB schemas to the ontologies. When mapping from ontology to
ontology (property vs. class 'parent') there is no language (as far as I
know) that enables you to state the relationship. The IFF candidate of
the IEEE SUO aspires to this, i.e., enabling a statement of the
relationships between ontologies, but I won't yet suggest this (though I
like the IFF).

No, these papers are still behind the firewall, but will be available
soon. I could also send them to you, if you're interested.

Yes, I know that "context" itself would need unpacking, since there are
so many meanings for this. In the papers we try to begin sketching a
notion of context, along the lines of (this was wrt objects in
object-oriented systems):

(1) Def. Context := <O1, O2, [[O1]], [[O2]], map([[O1]], [[O2]]>
    A. Object O1, a compiled runtime closure
    B. Object O2, a variable or virtual object, the kind of object that
the receiver system can               currently handle
    C. Interpretation of object O1 in sender system object model 
    D. Interpretation of object O2 in receiver system object model 
    E. Mapping between the interpretations of objects O1 and O2

This obviously is only a beginning and does not include "intent"
(pragmatics). And in the paper try to differentiate context from frame
of reference.

A more formal definition (and one we talk about in our paper) is given
in the Local Models Semantics papers of Giunchiglia and Ghidini, and
Bouquet. 

- Giunchiglia, Fausto; Bouquet, Paolo.  1998. A Context-Based Framework
for Mental Representation. Istituto per la Ricerca Scientifica e
Tecnologica (IRST), Trento, Italy, Technical report 9807-02, July, 1998.
- Giunchiglia, Fausto; Ghidini, Chiara.  1998. Local Models Semantics,
or Contextual Reasoning = Locality + Compatibility. Principles of
Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR'98), Proceedings of the Sixth
International Conference, Trento, Italy, June 2-5, 1998, Anthony Cohn,
Lenhart Schubert, Stuart Shapiro, eds., pp. 282-289.

But, in the end, I agree that "context" has its own baggage and we
should be picky about our definition.
