Issues seem to be struggling over concepts like inheritance, polymorphism
and template classes. Are they mutually exclusive? All seem valuable. But in
the interest of 80/20 simplification b) appears to align with inheritance -
which is already part of DAML+OIL.

Versioning features should (IMO) make it easy to apply revision control
logic to scalar data. It seems reasonable to think of ontologies as scalar
data in the sense that the version (number?) permeates all sub-elements. But
the possible consequences of improperly managed versioning are profound.
Consider a temperature sensor ontology that defines a temperature tolerance
range between -10c and 100c. And an ontology change resulted in the sensor
being clasified as a plasma temperature sensor then the tolerance range
might mistakenly be interpreted as kelvin (in which case -10k to 100k is
incompatible with device capabilities).

Versioning is as fundamental as naming. URI-->URV where the namespace is
fixed in time as well as in space???

I would like to hear the groups views on how ontology would be used to
describe the multi-faceted approaches for representing large data sets ala
indexing, distribution, caching etc.

I interpret the semantic web to have peer-peer semantics. The browser based
web (based on html/http) appears to be the origin of the "all or nothing"
and "viewable" semantics. I'm not sure "viewable" and "web pages" are the
right metaphores going forward? The metaphore I've been using is that an
ontology describes a structure that contains both data and meta-data, it is
traversable and it can reveal new information at every traversal. It is
reasonable to expect arbitrary sub-structures will be off-limits to some set
of probers, for some set of operations, for some period of time. (If I'm
misunderstanding ontology or misusing the metaphore someone please clarify -
this is potentially a fundamental clarification).

DAML-S supports the notion of a pre-condition which arguably is the right
place to apply access control semantics. DAML-S is a services ontology which
would be expressed using WOWG-ORL/WOL. I assume the DAML-S ontology would be
public domain and readily accessible. However, proprietary extensions to a
DAML-S ontology might redefine precondition, which implies introspection
might also be limited. There is an element of circularity that is suspect. A
ORL is used to describe an ontology that defines a semantic (precondition)
that is needed to prevent unauthorized traversal of the ontology that
originally defines the semantic.

I would like to understand how an agent might know how not to get confused
trying to learn the logical structure of say the network of post offices
when the ontology describing the network may be full of indexed, replicated
and distributed repositories whose physical structure (also represented by
ontology) is mostly superfluous to what is wanted.
