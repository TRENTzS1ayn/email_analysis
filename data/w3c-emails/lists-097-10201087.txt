R1 S
R2 S
R3 U  This may be beyond current state of webont art. Needs a deeper 
analysis of meanings of URIs
R4 A  Definitely beyond state of art. Research problem.
R5 S
R5a ?How can we stop it happening? If this means provide coherent 
semantic model for such reasoning, I vote A.
R6 S
R7 S Well, within reason.
R8 U How does this differ from R3??
R9 A Seems peripheral to webont, maybe more of an entire web issue.
R10 S but R10a A
R11 I agree with a and b
R12 A Not central to webont, more of an application area.
R13 S But need to distinguish asking q. about what follows from O, 
and asking q. about structure of O. Subtle but important distinction.
R14 S
R15 S
R 16 U May be beyond current state of art to do this properly.
