large ontologies.

?? I don't see what this kind of example has to do with versioning. 
An ontology that could be broken this easily is just badly designed. 
For example it ought to refer to a standard ontology of temperature 
scales that would be maintained at some secure exterior URI, 
precisely to avoid this kind of problem arising.

Maybe not, but any changes need to be put in place at the FTP/HTTP 
layer, not in webont. The transfer protocols we have currently (and 
which are implicit in the meanings of URIs) do not provide for much 
subtlety in this area.

I wish someone would say what that distinction amounts to. As far as 
I can see, DAML+OIL and RDFS consist of data.

How are the limits to be set? If I give you a URI, you can see what 
is there (or if it uses HTTPS, you can if you know the password.). 
There isn't any provision for controlling access on a more 
fine-grained basis.

I think that you are using 'precondition' in two different senses here (?).

Is this more than just a classical inference search problem? If not, 
I think that the description logic reasoners can handle quite large 
data sets (10|4 to 10|5  assertions) without much trouble.
