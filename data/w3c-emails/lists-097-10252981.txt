I don't think I agree, but I do see it will be a case we have to make 
carefully.  In my mind the issue is that the node names in an 
ontology have no real meaning (I could simply use the following)
  :G001 a WOL:class
    ... WOL:onProperty :G002
    ... WOL:hasProperty :G003
etc

i.e. the content of the ontology is up to the creator to 
internationalize, not our langauge.  Thus, in a technical sense, we 
can use whatever labeling scheme XML or RDF allows, and have multiple 
labels or whatever

  :G001 a WOL:class;
    english:label "Moose";
    french:label "Elk du Canada".

or however it is handled.

However, that said, what I thought was out of scope was for us to be 
inventing a new internationalization approach instead of doing what 
would be required by I18N-WG or at least coordinating with them if we 
want to look at new approches.
