This is not a problem, because these linguistic differences should 
not be in the ontology. Terms in an ontology are not natural-language 
words. They are more like identifiers in program text. If I write 
some Java and use 'color' as an identifier, I want that character 
string to stay exactly the same as I wrote it, even if the reader is 
Italian or English. Here's another way to put it: any uriref in a 
piece of WOL is not in English, or Italian or anything else: it is in 
WOL, and it should stay in WOL exactly the way it was written.

Only if someone were to make the basic error of thinking that the 
terms used in the ontology had the same meaning that they would have 
if they were words in English or Italian.

They should not be, in the sense you are here meaning. A good 
exercise for anyone dealing with a formal ontology is to replace 
every 'word' by a meaningless string, and then try to understand the 
assertions in the ontology. Because the ontology means *exactly the 
same*  as far as any software is concerned.
