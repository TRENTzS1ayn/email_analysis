Here are my votes and comments on the candidate requirements. Note that
in addition to the standard S(support), A(against), and U(undecided)
notation, I've added S-X for "support in general but believe its out of
scope of WebOnt."

R1. Shared ontologiesS
R2. Ontology extensionS
R3. Ontology evolutionS
R4. Ontology interoperabilityS
but only to a reasonable extent. some features may sacrifice
scalability

R5. InconsistencyS
R6. ScalabilityS
R7. Ease of UseS
R8. Data PersistenceU
Although I originally proposed this one, I'm not positive if I support
it enough to champion it.

R9. SecurityS-X
I think this deals with issues at layers above and below WebOnt

R10. XML SyntaxS
R11. InternationalizationS-X
I think the issues that are in scope are covered by R4 and support a
mention of it under that requirement

R12. Ontology-based searchU
I'm still not sure we have a group consenus on what this means, and
until we do, I'm undecided.

R13. Ontology queryingU
same reason as for R12

R14. ExpressivenessS
R15. Proof checkingU
Although this is the thing TBL always brings up, I'm still not
convinced that it is requirement, or even a requirement for some layer
after WebOnt.

R16. TrustS-X
I believe trust is essential, but I also believe it is cutting edge
research and out of scope.
