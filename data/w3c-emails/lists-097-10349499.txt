Here are the preliminary results of the straw poll on candidate
requirements. So far 5 of the eight members have voted. The table below
tabulates the results.

Key
S = Support
U = Undecided
A = Against
S-X = Support, but out of scope

R1332
R145
R1523
R1641

From this, we can see that R1, R2, R6, R7, R10, and R14 are supported
unanimously by voting members. R3, R5, R13, and R15 have some support
and no strong dissent, while  R4, R11, and R12 are contentious (they
have votes both for and against). Finally, R8, R9, and R16 have no one
who supports them.

Each member's vote on each issue is shown below:

Jeremy, Deborah, and Dan, if possible could you please vote tonight so
that I can have a more accurate picture of the group's opinion before
our report to the working group tomorrow? Thanks!
