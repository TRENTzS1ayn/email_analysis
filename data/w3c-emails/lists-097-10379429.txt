some people say they are not sure what this is - i would use findur as a strawman
starting point for it.  one paper is:
Deborah L. McGuinness. ``Ontological Issues for Knowledge-Enhanced Search''. In
the Proceedings of Formal Ontology in Information Systems, June 1998. Also in
Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications, IOS-Press, Washington, DC,
1998.   http://www.research.att.com/~dlm/papers/fois98-abstract.html

> R13. Ontology querying

not positive about this but questions of structure like returning subclasses,
superclasses, disjoint classes, etc from a class are important.  that fits in my
idea of queries of an ontology

> R14. Expressiveness             S
> R15. Proof checking             U

i would rename this explainable.  I think it is critical for a language to be
explainable.  explanations might be proofs (that are checkable) but they might
also be some other justification of information.
