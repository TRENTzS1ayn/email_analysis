Here's a little bit we've put together:

Rdf Primer Outline
A document being done by SeanPalmer and AaronSwartz.

1. Sales Pitch 
    Narrative: Boss says we need an RDF export for our sprockets right away.
    Why should I be using RDF anyway? What's this document going to tell me?

2. Right on! Wait a sec... what's RDF?
    Introduction to basics of RDF.

3. What's this Resource thing?
    Introduction to URIs and Resources.

4. But Bob says that's what XML is for!
    Introduction to uses of XML and self-describing documents.

5. So let's write some RDF...
    Writing out information and data into RDF formats.

6. Where do I go from here?
    RDF is developed by the W3C, but there's a large independent community,
lots of apps and implementations. (Lots of pointers to related material.)

N.B. From here on down, it would be suitable to segue into the RDF Cookbook
stuff; once they are able to deal with rudimentary serializations concepts,
it should be a simple matter of guiding them through the rest.

 - Introduction to developing schemas.
 - More advanced stuff with DAML and WebOnt.
 - Proof and digital signatures.
