The word "middle" doesn't occur in
http://www.daml.org/2001/03/model-theoretic-semantics.html

I assume that's the the document you were talking about.
The text of that document is sufficiently dense that
I don't get much out of a quick perusal. I'd appreciate
if you'd point out where it says that DAML+OIL
excludes the middle.
