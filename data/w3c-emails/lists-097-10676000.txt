I see now what you are getting at.  

Pat and I have been having a discussion with Jim over this point, which for
some reason Jim took off the wg mailing list.  

However, the problem here is that I was using a term ``RDF document''
without giving it a precise definition.  What I meant was:

If D1 and D2 are two RDF documents that do not use any non-RDF DAML+OIL (or
SWOL) constructs then D1 RDF-entails D2 precisely when D2 DAML+OIL- (or
SWOL-) entails D2.

Sorry for not being sufficiently precise.

If you are going to argue about logic and semantics please try to
understand what you are arguing about.

The entire model theory uses constructs that assign exactly one of two
situations to ``facts''.  For example, a pair is either in the extension of
a property or it is not in the extension of the propery.  It is not
possible for a pair to be neither in nor not in the extension of the
property.  As another example, the extension of the complement of a class
is precisely the set of resources that are not in the extension of the
class.  This is the law of the excluded middle.
