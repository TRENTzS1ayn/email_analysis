Well, I was in the process of composing a message suggesting that we
should not necessarily be assuming that the semantics of SWOL was
compatible with those of RDF(S), when I had to go teach class, and by
the time I got back, Peter seems to have come to the same conclusion. 
Since my email is now obsolete, I will go read Peter's new one and hope
he doesn't change his mind again before I have an opportunity to
respond.  :o)
