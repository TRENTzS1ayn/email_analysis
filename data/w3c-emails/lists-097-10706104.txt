It's rather unfortunate that the URI for the following resource
described in your publications page:-

[[[
Sep '95: Cite a Source! Dispell FUD!
Cite a Source! Don't take my word for it, look it up!
]]] - http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/pubs
   last revised $Date: 2000/09/12 13:56:48 $

is broken, but thanks to Google, I managed to find it again for you:-

<http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=CONNOLLY.95Sep22103458%40w3.org>
From: Dan Connolly (connolly@w3.org)
Subject: Cite Sources! Dispell FUD!
Newsgroups: comp.infosystems.www.authoring.html

also, in plain text:-

<http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=CONNOLLY.95Sep22103458%40w3.org&
output=gplain>

Nice to see that your old homepage URI still works. I've attached a
copy of the "Dispell FUD!" post as <<cite.txt>>, so that it never goes
astray again... ('though Google should take care of it).
