XML Schema Part 1: Structures, http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-0/, Section
2.6.1 xsi:type, is, I believe, the primary specification of that syntax.
The syntax is used extensively in the XML Schema documents, including XML
Schema Part 0: Primer, http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-0/, and, XML Schema
Part 2: Datatypes, http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/.

I'm not saying that it does mean *anything* as parsed by a current RDF/XML
parsed.  I'm saying that it does mean something in

``The semantics and syntax documents that I sent out''

Objection noted.

The proposal in my documents is more semantically complex than others
simply because it handles data values that do not have a locally-specified
lexical-to-value mapping.  If one were to move to an environment where this
mapping either had to be locally given for all literals or where the
mapping was unambiguous overal then there would be little difference in the
semantic complexity.

I take it that you are advocating datatyping scheme ``S''.  

I have serious reservations about ``S'', mostly concerning compatibility
with existing RDF usage and with XML documents.

If the RDF Core WG has not made a decision by the time of our face-to-face, 
it might be fruitful for us to spend some time on this issue there.
