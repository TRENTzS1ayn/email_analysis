Hmm... I'm familiar with that document, but I don't quite
see how it applies; I don't see what shema is to be used
for <Person>, rdf:about, etc.

Perhaps it's explained elsewhere...

It's traditional to cite sources by URI.

I presume you mean this one:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-webont-wg/2001Dec/att-0123/02-syntax-data-model.text

which, in turn, cites

XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0 Data Model (W3C Working Draft 7 June 2001)
http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-query-datamodel-2001-6-7/

I haven't read them in detail, but from a quick scan,
it seems to suggest that all of XML Schema becomes
necessary to parse this language. That doesn't seem
cost-effective.

RDF syntax is constrained so that consumers can
parse it without a schema. This (a) simplifies
implementations and (b) avoids a lot of trust
issues (do I have the right schema?) but
at the cost of (c) the syntax is somewhat awkwardly
constrained.

If we're willing to bite the bullet on
(a) and (b), we might as well get something
prettier (c) while we're at it.

Hmm... I don't think I understand that. What does
"locally specified lexical-to-value mapping" mean?

Yes, we've talked about that; see the recent discussions and
refinenments, in particular Idiom B ("backward compatible")
under 4.9 Modeling styles.

yup.
