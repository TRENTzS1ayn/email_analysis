From http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-1/, Section 2.6 and 2.6.1.

[[[
XML Schema: Structures also defines several attributes for direct
use in any XML documents.  [...]

2.6.1 xsi:type
The Simple Type Definition (?2.2.1.2) or Complex Type Definition (?2.2.1.3)
used in validation of an element is usually determined by reference to the
appropriate schema components. An element information item in an instance
may, however, explicitly assert its type using the attribute xsi:type.
The value of this attribute is a QName;  see QName Interpretation
(?3.15.3) for the means by which the QName is associated with a type
definition.

There are several options open for providing XML Schema datatypes for the
semantic web.  It is, of course, possible to depend on a full
implementation of XML Schema.  I strongly prefer this approach, because, as
far as I can tell, XML Schema is the W3C-recommended way of incorporating
typed data in WWW documents and so there should (soon) be available a
number of performance implementations of the full XML Schema
recommendation.   Further, XML Schema provides mechanisms for putting
datatyping information directly into XML documents, so if one desired one
would not have to depend on the XML Schema mechanisms for determining the
right schema.

However, it is also possible that one might want to (for now) build one's
own datatyping implementation.  In this case I strongly prefer going with
an input syntax that is compatible with XML Schema, namely the use of
xsi:type.  One could even restrict the XML Schema datatypes one uses to
some select built-in datatypes, resulting in a quite easy to implement, if
limited, datatyping scheme that can be upgraded to full XML Schema.

I believe that this term, or variants thereof, has been used in the RDF
Core WG group discusssions on datatyping.  In any case, it means that
literals have datatyping information given syntactically close to them in
the input document, either by means of xsi:type or some other mechanism.
Some of the RDF Core WG proposals for datatyping require locally-specified
lexical-to-value mappings, others do not.
