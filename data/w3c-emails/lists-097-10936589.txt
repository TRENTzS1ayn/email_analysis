Frank,

I agree with your point that some of daml+oil corresponds exactly to 
standard frame-based representation.  However, if this frame-based 
subset is part of a larger dl-like representation, then I think that 
misconceptions can still arise on the part of non-dl-aware users 
(i.e., my point is not about formal semantics is about the relation 
between the story presented to the user and the underlying behaviour 
of the system).
