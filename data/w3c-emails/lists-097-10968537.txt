I think daml:collection parse type is probably a mistake.

1: There is an adequate (not perfect) syntax for collections in rdf, e.g.
<rdf:Bag>. daml:colleciton looks like N.I.H. in the face of this.

2: daml:collection with its lisp/prolog like construction is very biased
towards one groups of implementors at the expense of other types of
implementors.

3: the cons-cell list data model has no semantic justification.

Anyway daml:collection should be defined as a qname not a hard-coded string.
