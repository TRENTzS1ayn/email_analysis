Neil,

sorry for bug you, but I've trouble understanding the use cases:

1) What do you mean by:
"Discrete partitions of an ontology must be recognizable in terms of the 
physical boundaries and in terms of logical (composite device) boundaries."?

2) Does
"The device is aware of its own ontological properties"
pose requirements on the Web Ontology Language, or just on the device?

3) What concrete requirements does:
"If a composite device has properties in excess of the sum of the 
properties of subordinate devices, these properties can be physically 
located on multiple nodes. Device properties may be owned/controlled by 
multiple entities. The owner/controller may modify property values" pose?

4) Further you wrote:
"Both property type and value can be changed. Type changes can be 
discovered by other services/devices and type semantics can be resolved - 
hopefully quickly!"
Does this point into ontology evolution? Are primitives requires to capture
ontology changes? Could you provide an example? Motivation?

5) For
"Properties in an ontology must be associate-able with a service/function, 
that supplies the property value"
Could you provide motivation/make up an example?
What kind of function? Do we need ways to express different access methods?
(CORBA, Java RMI, etc)?



It would be great it if it is possible for all points to write a short 
motivation and a concrete example (written in a small "pseudo" ontology 
language).

Thanks and all the best,

Stefan
