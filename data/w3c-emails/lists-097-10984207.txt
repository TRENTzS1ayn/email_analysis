Dear all,

please find attached a slightly updated Use Case document.
So far I've not received many comments from the solicitation on
on the Web Services Mailing List.

Instead I've  asked some people that provided initial input for concrete 
examples.
I have the hope that this will lead to useful examples and use cases very soon.

Thanks and all the best,

Stefan
