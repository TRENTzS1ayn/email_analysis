Primer fans--

I've gone over the current Primer draft again, and think I can see how 
to both address Aaron's concerns about using correct RDF from the start 
(instead of triples with string names for the predicates and so on), and 
mine about introducing the RDF "model" (graphs and triples) in a fairly 
complete way right away, without doing to much violence to the material 
we have now, by an appropriate interleaving of that material.  I don't 
think I'll have a draft before the telecon, but might have a draft of at 
least that material for us to consider either by the end of today or 
sometime tomorrow.  Anyway, we can talk about it.
