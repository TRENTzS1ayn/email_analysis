Roland,

I'm writing to you to tell you about a decision made by the RDFCore WG, 
because it has decided to delete a feature from the specification that I 
believe that you use.

Para graph 196 of M&S

   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2001Jun/att-0021/00-part#196

states:
[[
When an RDF processor encounters an XML element or attribute name that is 
declared to be from a namespace whose name begins with the string 
"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax" and the processor does not recognize 
the semantics of that name then the processor is required to skip (i.e., 
generate no tuples for) the entire XML element, including its content, 
whose name is unrecognized or that has an attribute whose name is unrecognized.
]]

The WG has decided to delete the effect of this text.  There is no special 
processing of elements from the namespace whose URI is 
http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax.

The WG learned that the use of this namespace was not a typo as most, if 
not all, implementors seemed to think.  Some change was necessary to 
address the fact that most if not all implementations fail to implement it 
correctly.  The WG decided there was no need for this mechanism.  The 
namespace is reserved for W3C use and the WG decided that no names would be 
placed in this namespace.

I hope that this decision is acceptable to you and that if you do use this 
feature of M&S, you can find some other way to achieve the effect you 
desire.  On the other hand, if this decision causes you difficulties, then 
I encourage you to give that feedback to the WG on www-rdf-comments@w3.org.
