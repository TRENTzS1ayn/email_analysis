Hello,

I just made public (and finished uploading) all our Annotea WWW10 material. 
this includes:

- the preprint version of our refeered paper (I was hoping to link to the 
  WWW10 site, but papers aren't yet accesible). 
- slides used when presenting the paper
- slides we used during our DevDay presentations.

You can find links pointing to this stuff at:
