Nahh... this falls under "Well-researched questions are welcome,"
especially since it points to some improvements we could
make in the W3C web site.

I'm copying www-archive@w3.org, a public archive,
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/
so that I can point other folks to it; sorry to do that without
your permission; I should have reserved the right to do so on
my home page; I presume you don't mind...

Well, my home page is XML, as are most of the actively-maintained
pages at W3C; it's XHTML, which is both
XML and HTML. But that's probably not what you meant...
you probably meant "... uses XML with some other vocabulary
than the HTML tags."

Try this one:

Yes, transforming to HTML server-side is a common idiom.
There's a whole market of tools: cocoon/ASP/JSP/etc. for
managing sites this way.

Also... it's being used in faceless/browserless
applications.

Surf around the sites I recommend on the XML home page
to get a feel for how folks are using it...

Er... where did you get the impression that
XML will replace HTML?

I expect most HTML usage to migrate to XHTML usage,
but I don't expect the headings/paragraph/lists/links
vocabulary to ever go away.

Widespread deployment of that is perhaps a ways off.
But to see it in action now, try

  xmlTree

That's one of the main uses these days, indeed. But that's
hardly the only intended use.

Introduction

      Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a simple, very flexible text
      format derived from SGML (ISO 8879). Originally designed to meet
      the challenges of large-scale electronic publishing, XML is also
      playing an increasingly important role in the exchange of a wide
      variety of data on the Web.

There are a few more articles cited from the bookmarks
section of the XML page; I recommend them, of course.
