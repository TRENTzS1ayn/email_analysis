There are some examples in Appendix A of our WWW10 paper:

yes, that gives Eric Prud'hommeaux's interactive interface
for querying our RDF database.,  If you scroll to the bottom
of the form and enter, e.g. "http://www.w3.org/" in the
"uris to check for annotations" field and select the
"query RDF DB" button you will see the then-current list
of annotations of the W3C home page known to annotest.w3.org.

So, for example, I see right now the annotation
http://annotest.w3.org/annotations/annotation/983924086.577258
which, if you request with accept: text/html you'll see quoted and
wrapped in some HTML markup but if you request with
accept: application/rdf or accept: application/xml you will
see in bare RDF/XML form.

sure.  I just copied the annotation data named above into
http://www.w3.org/2001/Annotea/examples/www.w3.org.rdf
