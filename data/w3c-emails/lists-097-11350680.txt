Hi Mary; thanks for your update of dtd2xsd.
  http://lists.xml.org/archives/xml-dev/200101/msg00481.html

I'm pleasantly surprised that anybody was able
to make heads or tails of the code, let alone
contribute!

I updated my copy

I looked over your changes briefly, but not really closely;
I trust that your code works. If you find bugs, please keep
me informed.
