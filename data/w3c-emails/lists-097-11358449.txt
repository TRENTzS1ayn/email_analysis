Hi,

I made a number of links to your site from one of my web pages:

    http://impressive.net/people/gerald/2000/07/ottawa/

specifically, to:

    http://www.octranspo.com/pi/engmenu.html
    http://www.octranspo.com/pi/schedules/current/001inde.htm
    http://www.octranspo.com/pi/schedules/current/005inde.htm
    http://www.octranspo.com/pi/schedules/current/007inde.htm

but these links are all broken now. (returning 404 errors.)

If you check your web server's error logs, I expect you will find
that there are thousands of people now encountering errors on your
site after bookmarking the bus schedules at their old locations.

Breaking links like that is anti-social; please configure your
server to serve redirects from the old locations to the new ones,
and try to avoid moving documents around in the future.

If your web server software doesn't make it easy for you to set up
redirects or maintain a site without changing the URLs, I suggest
changing the software you use; one alternative is the (free)
Apache web server, http://httpd.apache.org/
