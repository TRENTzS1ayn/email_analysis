I think that as you mentioned:

 the key point is the level of interoperability we want to achieve.

If the purpose is "only" to indicate to an Annotea client the location
to highlight, then one can use any syntax ;=) and yes, I do think that
this is a useful feature...

The fact to write "http://foo.xxx/bar.html#xpointer(id('Main')/p[2])"
has anyway enough intrinsic meaning to attach a higher level of
expectation and 99% of the internet lurkers would probably expect it to
be a valid URI that can be opened in their favorite browser!

It's a matter of presentation and

<a:context-pointer>id('Main')/p[2]</a:context-pointer>

would probably not chock anyone!
