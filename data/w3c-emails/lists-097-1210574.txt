Some further clarification:  Amaya does not yet dynamically
load RDF schemas from the Web.  It loads only the schemas listed
in Amaya/config/annot.schemas (SMOC - small matter of coding).

But Amaya will load schemas from the Web if annot.schemas
tells it to do so.  For the two namespaces
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/annotation-ns# and
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/annotationType# we cache a local
copy of the schemas.  These are the first two files Jose is
referring to.  It is legitimate to cache a copy of an RDF
Schema as http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/CR-rdf-schema-20000327
says that once you publish a namespace name you should not
change the contents of the namespace.

note that, per the comments in annot.schemas, if you just put
http://www.w3.org/2001/05/MyTypes#
(without a second field) into that file then Amaya will attempt
to read the schema from the Web.
