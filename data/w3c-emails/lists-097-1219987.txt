There is an image-editing tool that is used to add RDF metadata, through a
reasonably nice graphic interface, and various other pieces of the stuff,
that go with the Note Describing and retrieving photos using RDF and HTTP
(28 September 2000, Yves Lafon, Bert Bos) - http://www.w3.org/TR/photo-rdf/

A cool tool would be an online interface that did this for images. I copied
Yves on this because he said he thought it could eb done in a day, and he is
the expert in the relevant technology, and I am hoping he can find the day.

A cool option to add would be the ability to store this as an annotation,
where the server holding the original does not allow the data to be PUT back.
This raises the issue of finding out how to get to a readable version of the
metadata - is this an XML protocol issue or an RDF folks issue or both? (I
don't know - looking for guidance).

This kind of tool would be extermely useful for identifying images that
people want to use but can't see themselves, among other things. (There was a
recent thread on the topic on the blinux list - unfortunately I can't find it
in the archive yet, but that is at http://leb.net/blinux/blinux-list.html

cheers
