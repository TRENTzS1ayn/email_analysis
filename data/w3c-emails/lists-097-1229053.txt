Hi charles

I had a bit of a go at something like this, because I was so impressed
with the RDFPic tool. Instead of embedding RDF in the images however, I
stored all the information, including annotations and more fundamental
cataloging information in a database. There's a little demo at

http://swordfish.rdfweb.org/discovery/2001/03/demos/image.html

You can search and annotate the images.

I wanted to extend the schema used by RDFPic to include depictions of
objects and things in the image, as well as annotations. Danbri's idea
was to use terms from wordnet, but I never got around to doing that
properly.

cheers

libby
