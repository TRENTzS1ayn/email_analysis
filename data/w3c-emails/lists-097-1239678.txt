As has already been mentioned before [1] by Len, the W3C WAI ERT group
is currently developing the Evaluation And Report Language (EARL) [2],
and we believe that the Annotea project holds many great possibilities
for deployment and implementation.

For example, we have already hacked up a short example bookmarklet [3]
(based heavily on ArtB's excellent Annotea one) for annotating a
specific page with EARL. However, although this is a good
demonstration, due to my own personal lack of programming skills, the
EARL output is very thin. Hence, we would like to discuss possible
merging with Annotea.

What we'd like to start discussing is something like the current
bookmarklet, but using a similar system to the Annotea server, where
people put in their details once and are stored, and then the EARL
annotations are kept on the server for whatever length of time. I'm
not sure how this would fit in with current Annotea implementations,
but the fact that it's an RDF based framework will hopefully help.
