I wanted to have the rdf embedded in the picture to avoid losing comments
when the picture is transferred, or changed. As the server can, with the
right Accept: headers, return only the comment (and the same is possible
for HTTP PUT). Of course it doesn't preclude storing a copy of the
metadata in a db.
I like self-describing objects in general :)
