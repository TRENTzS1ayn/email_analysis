Me too :)

http://www.tasi.ac.uk/2000/09/rdfmeta/
"RDF for self-describing images"

...something I wrote a couple of years ago, occasionally updated. BTW Dave
Beckett's just been re-packaging his PNG-meta (see
ttp://sourceforge.net/projects/pmt/) that I used in the original demo to
show RDF being stored inside PNGs. Never got around to doing JPEG but then
RDFPic arrived!

My inclination is to manage the RDF alongside the images, then pack it
inside the pics for distribution. I say this in part because often the
metadata you're writing (eg. for travel photos) applies to several files
at once, so it's a tidier management strategy to keep a single .rdf file
for the entire collection, even if it gets copied into each image for
distribution. Either way it would be handy to have a Web interface to
"store" and "extract" services...

My current hobbyhorse is to explore ways of representing (via
annotations or in the original metadata) that a picture
*depicts* some individual or individuals, so we can build fun tools that
connect people visually by finding paths through the graph.

There are some examples of this in RDFWeb:

In this example, I say in RDF that some person is depicted by some image;
for image annotations that's kind of back-to-front, but the principle is
the same.
