IMHO it would be far more interesting to implement the same protocol over
a different codebase rather than install the annotea code here (er, I mean
in Bristol).

The protocol is pretty simple, though the schema used in the annotations
would differ.

Querying an annotation server

An annotation server is queried for the URIs of annotations it may hold
using the GET method. Since the client will most commonly wish to
query for annotations that have an annotates property naming a specific
page that the user may currently be viewing, a particular query
parameter is designated to pass the URI of that page, as shown in Figure
4.

GET /annot?w3c_annotates=http://example.com/some/page.html HTTP/1.1
Host: annotea.example.org
Accept: application/xml
]]

[[
The query parameter w3c_annotates may be best thought of as an
abbreviation for the longer property name
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/annotation-ns#annotates; that is, this GET is a
short-hand for a query that says "return the names of
resources that are the subjects of RDF statements in which the predicate
is http://www.w3.org/2000/10/annotation-ns#annotates and the
object is http://example.com/some/page.html". The server responds to this
GET request by returning RDF/XML describing the properties of
each annotation that has an annotates relationship to the given URI. In
the first release of our server implementation, we return all the
properties of each annotation including the URI of the body resource.
Figure 5 illustrates a typical response; in this case there is only one
annotation for the specified page.
