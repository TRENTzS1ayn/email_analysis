Appologies if this is the wrong mailing list, I couldn't work out if this
was appropriate or not.

I've been attempting to install the Annotea server, I have all the pieces
installed (from the CVS archive), but when the CGI script attempts to open
the users file I created I get:

[Thu May 24 12:35:31 2001] [error] [client 152.78.65.48] (2)No such file
or directory: could not open dbm auth file: /usr/local/src/w3cperl-cvs/perl/modules/Conf/users
[Thu May 24 12:35:31 2001] [error] [client 152.78.65.48] DBM user swh not
found: /usr/local/src/w3cperl-cvs/perl/modules/W3C/Annotations/CGI/annotate

Obviously The file /usr/local/src/w3cperl-cvs/perl/modules/Conf/users
exists, and is readable by the CGI process:

[swh@inanna swh]$ ls -l /usr/local/src/w3cperl-cvs/perl/modules/Conf/users
-rw-r--r--    1 swh      cvs         12288 May 23 16:08 /usr/local/src/w3cperl-cvs/perl/modules/Conf/users
[swh@inanna swh]$ file /usr/local/src/w3cperl-cvs/perl/modules/Conf/users
/usr/local/src/w3cperl-cvs/perl/modules/Conf/users: Berkeley DB (Hash, version 7, native byte-order)

Originally the file it was looking for was /etc/apache/conf/users or similar,
so I altered the code, but it doesn't seem to have helped.

Any help appreciated,
   Steve
