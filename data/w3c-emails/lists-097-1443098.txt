Hello list-members,

I'd like to publish some info about a project I'm just working on, an
Annotea client for Internet Explorer. You can find a first running version
at http://www.formatvorlage.de/experiment/annotea/ .It supports creating
selection-level annotations and showing them right in the document. The
scripts can create/resolve the XPointers needed, IE's XML element is used to
retrieve the RDF data from the server.
This is only a pre-release, so it's unstable and buggy and due to security
limitations restricted to annotate only docs from the sane server, but it
works. Nice to see annotations popping up on IE, however.

Please read the doc before trying the demo, you have to switch one option in
your IE prefs security panel before you can access XML data sources from
another domain (without using a signed script).

Any comments, suggestions, etc. are greatly appreciated.

Claus Augusti
