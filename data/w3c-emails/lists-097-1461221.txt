This should not be a problem.  I haven't tried Claus' Annotea 
client but I am able to use Annozilla - the Mozilla Annotea client:

 http://annozilla.mozdev.org/

and the Annotea bookmarklets (documented at):

 http://www.w3.org/2000/02/collaboration/annotation/JavaScript/Annotea-JavaScript.html

with Netscape Communicator to browse annotations created with the
Amaya implementation of Annotea:

 http://www.w3.org/2001/Annotea/

The oppposite - annotations created via Annozialla and the bookmarklets
can be browsed with Amaya - also works.

It was also reported:

 http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-annotation/2001JanJun/0051.html

that the bookmarklets work with the Mac's IE browser.

If your question is about database synchronization [are simultaneous 
writes supported] - that should be handled by the underlying database 
used by the server.  For more information about the Annotea server, see:
