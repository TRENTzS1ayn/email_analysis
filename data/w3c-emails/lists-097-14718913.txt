Hi,

A while ago I wrote to you pointing out a bug in Google's indexer,
that it does not index URIs that have '@'s in them. You seem to
have made some progress on that, since there are now some URIs
with '@'s in your index; sample:

    http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&safe=off&q=+site%3Aimpressive.net+oskoboiny+%2B%22www-talk%22+archive+%22new+search%22&btnG=Google+Search

but it still fails to index URIs that look like:

    http://impressive.net/archives/fogo/20000809025411.N7692@impressive.net

it only indexes URIs that look like this:

    http://impressive.net/archives/www-talk/25020093151848@HUJIVMS

i.e. if there is a hostname after the '@', the pages are ignored.
(so ironically, the only messages in my archives that are being
indexed by google are those that have bogus message-id's :( )

Could you please fix this? Those URIs are valid, per sec. 2 of RFC 2396.

Past correspondence follows:
