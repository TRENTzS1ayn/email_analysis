I'm really happy about this work. This is just great!

I'll ask about this from the Amaya team. My personal view is that the
document is invalid without tbody and it is helpful that it corrects it
when I update the document, but I don't think Amaya should add it to
XPointers until it really is in the document.

We are also trying to find out what the opinion of the involved working
groups are about using XPointer with HTML documents.
