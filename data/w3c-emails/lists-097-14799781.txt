The link from:

http://www.w3.org/OOP/HypermediaTech

to "Why Tcl Doesn't Scale" is broken, it should go to:

http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/drafts/why-tcl-doesnt-scale.html

(Took me a while to figure this out since the title of the link 
is wrong too -- the paper is "Why Tcl Doesn't Scale" not "Why 
Tcl Doesn't Scale Well".)

While we're on the subject, Tcl (finally?) fixed both of the 
bugs you mentioned -- it now supports namespaces, and it has an 
intermediate bytecode. However, most Tcl things I've seen don't 
use namespaces.
