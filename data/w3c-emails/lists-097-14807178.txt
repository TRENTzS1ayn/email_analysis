The attached file is a JPEG of the SVG file that I got from:-

   [1] =CWM=> XML RDF =SiRPAC=> SVG* =hand=> SVG

SVG* had bad character entities in it. The file overall is just under
half an MB, I think.

As you can see, there are some neat little patterns revealed by this.
The blobby things at the left of the file tend to be Aaron's W3C
technical plenary meeting notes, which have lots of links in them, and
the ladder at the bottom right is created by the links in the xWeb
documents.

It's interesting to use the attached as a "metro map" of the thing
zoomed in. I mangaged to navigate from a node that turned out to be
TimBL, to the file which is all on its own, only connected by two
links. I had been hoping that the file would reveal a series of badly
connected blobs, revealing bad site design, but that didn't happen.
What it did reveal, however, is that there are a number of pages which
aren't linked to in logicerror.com. You can't see these on the
attached file, but there's a group of them above that mess.

Interesting little experiment!
