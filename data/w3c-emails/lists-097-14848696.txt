Hi

Forwarding this from the SWIPL list as thought it'd be of interest to folk
working on the XSB RDF components, or thinking about common approaches to
RDF-handling that'd work in a variety of Prologs...

Dan

ps. for some related-but-different RDF experiments using XSB, see
http://rdfweb.org/ -> http://rdfweb.org/~pldab/rdfweb/closure.P
(possibly to be written up at some point...)

Hi folks!

The second article in my series on Prolog and RDF went live on XML.com
yesterday. It's called "RDF Applications with Prolog" and it's at:

http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2001/07/25/prologrdf.html

I plump SWI-Prolog heavily, and talk about rdf_db and html_write. It's
fun, if long ;)

If anyone has a SWI-Prolog based RDF app that wants a bit of publicity,
please send me a link. I'd love to add them to the "Useful Links" section
at the end.

Also, has the TWiki moved? This link is down:
http://gollem.swi.psy.uva.nl/twiki/pl/bin/view/Main/WebHome

It looks like I have the go ahead for another article in this series, so
if anyone has interesting stuff, let me know. I can't promise I'll
use/mention it (heh :)), but when I can, I shall.

Cheers,
Bijan Parsia.
