Annozilla gets away with it because the DOM methods say that there is a 
TBODY element even if there is not one in the document. I raised this issue 
on the list a while ago because I thought it needed clarification.

I haven't looked at how the IE client works, but in Annozilla, I use the 
DOM to work out an XPointer for the selected text. (Actually this is not in 
a released version yet, it will be in the next version...) Consequently I 
am at the mercy of whatever the DOM methods return.

An HTML document can be valid with a <table> but no <tbody> - in fact I 
think they can even miss out <html>, <head> and <body>, and all of these 
will be implicitly created. I had thought that the DOM specs mandate this 
behaviour, but having a quick look now I can't find a reference to this. 
I'm sure it's in one of the W3C specs though.

(In a working draft of DOM requirements 
http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-DOM-Requirements-20010419/ there is:
Implied elements are exposed even if not explicitly defined in the document 
(e.g., HTML, HEAD, BODY).

(Section 2.1.2 item 3).)

This is why I think the Annotea specs need to say more than "we use 
XPointers to define the annotated section".
