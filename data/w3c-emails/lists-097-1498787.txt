The only difference (apart from bugs!) is the level of XPointer 
implementation. I don't know what level of XPointer support Amaya has, but 
it certainly supports string-range(), which Annozilla does not (yet).

There is one current bug I know of, Annozilla will fail to understand, say, 
/html/p[10]. This will be fixed in the next release.
