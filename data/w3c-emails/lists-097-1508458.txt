I installed the IE5.5 annogates few days ago. In general it works well. 
However, sometimes it comes up with a Javascript error, saying 'document is 
undefined'.

To make it clear: what I did was to have a bookmark entry and I manually 
exchanged the URL in the bookmark to the two javascripts for create and 
extract annotations. I run it with IE5.5 on win2000.

Unfortunately, I could not pinpoint when exactly it happens. It is not 
related to a specific document, it is not related on whether I use a 
bookmark or something else. I think it never comes up for the first time I 
use it. To make things even works, if I insist, it might lead to a crash of IE.

Anybody else had this problem? Any idea what happens?
