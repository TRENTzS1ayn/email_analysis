It seems that I never received this message and wasn't able to follow up
on it.

The W3C software license was submitted by W3C some time ago, but no response
was received.  Please add it to the list with the following specifications:

Name:  W3C IPR Software Notice
URL: http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-software-19980720
Contact: Philippe Le Hegaret <plh@w3.org>

(Philippe, if you are not the right person, please send Lawrence the email
of the right person.)

IMHO the W3C license is obviously open source (new BSD style), and should be
blessed ASAP.

I'm not the right person on that even if this subject come
from time to time on the DOM public mailing lists. The W3C Contact
should be Joseph Reagle <reagle@w3.org> (cc in this message). He submitted a
request
in January 2001 but never got a response [1].

This subject strikes back again today regarding the development of the
DOM Test Suites in a public domain and might prevent us to use SourceForge:

  Perhaps not from the W3C's perspective, but for SourceForge, the
*project* must have an OSD license to use the SF facilities -- even if
the facility isn't CVS.
  It is unfortunate that the W3C license is not OSI approved, but
that's not a battle I want to take on.

I'm wondering if the W3C software license was lost somewhere or rejected for
some unknown reasons. It is our intention to fix the W3C software license
if it doesn't match the requested criteria but we cannot move if we are not
aware of the rejection's reasons.

Philippe
