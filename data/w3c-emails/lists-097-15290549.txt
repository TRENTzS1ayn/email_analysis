They don't? I don't know of any "W3C rules" for URLs, but they 
are most certainly in the IETF's URL spec. To my knowledge, they 
are perfectly good URLs.

They aren't? But I thought you were accessing them! You must 
recognize the definition of Web we are using. The Web is the set 
of all things that have URIs, not the set of things you can type 
into your web browser and get bits back.

I don't see how that's relevant. I was around long before they 
thought of naming me Aaron, but that's still my name, isn't it?

I'd certainly agree with you. But please understand there is a 
difference between scanning in the content of something, and 
simply using a term to refer to it. Just giving it a URI would 
"put it on the Web" so to speak, although this disagrees with 
common usage. And it would never be scanned in to some sort of 
global matrix.

I know we've gone over this before so either you just aren't 
getting this, or you want to stir up trouble. Either way, I 
think this conversation is over.
