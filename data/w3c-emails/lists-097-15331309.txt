Michael,

See http://www.w3.org/2001/06/rdf-xproc/1 for my position paper for the
XML Processing workshop. This was prepared with lots of input from Eric
Miller, who (if he's happy with the final content) will put his name to the
paper too. The last revision I made was $Id: 1.html,v 1.11 2001/06/25
23:20:59 danbri Exp $ but I'm happy with any edits Eric sees fit to make.
Is it possible for us to make further refinements to the paper after the 25th?

cheers,

Dan
