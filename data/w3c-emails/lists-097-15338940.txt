I fail to see how this is relevant. The relevant RFC seems to be:

http://www.w3.org/Addressing/rfc1738.txt

in which case it doesn't seem to matter what you name your files 
(we can always escape it).

;-) I'm not sure if you've read TimBL's book, "Weaving the Web", 
but I recall a quote along the lines of: "At W3C meetings, we 
have a rule: if it isn't on the Web, it doesn't exist and you 
can't mention it."

I agree that we are not at all clear about what it means for 
something to be "on the Web." It seems to have several:

  - The set of all resources (the domain of discourse, includes 
things like
    unicorns)
  - someplace murky here that I think DanC was referring to with no clear
    definition
  - Everything that has a URI scheme meant to identify it 
(currently files on
    computers, books with ISBNs, etc.)
  - Everything available over the Internet.
  - Everything over HTTP

I'd also quickly admit that we need better systems for giving 
things URIs and defining resources. I'd like to know if you have 
any suggestions on how to make this clearer, stemming from your 
background in semiotics, etc.

My understanding is that a URI is a special type of name -- one 
that follows the rules in:

   http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt

It's an attempt to create a naming system that helps prevent 
name collisions. Combined with a resolution system, it seems to 
have been very useful over the past ten years.

Of course. There is no argument here.

I continue to agree.

I suppose it all depends on what the Web means, which I'm no 
longer sure of. Historically, it seems to be:

The World Wide Web (known as "WWW', "Web" or "W3") is the universe of
network-accessible information, the embodiment of human knowledge.

You seem to be assuming a definition of Web while providing one 
which makes this long sentence very hard for me to understand. 
However, I agree that the things are very confusing this way and 
would appreciate suggestions in fixing it.

I'm not certain that this is true. While I may have argued this 
position, I do not personally believe it strongly.

I recall having a conversation a month or two bag which talked 
about grains of sand on the beach, although I'm not inclined to 
go dig it up.

Thank you for the offer. In this message I've tried to take a 
different approach -- instead of trying hard to argue the URI 
"dogma" (and trying to convince you of its truth) instead I hope 
that my background in the Web and your background in semiotics 
can help us find some sort of compromise to sort out the 
difficult bits of the terminology we (the RDF/Semantic Web 
Community) use.

I do ask that you bear with me if I say things that are silly, 
but please continue to point them out. I am often an optimist, 
but I do think we might actually get somewhere on this.
