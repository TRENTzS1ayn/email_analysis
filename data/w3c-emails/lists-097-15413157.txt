Example 1, 2, 47, 48, 49 and 50 done.

Note I moved the attribute to the *children* of Body and Header because
given the reason for moving it down from Envelope was that the Envelope does
not use Section 5 encoding then the same applies to Header and Body, they
don't use Section 5 encoding either.

The only thing I can think of is moving encodingStyle attribute in
appendix A examples away from the envelope element.

I can do that now.
