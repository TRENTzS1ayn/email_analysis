I uploaded an updated spec to[1]

See previous mails and/or change log for update list.

I'm about to go and 'de-pink' as much as I can before exhaustion sets in...
I'll upload the (partially?) 'de-pinked' version later tonight. That way,
should anyone not like my 'de-pinking' they can get the previous version out
of CVS.

Cheers

Gudge
