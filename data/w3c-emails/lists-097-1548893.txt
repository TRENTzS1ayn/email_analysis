                                          Workshop on

                      Knowledge Markup and Semantic Annotation
                        October 21, 2001, Victoria B.C., Canada
                    <http://semannot2001.aifb.uni-karlsruhe.de/>

                                    in conjunction with the
                First International Conference for Knowledge Capture
                    <http://sern.ucalgary.ca/ksi/K-CAP/K-CAP2001/>


                                     --- Call for Papers ---

Capturing knowledge by using markup techniques and by supporting semantic
annotations is a major technique for creating metadata. It is beneficial
in a wide range of content-oriented intelligent applications.  One
important application, for instance, is the Semantic Web. Here, knowledge
markup is a major challenge, i.e. the problem is the providing of knowledge
structures for existing syntactic or multimedia resources.  The workshops
intend to bring together researchers and practitioners from such communities
as W3C, MPEG-7, AI, Natural Language technologies and KR to discuss various
aspects of knowledge markup and semantic annotation.


Submission Papers:
Practitioners and researchers interested in participating should submit 
either a
full paper (less than 6000 words) or a position paper (less than 1500 words)
addressing relevant issues. Submit before July 15, 2001
in electronic form (postscript or pdf)
to: handschuh@aifb.uni-karlsruhe.de.

Topics of Interest includes, but are not limited to:

* web page annotation
* collaborative, shared annotation
* knowledge markup in the Semantic Web
* ontology-based markup
* using semantic annotations to define knowledge
* tools for supporting knowledge markup
* integrated software architecture based on semantic annotation
* multimedia annotation (e.g. by using MPEG-7)
* annotation of software components
* linguistic aspects of semantic annotation
* capturing knowledge through Information Extraction and NLP
* text mining for creating knowledge markup
* evaluation of manual annotation

Although not required for the initial submission, we recommend to follow 
the format
guidlines of K-Cap 2001 
<http://sern.ucalgary.ca/ksi/K-CAP/K-CAP2001/CFP.html#submission-guidelines>,
as this will be the required format for accepted papers.
