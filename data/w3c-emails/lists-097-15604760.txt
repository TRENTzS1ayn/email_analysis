>
>3.3.3 <KeyUsage>
>Why not use URIs so this can be extensible and externally specified? (Right 
>now can never extend beyond the stated meaning of signature, encryption, or 
>exchange.)
>
>3.3.8 Respnse Message
>Similar question, are the ResultCodes extensible?
>
>3.3.9 Faults
>I do not yet understand the nuances of "expressing this protocol in SOAP" 
>versus "XKMS is SOAP application." One possible ramification is that by 
>relying upon the SOAP faultcode in this instance, would this also render 
>any other modules/messages as a fault within the same SOAP envelop?
>
>6.1.2/3
>Why is Signature optional within the KeyBindingAuth and ProofOfPosession 
>elements? If those parent elements exist, what else would be included? 
>(This applies to some of the other structures in section 6).
>
>A.2 RSA Private Key DATa
>You could use the Modulus and Exponenet from the dsig structures.
