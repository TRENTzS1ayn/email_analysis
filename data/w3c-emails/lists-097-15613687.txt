3.3.3 <KeyUsage>
Why not use URIs so this can be extensible and externally specified? (Right 
now can never extend beyond the stated meaning of signature, encryption, or 
exchange.)

3.3.8 Respnse Message
Similar question, are the ResultCodes extensible?

3.3.9 Faults
I do not yet understand the nuances of "expressing this protocol in SOAP" 
versus "XKMS is SOAP application." One possible ramification is that by 
relying upon the SOAP faultcode in this instance, would this also render any 
other modules/messages as a fault within the same SOAP envelop?

6.1.2/3
Why is Signature optional within the KeyBindingAuth and ProofOfPosession 
elements? If those parent elements exist, what else would be included? (This 
applies to some of the other structures in section 6).

A.2 RSA Private Key DATa
You could use the Modulus and Exponenet from the dsig structures.
