Well, it is a pain, isn't it.  But in fact there are bigger changes!
Changing  <> forAll to this forAll for example.

That's probably because it doesn't recognise the variables (use "this")
or the log: namespace.

I agree!  The problem is to sync the web site with a public repository.
I have it in the cvs repositpory whcih is protected but mirrored.
I think I should just move it and let hte web site get synched by hand or
something.
I agree with you.

It has gone though a big change just recently.  I'm sorry it is a mess.
