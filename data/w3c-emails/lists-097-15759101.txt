Updated examples for Section 1.3

Replacement text for first cyan block[1]
Replacement text for second cyan block[2]

Changed prefix from XS to env. Put in a 'real' URI.

Was the intent to make the value of SOAPAction the same as the namespace
name for the GetLastTradePrice element? I'm guessing yes, but it's not clear
from the spec...

Cheers

Gudge
