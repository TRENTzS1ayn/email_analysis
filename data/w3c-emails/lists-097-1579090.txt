Kynn,
Annotea and other annotation systems are not specifically tailored to Web
authors and designers
but to people who read the pages.
And I don't see how Web designers and authors could prevent us (the readers)
to use such systems.

In the paper world, the problem is less of importance, since only ONE reader
usually "destroys"
the layout of the author by highlighting and marking the pages.

In the electronic word, you can get the marks left by other readers even
before you start your own annotations.
This can become a problem, greatly examplified by ThirdVoice (cluttered
annotations on Web pages).

I believe annotation tools will be used, but readers might want to filter
annotations (like using specific
annotation servers: your classroom, your university, your company, your
research group...).

Laurent.
