Updated examples for section 5.4.1

Replacement text for first cyan block[1]
Replacement text for third cyan block[2]
Replacement text for fourth cyan block[3]
Replacement text for fifth cyan block[4]
Replacement text for sixth cyan block[5]
Replacement text for seventh cyan block[6]

Added ns decl for prefixes e and xsi. removed prefixes n and m ( remapped to
e ). Schema example[6] rewritten. I'm waiting for some input on the schema
itself from a couple of people on the schema group. I'll post again after I
get that feedback. I'm confident that the schema is correct but there may be
a more concise form.

Viewing[2] and [4] in IE 5.5 doesn't work. Use View Source to see the real
thing...
