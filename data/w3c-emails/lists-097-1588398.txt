I've been following some discussions about Smart Tags and I see two
general types of objections:

Some people think that any kind of "mediation" of their content is wrong
and thus oppose all annotation (and many other aspects of the Semantic
Web). (BTW, I don't think it's accurate to say that annotation can't be
prevented. Annotation software developers can only fight off so many
lawsuits before they go bankrupt.)

Some people dislike the fact that the default Smart Tags database was
pointing only to Microsoft sites, but they don't object to annotation as
long as it isn't being used to prop up a monopoly.
