Huh? Have their been any annotation lawsuits? By whom, over what? I still
think that the "grafitti" complaint is spurrious, aside from the cases
where offensive or libelous content is annotated on.

The courts, at least in the U.S., just don't allow a technology to be
killed. If the technology has some social value, some vendors work with the
gov to meet the guidelines established for its use.
