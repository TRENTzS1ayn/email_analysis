some scribbles triggered by the webont stuff, trying to mix in some
complimentary yet overlapping rdf namespaces...


<rdf:RDF
xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
xmlns:air="http://www.megginson.com/exp/ns/airports#"
xmlns:wordnet="http://xmlns.com/wordnet/1.6/"
xmlns:contact="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/pim/contact#"
xmlns:foaf="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/" >

<foaf:Person
foaf:name="Dan Brickley"
foaf:givenName="Dan"
foaf:surname="Brickley" >

  <contact:nearestAirport>
    <wordnet:Airport air:icao="EGGD" />
  </contact:nearestAirport>

</foaf:Person>

</rdf:RDF>

...plus (todo):

subproperties connecting foaf/contact name stuff (we did this already?)
not yet. see http://www.w3.org/2001/08/rdfweb/foaf (hmm, should FOAF drop
surname in favour of 'lastName', I forget what I was told about this).
Could be a good test case for subPropertyOf loops here?

air:iata is a daml uniqueProperty (seems a more neutral / widely
understandable way of identifying airports than giving them URIs).

Something to say that one as at most one nearest airport too?
(unambigprop?)

wonder if I have a picture of Bristol airport anywhere... certainly have a
picture that is a foaf:depiction of Bristol, but the RDF doesn't mention
Bristol yet.

suggestion: leave the domain of 'nearestAirport' vague, so we can say in
addition to the above that...

...
<foaf:livesIn>
  <wordnet:City rdfs:label="Bristol" (??? can cities have foaf:names?) >
    <contact:nearestAirport>
      <wordnet:Airport>
         <air:icao>EGGD</air:icao>
 ...
