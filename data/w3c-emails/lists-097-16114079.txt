No - see my third paragraph below (the one starting with "an underlying
protocol"), case (c).

If the binding (not the underlying protocol, because we can't see the
underlying protocol directly, just the binding) doesn't supply a required
feature, it would have to be satisfied by a module.  There is some question
as to whether you'd call that "application-level", since you could envision
scenarios where the SOAP node decides to activate the module (middleware),
and others where the application (i.e. the thing which engages the SOAP
node) explicitly handles inserting the module's headers itself.

This is correct IF the MEP in question is exposed as a feature by the
binding.  For instance, we could imagine an HTTP binding which said nothing
about the inherent request-response nature of HTTP and how it maps to the
SOAP-level request-response MEP.  If that were the case, then according to
our framework there would be no guidance which the SOAP engine writer could
use to conclusively determine that a "response" per a SOAP req-resp MEP is
contained within the HTTP response and therefore no correlation module needs
to engage.  So not only must the underlying protocol support a given MEP,
but it must be described as such in the spec.

It is certainly true that the feature sets of various underlying protocols,
the bindings which utilize them, and the available modules will be varied.

Perhaps part of the problem here may be that we keep trying to limit the
scope of what we're doing to be JUST the bindings, whereas I think in
reality it's a bit larger than that.  Part of what I think we're doing is
laying some usable structure on top of the idea that different parts of a
SOAP node (modules, bindings) may be used to satisfy requirements in a given
message exchange.  Some of what is interesting about that involves the
writers of different specifications (modules and bindings) being able to
describe the functionality of those pieces in such a way that we can
conclusively say that yes, module A provides the SAME
semantics/functionality as binding B with respect to a particular feature.
