Henrik,

The only place I can find the wording you refer to online is in a message
Glen sent to the WG just ahead of the September F2F [1].

I think that what happened was that this and [2] were merged on someone's PC
at the f2f, transferred to floppy and printed at the reception desk. I don't
think the merged version ever made it onto the Web. It's a pity this text
'fell-off-the-web' I like it too.

Stuart
