I think the fear is that companies (especially microsoft which heads the
browser business now) could hurt any competition that was out there. AKA.
If microsoft doesn't want you to see it, you don't. Now, yes, if Microsoft
didn't want you to go to competitors websites, they could add that into
the MSIE code, but I think that people fear this is a more covert way of
doing it. If the feature is as annoying as say, the MS paperclip, it could
be even worse....

For example, MSNBC could steal alot of CNN's views because an annotation
says to check out MSNBC's site instead. Also, if I type in
www.priceline.com, and I REALLY want to go to priceline, do I want to be
asked, do you want to try microsoft's expedia? when it's going there. I
wonder how much control Microsoft will have over recording what websites
you go to also (how centralized this feature is)s. What kind of profiling
might be created? It's kinda creepy
when you think about it.

anyway, post your feedback at me, don't flame...
