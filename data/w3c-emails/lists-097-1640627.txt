I decided to totally quit from usual human life and make my own Annotea
project.
As you probably have expected (from certain conversations on other
lists) I am looking for a document that describes how Eric's Annotea
"RDF persistent store" works in some detail. A document covering an even
wider area of the project would be even more helpful. I just wish a day
had 48 hours...
Thanks for your time.


Kindest regards,

Manos
