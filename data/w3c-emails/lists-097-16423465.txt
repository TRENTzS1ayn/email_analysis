Hi All,

In response to Dan's challenge, here is a SOAP server and client for
the query engine. At the moment, it only lets you query by file name
(can be a local file name, or an HTTP URI), but it works alright.

I had to modify query.py a little so that it would run using a SOAP
interface (I have not added the other changes that need to be done
yet). Aaron, could you bung it in CVS please? It's attached as
<<query.py>>.

As for the server and client, the server is attached as
<<query-server.py>>, and runs with:-

   python query-server.py > errors.html

Further to the attached query.py, you'll need rdfapi.py, ntriples.py
to run it, available from CVS [1], and of course SOAP.py. To run the
client, which is attached as <<query-client.py>>, load up the server,
and try:-

   python query-client.py > output.n3

for the built in test (which runs over the Web), and:-

   python query-client.py URIa URIb > output.n3

for your own query. As query.py gets updated, more features may
follow.

Cheers,
