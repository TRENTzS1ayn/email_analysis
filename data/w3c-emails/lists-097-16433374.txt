Just noodling on the relationship between "values" and "range"...

We have:-

  :bottom :values "<length> | <percentage> | auto | inherit" .

which is *like*:-

   :bottom :value v:length, v:percentage, v:auto, v:inherit .

but is more accurately modelled as:-

   :bottom rdfs:range :Bottom .
   :Bottom daml:unionOf
      (u:length u:percentage [ daml:oneOf (v:auto v:inherit) ]) .

This means that the range of "values" in my original result is an
alternate plain text representation of the range of the CSS
properties.

   { ?x :values ?y } log:implies { ?x rdfs:range ?z . ?z rdfs:label
?y } .

or, more like:-

   { ?x :values ?y } log:implies { ?x rdfs:range ?z . ?z :altRepr ?y }
.

Which is not at all useful, unless someone really wants to follow up
and start an RDF version of CSS.
