I decided to convert a chord dictionary for guitar into RDF, with the
possible goal of creating a CGI to search such an RDF database, using
the PlexRDF API stuff.

I got the chord dictionary from OLGA [1], at [2], and then used a
Python RegExp (attached as <<RegExp.py>>) to come up with a Notation3
file (attached as <<tab.n3>>). I cut down the chord file (attached as
<<tab.txt>>) so that it wouldn't mess up the RegExp, and converted the
N3 output to XML RDF (attached as <<tab.rdf>>).
