O.K., so it veritably sucked... not only did it use POST instead of
GET, but it used it over a non-CGI based server. Well, to make up for
that, find attached a proper CGI <<query.cgi>> of about half the size,
that works just as well, and runs in an ordinary browser.

There, now you can relax Aaron... or should I say REST?
