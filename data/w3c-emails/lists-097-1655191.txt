Version 0.3 of Annozilla (an Annotea client for Mozilla) has been released.
http://annozilla.mozdev.org/

It will require a 0.9 or better build of Mozilla, due to changes in 
Mozilla's XUL language after 0.8, and the introduction of the 
XMLHttpRequest object to the Mozilla builds. (I am testing under 0.9.1.)

New in this version:
- creates annotations by POSTing XML to the annotation server
- create an annotation on the selected region of the document
- allows the user to attach dc:language metadata to annotations
- allows the user to filter annotations by language

plus various fixes and improvements.

As usual your bug reports and comments are welcome; particularly on the 
user interface aspects of selecting the language.

Matthew Wilson
