(archiving some notes for reference --danbri)

For example of using a sha1 RDF property to pick out digital content and
associate it with other metadata, here is an RDF fragment (assume some
xml namespace declarations):

<wn:Episode dc:title="Buffy the Vampire Slayer - 603 - After Life" >
 <foaf:homepage rdf:resource="http://www.episodelist.com/shows/view_episode.asp?episode_id=3162"/>
 <foaf:homepage rdf:resource"http://www.buffyguide.com/episodes/afterlife.shtml" />
 <dc:creator>Jane Espenson</dc:creator>
 <s:encoded>
  <wn:Recording
    digit:sha1="ea74dbda94b0ff77a92875899c1103b91575d834"
    dc:size="170274820"
    dc:format="video/mpeg" />
  </wn:Recording>
 </s:encoded>
</wn:Episode>


...so the interesting thing here is that we've described (and identified)
a piece of digital content, without mentioning any URIs for locating
(purchasing... etc) it in the Web.

Somebody who had a copy of this video/mpg could use such a description to
dissiminate information about its location. Somebody who claimed ownership
over this content could use such a description as an anchor for a rights
statement.
