Good idea...

I am actually not sure I can see the benefit of talking about underlying
protocol MEPs - after all we are interested in carrying SOAP messages
around and not of modeling underlying protocols in general. It seems to
me that just as we expose features to SOAP, we expose MEPs to SOAP -
whether they are "native" or not doesn't really matter. Also, it doesn't
seem consistent that we talk about one particular property of the
underlying protocol but not others like intermediaries, say. What
benefit does this distinction bring to the table?

I may have missed something but after having read Noah's discussion and
moved a few things up in the introduction, I could not find anything
that wasn't addressed already with respect to features and MEPs.

That is fine - I was assuming that the part being edited was intended
for part 1. It may make sense to move the description of properties to
the HTTP binding in section 2 - I haven't touched that at all.
