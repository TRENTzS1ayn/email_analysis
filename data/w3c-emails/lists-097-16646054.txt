In reviewing my work of last night I realize that more typos crept in than 
I had realized.  Some are due to my use of speech recognition technology, 
which tends to create mangled syntax (but never bad spelling), and some 
due to the lateness of the hour.  I hope the intent of the changes is 
clear.  Where something doesn't read quite right, it probably was just an 
oversight.  I noticed at least one formatting error too:  the text that 
reads

concepts that are common to all binding specifications 
* To facilitate transparent application access to multiple bindings that 
support common features and message exchange patterns 
* To enable SOAP and optional features built on SOAP to take advantage of 
the native features of the underlying protocols available to it.

Sorry for any confusion, but I thought it would be worth getting something
