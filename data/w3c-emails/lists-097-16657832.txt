I have continued the editing of Noah's work and here is the result - I
think we are getting close! I found a lot of duplication - have cleaned
it up somewhat. I have included both the HTML version and the Word
version with change bars (don't know how to export them to HTML).

Hugo, Yves, rather than sending the whole thing to everybody on
xml-dist-app, would it be possible to upload this some place on the W3C
site?
