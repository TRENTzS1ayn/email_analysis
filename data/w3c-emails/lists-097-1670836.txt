Winds are blowing? I would say hot air is blowing. Who would sue? On that
very same discussion group, a more cogent argument is presented which just
strips down the anti-SmartTag sentiment to anti-Micrsoft. I can't explain
why the SayNoToThirdVoice group still has the problem with graffiti.

This makes some claim about "unauthorized derivative work". Anyway, we can
blow all the steam we want about what the legal ramifications are. Wendy,
and other lawyers, a general question: do academic law programs (such as
Berkman Center) do any research preperation in anticipation of legal
conflicts? I remember that Jonathan Zittrain at Berkman had quite
supportive of annotation when ThirdVoice came out with the software and
starting getting flack.

I have some interesting work that I hinted about before regarding
server-side annotation/collaboration. I will definitely have more to
present in a few weeks-- I can only hint for so long! Given the choice
between publisher-managed and third-party-managed annotation, I'm betting
that most publishers would choose the former.
