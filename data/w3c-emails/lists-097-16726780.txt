Hi Noah et. al,

The wires that connect HP and Lotus must be very narrow... it took 2hrs
10mins to get here! Fortunately I saw Highland's question in response much
earlier which contained your various suggestions. 

I was on the brink of making an almost identically worded insert to:

>>MEPs are considered to be a type of feature;  unless otherwise stated,
references to the term "feature" apply also to MEPs.<<

at exactly the same point in the document... so that was reassuring!

Unfortunately, I have not seen your response to Highlands question, which
may have been a simple 'yes' or it may have been a revision to the Ed Note
(in which case I have not changed it from your original suggestion).
I've attached HTML and DOC versions of the revisions I've applied and a diff
version from Henriks previous version to speed review.

The main piece that has given perhaps needs more careful review is the
following change:

<original_version>
As described above, SOAP can be augmented with optional features (such as
reliable message delivery) and with new Message Exchange Patterns
(request/response, multicast, etc.). The specification of each such MEP or
feature MUST include the following:

1.The information (state) required at each node to implement the MEP
or feature.
2.The processing required at each node in order to fulfill the
obligations of the MEP or feature.
3.The information transmitted from node to node, and in the case of
MEPs, any requirements to generate additional messages (such as responses to
requests in a request/response MEP).

Every binding specification MUST support the transmission and processing of
one-way messages as described in this specification. A binding specification
MAY state that it supports additional MEPs and/or features, in which case
the binding specification MUST provide for maintaining state, performing
processing, and transmitting information in a manner consistent with the
specification for those MEPs and features.
</original_version>

<revised_version>

reliable message delivery, request/response MEPs, multicast MEPs, etc.). The
specification of each such feature MUST include the following:

</revised_version>

I believe that this all in line with what we agreed on the call.

Best regards

Stuart
