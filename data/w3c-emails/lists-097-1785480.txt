Many of the objections are not so much for annotations but how much control 
the users have for using/not using them, defining with whom to share them 
and how to present them and selecting where to store them.

We should try to keep in mind that there are many possibilities if the 
implementations are done right.

And that kind of a personal/group server is possible with the Annotea 
(http://www.w3.org/2001/Annotea) server developed by Eric Prud'hommeaux. 
There is probably still work to make it easy enough to set up for any user, 
but the capabilities are there. The users can help by providing feedback on 
instructions and/or the code itself to this list.
