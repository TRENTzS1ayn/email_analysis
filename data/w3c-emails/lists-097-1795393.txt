                                          Workshop on

                      Knowledge Markup and Semantic Annotation
                        October 21, 2001, Victoria B.C., Canada
                    <http://semannot2001.aifb.uni-karlsruhe.de/>

                                    in conjunction with the
                First International Conference for Knowledge Capture
                    <http://sern.ucalgary.ca/ksi/K-CAP/K-CAP2001/>


                                     --- Call for Papers ---

Capturing knowledge by using markup techniques and by supporting semantic
annotations is a major technique for creating metadata. It is beneficial
in a wide range of content-oriented intelligent applications.  One
important application, for instance, is the Semantic Web. Here, knowledge
markup is a major challenge, i.e. the problem is providing knowledge
structures for existing syntactic or multimedia resources.  The workshop
intends to bring together researchers and practitioners from such communities
as W3C, MPEG-7, AI, Natural Language technologies and KR to discuss various
aspects of knowledge markup and semantic annotation.


Submission Papers:
Practitioners and researchers interested in participating should submit 
either a
full paper (less than 6000 words) or a position paper (less than 1500 words).
Submit before July 15, 2001 in electronic form (postscript or pdf)
to: handschuh@aifb.uni-karlsruhe.de.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

* web page annotation
* collaborative, shared annotation
* knowledge markup in the Semantic Web
* ontology-based markup
* using semantic annotations to define knowledge
* tools for supporting knowledge markup
* integrated software architecture based on semantic annotation
* multimedia annotation (e.g. by using MPEG-7)
* annotation of software components
* linguistic aspects of semantic annotation
* capturing knowledge through Information Extraction and NLP
* text mining for creating knowledge markup
* evaluation of manual annotation

Although not required for the initial submission, we recommend to follow 
the format
guidelines of K-Cap 2001 
<http://sern.ucalgary.ca/ksi/K-CAP/K-CAP2001/CFP.html#submission-guidelines>,
as this will be the required format for accepted papers.
