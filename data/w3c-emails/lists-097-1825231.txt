hi all,

I'm michele costantini, editor at Praxa.it, a newsportal for italian
entrepreneurs about ebusiness and the internet.

I'd like to write an article about the annotea project but it's not easy at
all to say right things about it. can someone help me?

-is the LEAD stage an advanced stage in the standard development process?
-I'm particularly interested in the remote annotation and less in the local:
1. who will be able to annotate the web page of my business site?
2. who will be able of reading the annotations about my business
site?
3. what kind of saveguard dou you foresight about the trustfullness
of the annotations user do about a company site?
4. when you think that the commercial browser adopt the standard and
add the annotation-features?
-what other application sof the feature do you can suggest? 

any other information that can help me to understand.

Many thanks to all,

Michele Costantini
