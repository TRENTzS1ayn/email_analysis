I can't answer all your questions about Annotea, but just wanted to note...

...that basic "3rd party annotation" facilities are already deployed in
commercial browsers. Netscape launched their "What's Related" service (an
early RDF application) a couple of years ago. It requests very simple
annotations from their server; the annotation format basically just says
"here are some pages that may be on a related topic". I believe they use
the Alexa database (http://www.alexa.com/) and that Internet Explorer has
a similar facility.

Netscape have some pages up about their "What's Related" or "Smart
Browsing" service, see:

http://home.netscape.com/escapes/related/
http://home.netscape.com/escapes/smart_browsing/index.html
http://home.netscape.com/escapes/related/faq.html

The interesting thing with developments like Annotea is that by proposing
a common cross-browser vocabulary to support annotation services, we see the
prospect of a marketplace for third-party annotations. The Netscape page
hints at this, showing someone looking at the Ford car site, and then
navigating to 3rd-party reviews of a car, other places to buy that model
etc.
