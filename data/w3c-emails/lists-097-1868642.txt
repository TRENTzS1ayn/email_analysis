Hi Michele!

Here are some answers.

>-is the LEAD stage an advanced stage in the standard development process?

LEAD (Live and Early ADoption) means that it is early development that we 
are testing ourselves in our own work and with other early adopters.

The focus of Annotea is to help collaboration by letting a group of 
collaborating users to share their comments on the Web on their own 
annotation server. They can store annotations of any web page, also your 
business site. Often the audience of these servers is limited to a certain 
group, but it is also possible to offer public servers for anybody. It is 
easy for a user to turn the subscription of each annotation server on or 
off, so what servers the user wants to subscribe to depends on the quality 
of the content on the servers from his/her viewpoint.

See earlier. The user who is subscribing to the same annotation server 
where these annotations are can read them. E.g. the user may get different 
annotations or no annotations at all depending on what servers he or she is 
subscribing to and wheather he/she has turned the annotations on when 
reading the page.

It depends on the quality of the content on the server. The user may trust 
certain annotation servers more as he/she knows the people. Public servers 
for anybody are probably the least trusted.

I have not heard any announcements yet, but I hope they will in the long 
run as shared annotations will help the users to collaborate easier and 
that is a very important goal on the Web. To be successful is it very 
important that users are given enough control in selecting the servers they 
are interested in, turning the annotations on/off, starting their own 
servers etc.
