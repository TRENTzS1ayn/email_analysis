Hello,

I'm Ville Maijala and I'm working at the Elisa Communications Research
Center. We have had some problems to setup annotation server to my computer.
We wrote to Marja-Riitta Koivunen to ask some help, but she was on holiday
and asked us to write you about our problems.

So we are using Windows NT and IndigoPerl 5.6 with the Apache webserver.
First we tried to set up the Perllib, but unfortunately we didn't succeed.
Every time we put a new module in, the new module was asking some other new
module or modules. After about 15-20 modules it gave me an error: Not enough
arguments for W3C::Database::ObjectDB::new  at ../ObjectDB.pm line 472, near
"))". Then we had to give up! We tried to use only the newest modules, so
what's wrong? Is there coming some new instructions to set up the annotation
server? Have you tried that in Windows NT? Did you succeed? Or have you
heard that someone else have?

My fellow worker tried to do the same but got almost the same result. He
found out that for example in cygwin there are different default modules and
annotate is asking different modules than IndigoPerl. But even then the
result was almost the same.

It would be very nice if you would give us some help.

Thanks
Ville

Ps. If there is someone in the mailing list who has done this, please mail
me some information.
