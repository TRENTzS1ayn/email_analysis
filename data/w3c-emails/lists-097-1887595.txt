Did you use the 'Getting the Perllib Source' instructions at 
http://www.w3.org/1999/02/26-modules/Distribution.html ?
I think that those are the most recent, yes.

We have not tried running an Annotea service on NT.  I think
a long time ago someone was using early versions of the
RdfParser code on NT but I haven't kept track of that. 

For my perl/Win work I use ActiveState's ActivePerl on NT/Win2k.
But I've only used the RDFdb code on linux.
