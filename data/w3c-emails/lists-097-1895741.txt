I've run the Perllib tools, including the old Tk-based GUI, under Windows
(NT, I think; yes, using ActivePerl). They worked fine, but I've not tried
these since (wow...time flies!) Nov '99.

I didn't use any of the SQL-related packages, but can vouch that the
XML/RDF parser, RDF query engine etc pretty much "just worked". Eric and I
made some .xml config files that the then-current version of the Windows
Perl stuff consumed; I believe these are now out of date, but IMHO it
shouldn't be too big a deal to make the basic stuff run under Windows. How
much further work it would be to run a full RDF Annotation server, I've no
idea.
