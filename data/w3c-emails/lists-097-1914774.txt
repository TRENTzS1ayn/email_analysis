To:www-annotation@w3.org

I tried to submit the form for access [1], but received an error:
Access to "/etc/apache/conf/users" failed. No such file or directory

Can someone look into this error?

Also, policy [2] states
User groups: Everyone can read annotations stored in this service. Anyone 
with an acceptable access id and password can post new annotations to the 
service. The following user groups have acceptable id's : (1) users with 
existing W3C member access password and identification, and 2) anyone with 
e-mail address that obtained a temporary identification from W3C id server.

Is there a way to read annotations on annotest.w3.org without either (1) or 
(2), as suggested by "Everyone can read ..." above?

My W3C member access password does not work.  Am I correct to assume that I 
still need to submit the access request even though I have a W3C member 
account?
