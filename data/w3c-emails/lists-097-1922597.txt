Oops, it looks like Eric's new code for supporting more parameterization
of access databases leaked out into annotest.w3.org too soon.

I looked at this for a bit, thought I saw the problem, but failed
in my attempt to fix it.  So we'll have to wait for Eric to get off
a plane to look at it.  Sorry for the inconvenience.

bigger oops; it looks like we didn't actually describe the policy
we implemented on annotest.w3.org.  At present, even read
access requires an id.

We are likely to change the access policy for annotest.w3.org
to permit read without supplying credentials but for right now
(2) is required.

For now you will have to obtain a second id.  We don't yet have
enough infrastructure to share authentication credentials between
annotest.w3.org and www.w3.org conveniently.  We're working on it
(part of Semantic Web Advanced Development) but it's not yet there.
