Sorry about that. I was cleaning up some code and took it upon myself
to clean up some directory after running my tests. Please let me know
if you have any more problems.

It has been the case in the past that the annotations server [1] and
algae interface [3] did not require authentication when reading
annotations. The policy may have been drafted to reflect
that. However, I think it is more likely that the policy reflects the
fact that anyone may go through the same account application process
and, assuming I don't break the server again, get access to any
annotations you make. I believe the distinction between unathenticated
and authenticated, but anyone may have an account, is insignificant
from a polity viewpoint.

That is true. We have the ability to create a member server if there
is general interest.
