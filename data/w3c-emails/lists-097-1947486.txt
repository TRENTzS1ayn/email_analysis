IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology
Special Issue on Conceptual and Dynamical Aspects of Multimedia Content 
Description
<http://ieee-csvt2002.aifb.uni-karlsruhe.de/>

--- Call for Papers ---
"Multimedia content description spans a wide range of abstraction levels: 
At one end, it can be used to describe the low level (perceptual) features 
of the content. These include features such as color, texture, shape and 
motion. At the other end (e.g., high level of abstraction), it can be used 
to provide conceptual information of the real-world being captured by the 
content. In between, intermediate levels of description can provide models 
that link low-level features with semantic concepts. In addition, because 
of the importance of the temporal nature of multimedia and sensitivity of 
multimedia concepts to context, dynamic aspects of content description need 
to be considered. This special issue is dedicated toward the conceptual as 
well as dynamical aspects of content description. Its major goal is to 
publish state of the art research results for multimedia content 
description, including automated reasoning, processing, and updating 
distributed content descriptions. It is very timely with the recent 
developments in the context of the upcoming standards, MPEG-7 andMPEG-21 as 
well as recent Semantic Web initiative."

The topics of interests include but not limited to:
? Recent developments in semantic description of content in MPEG-7
? Recent developments in semantic web and DAML
? Semantic interoperability
? Multimedia semantic classification
? Dynamic update and context sensitivity
? Distributed intelligent agents
? Pervasive media computing
? Knowledge representation
? Semantic applications
? Semantic Annotation

To submit a paper to this special issue, authors should follow the 
instructions in the Information for Authors on the back cover of a recent
