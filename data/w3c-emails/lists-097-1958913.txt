Hi,

It's true that I had to change some lines in code. I think that those changes 
would have been done in the latest versions of annotea files. But I think that 
Eric knows this better. How is it, Eric? If they aren't, I could send you those 
or just tell how I did resolve that.

It's very nice to hear that someone else is trying to setup annotation server 
in windows. And I will do my best to help you. I would appreciate if you could 
write your own manual for setting up annotation system, so we could help for 
each other.

Let's keep in touch
-Ville
