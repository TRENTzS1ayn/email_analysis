Hello,

I use Annotea Via JavaScript and I cannot retrieve annotations previously
created.

This problem only occur when the URI is like
....servlet/page?_pageid=124&_dad=portal30&_schema=PORTAL30&_mode=3&_languag
e=fr

I have made many tests and it's alway the same result : When I use Annotea
with well formed URI as www.domaine.top/dir/.../file.html it's Ok, and when
a part of the URI contains any ? or ..jsp it's not.

Is it quite normal ?

Best regards.

Denis Lemarchand.
