Hi, in continuing to test my Annotea Client, I get these errors, when
collecting the body:

e.g.

http://annotest.w3.org/annotations/body/982176200.34646

>should read "Pedantic"

>"Status: 500 died with Can't call method "flush" on an undefined value
>at /home/annotest/perl/modules/W3C/Annotations/CGI/annotate line 176.
>Session-id: 1003883882.935085 "

So it correctly gives the body, but also then gives the error.

I'm still also having problems with the submission of new annotations
just causing an error on the server (see previous post.)

Jim.
