Hi,

http://jibbering.com/snufkin.html

Snufkin is a web browser, based on IE5 or later, it has all the
functionality of the copy of IE installed, plus various extensions, I've
just added an Annotea client, at the moment, you can only query and add
annotations, (no delete, or modify) and the XPointer implementation is
somewhat limited, you can create and see the annotate using them though.

On XPointer, as snufkin is also based on javascript, it may be a useful
idea to develop a common xpointer based on a common IE/Mozilla DOM that
can be used in both clients.

I've noticed various problems with the current documentation, and the
current servers.

In:
http://www.w3.org/2001/Annotea/User/Protocol.html
Figures 1 and 2 both need <?xml version="1.0"?>, in them.
and the returned information (Figure 3) is completely wrong, and also has
more serious problems and is invalid HTML:
e.g.
<P>annotation
[http://annotest.w3.org/annotations/attribution/1004000588.146073#genid1]
changed to
http://annotest.w3.org/annotations/annotation/1004000588.146073</P>
<P>body
[http://annotest.w3.org/annotations/attribution/1004000588.146073#genid7]
changed to
http://annotest.w3.org/annotations/body/1004000588.146073</P><?xml
version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?><html xmlns: ...

I'd like to have the minimal returned possible, and the information in
the protocol page seems appropriate - I should be talking to the server
which returns machine readable, not some page for humans.

If you submit 2 identical requests, the server errors with an uncaught
exception as MySQL errors on "duplicate key".

The returned information in response to a GET is slightly different to
Figure 5, and also invariably contains an error (after the actual content
is returned) "Status: 500 died with Can't call method "flush" on an
undefined value at
/home/annotest/perl/modules/W3C/Annotations/CGI/annotate line 176.
Session-id: 1004000959.727677"

Regards,

Jim.
