I try to install the annotea server but it doesn't work.
I installed the perllib from cvs, a mysql database and the apache webserver on a
linux system.
After that i set the configuration files and tried to call the "annotate"-script
with a normal webbrowser.
But i got an error message "Internal Server Error". So i watched the log-files
and found the following 2 lines:

[Wed Oct 31 01:02:03 2001] [error] (2)No such file or directory: exec of
/usr/local/perl/modules/W3C/annotations/cgi/annotate.cgi failed
[Wed Oct 31 01:02:03 2001] [error] [client 192.168.0.10] Premature end of script
headers: /usr/local/perl/modules/W3C/annotations/cgi/annotate.cgi

On my command line i can execute the annotate script (with any user):

linux:/usr/local/perl/modules/W3C/annotations/cgi # perl annotate.cgi
(offline mode: enter name=value pairs on standard input)

Is it possible to test the script offline? Are there all perllib modules
installed right, if i can run the script?
What commands are accepted from the script on the command line?
I don't know where to search the error.

If anybody has a solution for one of my problems please write me...

Thanks
Markus
