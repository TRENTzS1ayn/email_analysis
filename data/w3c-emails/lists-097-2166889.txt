Now i can call the annotate script on my server with a normal browser.
But if i hit the button "post new annotation" the following error appears:

: Unknown Exception
blew its mind.

perl error: Can't call method "setRdfPrefix" on an undefined value at
../../../W3C/Rdf/CGIApp.pm line 227.

W3C::Util::Exception thrown at
/usr/local/perl/modules/W3C/Annotations/CGI/annotate:357

Status: 500 died with Can't call method "flush" without a package or object
reference at /usr/local/perl/modules/W3C/Annotations/CGI/annotate line 181.
Session-id: 1005066427.405477


I read line 227 of the CGIApp.pm file but i didn't find something incorrect.

I changed the line "Require group registered" in my httpd.conf to "require
valid-user"; could this cause the error.
Is a group needed?
I don't know what the setRdfPrefix method does.


Perhaps somebody can help me
