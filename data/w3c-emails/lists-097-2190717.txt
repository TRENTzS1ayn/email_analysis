Please accept our apologies for any cross-postings
==================================================

Dear all,
We are pleased to announce the latest release of the ICS-FORTH RDFSuite,
a set of high-level Scalable Tools for the Semantic Web:

- The Validating RDF Parser (VRP), v2.0, supporting semantic validation
of both resource descriptions and schemas.

- The RDF Schema Specific Data Base (RSSDB) Loader, v1.0,
that uses RDF Schema knowledge to automatically generate
an Object-Relational (SQL3) representation of RDF metadata and load
resource descriptions.

- The RDF Query Language Interpreter (RQL), v1.0, a Declarative
Language for uniformly querying RDF schemas and resource descriptions.

RDF Suite is available for download under an Open Source Software
License from the Web site http://139.91.183.30:9090/RDF/. RDF Suite
has been partially supported by the EU projects C-Web (IST-1999-13479)
and MesMuses (IST-2001- 26074).

VRP v2.0 main features (available for download)
===============================================
Supports:
-  Embedded RDF in HTML or XML
-  XML Schema Data Types (http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/)
-  Full Unicode
-  The updated RDF syntax (http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/)

Various Options
-  Debugging
-  Serialization under the form of triples or graphs
-  Statistics (time, characteristics) of validated schemas and
resource descriptions

Easy to use as a standalone application
-  Graphical User Interface
-  No XML software needs to be installed

Easy to integrate with other applications
-  RDF Model Construction and Validation Java APIs

RSSDB Loader v1.0 main features (available for download)
========================================================
Customization of the database representation according to
-  Employed meta-schemas
-  RDF schemas and description bases peculiarities
-  Query functionality of applications

Various Options
-  Debugging
-  Incremental loading (detecting changes) of RDF namespaces
-  Statistics (loading time, characteristics) of stored schemas and
resource descriptions

Easy to use as a standalone application
-  Graphical User Interface
-  Requires only JDBC-compliant ORDBMS

Easy to integrate with other applications
-  RDF Model Loading & Update Java APIs

RQL v1.0 main features (online demo available at
the moment, source code distribution coming soon!)
==================================================
Supports:
-  XML Schema data types (for filtering literal values)
-  grouping primitives (for constructing nested XML results)
-  aggregate functions (for extracting statistics)
-  recursive traversal of class and property hierarchies (for advanced matchmaking)

Pushes as much as possible query evaluation to the underlying DBMS
-  Benefit from robust SQL3 query engines
-  Extensive use of DB indices

Provides generic RDF/XML result form
-  XSL/XSL processing for customized rendering

Easy to couple with commercial ORDBMSs
-  RDF Querying APIs (SQL3/C++ functions)

Easy to integrate with Web Application Servers
-  C++ or Java drivers to RQL servers

Easy to learn and use
-  One day training


Please also take a look at the repository of currently available RDF
schemas in our site: http://139.91.183.30:9090/RDF/Examples.html

We are looking forward to receiving your comments and suggestions.

Best regards
