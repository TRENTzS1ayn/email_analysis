Hi,
Can someone please tell me why the annotation initiative seems to have
skirted XLink and opted for RDF to supply link semantics? Not that there's
anything wrong with RDF (of course ;-) but it does seem a little
sledgehammer to nut. Or (once again) am I missing something here?
Any refs to xlink-annotation material would be appreciated.

Cheers,
Danny.
