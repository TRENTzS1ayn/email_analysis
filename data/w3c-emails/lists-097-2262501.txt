In the meantime, Google's main search service seems to offer a workable
stopgap alternative. I'm not sure how up to date their index is of our
list  archives, but you can do things like:

 site:lists.w3.org +www-annotation +xlink


...to constrain searches to specific W3C lists.

eg.:
http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=+site:lists.w3.org+%2Bwww-annotation+%2Bxlink
...will find a few historical references to XLink on this list.

ps. my old notes on RDF and XLink, possible obsolete (though probably
vague enough not to be :) are at http://www.w3.org/2000/02/rdf-xlink/
