Hi,
I recently did a presentation at XML Asia Pacific which included the use XLink
in conjunction with XML Topic Maps (see XTM 1.0 spec at
http://www.topicmaps.org) for annotating documents. Topic Maps provide a lot
of complex features which can be used to enhance XLink and we have been using
this combination quite successfully for the annotation of documents. If you
are interested the slides of my presentation are at:

Regards
