Is the Annotea Servlet still up and running correctly?

Whenever I query it with a GET operation to get the rdf of annotations for
a particular URI, it returns an HTTP error 502.  For example, a GET
operation on:

http://www.w3.org/2001/04/AnnoteaServlet?w3c_annotates=
http%3A//www.mozilla.org/&server=http%3A//annotest.w3.org/annotations
&type=get-rdf-xml
&username=<your-username-goes-here>
&password=<your-password-goes-here>

where that whole thing is one line returns error 502 from the server.  Is
this happening for anyone else?

Does anyone have any ideas?

Thanks,
Doug
