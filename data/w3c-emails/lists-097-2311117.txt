Hello Annotations guys,

Just a small note to tell you that the latest Amaya release (5.3)
includes some annotation enhancements:

1) It is now possible to annotate other annotations. Previously, you
could only annotate documents other than annotations.

2) Because an annotation is like a comment, we have been working on a 
   mechanims that allows people to reply to comments. We made a new
   RDF schema for replies and integrated it into Amaya. You can
   now reply to annotations. You can see all the discussion thread made
   from replies in the annotation window. You can also annotate replies.
   Like annotations, you can keep the replies local to your workstation
   or publish them to a server.
  
We're updating our annotation tutorial and will make more info available
soon.  If you want to try it out, check the latest Amaya and see the Help 
file on annotations.

Enjoy!

-jose, on behalf of the Annotea team
