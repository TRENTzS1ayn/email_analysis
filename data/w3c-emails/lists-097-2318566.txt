                                           Workshop on

SAAKM 2002 -Semantic Authoring,  Annotation & Knowledge Markup
<http://saakm2002.aifb.uni-karlsruhe.de>

Workshop at the 15th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence
July 22-26, 2002 , Lyon, France
<http://ecai2002.univ-lyon1.fr/>

                                     --- Call for Papers ---

Workshop Goals

The workshop intends to bring together researchers and practitioners from 
such research areas as the Semantic Web, knowledge acquisition, 
computational linguistics, document processing, terminology, information 
science, and multimedia content, among others, to discuss various aspects 
of knowledge markup and semantic annotation in an interdisciplinary way.

Potential topics include but are not limited to:

-       authoring/annotation tools
-       web page annotation
-       ontology-based markup
-       knowledge markup in the Semantic Web
-       using semantic annotations to define knowledge
-       tools for supporting knowledge markup
-       integrated software architecture based on semantic annotation
-       multimedia annotation (e.g. by using MPEG-7)
-       annotation of software components
-       linguistic aspects of semantic annotation
-       capturing knowledge through Information Extraction and NLP
-       text mining for creating knowledge markup
-       collaborative, shared annotation
-       evaluation of manual annotation

Intended Audience

This workshop aims at bringing together members of different overlapping 
communities that share the interest on semantic authoring and annotation 
for developing methods and tools:
- Semantic Web researchers who use semantic authoring and annotation to 
enrich the web with distributed relational meta-data in order to enable a 
machine-readable web
- member of the computational linguistics community, developing information 
extraction systems for the generation of meta-data
- people from the multimedia content domain, indexing and searching of 
multimedia (and multilingual) data.

This will give an opportunity to push further the discussion upon the 
potential of semantic annotation or authoring across these communities.


How to contribute
We invite submissions of technical papers and short position papers (two 
pages). Authors of accepted technical and position papers will be invited 
to participate in the workshop.
Format requirements for submissions of technical papers are:
*       maximum 12 double-spaced pages, excluding title page and bibliography.
*       All submissions should be made electronically if possible, by email 
attachment and preferably in Postscript or PDF format.
           Only if electronic submission is impossible should you send 
three hardcopies.
