Looks to me like it's not making a connection to the database.
I'll add some code to make it look for this problem and give a
more usefull error message.

In the mean time, have a look at the code and see if the problem
is as i diagnosed. W3C/Rdf/CGIApp connects to the database:
    eval {
die $W3C::Rdf::CGIApp::USE_EPHEMORAL_DB if ($self->{EPHEMORAL_DB});
my $conf= new W3C::Util::Properties('../../../Conf/rdf.prop');
$self->{RDF_DB} = $self->{RDF_DB} = new W3C::Rdf::ObjectDB(-errorHandler => $self->{ERROR_HANDLER}, 
   -lazyReification => 1, 
   -properties => '../../../Conf/rdf.prop', 
   -atomDictionary => $self->{-atomDictionary});
    }; if ($@) {
if (my $ex = &catch('W3C::Util::Exception')) {
    push (@{$self->{PRE_MESSAGES}}, $ex->getMessage);
    push (@{$self->{PRE_MESSAGES}}, 'switching to ephemoral DB');
} elsif ($@ ne $W3C::Rdf::CGIApp::USE_EPHEMORAL_DB) {
    push (@{$self->{PRE_MESSAGES}}, "got die($@)");
    push (@{$self->{PRE_MESSAGES}}, 'switching to ephemoral DB');
}
$self->{RDF_DB} = $self->{RDF_DB} = new W3C::Rdf::RdfDB(-errorHandler => $self->{ERROR_HANDLER}, 
-lazyReification => 1, 
-atomDictionary => $self->{-atomDictionary});
    }

If it can't connect to the persistent database, it's supposed
to connect to an in-memory data store (not good for storing
data, but good for diagnostics). This should show the message
"switching to ephemoral DB" when you GET the annotations page
with an HTML browser (like Netscape).
