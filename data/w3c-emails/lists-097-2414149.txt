Thank you very much for your help.
I downloaded the perllibs from your cvs archive at 31th of october 2001.
I use red hat linux 7.1(Kernel 2.4.2-2), apache webserver 1.3.12 and mysql Ver 11.13 Distrib 3.23.36
Because you said that there might be a problem with the database, i checked all the following things:

-the property file rdf.prop is in: /usr/local/perl/modules/Conf/
 ( the libraries are in /usr/local/perl/modules/W3C/Rdf)

- in the rdf.prop i changed the AnnotateServer to another name(is it ok to choose it freely?...it's the 
  same name as the mysql user i added)

I can login to the mysql-database on the command line with the annotea user and watch the
rdf database:

I hope some of these informations will help you.
Shall i download and install the new perllibs from your cvs archive?
I will now continue my search for the problem...
