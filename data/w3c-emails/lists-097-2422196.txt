At the moment Annozilla (my Mozilla client) is confused by the RDF it's 
getting back from requesting a list of annotations for a page, presumably 
because of the changes to the schema.

Annozilla iterates over all RDF resources assuming them to be annotations. 
The new RDF served up includes things like

       <example.org:huh
        xmlns:example.org="http://example.org/">
          <r:Description>
             <a:Email
              r:resource="mailto:matthew+test@mjwilson.demon.co.uk" />
             <a:Family>Wilson</a:Family>
             <a:Given>Matthew</a:Given>
          </r:Description>
       </example.org:huh>

which appears to be causing additional resources to be created. I can hack 
around the problem by ignoring resources without an <a:body/> property (is 
that right right term? sorry, I'm not very good at RDF), but I don't know 
whether that's the right solution or just a workaround.

The bookmarklet servlet seems to be confused as well. Any advice?
