I use the Mozilla RDF parser to collect all the results into an 
RDFDatasource. I don't have then direct access to the triples (I think): my 
algorithm is to loop over all resources, and then report these as 
annotations based on their properties.

Now, I can just ignore resources which "look wrong", but I'd rather get a 
better understanding of the issues (as I said, I'm no RDF expert) to try 
and produce a client which is more robust to these kind of changes.
