Marja - you should/could test schema or protocol changes with the
Annotea JavaScript interfaces:

Hmmm.  The Annotea Servlet?

Jim - does your Annotea implementation use an Annotea Servlet like
[1] does or does it go directly to an Annotea Server?

Matthew - at one point EricP was talking about modifying the Annotea
server (protocol?) so that Annozilla could bypass the Annotea Servlet
and go directly to the server.  I don't know the status of that work.  
I believe the issue was that Mozilla was expecting a different MIME
media 
type for the RDF/XML returned from the server.  Even if this current
problem is not related to the Annotea Servlet perhaps you and EricP
can determine a way to eliminate the servlet from the pipeline.
