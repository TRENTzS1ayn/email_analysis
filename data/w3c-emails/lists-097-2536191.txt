sure.  Here is the URI of a reply I just posted:
http://annotest.w3.org/annotations/reply/1010749434.580361

I'll leave it as an exercise to the reader :) to follow the RDF links
in that object back to the annotation then to the page that was
originally annotated.

(Anyone care to contribute a replacement bit of perl for
http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/perl/modules/W3C/Annotations/CGI/annotate
to generate a more user-friendly HTML presentation?  The current
bits that annotest serves for content-type text/html is just a debugging
interface.)
