OK, done that (I think!)

http://annotest.w3.org/annotations/reply/1010749434.580361
is a reply with root
http://annotest.w3.org/annotations/annotation/1006643542.393511

whose context is http://www.w3.org/#xpointer(id(&quot;logo&quot;)/img[1])

and body "Works similar as Discussion function of Internet Explorer."

(All at the time of writing, of course.)

But I don't see the Reply thread displayed in Amaya for that annotation. Am 
I doing something wrong?

I am running Amaya 5.3 on Win98. I go to the W3 page, do Annotations->Load, 
then double click on the pencil icon to the left of the W3C logo. I see the 
annotation, but no replies. The tutorial says that I should see a thread of 
replies.
