We did change the deletion policy so that you cannot delete an annotation 
or a reply that already has replies (without deleting the replies first). 
Another option we discussed was to delete all the replies starting from the 
annotation or reply that is being deleted. Ultimately the deletion policy 
should be configurable by different user groups.

Not sure if that is the problem here though. Will test.
