Hello!

The ability to annotate any WWW resource is wonderfull, but
I have a question (possibly a FAQ):

Is there a way to search for all web pages, which match certain
conditions AND have annotations [on a set of annotation servers that
this search engine accesses]? I.e. something like Google, but with a
flag in advance search "Is annotated".

While the amount of annotated pages is small compared with the total
amount of the information on Web, I would very much prefer to be able
to filter out pages that are annotated as opposed to look at all pages
and see if they have annotations.

P.S. The same question in broader scope would be: is there a search
engine [like Google] to find all resources with RDF metainformation
that matches selected criteria (i.e. describes object Person from a
certain schema, etc.)?
