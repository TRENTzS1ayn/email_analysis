Hi, I thought I would write up the ideas I have had recently for using
annotea and see if these make sense and what they mean for the development...

So here are the things that occurred to me in the last few days as really
interesting for me <grin/>

1. There are a number of archived mailing lists at W3C. There are a number of
cases where essentially similar discussions occur on different lists, and I
would like to note that a thread in one archive is related to a threadd in
another archive. So far, so good I think. But sme of these threads have
different confidentiality levels, so I want to make sure that public things
have annotations where people with public access find out what other public
things are related, but where people with "private access" also get
annotations for things that they have the ability to access. (I also want to
point out that one thread is a continuation of another - that is intersting
but I don't think makes a big issue).

2. I edited a specification for a long time, and now I am handing it over. I
want to make it clear how this thing is developed, and what are the tools
that make the spec. Again, there are different levels of confidentiality
involved here.

3. I  want to annotate images with descriptions of them

4. I want to put my bookmarks online, so I can keep finding them. Again,
tehre are things for me only, and things that I would like to share as
bookmarks with some information about them

5. I want to use annotations to provide EARL reports (assessments of some
kind of conformance) for various things. It is important that these can be
updated - is this replacing an annotation, or responding to one?

cheers

Chaals
