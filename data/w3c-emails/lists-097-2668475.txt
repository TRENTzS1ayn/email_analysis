Introduce Fred, my dog's vet's brother whom I met when I backed my
pickup into his Lexus. In the course of resolving damage from the
accident, I invite Fred to read messages related to insurance, which I
have smartly placed in folder of the same name.

When Fred looks for the the bookmarks of the insurance folder, he
sees some of e3, f3, c2. How do we enforce which he sees?


All annotations are visible - Fred sees bm1, bm2 and bm3:

  He knows of the existance of f3 and c3, but is unable to
  retrieve them. He can retrieve e3.

  cost: Awkward to program -
  in order to communicate the existence of f3 and c2,
  the server must reveal the statements
     f3 --appearsIn--> insurance.
     c2 --appearsIn--> insurance.
  but none of the other statements in those bookmarks.
  It would be unfortunate to handle this in an
  application-specific manner rather. Therefor we will
  need to encode these statements at a different level
  of access from the rest of the document that asserts
  the bookmark. This is pretty murky territory.


Bookmarks have homogeneous access - Fred sees bm1 and bm2:

  He knows of the existance of f3 but is unable to retrieve
  it. He can retrieve e3.
  cost: No auth challenge where one could help - 
  If an unknown user queries for bookmarks in insurace,
          the server will return bm1 and bm2. If this user is
  actually Fred, he will never get an auth prompt for
  him to let the server know he is Fred and can know
  about bm3.

I think this could be a separate app for applying thread properties to
web resources. This would allow a more atomic use of these predicates.
While it seems that noting thread relationships is a particular type
of bookmark or annotation, one could say that all assertions about web
resources are bookmarks or annotations. It is simpler just to make these
assertions about these resources.

I argue this point not because I think you disagree, but because it is
a trend I have noticed. We run around with our annotations hammer and
think that every RDF statements could be an annotation.

I think bm3 tests this scenario.

Will address in a separate thread...
