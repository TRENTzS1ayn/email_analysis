This gets into some stuff that Ralph and I were discussing recently.
The RDF DB used by annotea has an attribution for each statement. The
attribution points to the document from which the statements were
learned. It turns out that the annotations documents are served from
the database rather than a static page, but that doesn't change the
model.

I use the attribution to handle the PUTs and DELETEs so that the
"document" that asserts an anntation can have all of it's statements
revoked and optionally replaced. The attribution also stores the time
and auth associated with a GET, PUT or POST. Ralph pointed out that
this message-related stuff should be in a separate object. Soon I
should have:
Statements:
  subjectpredicateobjectmessage
  annot1annotateswww.w3.org/1
  annot1earl:valid"nope"1
  annot2annotateswww.w3.org/8
  annot1annotateswww.w3.org/15
  annot1earl:valid"yup"15

Messages:
  #methodtimestampauthUser statusattribution
  1POST 998975810Joe 01
  8POST 999337327Fred 12
  15PUT1000382774Joe 11

Attributions:
  #uri
  1http://annotest.w3.org/annotations/attribution/998975810
  2http://annotest.w3.org/annotations/attribution/999337327

I can then do a query for annotations of http://www.w3.org/
  SELECT Statements.subject 
  FROM Statements, Messages
  WHERE Statements.predicate='annotates' AND
    Statements.object="http://www.w3.org/" AND 
    Statements.message=Messages.# AND 
    Statements.status=1;
I'll select the set of statements that annotate http://www.w3.org/
that came from message #15

This status stores the currency ($20 will do fine) of the annotation.
When Joe PUT http://annotest.w3.org/annotations/attribution/998975810
at 1000382774, the database "invalidated" the triples from the first
message. These statements are still there. Another query could not put
in the currency check. This solution puts the history of validity
assertions into the the general history mechanism. Standard queries
will only see the current validity.

Another option is to place this assertion time in the graph:
  annot1 --earl:valid--> _:1
  _:1 --when--> 998975810
  _:1 --validity--> "nope"
  annot1 --earl:valid--> _:2
  _:2 --when--> 1000382774
  _:2 --validity--> "yup"

I guess it depends on why you need the historical info. Do you want
the historical data presented as if it were current and only separated
by the application-specific date stamp in the validity structure?

I suspect this question could go to the earl list. Feel free to
forward if Chaals signs off on his part of the message.
