Checked with Eric to be sure:
Update replaces the old annotation. You have to make a new copy of all the 
data that was in the previous message as the data collected from the 
previous message is deleted. Adding new body or title does not delete the 
old one as there can be several.

I'll cc Eric, if you want to discuss more about the implementation or 
suggestions.
