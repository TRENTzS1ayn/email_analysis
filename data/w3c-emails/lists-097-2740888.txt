Replace, and here's why:

There is no constraint that there be one body per annotation so adding
a body would not remove the previous one. Furthur, if there were such
a constraint, it would be up to the application to define whether
asserting a conflicting object for a unique property would
  replace the original
  be ignored
  produce an inconsistent system from which no data could be extracted

We haven't defined this for the interface to Annotea so we treat
updates as messages which replace entirely the results of a previous
message.
