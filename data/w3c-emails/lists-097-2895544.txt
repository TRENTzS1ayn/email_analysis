I believe this to be an exaggeration.

I haven't got an annotation server running fully under Windows yet - some 
bits of Perl make my home Win98 box crash, and I can only play with my work 
WinNT box at lunchtimes.

But there only seem to be a few problem areas in the Perl code:
1. hard-coded Apache path
2. hard-coded temporary directory path
3. use of syscall to get the time to a resolution of less than a second.

3. is easily fixed by downloading Time::HiRes from CPAN.
