I think I'm following a path recently pursued by Jim, looking at how
to post EARL to the annotest server.  If I'm way behind and talking
rubbish, please excuse me (I'll blame the wine)!

It seems to me that the database issue could in principle be fixed up
by simply declaring a new annotation type
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/annotationType#earlAssertion
whose body will be an EARL assertion.  This has the drawback that it
could get horribly verbose for multiple assertions, but I'd be happy
to put that aside for the time being.

The question then arises: what use are single assertions either to
EARL or Annotea clients?  Presumably Snufkin (being both) could be
happy with them(??).  Is there any reason why other Annotea clients
shouldn't then also be pretty simple to program up to deal with this,
given that all we're adding from your POV is a subject-predicate-object
structure to the body?

This looks too straightforward.  What are the problems with it?
