I'm having that problem now.  It returns HTTP status 404, with a message
saying "no annotations found" and an HTML page inviting me to formulate
an algae query.  I've had to stop testing, because annotest now appears
to be completely uncontactable.

Can't try that while the server's down.  And if I can do it without
urlencoding, then that's what I'd prefer.

I shall ask about this next time I bump into you on IRC.
