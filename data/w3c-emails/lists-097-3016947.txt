To whom this may concern,

Okay ? I think I have the general idea of this annotation concept ?
basically like using MS Word review comments function with encryption,
so you'd have to unencrypt the code to reference the footnotes ?
right?

But, ouch, my head hurts ? could you possibly convert this whole
concept into something just a tad more user-friendly for those of use
less code-efficient (or very code deficient).  

The big controversy on listservs is how we (teachers) harp on our
students about plagiarism only to find ourselves inadvertedly doing
exactly that.   Now that everyone is sensitive to the issue, an idea
like yours is ripe for implementation (if I understand your idea...) ?
but it has to be accessible for the low-techy.  What do you think?

Thanks,
Arlyn Freed
