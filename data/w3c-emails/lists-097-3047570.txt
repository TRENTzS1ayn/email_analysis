Hello Matthew,

Sorry it took me some time to get back to you. 

Annotating the line in your SVG example:

  http://www.mjwilson.demon.co.uk/svg-annot-test.html

Produces the following XPointer in the current Amaya (from CVS):

 file:///home/kahan/svg-annot-test.html#xpointer(/html[1]/body[1]/svg[1]/line[1])

Although it doesn't include namespaces, it is correct by itself. Which
version of Amaya (and on which platform) were you using when you got the
XPointer:

  xpointer(/html[1]/body[1]/SVG[1]/line_[1])

My guess is that it was a version previous than 5.3 which was missing the
convertion from the internal Amaya name to the external name, because
I was unable to reproduce it. 

What I did was to copy your file locally, then select the line, annotate
it and open the index file that's stored locally. Did you use this same
procedure?

My previous comment was wrong:

>>The inclusiong of SVG inside HTML can only be done with the SVG keyword.
>>On XHTML, you can also do it with namespaces. However, the name should
>>>be SVG. 

>Are you saying that the element called "svg" has to be converted to
>capitals, "SVG", for inclusion in HTML?

I was completely confused by MathML. There is no SVG element that allows
you to include the SVG XML source inside HTML 4.x documents. You can only 
include an SVG image  thru the object element. Amaya allows to do the same 
thing using the img element. However, the SVG tree is not visible then. You 
can only make an XPointer that points to the element that includes the SVG 
image.

For XHTML and other XML documents, you need to use namespaces to include
SVG.

For the outstanding question on how does an XPointer that includes namespaces
look like, I got the following example from Henry (I split the line at the
# char, but there is no space there):

  href="http://www.w3.org/Team/thompson/w3c-home.xml#
        xmlns(x=http//example.com/foo) xpointer(//x:a)"

Amaya is not able yet to handle this kind of XPointers. I'll try to
improve this situation.

Hope this answers (even if belatedly) your questions.
