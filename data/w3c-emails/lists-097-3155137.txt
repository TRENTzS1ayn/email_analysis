My complaints are not about the Annotea page, I was using that as an
example of perhaps the best quality page for annotations, yet it still
has problems, I was using it to highlight the weakness in Fuzzy Pointers
(I don't think either your changes over time as evidenced by
web.archive.org are inappropriate)

I call them Fuzzy Pointers becuase the documents they are used on are
_HTML_ and XPointer isn't defined for anything other than XML and we're
relying on HTML normilasations being similar enough that we can use them
between different parses.

There is no solution to either of these problems and that is what we
need, it seems to me that XPointer isn't a solution to providing context
in HTML resource. (Sean Palmer has also raised problems with any context
information surviving HTTP content-negotiation
http://someurl/#xpointer(...)  only applies to one representation of the
resource, rather than the resource itself.

Within the Evaluation and Repair group we've discussed checking when
resources have changed and the extent of those changes - similar
mechanisms I think are needed in Annotea so you know if a resource is
likely orphaned through the document structure changes.
