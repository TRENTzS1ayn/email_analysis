When we realized this to be a problem we asked (through someone) from the 
XHTML WG to get a standard rules for canonical conversion from HTML to 
XHTML . It will be needed for other purposes too, not just for XPointer. We 
decided not to work on this part until we get the rules. If there are big 
problems because of this let us know, I'll see what can be done.
