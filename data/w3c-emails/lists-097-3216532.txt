Of course it does!

If IDs are used for all elements, then we can happily reference them -
provided we don't have an editor that moves them around!  But an ID
gives us an element (or attribute): trying to extend it to a range
as Annotea does[1] is problematic.

That's why I suggested a method for measuring document change
(or more precisely, a family of equivalence measures).

OK, I think you should separate the manual and automatic cases.  Doing
it manually is just a case of a software tool maintaining dependency
information and basic housekeeping.  I find the automated situation
more interesting: for example, if a document has changed, I want to
be able to detect which annotations are affected and should be
archived off or flagged for human attention.  The person doing the

[1] Yes I know XPointer does that too.  There are cases when you *can*
meaningfully refer to a range; my point it that to try and do so in
the presence of change is not sensible.
