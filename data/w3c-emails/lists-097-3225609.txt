ID attributes for everything are fine for a scenario where all contents
are tightly controlled by a publishing system that manages them.
But that's a rather restricted scenario, and clearly not applicable
to the Web at large.

Jim and I worked through several implementations of fuzzy pointers
in the course of interfacing our respective software agents.  What
we have now appears to be equivalent to Annotea, except in that it
identifies an element and not a range.

They are XPointers into a normalisation of the document markup -
hence fuzzy (as Jim calls them).

No it isn't!  Using fuzzy pointers, Jim's client software can query
my server, and does NOT misplace an earl assertion (or annotation).
The problem isn't fuzziness, it's change!

I'm making one such suggestion!

But we have both!
