No, no, NO!  That's only half the story!

For IDs to work properly, you need to *guarantee* that they will be
anchored to elements across edits, regardless of who edits a document
or what tools they use.  This is the province of a document management
system, not a mere editor.

Robustness in the presence of consistently-used IDs is easy.
I want to see it everywhere!

A review is a situation that can be well-handled by annotation-aware
tools.

That one's easy: a snapshot represantation comprising both the document
and the annotations will suffice, and can be processed (eg with XSLT)
to whatever format you please.  It's exactly what Valet does to show
errors and warning in-situ in a document, for instance.
