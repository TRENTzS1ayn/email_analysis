It's a good idea, it's also trivial, the only problem is the resource
discovery of peoples annotations, the current Annotea RDF is fine, I
could add parsing of user annotations stored elsewhere than a server
trivially.  I can't see a simple mechanism though without a search engine
to get out and find these user annotations, also what's the motivation
for these private annotations when you can use an annotea server.
Certainly distributed systems have their uses, however as you're not
usefully annotating domains you control I can't see how the resource
discovery portion of the problem works.

Jim.
