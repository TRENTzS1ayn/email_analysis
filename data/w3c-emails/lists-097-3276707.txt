Sorry ER, is the Evaluation Repair group

http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-er-ig/2002Feb/0009.html and
the posts around, although I fear much was discussed on IRC before we had
archives.  #er on irc.w3.org * often discusses annotea these days you can
often find me and Nick if you want to grill us on it.

Jim.

* The channel's even got its own Annotea bot.
