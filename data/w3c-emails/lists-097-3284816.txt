I looked closer and found it to be my mistake - I easily forget that the 
content conceptually under headers is not under headers in HTML structure. 
So I added more ids with the automatic id generation command in Amaya. It 
asks which elements to give the id to. For users like me it could also 
suggest a good default set of elements to give to id to.
