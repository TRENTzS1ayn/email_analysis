OK, to follow up to myself, let's spell that out.

An annotation can include its own date, and a document last-modified
date - more useful where available.  But this doesn't help to measure
which changes are significant.

The solution Valet uses to track changes is hashing on an ESIS
representation.  The most useful hash for testing the validity
of annotation pointers is that on document elements.  I'd suggest
that these be properly integrated into annotea:

* An annotea client should compute a hash when it makes an annotation
* The server stores the hash within the rdf:
<a:elementhash>LWDBNLW/24DqY</a:elementhash>
* Queries on the database return a hash.
* The client rendering an annotation computes a hash on the document
  at the time of reading it.  If this differs from the hash associated
  with the annotation, the pointer is invalidated.
* Document management software can use this to prompt an administrator
  to deal with annotations, or can do so automatically if this is
  considered appropriate.  At this point, if annotations are kept
  their hashes can be updated.

A more sophisticated document management system might want to use
more hashes (Valet already does).
