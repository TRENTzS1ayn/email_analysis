Amaya is currently producing XPointers incompatible with Snufkin and
Annozilla which both do have implied elements (ie we're working on a
Normalised parse tree.) so TBODY insertion (a very common normalisation
on the web) is needed.

Is it possible for Annozilla and Amaya to automate the generation of
XPointers?  If we say generate XPointers for every element in 20 or 30
agreed webpages we can soon see how close the normalisations are and then
look if they are feasible.

As this is related to work we've already done in ER (comparing openSP's
and browsers normalisations for pointing to invalid elements in a page.)
I'd gladly co-ordinate any research into this, but don't know anything
about hacking Amaya (I could probably hack Annozilla myself.)

Jim.
