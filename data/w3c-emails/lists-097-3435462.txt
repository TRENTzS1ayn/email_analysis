The latter.  It's a demo-of-concept prototype, not a full-blown spec.
The goal was to find a representation we could both work with.


My suggestions would be:

(1) Run Page Valet on some test cases - it generates the normalisation
or
(2) Look at Jim's Javascript client code, which I imagine must be
    quite similar to what you'll want.

If you'd like to move it towards a formal standard, I could scribble
down something a little more detailed.
