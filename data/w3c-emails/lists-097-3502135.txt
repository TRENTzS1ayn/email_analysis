Mozilla 0.9.9 (non-SVG build) + the latest Annozilla (from CVS) loads the 
annotation list, raising a couple of errors on the way because it's 
expecting an XPointer to resolve, and, on attempting to load the annotation 
body, displays a "What do you want to do with this SVG file" prompt.

With a slightly older Mozilla+SVG build I get a crash when trying to load + 
display the SVG; this is likely to be a Mozilla rather than an Annozilla bug.
