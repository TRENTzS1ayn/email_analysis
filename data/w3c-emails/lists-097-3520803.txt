annotea's current stable release as moved to 1.1.  This change
includes a change to the Rdf SQL database. You may checkout
the version 1.1:
  cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@dev.w3.org:/sources/public \
  checkout -r V1_1 perl/modules
(you may need to login first:
  cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@dev.w3.org:/sources/public login
) or update your current version:
  cd perl/modules
  cvs update -r V1_1

Updating will leave the code and the database schema out of sync.
W3C/Rdf/bin/Strings-substringToMd5hex will update your database
to the schema that the 1.1 expects to talk to:
  cd W3C/Rdf/bin
  ./Strings-substringToMd5hex


The primary goal is to fix the string length limit bug [1].


The annotest server has just been upgraded to 1.1 as well. It
should be 100% compatibile with 1.0 clients. 1.2 will likely
eliminate some deprecated functionality described earlier [2].


Plese let us know if you have any problems.
