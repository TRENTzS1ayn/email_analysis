A nice web annotation system "Web highlighter" is available for free
from PC Mag at http://www.pcmag.com/article/0,2997,s=1478&a=24244,00.asp
with source codes.

It integrates well with Internet Explorer and exports annotations as XML.
Maybe one programmer would be willing to make it "Annotea-compliant".

Laurent.
