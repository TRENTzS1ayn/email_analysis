So long as you use 'text/html', no.  For XHTML documents served as
'application/xhtml+xml', "3. Fragment identifiers" of RFC 3236 says
as follows:

   At the time of writing, [XMLMIME] does not define syntax and
   semantics of fragment identifiers, but refers to "XML Pointer
   Language (XPointer)" for a future XML fragment identification
   mechanism. The current specification for XPointer is available at
   http://www.w3.org/TR/xptr. Until [XMLMIME] gets updated, fragment
   identifiers for XHTML documents designate the element with the
   corresponding ID attribute value (see [XML] section 3.3.1); any XHTML
   element with the "id" attribute.

"It depends".
