We are well aware of that, but it affects the practice, not the
principle, of XPointers into HTML.

Indeed.  It depends on defining a canonical normalisation of HTML.
If we can do that, we're fine.

This has come up in ER and in Annotea.  I wasn't involved in Annotea
at the time of its introduction, so I won't comment on that now.

The subject arose in ER because we wanted an xpointer-like mechanism
available in Valet reports for client software - specifically Jim's
stuff.  Jim and I called them "Fuzzy Xpointers".  We haven't properly
formalised them, but rather we have an empirical working model:
  * Construct an XML normalisation of the HTML
  * Use a (simplified) Xpointer into that
We called them "Fuzzy Xpointers".

The mechanism works provided our respective parsers make compatible
HTML->XML normalisations.  After a couple of iterations, we were
able to make it work with OpenSP, MSXML and Mozilla - the tools we
were using in the applications in question.  This looks like a
reasonable starting point to define a canonical normalisation.
