Based on his research, David Bargeron (followed by Ka-Ping and myself) pointed out that
"using 'human-level' page content as the basis for anchoring was more effective than using the internal structure of the page".

So I would like to understand your motivations for using XPointer-like anchors to annotate documents.
It does not make sense to me, unless you specifically need to annotate the structure of a document. In this case, I would like to hear more about these applications.

Laurent.
