Indeed.  But that is another issue.  Another strand of work we have
pursued addresses the effectiveness of anchors by providing a measure
of their validity )or otherwise) over changes to a document.

I suggest you look at Page Valet
<URL:http://valet.webthing.com/page/>

Run it with the default settings, and select some kind of accessibility
tests.  Note that it references both validation errors and accessibility
warnings to the element in the markup that gives rise to them.

Now select the EARL output.  Tools using that may want the same
information.
