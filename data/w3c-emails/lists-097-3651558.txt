Well, the Fuzzy Pointers Jim and I are using each reference an element
in the markup (as opposed to a full-blown XPointer, which deals with
offsets and ranges).  This harnesses the document structure, and seems
to me to be the simplest and most robust way to do so.  Robustness
is further improved by computing a measure of whether the document
structure has changed between producing and reading the metadata.

A reference to "Chapter 2" in a book is a pointer to a structural
element, and is exactly analagous to our pointers.  "The chapter named
'Architecture'" is then the case where we have an ID.

Stretching the analogy, XPointer offsets and ranges could be said to
refer to pages, lines and even words.  In another edition of the book,
these may very well be invalid, but references to a chapter will be
more robust.

On te Web, documents change more frequently than editions of a book,
which makes it harder to produce robust pointers.  On the other hand,
electronic processing makes it easier.

Indeed, we can infer structure.  An exercise to the reader: take an
HTML page, change the FPI to ISO/IEC HTML, and run it through (say)
sgmlnorm.  The output will be normalised to the DTD, which infers
exactly that kind of document structure, each <H2> and its descendents
being enclosed in an implicit <DIV2> from the DTD.

But in the general case where such structural elements are seldom
used, it would, I suspect, be problematic to infer such structure.
We should use instead the actual structure.

Take for instance:

<h2> something </h2>
<p>bla bla bla</p>
<table> .... complex stuff here ... </table>
<p>some more</p>
<hr>
<p>a third para</p>

We might reasonably attach the first <p> to the <h2>, but whether the
<table> and the second <p> belong there cannot robustly be inferred
(unless the author is using a structurally strict DTD such as ISO HTML).
The third <p> after the <hr> is unlikely to belong to the <h2>, but
this isn't really something we can robustly infer beyond the simplistic
ISO-HTML approach of normalising to:
<div2>
 (the above markup)
</div2>

Using Fuzzy Pointers, we reference the actual elements.  We could instead
reference an implied <div2>, but I think this analysis is more useful for
markup similarity measures than for anchoring actual pointers.

Indeed it does, with the proviso that Annotea's "XPointers" are also
not strictly XPointers at all, since you too are applying them to HTML.

A checksum is not particularly useful, because it will be messed up
by trivial changes - e.g. a document that displays "todays date" but
otherwise doesn't change.  That's why Jim and I are using smarter
structural hashes to measure change.
