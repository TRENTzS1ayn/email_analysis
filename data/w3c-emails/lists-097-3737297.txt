XHTML may also be served as text/xml, so in that case XPointer can be used.
As Masayasu points out, XPointer needs to be updated to refer to RFC 3023.

If the document has id's then you can just use a URI, problem solved. But I
thought a more general solution was being sought.

No, the same document, served with different media types. It is the same
document, but the result of the media types means it gets parsed
differently.

As I said, if the document has ids, the problem is solved.

I'm sorry if I said something that upset you. I don't know what I said to
engender such rancour.

I was asked to comment on using XPointer into HTML, especially in the
context of TBODY.

If that is not the problem, I will keep quiet.
