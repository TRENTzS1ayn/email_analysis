Having id's makes pointing to a child of an element with an id or a range
within elements with id's more reliable, obviously if you're pointing to
just an id it's trivial as you say.

Can you have an xhtml1.1 document that is served as text/html ?  If not
the point is of somewhat historical interest as we're talking about a
subset of xhtml 1.0 documents are we not?

No it is not, by your argument
http://jibbering.example/example#xpointer(id('Moomin')) points to a
different fragment depending on whether the resource has an xhtml or html
mime-type.

You've said nothing to upset me - but your confused arguments over
XPointer and HTML have left more questions (many of which have been
raised before, and gone un-answered) than answers - A large number of
comments on XPointers have arisen in the thread, perhaps rather than
limit yourself to commenting on XPointer into HTML and the context of
TBODY you could comment on all the issues raised - those are the ones
that are actually concerning www-annotation and wai-er after all.
