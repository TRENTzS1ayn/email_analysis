That is defined by RFC 2854. I believe you could manipulate an xhtml 1.1
document in a similar way to Appendix C of XHTML 1.0
(http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#guidelines) so that it would be acceptable to
a UA that accepts text/html. It wouldn't be XHTML 1.1 to that UA of course,
but it would still be an XHTML 1.1 document. (I'm not sure if this answers
your question).

Are we?

I don't see the relevance of XHTML 1.1 here.

Aha. Apparently you misunderstood what I was trying to say. No. I didn't say
that. Ignoring the problem of permissibility of using XPointer to point into
HTML, the above would identify the same element. That was what I meant with
"if the document has ids, the problem is solved."

My point was about using child elements.

    http://jibbering.example/example#xpointer(id('Moomin'))/3/4/5

could identify different elements depending on the media type that the
document was served with. This is because the same document has different
parsings, dependent on the media type (text/html, or text/xml).

So if you gave the above pointer to someone, what they would see would
depend on the settings of their content negotiation parameters.

XPointer into HTML and the context of TBODY was what I was asked to comment
on, and I was fulfilling that request.
