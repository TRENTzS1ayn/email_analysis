You can't follow those guidelines and have a valid XHTML 1.1. document
(Guidline C.7 creates an invalid document.) so the simple Appendix C
guidelines are not sufficient.  The HTML WG have obviously already solved
this http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/ is served as text/html - could you
make public how you solved it?  Certainly some of my UA's that only
accept text/html have some difficulties with it.

That's always true of xpointer though, it only exist for a given
document, content-negotiation defeats all the fragment identifier
schemes.
