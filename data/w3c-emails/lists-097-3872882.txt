You can. A document with no lang= or xml:lang= would not contradict
guideline C.7. (You can use the http headers to express the content
language).

You didn't ask if *all* xhtml 1.1 documents could be served as text/html.
But even HTML 4 says that unrecognised attributes should be ignored, so an
xml:lang attribute doesn't do any actual harm.

To my knowledge there is nothing in that document that precludes it from
being served as text/html, with the exception of the closing slash quirk
which is the basis for being able to serve any XHTML document as text/html.
