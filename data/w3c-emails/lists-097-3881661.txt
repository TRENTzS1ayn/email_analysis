Ah, of course, sorry -  I was thinking in a WAI mindset where identifying
the language is a requirement.  So it's impossible to create an
accessible to WAI guidelines that is both XHTML 1.1 and served as

1.1 recommendation, it might help me understand it better in future, and
therefore not waste your time.

Jim.
