Which says:

|http-equiv = name [CI]
|This attribute may be used in place of the name attribute. HTTP servers
use this attribute to gather |information for HTTP response message
headers.

Nothing about clients using it, _servers use_ .

http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-html-lan also mentioned I think needs to
justify

"in particular, it is not in contradiction with the HTML 4.0
Specification."

as it reads that way to me, still it's only a note, so is of no real
consequence.

Jim.
