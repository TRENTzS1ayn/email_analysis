I also mention that [[
pdated 2003-03-04 by danbri,
this page is currently somewhat out of date. Earlier Mozilla's used a
simple RDF Web service protocol to
acquire annotations for display in a browser sidebar panel. More recently
this has been implemented as an HTML sidebar with the "metadata to
markup" conversion happening serverside. Others have explored
implemented systems that consume RDF/XML clientside...
]]

ie. I think Mozilla SmartBrowsing as originally documented no longer
exists.

I think a few folk have done this sort of thing. I'm copying
www-annotation (W3C's annotations list); someone on mozilla-rdf or
www-annotation should know more.

cheers,
