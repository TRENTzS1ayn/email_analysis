I installed the annotea server v1.1on my redhat linux machine (i use a 
mysql database).
Without the rdf.prop file in the right directory my browser displays the 
annotea page correct but with the
following statement:
-----
Can't open file "../../../Conf/rdf.prop": No such file or directory
 switching to ephemoral DB
-----
That's ok. But the aim is to use the real rdf database and so i copied 
the rdf.prop file to the right location.
Now there's the following problem.
The browser shows this message:
-----
native perl exception "Can't call method "rdfToken" on an undefined 
value at ../../../W3C/Rdf/XmlSerializer.pm line 28.
" in W3C::Annotations::AnnotationApp::W3C::Rdf::CGIApp::makePresenter

I watched the source code of the file XmlSerializer.pm the code of line 
28 is:
-----
 $self->{-rdfTag} = $self->{-RdfDB}->rdfToken('RDF')->getUri;
-----
But i don't know where to find the mistake. I checked the database 
several times and gave the annotea-user all database rights but nothing 
happens.
I would be very glad if anybody can send me some help. Perhaps where the 
mistake might be? Where i have to search to find it?
What is the functionality of the method "rdfToken" ?
