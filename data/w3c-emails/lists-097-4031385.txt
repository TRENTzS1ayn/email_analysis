Hello folks,

I asked the organizers if we could have this BOF. They're checking
the availability of a room. Check the BOF panel near the registration
desk (in front of the plenary key note room) to see its announcement
room, and meeting time (I'm not sure if it's 18h00 or 19h00).

If it doesn't happen, we can still meet around the conference. All the
Annotea folks from W3C are here.

Hope to meet you there,

-jose
