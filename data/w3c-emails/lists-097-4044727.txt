Sorry,

This may be a very stupid question, but:
I am trying to set up an annotation server.
I have read the documentation.
But I cannot understand where I can find the following file in the "Create
MySQL RDF database":
W3C/Rdf/bin/RdfObjects.mysql

If someone could give me a little hint, it would be very helpfull.

Thank you.
