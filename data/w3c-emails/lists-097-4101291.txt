All the annotations have rdf:type of a:Annotation however they also have
a property a:annotationType of
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/annotationType#Comment

Since looking in more detail, I've also found an
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/annotationType#Example
although the actual annotations don't appear to be any different from the

Question - they seem to share a addr:name/addr:firstName being identical
aswell, so it could be from a different UA?

On that might it be nice if we could trace which client made an
attribution - at the moment I only send identifying in the http header,
it might be nice if we included it withing the attribution itself.
