This seems to be different to the description on the Annotea protocols page 
http://www.w3.org/2001/Annotea/User/Protocol.html which has, for example in 
Figure 1,

  <r:Description>
   <r:type resource="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/annotation-ns#Annotation"/>
   <r:type resource="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/annotationType#Comment"/>
   etc.

i.e. two r:type's but no a:annotationType.
