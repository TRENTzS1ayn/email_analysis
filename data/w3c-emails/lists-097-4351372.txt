Hello,

The WWAAC folks were interested in setting up an annotation server to try 
out some of the ideas we talked about.  I'm forwarding a trip report that I 
sent to the WCAG WG mailing list. Also is a link to an outline that tries 
to bring the various pieces together.

Basic idea:
annotate text with concept codes that could be translated into symbols.

Best,
--wendy

>We discussed the possibility of creating a symbol-based style sheet for an

>They gave me an install of "Symbol for Windows" to demonstrate the issues

>The first, went through WCAG 2.0 and raised good research questions as
>possible future directions for their group.  They were trying to make sense
>of how they could contribute. I think we found many connection points -
>primarily in review and documentation of techniques.

>The second, described an XML syntax to markup concept codes.
