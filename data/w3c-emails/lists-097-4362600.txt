Hello everyone,

I'm quite interested in experimenting with annozilla and setting up a
local w3c annotation server.  I have a few questions, if anyone has time
to comment, it would be great.

I'd like to use postgres instead of mysql (I have a bunch of data 
already in a pg db and correlation would be nice). I don't imagine
changing the perllib modules would be that difficult, so I am inclined 
to do so.  Would this be a reasonable idea?  

I think it would be preferrable to have a generic perl SQL module 
presented for user interaction and thus be independent of the back 
end (this of course limits the SQL to the intersection of the feature 
sets of the various backend servers).  Has this approach been tried and 
abandoned?  (I know this is more of a perl/SQL question than an
annotation question, but I figured someone here might have have thought
about it and I'm new to the perl/SQL combo.)

There doesn't seem to be much traffic on the perllib mailing list, have 
the modules been superceded/replaced?  More specifically, is all the 
documentation at w3.org pertaining to annotea (and requirements) current?

Thanks,
Richard
