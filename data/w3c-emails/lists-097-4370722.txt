Yes (in principle at least).

On the Perl level this should be straightforward. The Perl idiom (I 
believe) is to install a DBD driver for your particular type of database, 
then do

use DBI;
my $dbh = DBI->connect($data_source, blah...)

where the driver in question decides how the $data_source will be named. So 
in theory the change could be as small as plugging in a new value for the 
data source. (Disclaimer: I'm not looking at the Annotea code at the 
moment.) Of course there could be complexities in practice.

I managed to install an annotea server on Windows NT using Apache and 
MySQL, using Perl from ActiveState and Perl modules from PPM, with only a 
bit of hacking (most of which were for Windows changes). So the 
instructions are probably fairly up to date.
