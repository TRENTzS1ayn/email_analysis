In deepest fear of this beeing a stupid question
I was wandering if anyone could please explain
to me why the rdfs:Class Annotation resides in

http://www.w3.org/2000/10/annotation-ns#

When all other rdfs:Class' are in

http://www.w3.org/2000/10/annotationType#

What is the difference? Thanks in advance.

/Claus
