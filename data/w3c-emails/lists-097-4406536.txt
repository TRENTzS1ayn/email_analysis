No need for fear.

We wanted to separate them so that people not wanting to use our Annotation 
subtypes can still use  the basic Annotation schema and just include their 
own types. For instance, Amaya has a a special file (config/annot.schemas 
in the Amaya installation directory) that can be edited to define what 
schemas to include. Right now we always use both definitions.
