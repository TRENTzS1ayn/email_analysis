Hi all,

There was a workshop at the end of June which discussed these two topics,
both of which are related to annotation (in different ways).

A preliminary report is available at
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/reports/dev_workshop_report_1 - any comments
or pointers to further information welcome.

regards

Charles McCN
