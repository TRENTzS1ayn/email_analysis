Dear all,

I've been gathering information about Annotea over the last couple of 
days. A collegue would like to use it in a course on computer-mediated
communication, sometime next month. I'd like to use the Java servlet 
because of my own personal experience and server availability (Tomcat).
Could someone verify that the following is accurate, and help me a bit
to get the stuff up and running?

The idea is to use two JavaScript-enhanced pages to create and retrieve
annotations, respectively. These are typically named create-annot.html 
and get_annot.html for obvious reasons, and addressed through a normal
URI, a bookmark etc. Whatever you like. These pages can be anywhere on 
the web, but it makes sense to have them on a "nearby" webserver. The
annotations are stored or retrieved by having the JavaScript functions
send/receive information from a relational database storing RDF data,
by calling on the Annotea servlet.

What puzzles me, is how the Annotea servlet gets addressed from within
these pages. Why is there a distinction between a "annotations" server
and a "servlet" ? One to GET, one to PUT/POST ? How should I configure
a web-app on Tomcat to get things working - it smells like a piece of
cake but I can't figure it out just yet :(

Any help or hints much appreciated.

Cheers,
Sandor
