I created the Annotea Bookmarklets and servlet because I wanted to
create and retrieve annotations from a browser other than Amaya.  
Since I did my work other, much more useful interfaces to an Annotea 
server have been created as documented at [1].

The W3C does not have the resources to maintain the Annotea servlet so 
the service was terminated a few weeks ago. 

If you'd like to set up your own installation of the servlet, the src is 
available (see [2]).

Anyhow, please check [1] and consider using one of the alternate 
interfaces rather than the servlet interface.
