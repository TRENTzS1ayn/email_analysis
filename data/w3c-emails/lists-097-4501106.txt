Hi guys,

I am trying to delete an annotation from Java with no luck.
The server returns a HTTP 500 error. I know that my code
is wrong because I can easily delete annotations from Amaya.
(The web-interface also fails) there are no reply's to the annotation.
Does anyone know what is wrong?


  String annotation = "http://annotest.w3.org/annotations/Annotation/1028082170.43327";
  String ai = "username:password";
  String authinfo = new sun.misc.BASE64Encoder().encode(ai.getBytes());

  URL url = new URL(annotation);
  HttpURLConnection huc = (HttpURLConnection)url.openConnection();

  huc.setRequestMethod("DELETE");
  huc.setRequestProperty("Authorization","Basic "+authinfo);
  huc.setRequestProperty("Accept","text/xml");  InputStream is = huc.getInputStream();
  InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(is);
  BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr);
  String line = "";
  while ((line = br.readLine())!=null)
  {
      System.out.println(line);
  }
  br.close();


/Claus
