Hi,

Does anyone know why the server response to POSTing an annotation (as indicated
by the protocols) provides only a subset of the RDF describing the annotation
and not the entire set?  I believe it would be useful to have complete
information in the response, thus eliminating the need for a second HTTP
transmission to retrieve the full RDF info.  

While in theory the application posting the annotation can infer the rest of the
information, confirmation would be useful.  

Any thoughts?

Doug
