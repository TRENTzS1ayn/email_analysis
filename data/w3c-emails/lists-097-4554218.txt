I suggested sometime ago that the Annotea implementations should be
moving towards DC 1.1, certainly last time I looked, Amaya (somewhat of a
reference implementation) didn't notice a title if it was 1.1, my
development version does recognise either 1.0 or 1.1 titles as being
titles.

I'd suggest you can freely change it to 1.1, without worry, it's the
title that's the important thing, not the vocabulary.

Jim.
