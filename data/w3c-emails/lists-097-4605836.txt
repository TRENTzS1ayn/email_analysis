Perhaps I'm looking for the wrong error. I was looking for errors with
a certain symptom, but they haven't occured since yesterday at 03:21 GMT.

[Mon Aug 26 03:21:05 2002] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] File does not exist: /var/www/annotations

I did an upgrade to last night at 23:50 GMT. Could you tell me the
exact time you get such an error? Then I can look in the error log and
see if it gives me a clue.

I'm sorry, but you seem to have gotten involved in a system bug
here. Hopefully we'll be able to track it down quickly.

Let's start with the exact time of a failure and see if we can work
with that.

Again, I'm sorry for the downtime.
