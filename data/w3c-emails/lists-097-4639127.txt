Well, at W3C we archive our email lists on the Web. This means you can
annotate those. You could also annotate by the message id that each email
has.

Although we can use that as a key into our archive, as far as I know
there is no reliable way of finding an email mesage that was sent based on
its message-id (happily enough, since most email is personal). But I don't
think that's really a problem for most use cases - if you take an annotea
approach then anyone who has the email can find the id in the header and
query for an annotation - usually that means the sender and recipient(s).

cheers
