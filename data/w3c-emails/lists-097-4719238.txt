I use amaya 6 and annotea locally.

I use annotea to comment documents, which I read from the web (not so much
for preparing new html-documents).

For about 36-38 annotations of one document all works well.

But then comes a point, when all further annotations are marked at the
begin of the doument and not at the place which I selected in the
document.

I think this is a problem with some numerical limit somewhere in annotea.

Can anybody hep me?

Kind regards
