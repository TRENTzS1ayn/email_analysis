Hi All.

I'm tinkering around with writing an annotea server as a gateway to my 
weblog.  Actually right now I'm just querying the W3C annotea server and 
fooling around with the clients to see exactly what their posts and queries 
look like.

Is there anyone who's interested in chatting about this?

I'll be hopefully creating a server and also a toolkit that will make it 
easier for others to add bits and pieces of the annotea protocol to other 
apps.

Here's a post about the project:

Thanks!

---------->Nathan
