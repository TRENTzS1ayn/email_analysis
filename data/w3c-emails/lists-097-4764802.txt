well, I hope you've also skimmed the protocol document
http://www.w3.org/2001/Annotea/User/Protocol.html

We (well, Marja) have been working on an update to that\
document, as we've neglected to document the reply
threading additions.  Marja's been beating me with
a stick to review her drafts.  I'm slowly getting to do that,
in between other tasks.

I'd prefer to put my time into getting a new protocol document
out the door, but perhaps your questions and comments
here on this list will cause me to work faster, or realize
parts of things that we've still failed to document adequately.
