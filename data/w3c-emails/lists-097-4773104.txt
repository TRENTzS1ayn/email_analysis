Hi,

I would like to announce the availability of a new implementation of an 
Annotea-compatible server, using Zope[1].  The product is called ZAnnot, 
and is available from http://www.zope.org/Members/Crouton/ZAnnot/. 
Using ZAnnot and Zope makes it very simple to get an annotation server 
running.  Once Zope and ZAnnot are installed, you simply:

- Go to the nifty web-based Zope Management Interface
- Create an instance of 'Annotation Server'
- Go to the acl_users folder and create user accounts for anyone you 
want to have access to adding annotations
- Configure your annotation-enabled browser to point at the newly 
created Annotation Server

We have tested it with Amaya and a forthcoming release of Annozilla. We 
  have tried to to make ZAnnot compatible with the Annotea protocol 
document as posted, and would welcome feedback if you encounter 
difficulties or incompatibilities.

  by exertion of the imagination.  Few media of creation are so
  flexible, so easy to polish and rework, so readily capable of
  realizing grand conceptual structures."
