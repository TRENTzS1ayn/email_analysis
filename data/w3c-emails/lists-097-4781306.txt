Hi Nathan,

yes, Dan brickley wrote a server (it only handles queries - you can't
actually PUT annotations to it) and I wrote some tools to use the annotea
protocol. It should all be in
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/200209/annodemo and we will write this up
properly over the course of this month. In the meantime I am also interested
to see what your tools do (and here's a +1 for asking Ralph to review the
reply-threading documentation and push that up the priority list).

cheers

Charles (must remember not to try and ask Ralph to do too many other things
in the meantime...)
