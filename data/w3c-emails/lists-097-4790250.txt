Yes, I have.  I've also looked at the RDF format for annotea but I'm new at 
reading this.

I've also looked at what you get when you make a request like:

http://annotest.w3.org/annotations?w3c_annotates=http%3A%2F%2Fncyoung.com

Is there an easy way to get the server to return XML to my browser just as it 
would to an annotea client?

I have a test version of my weblog to annotea gateway up (brittle query 
support ONLY).  You should be able to put it into your amaya annotea server 
lists and have my weblog entries come up when you visit a site I've commented 
on in my weblog.

My annotea server:

http://ncyoung.com/annoteaServer/annoteaTools.php

My weblog:

http://ncyoung.com

This is not a vanity exercise (as you might begin to think) I'm really much 
more interested in seeing other people's weblogs as annotations as I surf 
than in publishing my own.  I'm also motivated to help weblog tool authors 
build in mini-server support like this.  With a bit more exposure I think 
that annotations could take off the way RSS did.  I just think annotations 
are a really inspiring vector to include in our web experience.
