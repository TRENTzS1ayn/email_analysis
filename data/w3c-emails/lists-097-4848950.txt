Hi.

>>   have tried to to make ZAnnot compatible with the Annotea protocol
>> document as posted...

Is there any documentation about what clients need to be able to expect from 
servers (as a minimum)?  Or should each server completely implement the 
annotea protocol?

Also, is there anything that explains the annotation structure in more detail 
than 

http://www.w3.org/2000/10/annotation-ns#

In particular, I'm not fully sure how I should handle: 

<r:Description about="URI">

I think this is because I'm stil learning about RDF.  From doing a bit of 
reading, my guess is that the URI given should return the full annotation 
again?

Also, is there a reason to use one of the body formats over another in a 
given situation? are they completely interchangable?  Specifically, would 
providing the body inline in the response to a query save the client an extra 
request?

<a:body r:resource="http://www.example.com/mycomment.html"/>

<a:body>
  ...
</a:body>

Thanks in advance!
