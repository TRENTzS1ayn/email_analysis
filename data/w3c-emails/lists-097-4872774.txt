Well, using my ruby tools I got a response that there is an annotation o
http://www.w3.org/ but the URIs are given as
http://localhost:8080/something...

I don't think that means that same thing locally as it does in the Web - I
don't find anything at localhost:8080 from my laptop.

I managed to post an annotation for Amaya (need to configure my annotataion
post tool to be flexible about which port it uses %-\ and when I looked for
that the body had been given a ful URI so maybe this is an old problem that
has been fixed.

So on the positive side, everything seems to work fine...

cheers
