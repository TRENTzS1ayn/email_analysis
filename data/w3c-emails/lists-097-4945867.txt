The current downloadable version of Snufkin, currently does not position
the annotations in the correct place, not managing to find the xpointer,
but it does find them, and can also submit properly.

Snufkin 0.31 - a genuine RDF implementation (well sort of, using my
javascript rdf parser rather than something real) works fine, positioning
them appropriately.  So all seems good!

Cheers,

Jim.
