Hmm, that means you should look  for another bug. I created the annotation
with Amaya (6.1 Macintosh package, so it may hhave been fixed already).

I think my post tool will work now for testing against Brent's server (I had
to update it to handle different port numbers) but I decided to check my
email instead of testing and committing, given limited connectivity. I hope I
will have some more time to work on this over the weekend.

Cheers
