In this message:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-annotation/2002JulDec/0000.html

it seemed that there was confusion over the correct way to indicate the 
type of an annotation.

Jim Ley thought that annotations should have an rdf:type of a:Annotation 
and could optionally have an a:annotationType which described the 
annotation type in more detail.

But the protocol page indicates that there can be two different rdf:type's.

Can anyone clarify this?
