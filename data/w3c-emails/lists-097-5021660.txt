I think there is confusion.

In the experimental EARL server we set up at W3C the annotations do not have
a type of a:Annotation (where a is the common annotea namespace) at all -
they are merely EARL data.

I suspect that it would have been more useful to make these annotations
perhaps with a type that was different to the existing list (something like
the Dublin Core relation element?). We can experiment further...

Cheers

Charles
