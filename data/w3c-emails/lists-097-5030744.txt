Currently all annotations are of type rdf:type a:Annotation (namespace 
a=http://www.w3.org/2000/10/annotation-ns#). They typically also have a 
more specific annotation subclass type e.g. rdf:type aT:Comment (namespace 
aT =http://www.w3.org/2000/10/annotationType#). It is also possible for a 
group to define other annotation subtypes and use them.

The a:Annotation could naturally be left out and just infer it from the 
more specific type by using the knowledge about subClassOf definition 
between the types. We have not currently done it for couple of reasons 
related to history and optimization.
