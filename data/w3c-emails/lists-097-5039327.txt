Hi.

I'm trying to tighten up my weblog to annotation gateway, using the annotea 
protocol doc at:

http://www.w3.org/2001/Annotea/User/Protocol.html

I have a question and a comment.

Question: what should the about attribute of r:description hold?  I.e.:
<r:description about="what goes here?">
I'm perfectly happy to be pointed at the right reading material to figure 
this out for myself :)

Comment: To get a title to show up when looking at the annotations in amaya, 
I used <d:title>, inferred from:

http://annotest.w3.org/annotations?w3c_annotates=http://ncyoung.com

But the title element does not show up in the protocol docs (linked above) or 
in:

http://www.w3.org/2000/10/annotation-ns#


Thanks!
