it should be r:about surely (old RDF format?)

What this document:

<r:RDF xmlns:r="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
       xmlns:a="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/annotation-ns#"
       xmlns:d="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">
 <r:Description r:about="http://www.example.org/Annotation/3ACF6D754">
  <a:annotates r:resource="http://example.com/some/page.html"/>
  <a:body r:resource="http://www.example.org/Annotation/3ACF6D754text"/>
 </r:Description>
</r:RDF>

Says at the triple level is:

 Predicate Object
 http://www.example.org/Annotation/3ACF6D754
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/annotation-ns#annotates
http://example.com/some/page.html
 http://www.example.org/Annotation/3ACF6D754
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/annotation-ns#body
http://www.example.org/Annotation/3ACF6D754text

So
 "the thing in the about" "Annotates" "http://example.com/some/page.html"
and
 "the thing in the about" "body can be found at"
"http://www.example.org/Annotation/3ACF6D754text"

So at one level it's just a label, you don't even need it at all (when in
RDF it would just be a blank label), however it's also a URI you can GET,
and if you do this, you'll probably get the original annotation RDF - so
if you have the RDF somewhere use that, or you can use some unique URI
simply as a label - I don't see the point of that though here.

Yep, this comes from the Dublin Core Namespace, they define in, in RDF
you use the most popular namespace you can find which says what you want,
so Annotea doesn't invent its own "words" for title, it borrows it from
Dublin Core.  The RDF primer at http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-primer/ may well
be helpful to understand these issues.
