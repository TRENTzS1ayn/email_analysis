Is the namespace identifier omitted on the attribute because it's the same 
namespace as the element itself?  (e.g. <r:type resource=""> but <a:annotates 
r:resource="">)???

So that's the annotation by itself rather than the list context returned as a 
response to a query, right?  'Though if the query only returns one 
annotation, these will be the same...???

Thanks so much, like I say I'm new at this and your descriptions have really 
helped.  That explains perfectly why it wasn't in the annotea definition.

I still think that where the protocol documentation gives example 
annotations, the title element should be shown.

Thanks, I'll read that.
