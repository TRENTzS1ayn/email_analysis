I tried Annotea with Amaya; it works fine (if there are not more than 
ca. 39 annotations to a single page).

But I have a question concerning annotations and changed files.

As I understand, annotea uses XPointer for locationg the annotations 
concerning the annotated document.
These annotations are stored at a separate server (not with the 
annotated document, to which no write possibility is needed.) That means 
the annotation and addressing information are stored at the local or 
Annotea server.

This is fine, as long as the annotated document is not changed, deleted, ...
If this occurs, the adress-information must be wrong (for example 
annotations for a deleted document)
There must be some sort of synchronization.
I could imagine at loading a deleted document => error 404 (no 
annotations). But at loading a changed document: Is there a check, if 
the annotation-information on the server fits the loaded document?
If not, the annotations could point to wrong parts of the text.

Please give me information to this question. I did not find answers in 
FAQ or other Annotea documentation.

A second question:

If I use Annotea with Amaya locally on my PC, can I access the 
annotations with mozilla too and vice versa?

Kind regards
