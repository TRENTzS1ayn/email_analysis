Can you tell me which version of Amaya and which platform 
are you using? I've been unable to reproduce this bug.

That's correct.

They are stored separately, either in a server or locally.

This is the problem of orphan annotations and robust XPointers.
Currently, the Amaya XPointer implementation is very basic. One could
always imagine new ways of using XPointer to reduce the risk of orphan
annotations. Some other people believe that the only way to do this is
to expand the context of what you annotated, e.g., including the
previous paragraphs. Knowing when a document has been modified is always
easy. Knowing how to reassing the annotations is not so easy.

We're expanding the annotation schema so that you can have other
contexts than just XPointer. This can be used to make more robust
annotations. We're not defining the other context ourselves, but just
making it possible to have people add them into an annotation.

I think that mozilla only supports remote annotations. We have yet to
specify how to exchange local annotations between applications. Once
this is done, you can store your annotations anywhere, even outside of
an annotation server and link your documents to them, e.g., using an
HTML LINK attribute, like we do today for linking external CSS.

I hope we find time to work on this. All contributions are welcome, of
course.

I hope this answered your questions.
