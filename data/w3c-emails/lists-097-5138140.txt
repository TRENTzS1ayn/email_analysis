If the annotations were totally deleted that was a bug.

Most probably what happened is that the document was changed in a way that 
the XPointer did not make sense anymore and so the annotation became 
orphaned. The orphaned annotation still exists in a Show links view and can 
be moved to a new location by using the Annotations/Move to selection 
command (select the location in the document window, apply the command in 
the annotation window).

We are planning to introduce a new "context" schema so that it is possible 
to define also other kinds of address mechanisms e.g. svg outline for a 
raster image. With the same mechanism it should be possible to add info to 
define more robust pointers. Using frequent ID's in the document elements 
also helps as XPointers are relative to the closest ID in the hierarchy of 
elements. And there are social mechanisms to freeze certain documents.

Also being able to store a snapshot of annotations and the document would 
be beneficial.
