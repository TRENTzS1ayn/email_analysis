To test my Zope annotation server, I decided to upgrade to the latest 
amaya client (GTK Amaya 6.4 on linux).  When it wasn't able to post 
annotations, I figured it was a bug in my server.  As a check, however, 
I pointed amaya at the W3C annotest server.  It wasn't able to post 
there either!

Am I the only one who has seen this problem?  Did something in amaya 
break between 6.2 and 6.4?
