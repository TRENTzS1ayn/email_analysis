I think that you used to get an error "509 Protocol Vaguery" if you tried 
to delete an annotation which had replies. But maybe I'm wrong.

I was wondering if some of the reply-related server code had changed, 
because my development version of Annozilla seems not to be picking up 
replies created by Amaya any more. In fact, even if I go straight to the 
server with

http://annotest.w3.org/annotations?w3c_replyTree=annotation URI

I don't see what I expect.
