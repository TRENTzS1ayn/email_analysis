What we eventually want is that the group using the service can easily 
define these things e.g. annotations with replies cannot be deleted by 
anyone or deleting annotations with replies also deletes the whole thread 
or something else that makes sense.

With annotest server we experimented with not letting annotations be 
deleted if they have replies so current behavior seems to be a bug.
