Seems like a reasonable approach. It is a bit like the problem of having
robust annotations for something (for examle making them annotations of a
whole document) which has changed. We can compare the dates (at least in case
of annotations on annotations and in principle for other documents) but that
doesn't necessarily tell us what went before - we just have to assume the
responsibility for interpretation...
