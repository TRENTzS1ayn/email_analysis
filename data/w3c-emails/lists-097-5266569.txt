I'm not going through a proxy.  I wasn't seeing the authentication box. 
  It would just hang.  Of course, I just tried it again today and now it 
seems to be working.  Strange

Well, I'm not seeing the problem anymore even with stock amaya, but I 
downloaded and tested your build anyway.  One thing I've observed is 
that with your changes, amaya no longer crashes on certain annotations 
generated by annozilla.  It doesn't correctly resolve the XPointer, but 
an orphan annotation is better than a crash

I'll attach the RDF for this annotation.  Should this be resolving?  Is 
the fault in annozilla's XPointer generation or in Amaya's parsing.

(Note: This is not a stock annozilla.  It has Doug Daniels' enhanced 
XPointer stuff)
