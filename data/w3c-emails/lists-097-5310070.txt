Hi 

I have just set up a new linux box (running SuSE 8.1).  Apache 
(including cgi-bin) and mySQL seem fine.  (Of course they were 
pre-installed using the SuSE RPM's.) I then tried to install annotea 
from cvs using the instructions in 

http://www.w3.org/1999/02/26-modules/User/Annotations-HOWTO

I inserted the apache script into the working httpd.conf file.
(I understood that access control and algae are not strictly
necessary, so for testing purposes I omitted them -- I will return
to these steps later.)

When I point a browser at
  http://localhost/annotations?w3c_annotates=test
I get the unhelpful single line

died with Undefined subroutine 
&W3C::Util::W3CDebugCGI::LogEntry::__NR_gettimeofday called at 
/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.0/i586-linux-thread-multi/bits/syscall.ph line 
550.

in the browser window.  There is no error log entry.

The only thing I can deduce from this is that perl is trying to tell me
something (an error message or debugging info) but because of 
a missing subroutine or module or something, it can't.

Please could someone help?

Many thanks

Richard Kaye
