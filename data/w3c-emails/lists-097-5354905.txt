Eric,

Many thanks.  I'm very grateful for your help!

As I mentioned, I'm using SuSE 8.1.  One day soon I will email
SuSE to explain this problem with syscall.

I did however manage to sort out perl.  I ran "h2ph -h"
on some of the .h files in /usr/include.  It seemed that without 
the -h switch the .ph files (which SuSE had perviously generated 
and I had installed from the RPM) didn't work.  I don't 
understand all this, but am reasonably happy I found a 
work-around.

But my annotea server's not working yet :-(

I am getting a new error message when I try to POST
an annotation from amaya.  The following appears in 
the httpd error_log file:

Can't locate auto/W3C/Rdf/RdfDB/disconnect.al in @INC (@INC contains: ..

script headers: /usr/local/perl/modules/W3C/Annotations/CGI/annotate

I'll keep looking to see what is or isn't happening, but if you have 
any ideas or suggestions, I'd be very grateful!

Thanks

Richard

PS.  I have had some reports of emails sent to me a couple of days
ago going mysteriously astray.  This is a repeat post. If anyone did 
respond to the original, please repeat! Thanks
