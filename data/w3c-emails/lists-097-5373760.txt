Hi,
We, at NCST Bangalore, have developed a simple annotation system. The
following are some of the functionalities supported :

1) Making Annotations on ANY resource that can be viewed in a browser (
Currently only MS Internet Explorer is supported )
2) Storing annotations locally/posting to a central server
3) Viewing annotations (Local & from one/more annotation servers)
4) SEARCHING for annotations
5) Replying to annotations made by others.

The client is a plug-in for MS Internet Explorer (a toolbar & a explorer
bar). The annotation server was developed in Java.

For more details, please visit http://www.ncb.ernet.in/groups/dake/annotate/

Thank you.
