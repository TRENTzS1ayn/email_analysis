Hello,
I did a similar program during my PhD (Yawas, available from http://www.univ-savoie.fr/labos/syscom/Laurent.Denoue/)
but the implementation you have looks much better.
However, as far as I can tell from the screenshot, I think you could improve something:
- instead of a single icon at the beginning of the selected passage, I think it would be nice to anchor the original selection, say with a highlighted color like in Yawas or with two icons like CritLink.
- let users search for keywords IN THE SELECTIONS
- present the results of the search engine with a document summary. One of my results with Yawas is that the simple
concatenation of the selected passages in a document are good to summarize it (when the highlights have been created by the person searching at least)
- when browsing annotations, again it would be nice to use the selected passages to represent the document. Now, you simply display the document URL. A simple solution would be to display the selected passages when you mouse over the document URL in the list.

I also have a few questions:
- how did you manage to annotate PDF documents? Do you simply annotate the whole document or can you select some text as well?
- can you annotate part of a picture or only the whole picture? How do the annotations appear in the original document?

Very nice work!
Laurent.

> Hi,
> We, at NCST Bangalore, have developed a simple 
> annotation system. The
> following are some of the functionalities supported :
> 
> 1) Making Annotations on ANY resource that can be viewed in a 
> browser (
> Currently only MS Internet Explorer is supported )
> 2) Storing annotations locally/posting to a central server
> 3) Viewing annotations (Local & from one/more annotation servers)
> 4) SEARCHING for annotations
> 5) Replying to annotations made by others.
> 
> The client is a plug-in for MS Internet Explorer (a 
> toolbar & a explorer
> bar). The annotation server was developed in Java.
