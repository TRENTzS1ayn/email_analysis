- how did you manage to annotate PDF documents? Do you simply annotate the
whole document or can you select some text as well?

annotations appear in the original document?

The annotea protocol, by using Xpointer can address any kind of XML document.
So it can point into part of an SVG image, for example. Nick Kew and Jim Ley
did some work on pointing into non XML documents using what they called a
fuzzy pointer - essentially it relies on having some way of addressing part
of an object.

There are people working on how to point to a part of a flash presentation,
and Adobe have been working on tagged PDF which should provide a way to point
towards parts of a PDF document, although I am hardly an expert there.
