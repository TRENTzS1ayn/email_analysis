I'd like to clarify something that the Annotea protocols are unclear on.
 Is it necessary to include the text for an annotation's body in the RDF
sent to the server to update the annotation?

Say you just want to update the type of an annotation, but not update the
text in the body.  If updates require the body of the annotaton, then to
update the just the type you must
(1) GET the annotation
(2) GET the body text from the url embedded in the annotation
(3) POST the update, complete with the same body text

However, if including the body in the update RDF was optional, then you
could skip step 2.  This seems like a useful optimization to me.

I was going to test an update w/o body information to see if it works on
annotest.w3.org, but the server seems to be down.  So does anyone know
offhand if the update w/o body will work?

Thanks,
Doug
