In principle it seems to me that you should be able to PUT the updated
annotation information, with the reference to the text as given by a query
that would return the annotation.

As I read the protocol you SHOULD use PUT to update an annotation, only using
POST to have the server create one with new URIs for the annotation and its
body, although this isn't a MUST for some reason I don't understand that
comes out as "implementation magic".
