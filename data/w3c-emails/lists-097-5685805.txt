Hi,

I have installed the Server (and I made a fink package so people can readily
install it in OS X, although it will take me a little while to put that into
the fink system, but when that happens I'll post it here. In the meantime
if anyone has a Mac and is prepared to try an under-tested system let me
know and I will make my experimental info file available).

I found an oddity in the documentation - it wasn't clear where the Annotea
server would be. It turned out to be reasonably straightforward - i gave it
the ID ZAnnot and so my Annotation server is http://localhost:8080/ZAnnot

and now it is running happily with Amaya and with the annodemo tools at
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/

So thanks Brent. This is the easiest install I know of at the moment for an
Annotea server (now to try and make some more easy ones :)

Charles
