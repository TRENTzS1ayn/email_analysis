Following the revision of the Annotea protocol, I modified the
implementation of the annotation update protocol to use PUT rather
than POST. The change is commited to CVS.

I haven'y yet removed the code to use POST. I can leave it there and
make its use optional if the other Annotea client developers think
it's good to keep both protocols for any given issue.
