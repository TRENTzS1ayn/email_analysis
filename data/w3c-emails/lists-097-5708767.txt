Charles,

I'm happy that you are helping us to make the W3C Annotea server 
instructions easier. I have tried to improve them and so has Eric and we 
have received excellent feedback from many developers but there is still 
much improvement to do.

So now is a good time for everybody to send suggestions.

Marja
