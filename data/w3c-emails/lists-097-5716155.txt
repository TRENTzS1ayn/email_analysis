hi all

A quick note to let Annotation/RDF/etc folk here know about a new Working Group 
at W3C, focussing on Timed Text, within the general context of SMIL.

Charter: http://www.w3.org/AudioVideo/TT/ttcharter20020901.html
Homepage: http://www.w3.org/AudioVideo/TT/
[[
1. Mission Statement

The mission of the Timed-Text Working Group (TTWG) is to develop an XML based format used for the representation of streamable text synchronized with some other timed media, like audio and video. A typical application is real time captioning of movies on the Web (e.g. integrated in SMIL).

2. Scope and Deliverables

The scope of the TTWG includes:

Develop a new Timed-Text format that integrates well with other W3C technologies
Ensure the quality and interoperability of the new format
Maintain a requirements document for the new format (what it should do and not do) 
At the time of writing this charter, a draft of these requirements is available.
Maintain a list of existing formats in this field and how they relate/differ from the new format being developed at W3C
Coordinate with organizations developing those other formats to get their input on the new format
Coordinate with other W3C groups (e.g. HTML, SMIL, WAI, SVG, CSS) developing technologies than can be used to implement Timed-Text.
[...]

I've not followed the creation of this WG closely, but from my 
experiences with SMIL, I think it should prove rather useful as a basis 
for annotating multimedia content (audio, video...).
