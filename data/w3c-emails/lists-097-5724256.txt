Hi folks,

I have installed the ZAnnot server o OS X (fairly easy to do) and on Windows
(ridiculously easy). I will shortly have written up instructions for
installation and configuration to make them run. But if anyone else has
installed the ZAnnot server on Windows they might be able to help me out...

I had no problem posting Annotations to it, but for some reason it will not
return them to me. I tested using the ruby command-line annodemo tools at
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/200209/annodemo and using Amaya 7.1 and it
doesn't get anything. The same tools work fine to post to the server, and the
annotations are shown in the server management interface, and on Moc OS X the
same tools all work fine. I have only tested on Windows using localhost and
annotating local files (I don't have a Windows machine that I can set up as
an online server at the moment).

Any help available?

The very rough draft of instructions that I am working on is at
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/reports/annotation_demo_server_report/zannot-inst
if anyone wants a preview of an unstable and incomplete draft...

cheers

Chaals
