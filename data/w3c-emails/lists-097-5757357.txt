Presumably this is to do with the way debian is set up. I'll note it..

Yep, did that about 10 minutes before your message :-)

I suggested apt-getting python2.1-xml in my instructions. With minimal
experience of debain packages and no test sytem I am open to all
suggestions...

If you configure your favourite annotea client to post anotations to and get
them from http://localhost:9673/anno/server you should be able to annotate
something, and then query for annotations on that thing and get the results.

Unlike the W3C server I don't think the ZAnnot server provides a default
HTML form interface - if you don't talk annotea to it you get no joy...

cheers, and thanks for your results...
