I put my windows machine online, and annotated a header on the W3C homepage.
As always, the ZAnnot server handled it fine, and this time Amaya could find
the annotation as well. So I am wondering what Amaya sends as the URI ift is
looking for annotations for when they are of the form file://

I next annotated http://www.example.org using the ruby annopost and tried to
load the annotation in Amaya. It told me there was an orphan annotation, and
then couldn't load it because it couldn't find annotest.w3.org (which must be
hard-coded in there somewhere, because I haven't put it in any config stuff.

Finally, I cannot delete my username - in the configuration box for Annotea
User I keep deleting it and Amaya keeps putting it back.

(and I still cannot get anything from the Zope server running on Windows
using the ruby annoget tool, although it works fine on OS X.)
