Charles, 

Have you read the new Annotea draft protocol [1]? This is not clear
from your message.

It actually documents what you're proposing and Appendix B [2] explains
why we were using POST. In a previous message we asked developers
for feedback wrt making PUT the prefered practice and dropping
altogether POST for updating annotations.
