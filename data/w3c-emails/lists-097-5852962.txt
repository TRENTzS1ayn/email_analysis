Hi all,

I'm trying to figure out how to format the body of annotations for
annozilla, and there  doesn't seem to be a standard in place.  Right now,
Amaya 7.1 is creating annotation bodies that look like:

 <html>
   <head>
     <title>Annotation of whatever</title>
   </head>
   <body>
     <p>some body text goes here</p>
   </body>
 </html>


this sort of annotation 1) has no doctype and 2) has no namespace.  as
such, when annotest.w3.org serves this document up with mimetype
"application/xhtml+xml", poor mozilla becomes utterly confused.  seeing a
standards-compliant mimetype, it tries to render in standards compliance
mode.  however, without a namespace and/or doctype, there's no styling
info, and the whole process gets hosed.

so, I suggest that we have our clients, especially amaya,  put a namespace
and/or doctype in the body html.

what do you all think?

regards,
Doug
