annotest gets the mime-type of the resource from the submission, the problem
is purely an Amaya problem of incorrectly submitting the mime-type as
application/xhtml+xml (well and a problem of embedding documents within
other documents in the xhtml world...)

amaya should simply not claim that the previous document is
application/xhtml+xml when it's not!
