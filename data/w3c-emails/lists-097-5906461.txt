Brent,

thanks for the response. I haven't got it online :( As near as I could tell,
when there was no difference between the context and the thing being
annotated it was just not returning a context, and so Amaya thought it was an
orphan, but I am not sure about that.

I have no idea why the annoget.rb wasn't working - that seeems to be windows
wierdness, since the same code works fine under Mac OS X running ruby.

I am hoping Jim Ley will set up a windows server with ZAnnot so we can test
against that. (But other volunteers would be appreciated...)

cheers

Chaals
