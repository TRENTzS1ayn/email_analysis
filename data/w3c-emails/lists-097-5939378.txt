Hi all,

in the protocol document [1] all the examples for context use a literal as
its value. The schema doesn't specify any domain or range.

In my annotools I used an rdf:resource as the object, on the basis that it
was going to be an Xpointer or a URI. The ZAnnot server is returning this as
if it were a literal.

Is there a reason why the object should be one or the other? Does the
specification remain purposely silent on the question, or are the examples
reflective of the assumed use.

And what do implementations expect?

A related question is how this applies to the Annotates property - what
happens if I use an rdf:Bag for the things that a particular annotation
annotates?

cheers

Chaals
