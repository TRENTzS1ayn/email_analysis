This changed between the old and new protocol, it's the one area of concern
I have with the new protocol, context seems problematical, I still want to
be able to annotate svg/raster images via my RDF img parts (like hte RDF
generated in http://jibbering.com/svg/annotateimage.html - example:
http://jibbering.com/rdfsvg/example.rdf ) which makes for the context to be
a lot more complicated object than is really expressable in a literal.  I've
been trying to think of an alternative suggestion, but not come up with one.

I don't distinguish between literal/resource, if they smell the same they're
used the same.
