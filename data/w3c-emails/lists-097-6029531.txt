Hi all,

If you want to try out a new, experimental version of Annozilla, you can 
check it out at http://annozilla.mozdev.org/installation.html (you'll 
have to scroll down to the bottom of the page) -- it's code that may 
eventually become part of annozilla 0.5.

This is a project that I've been working on for a couple months.  It 
uses a Mozilla XPCOM service to provide back-end annotations support, 
and then the Annozilla stuff is written as a front-end.  It supports 
multiple annotations servers, local annotations, and more accurate icon 
insertion than 0.3.5 (though 0.4 should have the same icon insertion 
abilities).

There are still a few bugs to iron out, and particularly the ability to 
view annotations as
   A) list in the sidebar -AND/OR-
   B) icons inserted into the window
which is implied by the Viewing Preferences isn't completely implemented 
yet.  It's more like B requires A.

Let me know what you think, and if you see any bugs let me know.

Thanks,
Doug
