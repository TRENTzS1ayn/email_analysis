Hi,

I am writing a Java client for Annotea and I am having a weird problem
that I am hoping somebody can help me to solve.

I have written several Java classes that interact with an Annotea server
using the protocols described in the "Annotea Protocols" document.  Using
my classes, and the annotest.w3.org server, I have been able to
successfully post new annotations, query the server to find out the
annotations associated with a document, download an annotation and its
body, update an annotation and delete it.

I have also been able to successfully query the server to find out the
replies to an annotation, and download a reply and its body. However,
whenever I try to post a reply to an annotation, update a reply, or delete
a reply I got a Java FileNotFoundException. According to the trace of the
exception the problem is that the reply can not be found.  (Please notice
that the reply seems to be there because I can access the URI with a
browser and I can see the reply with the Amaya browser).

I have reviewed the Annotea Protocol document several times and I am
doing everything that is described in there, however, my code keeps
crashing. What is weird is that, for example, according to the "Annotea
Protocols" document the protocol to delete and annotation and the protocol
to delete a reply are the same, however, I can delete an annotation but
not a reply (not even leaf replies) using the same Java code.

Is something missing on the Annotea protocols document? Has somebody had
similar problems?

Has somebody be able to post, update, or delete annotations using Java?
Is there an example code available?

I would really appreciate any help,

Thanks, Damian.
