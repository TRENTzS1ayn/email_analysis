I would use a http-proxy like muffin (http://muffin.doit.org/) to 
compare the post of amaya with the one of your application.

I didn't yet try to implement the reply protocol. To be honest I don't 
understand the need for this, why not just annotate annotations?

> Has somebody be able to post, update, or delete annotations using Java?
post and get only. you can check out the module client from the cvs as 
described under https://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=75007. This 
client is part of a newly started project named "mies" which aims to 
build a decentral system for storing annotations. The project is very 
open for contributions and new participants!

cheers,
