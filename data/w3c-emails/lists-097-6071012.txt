Hmm, I think using IE's canonical representation is a little simpler, and
you can see that it generally produces reasonably good and interworkable
XPointers, other than inconsistencies in the HEAD portion of the document.
(See work by me and Nick Kew)  Snufkin, and Annozilla also have DOM to
XPointer implementations in straight JS+DOM.

I think the bigger problem is the whole using XPointer into HTML docs at
all, Tidy is perhaps a better solution for allowing that.
