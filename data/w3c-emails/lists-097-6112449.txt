Hi all,

I noticed that annotations posted with Amaya aren't including time zone
information in the date they post.  They send something like:

2003-03-04T11:04:10

which doesn't give enough information.  what we need is more like:

2003-03-04T11:04:10-06:00

I think the protocol document has the time zone in the created and date
fields.

thanks,
Doug
