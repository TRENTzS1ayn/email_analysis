We use UTC and the times should have a Z after the time but is was dropped 
out by accident in our implementation. It was supposed to be corrected but 
I'll check that it is on the todo list.

Here is an extract from the new protocol document 
(http://www.w3.org/2001/Annotea/User/Protocol.html).

<a:created>1999-10-14T12:10Z</a:created>
<d:date>1999-10-14T12:10Z</d:date>

Is there a reason why this is not enough? The times can be converted to 
local time by the client if that is known.
