Hi,

I'm trying to send the character encoding when posting an annotation, and
the W3 annotest.w3.org/annotations server fails to parse it correctly.

When I send the request parameter 'Content-Type' as:
 'application/xml; charset=UTF-8'

the server responds with status 500 and an error message something like:

<!-- sessionId: 1046810082.118077 -->
<html><head><title>bad parameter: <?xml version</title></head>
      <body><h1>bad parameter: <?xml version</h1>
            <p>http://annotest.w3.org/annotations was unable to interpret
parameter <?xml version: "1.0"?>

Setting the content type back to just
 'application/xml'
generates the correct behavior again.

It seems like the server should be able to handle character encodings, and
from the HTTP 1.1 RFC this looks like the correct way to do it. So I guess
this is a bug?

thanks,
Doug

BTW, I also tried out a few other character encoding types, and got the
same error.
