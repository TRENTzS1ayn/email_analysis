Hmmm.  Indeed you are correct.  Unfortunately, changing this seems to 
break the latest CVS Annozilla since Mozilla's javascript doesn't 
natively understand ISO 8601 dates.  I'll release a new ZAnnot that 
corrects this once Annozilla 0.4 comes out.  In the meantime, this 
shouldn't cause problems for anyone since Amaya seems to just treat it 
as a string.  But if anyone is interested I can post a patch.
