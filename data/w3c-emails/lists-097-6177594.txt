I've published a new version of ZAnnot, the Annotea-compatible 
Annotation server for Zope, at:

http://www.zope.org/Members/Crouton/ZAnnot/ZAnnot-0.4rc1.zip

Among other fixes, this version adds support for UTF-8 encoded 
annotations and the HTTP PUT method of updating.  If you've used 
previous versions of ZAnnot, please give 0.4rc1 a try.  If there are no 
major bugs, I will release it as 0.4.

Thanks!
