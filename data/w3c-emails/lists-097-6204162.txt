So that would be none of them.  I'm now thoroughly confused. :)

ZAnnot attempts to follow the Annotea spec as written.  There, creator 
appears as a literal.  I can try to be a little more flexible in what I 
accept, but I'm concerned about interoperability.  If each client is 
basically choosing what type of data to send for each field, how will 
they ever be compatible?
