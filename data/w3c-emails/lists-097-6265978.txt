Hi,

Has anyone had a chance to look at annotest.w3.org yet to check out the 
'Content-Type' bug, whereby the server generates an error if the 
Content-Type request parameter sent to it includes a charset?

I'm looking to put out a version of the annotations service (used by 
annozilla 0.4), but before doing so would like to know whether or not I 
can send the character encoding in the content type.  It looks to me 
like this is the valid way of specifying character encoding according to 
the HTTP RFC.

Thanks,
Doug
