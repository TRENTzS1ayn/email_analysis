Hi folks,

A use case came up for annotea, which is providing information about a part
of an HTML document that isn't part of the normally rendered text - for
example to note that part of the document's title is in Italian (and perhaps
provide an alternative version in English).

Using the SWAD-E annodemo tools I scraped together an example - see
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2003JanMar/0349 for my
explanation. I think enough of the context is included in that (rather long)
message to explain what I was responding to.

It raises a couple of interesting questions for client developers about how
to create such annotations, how to present them, etc.

cheers

Chaals
