Here's a timely application of Web annotations...

  The Washington Post has an article at 
  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A46062-2003Mar18.html
  "British Prime Minister Rallies Lawmakers Ahead of Commons Vote on Iraq"
  By Ed Johnson,
  Associated Press Writer, Tuesday, March 18, 2003; 11:44 AM

The BBC News website has an article,
  http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2859431.stm
  "Cook's resignation speech",

...which gives the full text of Robin Cook's resignation speech to the 
UK House of Commons.


The Post article mentions the Cook resignation briefly:

"Already senior Cabinet minister Robin Cook and 
two junior ministers have quit over Iraq."


The Web annotation / Semantic Web use case here is to associate this 
brief mention of the Cook resignation to more details of the event, 
specifically in this case the full text of his speech. There are a number 
of ways we could represent this in RDF, depending on the level of detail
required. Basic idea is that annotating 3rd parties should be able to write
RDF/XML documents that can be harvested and used by user agents and 
intermediary services so that readers can more easily cross-reference 
related information sources.

I suspect the Annotea vocabulary would be adequate for most or all of this
use case, but haven't yet tried to write it out in full RDF/XML. I wanted to
archive the use case now, to revisit later. Extra points for anyone who
gets there first...

cheers,

Dan
