The use cases themselves would be great! Wouldn't mind that button
either right enough, but the use cases themselves would be great for

I have a handful of use cases - are you looking for that, or for
soething that gnerates a use case when you ress a button? (Actually you
have to prod me into writing mine if you need to see them - otherwise
they tend to come out slowly...)

cheers
