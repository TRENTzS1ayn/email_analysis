Yes, my apologies also. The new server addresses this bug. It was
related to the content-type. The CGI.pm that comes with perl
interprets all data as script parameters ala
  GET /script?parm1=val1&parm2=val2 HTTP/1.1
or POST /script
content-length: 24
content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

parm1=val1
parm2=val2

However, we're using it on some data that is not urlencoded:
POST /script HTTP/1.1
content-type: application/xml

<?xml...
...>

I wrote a wrapper that figures out when to let CGI.pm see the body
(former case) when when not to (latter, non url-encoded data). In the
currently deployed server, it looks for a content-type ==
"application/xml". The server we are preparing to deploy expects
"application/xml" optionally followed by charsets and other rifraff.

We should have this server deployed in another (guessing here) couple
weeks.
