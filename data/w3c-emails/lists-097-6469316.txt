Are you suggesting that people not implement the RDF Core specs until 
they get to REC? :(

The more implementation feedback we get the better. Don't wait til it's a 
REC before figuring out whether it works for you...

Annotea being a "Live Early Adoption and Demonstration" project would 
suggest early implementation of RDF Core WDs is very appropriate for 
the project. 

"We were too busy doing other stuff to get to it yet, give us a while!", by 
contrast, would have been a fine response...
