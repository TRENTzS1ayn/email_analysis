Not suggesting anything, we just have a very limited amount of resources 
and need to select what we do. Something that already is a spec. we have 
less choice than something that isn't. But as you know English is my second 
language and reading between the lines is hard anyway.

And that's what I was trying to say as we are examining it right now and I 
did tell that. But cannot promise anything until we know a bit more of what 
is needed.
