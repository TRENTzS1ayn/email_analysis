While debugging new Annotea server code, Eric Prud'hommeaux
and I noticed that Amaya did not exactly conform to the
Annotea protocol for updating an Annotation or a Reply.

Per the examples in

 2.4 Updating an annotation
 http://www.w3.org/2001/Annotea/User/Protocol.html#Updating

and

 3.4 Updating a reply
 http://www.w3.org/2001/Annotea/User/Protocol.html#UpdateR

an Annotea client is expected to not use bnodes in the PUT
message body when referring to the existing Annotation or
Reply or their bodies.  Amaya was failing to include these
URIs in the PUT body.  The Annotation or Reply URI is the
PUT URI but it should still be given explicitly in the
contained RDF.  The server might be able to deduce a
body URI from this, but should not be relied upon to do so.

I have updated the Amaya CVS sources with a fix to this, so
that Amaya will not use bnodes when updating an Annotation
or a Reply.  For backwards compatibility with older clients,
server developers might want to consider doing what the
current annotest server does, which is to deduce the URI
from available information when the client does not
specify it.
