Not sure if the Joseki stuff has been circulated here. It is a Java-based 
service built on Jena, and offers a Web data interface to RDF stores. I was 
wondering how it compares to the annotation-centric Annotea protocol, at least 
w.r.t. lookups (ie. ignoring updates / PUT aspects), but haven't yet found 
time to do a detailed comparison.

See http://www.joseki.org/protocol.html for details.
compare: http://www.w3.org/2001/Annotea/User/Protocol.html for Annotea protocol.

thought experiment: could we have all the read-only functionality of Annotea 
from Joseki, ie. is there anything peculiar to Annotations that means we need
a separate protocol for asking a service about annotations, vs. just using 
generic RDF query/lookup interfaces?

One way of testing this would be to try to implement an Annotea server which
was built by encapsulating a Joseki server...

Thinking out loud,

Dan
