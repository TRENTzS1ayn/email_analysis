Hi,

Today I suddenly got interested in sharing coomesnts with others about a web page I didn't like.
I kind of thought there might be plug-ins already incoprporated in IE, but seems not. So I searched
the web, and boy did I get dissapointed.

Is there any at all?

I went through this mailing list from 99 and later, every single project is discontinued, at least
the ones I am intereseted in. Specifically, the ones that were running for customer opinion
without interference from the web page owners do not exist anymore.

the ones I checked: what has happened to them?

Yawas has changed scope from annotation with others to highlight fow own use instead of bookmark ( I believe)

annotea client for IE (left as alpha)

anonzilla (not for IE)

I found one that seemed really promising but I couldnt see whereto download 
http://www.ncb.ernet.in/groups/dake/annotate/index.shtml (its on a very slow server too, from here)

the ones that still are working: they dontseem to do what I want:they are more Content management systems with annotation possibility at the web server, while im after distibuted, or external annotation server facility, for customer opinions.

pageseeder (weborganic.com) 
richlink (sentius.com)
IPP
annotea/amaya

So please tell me, is there anywhere I can get hold of what Im seeking? ssharing comments about arbitrary web pages at the page in my web browser but on a different server than the one hosting the web page in question?
