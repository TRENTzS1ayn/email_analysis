Yes, Yawas was primarily designed to let you create personal highlights.
Your annotations are stored on your local file system in yawas_database.txt

However, there is a "Yawas:Export" option that you can use to share your highlights.
It creates an encoded string that includes the url of the web page and the words you hihlighted in this web page.

You can insert this string into any email message for example.
The recipients "simply" need to copy this string into the clipboard
and choose "Yawas:Import" from the context menu in Internet Explorer.
This will show them your highlights. It will also store these highlights into their local file called "yawas_import.txt"

You can get the latest version of Yawas from:

  Hi,

  Today I suddenly got interested in sharing coomesnts with others about a web page I didn't like.
  I kind of thought there might be plug-ins already incoprporated in IE, but seems not. So I searched
  the web, and boy did I get dissapointed.

  Is there any at all?

  I went through this mailing list from 99 and later, every single project is discontinued, at least
  the ones I am intereseted in. Specifically, the ones that were running for customer opinion
  without interference from the web page owners do not exist anymore.

  the ones I checked: what has happened to them?

  http://www.thirdvoice.com

  http://www.e-quill.com (this one is bought up by microsoft, where did it go after?)

  Yawas has changed scope from annotation with others to highlight fow own use instead of bookmark ( I believe)

  annotea client for IE (left as alpha)

  anonzilla (not for IE)

  I found one that seemed really promising but I couldnt see whereto download 
  http://www.ncb.ernet.in/groups/dake/annotate/index.shtml (its on a very slow server too, from here)

  the ones that still are working: they dontseem to do what I want:they are more Content management systems with annotation possibility at the web server, while im after distibuted, or external annotation server facility, for customer opinions.

  pageseeder (weborganic.com) 
  richlink (sentius.com)
  IPP
  annotea/amaya

  So please tell me, is there anywhere I can get hold of what Im seeking? ssharing comments about arbitrary web pages at the page in my web browser but on a different server than the one hosting the web page in question?
