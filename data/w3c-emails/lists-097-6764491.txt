Dear all,

I just written an XSL stylesheet that tries to attach icons and
links for annotations to a XHTML document.  There are a number
of problems still, not least the fact that my stylesheet does not always 
produce valid HTML (and it may be that because of this, this task is 
doomed to ulitimate failure) but it seems to work well enough for it to be of
some immediate uses, and it may well be of interest to others here.

The stylesheet is at http://www.mat.bham.ac.uk/R.W.Kaye/annotation2xsl.xsl
You'll probably want to download http://www.mat.bham.ac.uk/R.W.Kaye/pencil.png
too.  There are instructions in the code itself.

Currently, to use it, download the rdf containing the annotation(s)
from the annotation server and also download the actual document itself 
from the web using wget or whatever.  Then run XSLT twice:
1. annotation2xsl.xsl on the rdf doc to produce a second xsl stylesheet
2. the new stylesheet is the one that transforms the actual document.

There are various configuration variables you will need to set to your taste,
and you may want to set up all of the above in a nice command line script
or cgi script or something.

Comments welcome. 

Best wishes

Richard Kaye
