There are tools that allow you to post annotations in different forms than
the ontology that Amaya uses.

I don't know how Amaya determines which ontology it presents in the user
interface.

Annotea servers can (but don't have to, as I understand the protocol)
restrict the ontologies of annotations they accept - for example there is a
server taht only accepts annotations which are in the form of EARL
assertions...
