Hello,

I'm looking for user studies of annotation systems,
mainly systems meant to allow public annotations a la ThirdVoice when it was still there.
(My own work focused on personal annotations only, with a small support for sharing among a close
community).

I'm looking for research papers mainly, but if you want to share your own experience, it's good too.

Thanks for your help,
Laurent.
