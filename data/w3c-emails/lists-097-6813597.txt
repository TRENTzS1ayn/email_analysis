Laurent -- We did a number of studies of shared annotation usage with
our early MRAS system and the later CAF system. I believe you can find
all of the papers on my homepage
(http://www.research.microsoft.com/~davemb). Grudin and LeeTiernan also
did a study of the MRAS system which was published at INTERACT (in 2000,
I believe).

I don't know of any studies of commercial systems such as ThirdVoice,
eQuill, etc...let me know if you find any.

Dave

Subject: user studies of annotation systems?


Hello,

I'm looking for user studies of annotation systems,
mainly systems meant to allow public annotations a la ThirdVoice when it
was still there.
(My own work focused on personal annotations only, with a small support
for sharing among a close
community).

I'm looking for research papers mainly, but if you want to share your
own experience, it's good too.

Thanks for your help,
Laurent.
