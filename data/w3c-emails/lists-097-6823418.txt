Hello Laurent,

I am using PDF documents for the carrying out my user studies targeted at
finding out the kinds of markings that people make on e-documents and the
navigational activities that are undertaken during this interaction. I
intend to publish later this year but let me know if you are interested in
my findings and I could forward you some preliminary data analysis from my
pilot study.

Regards,

Asim.
