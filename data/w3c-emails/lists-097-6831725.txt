Annotea team is happy to announce that the latest Amaya 8.1a Linux version 
has a partial implementation of shared bookmarks.

Annotea shared bookmarks are used to mark and classify Web documents into 
categories or topics so that they are easy to find later. They use the same 
underlying architecture as Annotea annotations and define an RDF schema for 
bookmarks and topics. This schema is explained in Annotea Bookmark Schema 
document (http://www.w3.org/2001/Annotea/User/BookmarkSchema).

Use of an RDF model permits multiple classification systems to be related 
to each other; for example, users's informal bookmark folders could be 
associated with formal ontologies via additional RDF properties.

The Annotea infrastructure makes it simple to add other RDF properties to 
bookmarks, share individual bookmarks with other users, share individual 
bookmarks between browsers, and query bookmark data in new ways not 
supported by current bookmark systems. As bookmarks are RDF metadata it is 
also easy to define semantic relationships that permit tools to interpret 
other data, such as RSS newsfeeds to be presented as Annotea shared bookmarks.

In the current Amaya version, the bookmarks are still stored locally. We'll 
have more info about shared bookmark protocols, Annotea bookmark server and 
more sharing in after the summer break.
