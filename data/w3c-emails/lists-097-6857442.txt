I believe my first response was assuming you were having the problem
with our annotest.w3.org. If you are installing this on your systme, I
need to know a little about the system.
Is it a standard apache install?
Does /etc/apache exist? /etc/apache/conf?  /etc/apache/conf/users*?
Note: on some systems, /etc/apache/conf is symlinked to ..
Does `dbmmanage /tmp/users add username password` create such a file?
What dbm format is it using [1] ?
