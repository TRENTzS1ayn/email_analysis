Eric,
Thanks for you answer,  I've moved forward. But before discussing further
about that here is my configuration:

I use Debian Linux V3.0r1 (Woody) with standard apache, mysql and perl
installation. /etc/ exists, /etc/apache exist.
On Debian by default  /etc/apache/conf is symlinked to /etc/apache, but I
removed this link and created the conf directory and copied the
corresponding files into conf

 "dbmmanage /tmp/users add username password" works. That is how I created
/etc/apache/users (linked to /etc/apache/conf/users).

The following
 W3C/Database/bin/ddb ifd=/tmp/users idelim=: odelim=:
returns:
username:password
So that makes me believe that the authentication method is dbm.

So I changed:
auth.database.parms: -type => 'ndbm', -file => '/etc/apache/conf/users'
by:
auth.database.parms: -type => 'dbm', -file => '/etc/apache/conf/users'
in annotate.prop and Annotations.access.prop

Now I misunderstood that annotate.prop and Annotations.access.prop should be
located in modules/Conf. Instead I put it in the /etc/apache/conf directory.
Sorry !

I don't have the Access to "/etc/apache/conf/users" failed. No such file or
directory" Error anymore, instead I have:

<pre>failed to execute $self->{USER_RECORDS} = new
W3C::Annotations::DBMUserRecords(-errorHandler =>
$self, -type=>'dbm', -file=> /etc/apache/users);:

Any idea ?

Thanks,

I believe my first response was assuming you were having the problem
with our annotest.w3.org. If you are installing this on your systme, I
need to know a little about the system.
Is it a standard apache install?
Does /etc/apache exist? /etc/apache/conf?  /etc/apache/conf/users*?
Note: on some systems, /etc/apache/conf is symlinked to ..
Does `dbmmanage /tmp/users add username password` create such a file?
What dbm format is it using [1] ?
