Hi,
 
I've been trying to install my own annotation server. With your help, I though I made it to work:  using http://localhost/access , I was able to register myself with my implementation of annotea. I noticed new entries in /etc/apache/conf/users, groups and "pending".
 
Now when I use amaya 8.1, and configure it to use http://localhost/annotations , everything seems to be working fine until I post my annnoations. Amaya connects to my instance of annotea (I can see it in the logs), but then I got a "Authentication Dialogue" windows poping up asking me for user and and password for the realm **su**.
 
Looking into the code, it seems that the annotea "fails over" to the realm su when the W3C_RDF realm "doesn't work". The annotea server logs does not show anything special even with apache logs switched to "debug"
 
my config files (Annotations.access.prop and annotate.prop) are as follow:
auth.database.parms: -type => 'db', -file => '/etc/apache/conf/users'

Annotations.access.prop seems to be configured properly as http://localhost/access works great. So what I don't understand is that the same parameters does not seem to work for annotates.prop.
 
Any idea what I did wrong ?
 
Also, where do I tell the  annotea server the location of the "groups" database (/etc/apache/conf/groups).
 
 
Thanks,
 
Bruno
