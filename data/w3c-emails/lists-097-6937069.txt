Hi again,

Some trial + error revealed that this happens because I use plain html as
body -- not xhtml.
By adding "xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'" to the html tag -- in my
inline body -- things went well.

Is this mandatory? Maybe I have misread the document
(http://www.w3.org/2002/12/AnnoteaProtocol-20021219) but it sounds to me as
this is just an option (mentioned in section 2.1.2).

Regards,
Claus Ljunggren
