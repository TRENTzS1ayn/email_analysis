The mailing list search [1] results are now available in triple
languages.  The accet header tells it how to render the results. The
following accept headers are defined:
  application/rdf+xml
  application/n3
  application/soap+xml

You can try this with the GET script that comes with perl's LWP CPAN
module:
  GET -H Accept:\ application/rdf+xml http://www.w3.org/Search/Mail/Public/search?keywords=hommeaux

You can use the form [1] to generate the above URLs in a conventional
browser and then script it as above.  You may also want to try it with
the advanced_search script [2]. You will simply get longer URLs.

The SOAP serialization is interesting as it uses SOAP for some of the
transaction information and keeps the queried data in RDF in a SOAP
Body:
GET -H Accept:\ application/soap+xml http://www.w3.org/Search/Mail/Public/search?keywords=hommeaux

Perhaps Philippe has written some WSDL for this but I can't remember.
