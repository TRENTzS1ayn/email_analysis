Eric,

I don't think the /n3 vs /vnd.w3c.n3 issue is a big deal.  I just thought 
using the vnd tree might make registration easier if there isn't a stable 
specification to point at.

Hmmm... let's check:
[[
2.1.1.  IETF Tree

    The IETF tree is intended for types of general interest to the
    Internet Community. Registration in the IETF tree requires approval
    by the IESG and publication of the media type registration as some
    form of RFC.
]]
-- http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2048.txt

and:
[[
2.1.2.  Vendor Tree

    The vendor tree is used for media types associated with commercially
    available products.  "Vendor" or "producer" are construed as
    equivalent and very broadly in this context.

    A registration may be placed in the vendor tree by anyone who has
    need to interchange files associated with the particular product.
    However, the registration formally belongs to the vendor or
    organization producing the software or file format.  Changes to the
    specification will be made at their request, as discussed in
    subsequent sections.

    Registrations in the vendor tree will be distinguished by the leading
    facet "vnd.".  That may be followed, at the discretion of the
    registration, by either a media type name from a well-known producer
    (e.g., "vnd.mudpie") or by an IANA-approved designation of the
    producer's name which is then followed by a media type or product
    designation (e.g., vnd.bigcompany.funnypictures).

    While public exposure and review of media types to be registered in
    the vendor tree is not required, using the ietf-types list for review
    is strongly encouraged to improve the quality of those
    specifications. Registrations in the vendor tree may be submitted
    directly to the IANA.
]]
-- ibid.

So unless you're requesting publication of the registration (not the 
specification) as an RFC, the vnd tree may be easier.  In this context, I 
guess w3c would count as a "producer".

Here's another thing to contemplate:
[[
2.1.5.  Additional Registration Trees

    From time to time and as required by the community, the IANA may,
    with the advice and consent of the IESG, create new top-level
    registration trees.  It is explicitly assumed that these trees may be
    created for external registration and management by well-known
    permanent bodies, such as scientific societies for media types
    specific to the sciences they cover.  In general, the quality of
    review of specifications for one of these additional registration
    trees is expected to be equivalent to that which IETF would give to
    registrations in its own tree. Establishment of these new trees will
    be announced through RFC publication approved by the IESG.
]]
-- ibid.

A W3C tree, anyone?   (e.g. application/w3c.n3)

...

(BTW, I forgot to say, great work on the search results!  Now, how to use 
them?)
