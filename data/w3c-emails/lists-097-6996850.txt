Tim, were you intending to go the RFC route with n3?

tx!

I'm finishing up the implementation of a query language that I will
use as a query interface to the script. This way you can use
predicates to indicate the search parameters instead of CGI
parameters. Of course, the whole search string will be burried in a
CGI parm, but at least you can express arbitrary search criteria
that may not be expressible in the expert query mode. I hope this
shift of burden to the query mechanism doens't hurt too much. We'll
see.

By way of documentation, I can point you at a fairly complex search
example [1] and the grammar [2] and code [3,4] that parse it. I have
a few nits in the grammar to work out (looking for help) and need to
test a federated query scenario before I'll be ready to add support
for algae2 to the search script.
