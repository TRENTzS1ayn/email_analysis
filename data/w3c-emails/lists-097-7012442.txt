Hi Everyone,

I'm trying to get annotea running, but perl can't locate NDBM_File.pm.

It seems that, according to CPAN, this module is supposed to be in 
perl-5.8.0, but I can't find it in the RedHat 9 perl RPMs.

Has anyone been through the installation of annotea on RedHat 9 and
dealt with their (seemingly) modified perl 5.8.0 distribution?

I apologize for the somewhat off topic nature of the post, I was
hoping to reach someone who'd had exactly this problem. :)

Regards,
Richard
