If you are interested in Annotea, you can find basic information at
http://www.w3.org/2001/Annotea/

and about Annotea papers, presentations, protocols, schemas etc. at
http://www.w3.org/2001/Annotea/User/Papers.html

www10 Annotea paper is still a good starting point
http://www.w3.org/2001/Annotea/Papers/www10/annotea-www10.html

some information about shared bookmarks can be found at the schema doc
http://www.w3.org/2003/07/Annotea/BookmarkSchema-20030707

Siegfried Handschuh and Stefan Staab have also edited a book describing 
several Semantic Web related annotation systems.

96 Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications, 2003, 240 pp.
