Since September 2002, Amaya (version 6.3) has been able to read Annotea 
annotations that use either the Dublin Core 1.0 or the Dublin Core version 
1.1 namespace.

This is a notice to all developers that we plan to change Amaya to use the 
Dublin Core version 1.1 namespace (instead of DC 1.0) also when creating 
annotations. The change is expected to occur with the next Amaya release, 
which should give ample time for applications still expecting only DC 1.0 
annotations to prepare to support both namespaces.
