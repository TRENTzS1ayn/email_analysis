Hi there,

As I have started to use a private instance of annotea as a basis for an
internal project, I have several questions/comments:
- has it been foreseen to post more than one annotation in one POST
request? From what I've seen the current W3C Annotea implementation
doesn't support this, nor does the protocol [1] seems to allow it (while
it doesn't explicitely say so)
- from what I've seen, the W3C Team private instance of annotea doesn't
reply with a 201 code as required by the protocol on the creation of a
new annotation:
cat annotation-test.rdf |POST -Sse -C dom:XXXXX -c application/xml -H
"Content-Length:567" http://xxx.w3.org/annotations 
replies with:
POST http://xxx.w3.org/annotations --> 401 Authorization Required
POST http://xxx.w3.org/annotations --> 200 OK
Further more, the response is a text/html document, note an RDF one (but
maybe the private instance of annotea is outdated?).
- the Annotea protocol would benefit from using RFC Keywords, I believe
(the should/may words are used, but it's not clear if it is in that
meaning; other assertions are made in affirmative style, and it's then
unclear what level of requirement they impose).
- is there any reason why this is not published as a Team submission?
The annotea system really deserves as much visibility as possible, I
think :)
