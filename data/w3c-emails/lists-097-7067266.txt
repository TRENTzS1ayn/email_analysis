That has been discussed. This requires some discussion about how amaya
associates annotations with POSTed data. annotate does not currently
support it, but it souldn't be hard to change.

You need to test the latest version which is, um, 30 seconds old.
Fixed.

you mean: "the Annotea protocol SHOULD use RFC Keywords".
makes sense to me.

I think it's been mentioned in late night drunken mutterings but
nothing more concrete than that. I'll bring that up, too.
