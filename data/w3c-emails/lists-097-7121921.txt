Eric,

I heard a rumour this might be applicable to spam tagging. In fact I
remember volunteering to follow up your post to this thread pretending 
the idea was mine all mine. Sadly that was some time ago, before the 
last spamstorm trashed our lists, and I no longer quite recal what we 
were thinking of in that space.

Perhaps something along lines of doing RDF / fulltext searches here 
and taking the results and human-checking or spamassasin checking and 
then feeding an Annotea server with claims about msgs that appear to be
spamlike...?

Or did I/you/we/they have something else in mind? 

cheers,

memoryboy
