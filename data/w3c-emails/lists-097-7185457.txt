Hi,

You can have a log of all the transactions if you open your
~/.amaya/thot.rc file and add LIBWWW_DEBUG=99

Amaya will then generate a log of all of its http transactions in
a file called w3chttp.log in the directory where you launched amaya.

If this doesn't help you, and if you open up a port and (annotation) 
acocunt on that server, I can do an Amaya debug session and 
tell you what is wrong.
