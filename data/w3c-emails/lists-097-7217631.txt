Interesting :)

I've started looking at J2ME (MIDP 1.0 specifically) now I have a phone
(Sony Ericcsson's P800) that let's me code in Java for it. Haven't got
very far yet, but a few notes on it are at http://rdfweb.org/topic/FoafMobile
(hmm that's mostly Symbian stuff so far). It is a wiki page (feel free
to edit, in other words), and has brief section on 
"XML and RDF parsing on J2ME, Symbian etc" including pointers to:

http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=172
http://wireless.java.sun.com/midp/articles/parsingxml/
http://sesame.aidministrator.nl/
http://sourceforge.net/projects/sesame/
http://www.hpl.hp.com/semweb/

One goal I expect we share is finding an RDF parser that runs in a
J2ME/MIDP environment. Most Java RDF parsers themselves use a separate
XML parser, so I'm currently stuck at the subgoal of finding a SAX2 Java
parser that works in MIDP. My best bet re RDF parser is the Rio parser
shipping with Sesame, although Jena's ARP may be a possibility too.

I'm curious why you've chosen J2ME rather than generic Java (J2SE I
guess). Do you have mobile, geo-coding etc apps in mind? An interesting
research / scoping question is to find out where the utility of
Annotea-style Annotations end, and other RDF approaches should be used
instead. For example, considering Restaurant reviews, you could use
Annotea vocab to annotate the homepage of a restaurant. Or you could use 
plain RDF/XML to just describe the restaurant itself. See 
http://esw.w3.org/topic/RestaurantRecommendation for more notes and
datasources on this front, if it's an app area that fits your goals. Or 
http://esw.w3.org/topic/RestaurantsVersusTheirReviews for more notes on 
modeling styles, 'doc centric' vs 'world centric' (Annotea being largely
the former I think).

Hope this helps! Do keep www-annotation posted on your progress,

cheers,

Dan
