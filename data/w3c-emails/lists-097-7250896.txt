I haven't been working on it for quite a long time now, but I simple
servlet/bookmarklet based annotea client is included in WYMIWYG-mies.
The application is based on jena 1 and j2se 1.3.1. See
http://wymiwyg.org/mies.

cheers, reto

| The primary reason for trying this in J2ME is that our instructor wants

| brief research), had open source implementations for ideas, and was
| widely interactive.  Additionally, it had a server system already
| created which removes that burden.
