sure enough, it couldn't connect to the DB.
i tweaked the my.conf to comment out skip-networing and did
/etc/init.d/mysql reload. no joy. i did /etc/init.d/mysql stop
and /etc/init.d/mysql start and it worked. confused by why i
needed to allow network access, i uncommented skip-networking
and did the stop start dance. that worked. i untar'ed the
conf file that i had backed up before playin with it, did the
stop start dance, and it worked.

so, it works. i can't explain why it didn't work.
