Hi,

I've just finalized an online Annotea client, based on XSLT:
http://www.w3.org/2003/12/annotea-show
It allows to visualize 
* the list of  all the annotations made on the page in a retractable
list
* the annotation icon (Annotation icon) in context for the
well-identified locations (e.g., near an element with an id attribute)
See an example with the target page http://www.w3.org/ and a target
server http://annotest.w3.org/annotations:
http://www.w3.org/2000/06/webdata/xslt?xslfile=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2003%2F12%2Fannotea-proxy&xmlfile=http%3A%2F%2Fcgi.w3.org%2Fcgi-bin%2Ftidy-if%3FdocAddr%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.w3.org%252F&annoteaServer=http%3A%2F%2Fannotest.w3.org%2Fannotations&

It only works with HTML as of today.

Beside being a useful tool to server for instance as a proxy for
non-annotea aware browers, it also shows the power of integrations of
various Web-technologies:
- Annotea (obviously) and its powerful HTTP GET interface
- XSLT (for making the requests and formatting the new page)
- CSS (for the overlapping formatting)
- JavaScript (for retractable list)

Comments and suggestions are welcome (but note that I'm not subscribed
to this list).
