Hello again,
As promised, I want to give you ALL the info you'll want to make an intelligent decision about our program. Just because it's NOTHING to enroll, doesn't make it right for everyone or mean that you should enroll.
IT'S GOT TO MAKE SENSE AND BE FINANCIALLY SOUND IF YOU'LL EVER PRODUCE LONG TERM RESIDUAL INCOME!

Free Store Club is a subsidiary of Signed and Numbered International, Inc. (SNII), a US (NC) company. SNII was chartered in June of 1997 and adopted the dba Lighthouse America later that year.

Lighthouse America operated two divisions, LHAStore and TeamFire International, prior to the formation of the Free Store Club. Since that time, LHAStore has been merged into FreeStoreClub. TeamFire is a product driven, independent entity under the SNII umbrella. 

The President and CEO of SNII, Paul Burks, is currently the hands-on owner/manager of FreeStoreClub. 

Senior Vice President Chris Worley joined SNII in 2000. His extensive background in corporate America was key in the development of many of the Exact Method Marketing processes. 

The company fully occupies a free-standing 7,000 square foot office / warehouse / shipping complex at 500 East Center Street, Lexington, NC 27292. Lexington is a small community on the bustling I-85 corridor between Greensboro and Charlotte, NC. 

OK, so why is it ZERO TO START?
This is WHY WE ARE NOT a traditional networking Co...... 
And this is probably the singular MOST IMPORTANT distinction that needs to be made by ANYONE considering the FreeStoreClub opportunity. Be sure that you are absolutely clear on this. 

"MARKETING PLAN" DOES NOT MEAN "PAY PLAN"! 

There is absolutely zero wrong with the multiple level, duplicating downline PAY PLANS used by most NM companies! They represent the most powerful concept for wealth building EVER CREATED! The problem with NM is NOT the pay plan. The problem is the MARKETING plan. 

You see, the PAY PLAN cannot PAY if the MARKETING PLAN fails to create the duplication that fuels it. If you could join a company, immediately sponsor 2 people who then sponsored 4, who then sponsored 8, who sponsored 16, etc., with each of those people making monthly sales quotas, you'd become VERY rich VERY fast! That kind of duplication is the job of the MARKETING PLAN. 

That's where Network Marketing (ML) breaks down. 

"Networking," in the traditional sense, involves SELLING and selling requires a highly developed set of skills. There are hundreds, maybe thousands of books that teach selling techniques. Read ANY of them and you quickly see that the sales process is a battle of wills. It pits the SALESPERSON'S crafting and delivery of a persuasive presentation and closing sequence against the PROSPECT'S natural resistance to being SOLD! 

If SELLING was easy then there would be no NEED for those thousands of books about how to do it. It takes longer to become a master at the art of selling than it does to become a medical doctor or an engineer! 

SO...NO MORE SELLING...IT SIMPLY DOESN'T WORK!

LEARN MORE, there's zero expense or obligation now or ever!

It simply makes sense!
