I smacked the server upside the head. It works now.

Whether "no annotations found" is a 404 has been a long standing issue.
A stronger case could be made for "no annotations found 'cause the db
isnt abswering." The hope was that people could play with the server
even if it wasn't talking to a database. Perhaps they could "play with"
it even if they got error messages back? thinking...
