[Please accept my apologies if this has already been discussed; I did 
not find it in the list archives.]

I have been looking at the Annotea protocol, and it seems that one HTTP 
GET request must be issued to retrieve each annotation body.  If a 
client wants to retrieve the list of annotations for a page as well as 
all of the associated bodies, it can't do so very efficiently.  Or did I 
miss something in the spec?

Are people open to extending the protocol to allow this kind of query? 
If so, I'd be happy to experiment a bit and propose something concrete.
