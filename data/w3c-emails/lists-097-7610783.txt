Thanks for your reply -- and good point.  I admit I was thinking of what 
I, in my admittedly limited experience, believe will be a common 
scenario: text annotation bodies of relatively short length that are 
stored (or cached) by the same server that holds the annotation 
metadata.  You are right that many other scenarios are valid as well. 
But I'd like to see an option to return the bodies if the server has them.
