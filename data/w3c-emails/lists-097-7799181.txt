Call for papers

 4rd International Workshop on Knowledge Markup and Semantic Annotation
(SemAnnot 2004)
 http://km.aifb.uni-karlsruhe.de/ws/semannot2004

 Workshop at the  3rd International Semantic Web Conference 
 (ISWC 2004)
 
 8 November 2004

 Hiroshima Prince Hotel, Hiroshima, Japan

*** OBJECTIVES ***

While a lot of basic infrastructure exists now for the Semantic Web (OWL, 
Editors, Inference-Engines), the lack of semantic metadata is still a major 
hurdle for the broad success of the Semantic Web. To overcome this obstacle, 
one needs methods that facilitate and accelerate the creation of metadata on 
a mass scale. Hence, this address the issue of upgrading the actual Web to 
the Semantic Web by means of (automated) semantic annotation strategies.

Another issue is the semantic indexing and searching of multimedia (and 
multilingual) data. It is difficult to process completely the content of 
multimedia data, even with technologies based on natural language processing, 
image processing, machine vision and speech recognition. Therefore, semantic 
annotation as a means of supplementing automatic multimedia processing is one 
of the promising methodologies to to describe content semantically.

*** TOPICS OF INTEREST ***

Topics of interest include but are not limited to:
* General description of semantic annotation
* Tools/strategies for upgrading the current Web to the Semantic Web
* A common semantic annotation strategy for upgrading the web to the Semantic 
Web (including multimedia content)
* NLP tools/strategies for semantic annotation of the current Web
* Multimedia tools/strategies for semantic annotation of the current Web
* Semantic annotation of static vs. dynamic web documents
* Manual vs. automated annotation. Can automation be effectively deployed?
* Statistical vs. rule-based semantic annotation strategies
* Manual and/or automated semantic annotation of the current Web
* Multimedia annotation (e.g. by using MPEG-7)
* Collaborative, shared annotation
