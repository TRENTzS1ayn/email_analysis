**********************************
Last Call for papers
Knowledge Discovery and Ontologies (KDO-2004)
Workshop at ECML/PKDD 2004, Pisa, Italy, September 20-24, 2004.
http://olp.dfki.de/pkdd04/cfp.htm
**********************************

!! Paper submission deadline: June 14th, 2004 !!

-------
The workshop is supported by KDnet, Daimler Chrysler, and the SEKT project.

*** Topic and Motivation

The workshop is concerned with the interaction between prior knowledge as
encoded in ontologies and derived knowledge as obtained by a knowledge
discovery process.
The use of prior knowledge may significantly enhance knowledge discovery
from large datasets or text collections. Currently, in most KDD projects,
prior knowledge is only present implicitly (in the head of the human
analyst) or in the form of textual documentation. Even in
knowledge-intensive approaches such as ILP, the background knowledge is
often not organized around a well-formed conceptual model. This practice
seems to ignore latest developments in knowledge engineering, where domain
knowledge is typically defined by formal ontologies.
Ontologies are formal, explicit specifications of shared conceptualizations
of a given domain of discourse. The expected central role of ontologies in
the organization and functioning of the Semantic Web has been well
documented in recent years. Somewhat less traditional is the role of
ontologies in incremental approaches to knowledge discovery, in which
ontologies and machine learning methods are used in combination to mine,
interpret and (re-)organise knowledge.
While knowledge engineering research has already recognised the value of
knowledge discovery from textual and semi-structured resources in the
process of building an ontology (i.e. in ontology learning), links in the
opposite direction are more rare. Within the context of this workshop we
intend to bring together researchers from both directions in order to
initiate a discussion on how to integrate insights from both communities.


*** Areas of Interest

Submissions are invited on all aspects of the interaction between Knowledge
Discovery (KDD) and Ontologies (Onto):

*  Onto4KDD
- domain ontologies for extending source data and/or to constrain the
search for hypotheses
- ontologies of the knowledge discovery domain to recommend and/or
configure methods or tools for a given problem

*  KDD4Onto
- knowledge discovery (from databases, semi-structured data, text,
multimedia) in ontology learning (extension/evolution) and/or ontology
mapping (merging/integration)

*  Onto4KDD & KDD4Onto
- combinations of knowledge discovery and ontologies to cover the full
knowledge life cycle, i.e. the use of ontologies in incremental knowledge
discovery experiments (based on previous results)

*  Usability & Evaluation
- practical applications in industry of (the interaction of) knowledge
discovery and ontologies
- evaluation methodologies for (the interaction of) knowledge discovery and
ontologies


*** Workshop Schedule

The workshop will consist of three to four thematic sessions of (long and
short) presentations, each followed by a wrap-up discussion moderated by a
PC member, and one or two invited talks.

In addition to the workshop proceedings it is intended to publish a
selection of accepted papers in a Springer volume of the 'Hot Topics'
series, partly supported by KDNet.
