Hi Scott,

I spent today hacking with saCASH. Great fun!

A while back, I wrote:

[[[
php version of quicken; integration with online services.

@@cbb, gnucash, ...
]]]

-- http://www.w3.org/2000/08/palm56/exp.html

and saCASH is a good match for what I wanted.

I did some hacking today... XHTML-izing the output,
working on concurrency stuff, etc. Nothing cleaned
up yet, but I'd sure like to have CVS access.

What news on this?

     coming soon
