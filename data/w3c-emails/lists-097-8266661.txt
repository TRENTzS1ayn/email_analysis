The fact that you broke links [1] to your specifications [2] means that 
there are now copies of the dsig spec that normatively reference ... 
nothing. Plus, I'm having difficulties finding these specs again for the 
next version. I've already wasted 15 minutes looking for FIPS PUB 186-1. 
Where did it go, did it get moved in the "redesign" (like [3]) or has it 
been deprecated (don't see it in [4]) and how do I find out without having 
to send an email?

We just reorganized out website to make it better.
Do you really feel that the old URIs cannot be kept running? If so, you 
chose them very badly. Think of your new ones so that you will be able to 
keep then running after the next redesign.
