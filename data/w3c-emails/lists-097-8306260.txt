Mozilla should probably be using application/rdf+xml since that's what we're
planning to propose to the IETF and that's what was reserved in the XML
Media Types RFC. If you file a bug, I'd prefer if you ask them to switch,
rather than remove, since I expect it to become a media type real soon... In
fact, I think I'll send an email to RDF IG right now.
