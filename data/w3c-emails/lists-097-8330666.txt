The use of CDATA for %LinkTypes; was only an oversight, in that had the
original designer thought to use NMTOKENS, this would have been more
appropriate in the DTD. The design in the HTML 4 specification of link 
types is a list of tokens, not a list of URIs, so XHTML is merely a 
correction in this sense. You can find in the HTML 4 specification that
the intention is explicitly tokens:

  http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/types.html#type-links

And can *I* fix it? Heh. I alone can do little. XHTML is merely (as much
as is possible) a transformation of HTML into XML. We tried very hard (or
at least I did) to not reinvent HTML in the process. If markup abuse has
been happening (ie., people not using HTML according to the specification),
this is certainly nothing new. HTML is a bit of an Eve in this respect (no
relation to Eve Maler intended).
