This isn't to say that a facility for specifying such information via
URL wouldn't be interesting or valuable. I hope to begin work on the
Dublin Core-in-XHTML project in the next week if possible (this week
is entirely tied up). This would be one possible way to approach this
problem, but whatever approach it will be a new invention and I 
believe it should be thought through carefully, not an overloading
of existing syntax. In this way, software expectations will not be
confused and there will be an explicit functionality assumed from
the new syntax.
