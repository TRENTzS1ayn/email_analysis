dublin core
-----------

 - 15 elements
 - decentralised community extension
 - usage board endorsement ('ratification') of extensions
 - multilingual RDF schema annotations of DC (and related) property/class  definitions
   (use case: 'find me the french description of dc:title...')
 - history:
old DC RDF spec didn't really use RDF Schema, so instance data
   had to do all the work of expressing extensions/qualifications
current DC RDF qualifier spec makes richer use of RDF, ie.
sub-property, classes etc

  current concerns:
"RDF 'versus' XML"
Being processable as XML and as RDF
perceived syntactic ugliness or overhead of RDF syntax
containers: what does dc:creator(foo,bar) mean if bar is an  rdf:Seq?
        datatyping: people want numbers, dates (creation date of document  etc)

what we like:
- loose common structure is making distributed collaboration  feasible:
RSS 1.0 uses DC without the two groups having to agree a common  DTD
- easy composition: rdf allows data mixing

what we need...: something soon...
