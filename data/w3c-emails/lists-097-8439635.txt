Comments on the RDF Schema proposals. Deleted items are ones I

I don't believe that DAML+OIL can express the constraint.

Proposal: Create a superproperty of all the 
ContainerMembershipProperties.

domain as their parent, but may be overridden with subClasses of 
those.

Hard problem?

Simply remove the stupid restriction.

Strawman: Split it into subproperties: namespace, schema/definition
