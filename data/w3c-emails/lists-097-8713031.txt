Hi all,

A mailing list for the RFD query work may take some time, so in the
meantime this is the cc list written down at the bof, plus a few others
who couldn't make it but expressed an interest.

I've put up notes (basically minutes) from the BOF at

http://ilrt.org/discovery/2001/08/rdfquery-bof/

please get in touch if you think it's wrong or would like to add
something.

There's also a text version

http://ilrt.org/discovery/2001/08/rdfquery-bof/index.txt

and an rdf version

http://ilrt.org/discovery/2001/08/rdfquery-bof/index.rdf

there are also some brief notes at the TMQL list, which you seem to
have to join to look at the archives:

http://groups.yahoo.com/group/tmql-wg

all the best

Libby
