Dan Connolly and I were talking about Web Services and Web 
Architecture on #rdfig today[1] and the issue of XML Protocol 
came up. I had previously asked the Working Group about their 
intentions with regards to preserving the semantics of Web 
Architecture and received no response:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/xml-dist-app/2001Jan/0029.html

Dan Connolly claims to have "asked (indirectly) for a GET (i.e. 
REST) related requirement for the XML Protocol requirements".

I was curious if the Working Group has adopted this as a 
requirement, and if not, why.
