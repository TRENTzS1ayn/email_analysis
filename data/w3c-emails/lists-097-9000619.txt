People I have talked with recently have had trouble finding the "primary
sources/proposals" we are considering. I think they are the following:

1. Stuart's "HTTP Doodle" [1]
2. Noah's reply to the "HTTP Doodle" which includes his glossary
definitions [2]
3. Henrik's proposal [3]
4. The NGH (Noah, Glen, Highland) proposal [4]
