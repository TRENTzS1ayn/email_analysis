I thought that issue 118[2] was resolved, but I actually think that
the spec is lacking some clarification.

The specification says[1]:

   The SOAP root attribute can be used to label serialization roots that
   are not true roots of an object graph so that the object graph can be
   deserialized. The attribute can have one of two values, either "true"
   or "false". True roots of an object graph have the implied attribute
   value of "true". Serialization roots that are not true roots can be
   labeled as serialization roots with an attribute value of "true". An
   element can explicitly be labeled as not being a serialization root
   with a value of "false".
       
   The SOAP root attribute MAY appear on any subelement within the SOAP
   Header and SOAP Body elements. The attribute does not have a default
   value.

I think that something is missing here:

   The type of the root attribute information item is boolean in the
   namespace http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema.

The reason for that is that "true" or "false" are canonical values for
a schema boolean, whereas in the current text, it can be interpreted
as "true" or "false" litterally, i.e. "0" and "1" being not allowed.

I will keep the issue opened until advisement by the editors on this.
