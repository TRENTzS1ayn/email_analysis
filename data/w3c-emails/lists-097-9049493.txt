Indeed, the text says that the value of the root attribute can be
either "true" of "false". Without saying that it's a boolean as
defined by schema, nothing in the text says that it can also be "1" or
"0".

I have no problem with adding a link to the schema too, but I think
it's underspecified right now.

The mustUnderstand attribute is clearly identified as a boolean[1]:

   The mustUnderstand attribute information item has the following Infoset
   properties:
     * A local name of mustUnderstand;
     * A namespace name of http://www.w3.org/2001/06/soap-envelope;
     * A specified property with a value of true.
       
   The type of the mustUnderstand attribute information item is boolean in
   the namespace http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema. Omitting this
   attribute information item is defined as being semantically equivalent
   to including it with a value of "false".

I think that the root attribute should get the same treatment. :-)
