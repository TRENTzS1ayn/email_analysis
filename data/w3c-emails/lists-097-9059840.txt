All,

I just tweaked the mark-up of the abstract model[1], because the HTML
generated[2] was not valid.

The HTML generated for the spec seems to have the same problem. Here
are the two changes that I made:
- I defined spec/header/langusage/language:
    <langusage>
      <language id="en">English</language>
    </langusage>
  That way the value of the lang attribute for the html element is set
  to "en" instead of "", which is invalid.
- The XMLspec DTD allows lists inside paragraphs, which is not the
  case of HTML. I have reported this problem to spec-prod[3] in order
  to fix either the DTD of the XSLT style sheet.
  In the meantime, I have extracted olist elements from p elements in
  the abstract model.
  You should mind that in the SOAP spec too.

The HTML version of the abstract model editors' copy is now valid. I
haven't worked on the spec since I know that some editing is in
progress.
