OK, fair enough, I'll try

the given graph is
  <ao#i> <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <ao#B>.
  <ao#B> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#subClassOf> <ao#A>.

and it entails graph
  <ao#i> <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <ao#A>.

because we have a given rule that says that premis-graph
  <ao#x> <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <ao#D>.
  <ao#D> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#subClassOf> <ao#C>.
implies conclusion-graph
  <ao#x> <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <ao#C>.
for all symbols
  <ao#x>, <ao#D> and <ao#C>.


or we can have 2 given rules
one rule ** which says that premis-graph
  <ao#x> <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <ao#D>.
  <ao#D> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#subClassOf> <ao#C>.
implies conclusion-graph
  <ao#x> <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> _:ao.
  _:ao <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#subClassOf> <ao#C>.
for all symbols
  <ao#x>, <ao#D> and <ao#C>.

and another rule which says that premis-graph
  <ao#x> <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> _:ao.
  _:ao <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#subClassOf> <ao#C>.
implies conclusion-graph
  <ao#x> <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <ao#C>.
for all symbols
  <ao#x>, <ao#D> and <ao#C>.

and that should also entail graph
  <ao#i> <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <ao#A>.

OK, we've made use of universally quantified variables and implication
but my point was about having that ** rule needed for our
current implementation in Euler (because of our actual
treatment of existentially quantified variables)
