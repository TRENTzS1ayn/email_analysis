Amit,

I had fun hacking with Yapps today...

A while ago, I transcribed a grammar from one of TimBL's
design notes (http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Notation3)
into a recursive-descent parser in python
(http://www.w3.org/2000/10/n3/notation3.py).

Tim picked that up and went totally out of control
hacking on it
(http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/ ,
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/notation3.py).

A few other folks are starting to look at the code,
so I started to get embarrased and looked for
cleaner designs.

I did it once based on SPARK
  http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/n3spark.py
but when I started to write the actions,
I found SPARK's bottom-up parsing style
didn't match well.

I tried it in Yapps today, and the top-down
attribute grammar approach was a really nice
fit.

Thanks for the nifty code to work with
and the nice docs!

p.s. by copying www-archive, I'm saying it's find
to forward this wherever you like, and it will
get archived in case you, I, or anybody else
wants to point to it.
