I did it that way so that you could use the [ :p :o ] bNode construct
as values, without having to keep resorting to "is x of". If you
*really* don't like them, it only takes a few search and replaces to
substitute the inverses, although I'm pretty sure that they'll be used
most in their current direction. Note that "memberCount" is not a
ReverseFunction.

Heh, heh, heh... I just had to "take the liberty" :-) The "math:"
prefix is referred to in the Notation3 Primer [1], but there's no
mention of it elsewhere that I know of.
