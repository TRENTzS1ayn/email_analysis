Hi there,

We're building an RDF API and a decentralized search system on top of it for
something called the Plex. Now we need a storage system for it, and I know
you have experience in this area.

Some thoughts so far:

IronDoc. Unfortunately it is still vaporware.

BerkeleyDB. Doesn't scale as well as Mathew (my partner, cced) wants -- he
imagines 60GB stores. Also, I don't know the most efficient way to store RDF
triples in key-value dictionaries.

Thanks for any help you can provide. Please ask questions.

BTW, I'm cc-ing www-archive so this message is archived to the Web -- you
can of course quote it as you wish.
