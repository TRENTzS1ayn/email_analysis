Here is a slightly revised version of the SOAP protocol binding
framework which incorporates feedback received from the WG. The previous
revision can be found at [1] and is item (a) on David Fallside's list
sent out for review [2]. Diffs between the two revisions are provided.

Note the default disclaimer that the document has no status whatsoever
nor does it necessarily represent consensus within the TBTF or within
the XML Protocol WG as a whole.
