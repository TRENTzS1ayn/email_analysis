Thanks so much. For you and Mathew, here are my two key questions:

1) For our initial versions, what free database should we use?
[ I'm imagining a three-month time frame for a prototype. ]

2) In a dbm which only exports a dict, how do we store RDF triples?
[ Ideally, we'd not have to duplicate a lot of data. ]

These are the problems we need to solve, I think. I'm interested in your
recommendations.

A full response to David is below.

Same here. I like sharing with others, as you do.
Plus, building an archive is helpful later on.

Indeed. I was a rather surprised when Mathew gave me that number.
He did say he'd be willing to take it in 2GB chunks.

I left out some context. The DB is part of a larger system.
It's part of a network, where other nodes are storing that data too.

This sounds very useful for our prototypes. Or simple clients.
 
(BTW, some pages on your site are out of date. Your index is awfully old:

The header here still says Oct01:

Writing in short sentences like this is fun.)
