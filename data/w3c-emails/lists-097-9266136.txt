Peter,

Sandro passed on your message.

Adding "-" to the ID characters is a problem, in that I wanted to reserve
the usual operators for use as operators in some posisble future shorthand
notation.

Another solution would be to have some form of escaping,
such as mapping sequences of "-" into sequences of "_" in some way,
such as taking a contiguous sequence of - and _,
replacing  _ with 0 and - with 1, then adding a leading "1",
taking what you have as a binary number, subtracting
1 from the result, and then writing that many _ signs.
The mapping is 1:1, and maps the simple case of - onto __
and _ onto _.

The only disadvantage is that those who co crazy with
n consecutive occurrences of  - and/or _  in XML will pay for it
in an even crazier 2**n long sequence in the N3.

I'll put a note in the Notation3 document suggesting this.

Tim
