Tim, Sandro

Thanks for the reply. The escaping is a good idea, but it doesn't work 
in both ways. I mean that "-" in XML would be mapped to "__" in N3, but 
it likely remains "__" if converted back to XML. However, it's still 
better than to exclude names with "-" completely.

May be I'm wrong, but since operators are to be used as shorthands for 
properties and there is always at least one space between subject and 
verb, or verb and object, a hyphen in local names (something like 
"pref:local-name") should never be taken as operator. But it's quite 
possible I'm missing your idea of operators at all.

Anyway, I see that my former suggestion to change alphanumeric wasn't 
necessary. Instead, the following change would apply to local names only:

fragid ::= alpha alphanumeric* ;
to
fragid ::= alpha ( alphanumeric  |  "-" )* ;

Have a nice day,
Petr
