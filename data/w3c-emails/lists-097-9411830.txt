Sure. I have understood you want to use the escaping for an XML to N3 
conversion only. When used in all N3 files  consistently, it works in 
the both ways. But it requires the N3 definition to change.

I see, N3 is useful since it's natural. I have hoped hyphens in prefixed 
names could be distinguishable in a similar way as hyphens in literals 
or URIs. Unfortunately, I don't know how operators are supposed to be 
used (an example would be great), hence I do respect your objection.

Yes, of course. Could you please let me know when (and how) the issue is 
resolved?
