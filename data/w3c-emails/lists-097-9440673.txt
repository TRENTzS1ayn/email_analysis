Subject:  communications & inconsistencies [was: Re: Clarification: TAG Election
      Results Announced to Members and Public on 11 December 2001]  (Document
      link: Jos De_Roo)

Hi Janet,

> Earlier today, I sent an announcement [0] which was inconsistent in
> identifying the Member and Public Announcement date for the TAG Election
> Results. The correct date is Tuesday 11 December 2001, not Monday 10
> December 2001.

that is a wonderful sentence!
(forgive me that i'm biased by RDF and so)
i mean, *knowing* an inconsistency is quite interesting

the real reason for this mail is that we look (within a subgroup of WebOnt)
into requirements, and i'm particularly looking into proofs of
inconsistencies (which really sounds worse than it actually is)
i.e. Re: Use case categories - 1st cut (action due by Thurs)

I'm sure you can tell more about communications & inconsistencies...
Thanks in advance!
