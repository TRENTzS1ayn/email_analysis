(-cc: webont wg; +cc: public archive list)

I'm reasonably happy with the current text, and don't see any urgent need
for the WebOnt WG to consider the XML/10pts doc. (Perhaps some WebOnt WG
members might like to contribute to the drafting of the RDF Primer, though?)

Anyway, nitpicking (with an eye to the rdf primer as target doc):

'true knowledge' - is there any other kind (apart from
non-propositional, which rdf/webont doesn't really
attempt to capture...)

'collections of meanings' - I prefer to avoid physicalist
metaphors for meaning. Talking about meaning as a type of thing or
a type of stuff only confuses. You can't count it; and you can't
weigh it either... But you can count (XML-encoded) claims about
the proper/appropriate use of vocabulary. Meaning itself isn't
downloadable, collectable... only (as per the final sentence)
representable.

Grumbles aside, this is useful text...
