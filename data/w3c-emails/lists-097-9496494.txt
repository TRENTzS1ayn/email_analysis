Sure.  Except .... I don't have time, I don't have support from my
management for doing it, and I hate writing primer-like materials.  
:-)

I was using true as in real, as opposed to fake.  I admit that I also used
it partly because of how it made the phrase sound, and also partly because
of the other meaning of true (i.e., not false).

As a formalist (or at least a quasi-formalist) I try to use neutral terms
(like ``collection'') when I don't want to invoke any of the aspects of
more-specialized terms.  It might be better here to use a bare plural
(``meanings'') or even a bare singular (``meaning'').

Thanks.  I'm not sure what the next step should be.
