(Maybe we can pinch bits of this text for the Primer anyway...? eric?)

heh :)

I expect RDF/WebOnt to be used extensively for lies and half-truths, as
per most email/internet/web precedents. When I get my first RDF/WOL spam
message, I'll know we've gotten somewhere! (and yes -- picking up on
another thread --  RDF reification isn't the best way to represent and
reason about that kind of content...).

As a scruffy ex-philosopher type, I suppose my tendency is to avoid nouns
where their use might spawn "angels on pinheads" discussion (eg. "what is
a 'Meaning'?" etc.). So I'd tweak your text slightly, eg as follows:

  Descriptions of the meaning of terms in a certain area (from "shopping" to
  "manufacturing") are called ontologies and are an important component of
  the Semantic Web.

(this does slight violence to the way folk in this field use 'ontology',
but I can live with that)

I'm also inclined to seek words that gloss 'meaning' in terms of
constraints on (sensible) usage. For eg:

  While it is difficult (*undestatement*!) to represent the full
meaning of such terms in a machine-processable way, we
can help machines make use of Web ontologies through giving them
simple rules for the proper use and combination of these terms. To
understand natural language terms is in large part to understand
the constraints on their sensible usage; much the same is also
true of Web ontologies. [eg here]

Having written that, I'm not entirely convinced by it. Needs an example at
least. Using words like 'constraint' can cause confusion eg with XML
notions of validation; the RDFS spec currently suffers from that (though
next draft won't).

Me neither. Eric? where are things up to with the Primer?
