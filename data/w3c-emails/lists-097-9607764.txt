agreed that there was a slightly different slant to that paper but i think at least most
(which you pointed out) and actually I would claim all of the points still carry over.
you mention not scalability for a web ontology language.  i would dispute this - i think if
the language can not scale, then we can not use it for representation on the web.   the thing
i would agree with is that scalability is not a thrust of our work and is almost "motherhood
and apple-pie" for any language  thus not worth making an issue of.

i would add conceptual search to my list.
