Actually, I agree that scalability is a requirement for web ontology
langauge, I just didn't make it very clear in my previous message. What
I was trying to say was that from your requirement #1, I thought
scalability was the only one with impact on the language, while the
other three topics (reliability, availability, and performance) were
more system oriented. In fact, I believe we should make scalability one
of our requirements (of course with the realization that some
requirements may be in conflict with each other and we will have to
strike some balances in the eventual language).

If you don't mind, I'd like to ask for some clarification on how you
think some of the remaining points carry over. In particular, could you
explain how you would describe

- security management
- multi-user collaboration
- difference and merging

in terms of language requirements? Thanks!

Jeff
