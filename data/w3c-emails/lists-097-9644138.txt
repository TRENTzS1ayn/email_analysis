Eric Ian and I revised the text substantially,
resulting in:

  $Date: 2001/12/07 18:27:15 $

I phoned PatH to see if there were any critical

see Peter's phone number handy.

Peter, I did what I could to integrate the suggestions
you've made. If you find anything you can't live with,
phone me or page me today.
My inbox is too full to be a reliable way to reach me.
