sorry for the slow response.
in terms of requirements for ontology languages based on use cases, given that we are to come up
with things that emerge across many (expected) use cases, i still would claim that the three issues
in question below fit.

first multi-user issues - i expect many use cases to include:
1- multiple users modifying background ontologies
2 - multiple users viewing background ontologies
3 - multiple users using background ontologies that possibly will be updated

given this, i think it is important that there is some support for allowing multiple users to
(re)use ontologies that others may change, browse ontologies that are evolving, extend ontologies
(that others may be extending), and all of this may need to be done by multiple people
simultaneously.

second security mgmt - once more than one person is using knowledge that is evolving, it is
important to be able to specify who can
1 - view information
2 - modify information
also, particularly for govt applications, it becomes important to allow levels of granularity that
people (like generals vs. civilians) can see.   some levels of specification may be classified
about tanks  but general information about tanks may be unclassified.

third difference and merging -
i expect many use cases to include using either an upper level ontology that might need extension
or multiple ontologies.
given this, it is important to be able to find out how one term definition differs from another
definition and also to support putting definitions together.
