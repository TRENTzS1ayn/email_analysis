ps. sorry for multiple messages - i think what becomes a little tricky is the notion that we are
talking about language requirements.
i dont know that any of the topics on the original list:
 versioning
- ontology-based search
- domain-mapping/ ontology linking
- ontology querying
- rapid creation of large ontologies
- inconsistency/contradiction (added as a result of mailing list
discussion)

are truly language requiements but they are what naturally develops as needs once one tries to use
the language.
note also that the "original list" of mapping and linking i would claim goes in the same point as
my difference and merging (along with keeping track of mapping information)
