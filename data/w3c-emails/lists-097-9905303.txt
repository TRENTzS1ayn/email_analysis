I fail to follow this distinction. (I know it is taken from the 
'layer cake' slide. I fail to follow it there as well.) RDF, for 
example, is surely a (simple) ontology language. Do y'all have some 
idea that metadata is somehow distinct from , and more primitive 
than, ontology? (?? In what sense?)

Maybe xml and internationalization (maybe), but I don't see any way 
to isolate security and data persistence issues from the ontology 
'layer', wherever that happens to be.

I tend to agree with that sentiment, though I doubt if it will fly 
with the DOH (ontology equivalent of DPH)
