I would like to see some short (paragraph length) statements of what 
these terms are supposed to mean. I feel like we are just tossing 
two-word phrases around.

Bad way to say this. After all, XML is purely syntactic and RDF is 
expressible in XML syntax; and the point is not to contrast RDF in 
particular with XML, but rather to say that one needs some kind of 
agreed semantics in order to even address interoperability, right?

Does RDF in fact do that? Seems to me that RDF just ducks the issue. 
If two different websites use incompatible terminology, RDF has no 
way to fix, or even to detect, the problem. DAML+OIL hasn't either , 
of course.

That is what these languages conspicuously lack, seems to me. How 
would one state a vocabulary mapping in DAML or RDF ? Eg suppose that 
one ontology treats 'parent' as a property, but another treats it as 
a class. There is no way to state the relationship in DAML+OIL (is 
there?).

Not clear that we should be talking about 'methods' here; and this 
seems to come with the semantics pretty much automatically, right?

Different point, though: there may be other kinds of ontological 
incompatibility than outright inconsistency. Eg if you use two 
different names in DAML+OIL for the same the same entity, that is 
consistent but may suggest the need for a vocabulary mapping.

I agree, that is completely useless for ontologies, unless we are

Not to knock your work, Leo (BTW, are those papers online?), but I 
would be very unhappy at any kind of ontoweb standard that referred 
to a notion of 'context' without being EXTREMELY precise about what 
it means. That word has almost more baggage than 'model' or 'system', 
and it is used by people to refer to almost anything and everything. 
There are enough  social thinkers waiting to pounce on the ontoweb 
that it would be dangerous to use this term without having it very 
tightly battened down first.
