Pat,

Sorry for the terse descriptions in the table, I had assumed that people
could match these back to the documents that Deborah and I sent out
earlier. Details on my list can be found at
http://www.cse.lehigh.edu/~heflin/webont/reqs.html while information
about Deborah's can be found in
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2001Dec/0022.html.
Unfortunately the original list was created by Jim from the various use
cases requested as "homework" so I don't think there is a single place
that provides details on all of them. Of course, you may say that some
of what we have is still vague, but that's actually part of our job.

That being said, I'm will to clarify a little bit about what I think
some of these mean. I simply see shared meaning as the requirement that
we have shared ontologies, and that different sources can commit to the
same ontology to express that they share definitions for terms. As for
ontology reusue, I simply see this as the ability to have ontologies
reuse or extend other ontologies. As for ontology evolution, I see this
as dealing more with changing an ontology. For example, if the old
ontology said that "A whale is a fish" then we might want to change the
ontology to fix our mistake. I see this requirement driving the need for
distinguishing between different versions of ontologies and for data
sources to commit to specific versions.

I agree that expressiveness is important, but wonder if that might be
too vague to be useful.
