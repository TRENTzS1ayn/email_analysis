Folks,

Sorry to be dumping this all in your in-trays... hopefully a third and final
version. The merging of the two paragraphs that Henrik noticed required a
slight tweak to Noah's ednote to refer to a single paragraph above rather
than two.

Changes are: merged paragraphs and tweak to the ednote.

Regards

Stuart
