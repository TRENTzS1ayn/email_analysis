Not to be picky nor to put additional burden on Stuart but I am slightly
uncomfortable with the ednote as it stands. I realize that the purpose
is to give some flexibility in how we want to move forward. However, it
seems to be such a central part of the model that I am wondering whether
it would be good to qualify the differences a bit more explicitly so
that people don't get the impression that we are completely opening up
the floor to suggestions - this was at least not my impression from
today's meeting.

Could we for example promote Noah's suggestion by providing an
alternative piece of text?
