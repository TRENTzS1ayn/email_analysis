Here is a proposal for an updated ednote that may improve understanding
the issue. I find it slightly problematic that the current note talks
about "binding specifications in particular, vs. other software" as
specifications and software doesn't seem to compare.

What about:

"There is still some discussion about whether we should say more about
how communicating SOAP nodes determine whether to express features as
part of the underlying protocol binding or within the SOAP envelope
proper."

Does this capture it?
