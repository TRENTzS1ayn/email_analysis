According to the NTriples "specification" [1], NTriples can't contain
new lines in the literals - i.e., it does not support the triple
quoting for strings construct that N3 does. However, CWM still outputs
material such as the following using -ntriples in the command line:-

   :x :y """x
   y z""" .

Attached as <<cwmntcleaner.py>> is the Python program I use to clean
it up at the moment, but it'd be easier if CWM could output valid
NTriples [ignoring literals-as-subjects] itself :-)
