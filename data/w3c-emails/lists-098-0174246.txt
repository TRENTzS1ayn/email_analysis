Ah, thanks. That works just fine.

Well, at least we're not stuck with "bind" now... but it does seem to
be a strange inconvenience to build it into the parser, rather than to
convince people that namespaces sans trailing "#" are not a good thing
for the Semantic Web (although having said that, I did actually once
change a "namespace" to use a trailing hash so that CWM would give me
neat QNames... TimBL's plan worked!).

Messed up: as in the above isn't valid Notation3 (note the period in
the anon node). The output is fine in 1.82 though, so it appears to
have been fixed.

Many thanks for the help,
