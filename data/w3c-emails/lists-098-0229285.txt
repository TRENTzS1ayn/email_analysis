I don't think we are quibbling over a few words.
The HTTP spec provides a whole protocol for giveing representations of
documents.  You can't change a few words and make it a protocol
for getting information about abstract things described by documents.

I agree.  There are only some sorts of thing which can be represted in bits.
Those I call documents.

No, it is not a question of disambiguating.  The actual document which
is represented will always exist, and always need a URI so that we can
reference *it*.  The problem with  the worldnet "Logo" URI ( .../Logo)
is that it actually does identify, usefully, a document.  We still need
the URI for that document.

Fortunately, the fragment ID allows us to refer to something defined
or described by the document, and that can be quite abstract.

By analogy, note that, for example, legal concepts are referred to
indirectly through the laws which define them
"A non-profit as defined in Section 501(c)3"
"Road vehicle as definde in Art IIB of section 82.3 of the penal code"
and so on. Documents are documents. They are powerful
because (with HTTP and slew of existing and future languages) we
can do a whole lot with them. We can argue about their contents logically.
I don't mind the semantic web architecture being built on a
infrastructure of documents ((and messages)).

I must agree with Roy's  "aaagh!" I'm afraid.
