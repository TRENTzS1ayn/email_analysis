I suggest we remove the NOTATION complex type ( and attribute declaration )
from the encoding schema.

As several commentators have observed the NOTATION type from the
http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema namespace should only be used with
attributes. However, the extended NOTATION type in the
http://www.w3.org/2001/09/soap-envelope namespace adds the standard SOAP
attributes, id and href. Obviously an attribute cannot itself have
attributes.

I'm reasonably confident that removing this type from the encoding schema
will have zero impact on implementations ( because AFAIK no one is using the
NOTATION type ).
