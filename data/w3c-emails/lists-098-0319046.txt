I've attached a version of our license in your format that includes the 
dated (versioned) URI of the license and validates (and removes all the 
crufty font stuff) -- the present version is invalid HTML [1].

Thank you.

Thank you. On your copy, would you please provide a hypertextual
reference to:
  http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-software-19980720

We don't use version numbers but dated URLs to specify the version of the
license.

For example,
  http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-software-19980519.html
wasn't GPL compatible.

If we were to create a new version (I don't forsee this) I would resubmit
the new license. (Obviously, we wouldn't intend to make it incompatible
with GPL or OSD but I wouldn't presume approval.)
