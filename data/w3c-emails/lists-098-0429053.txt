I'm archiving a copy of Alexander "Sasha" Chislenko's excellent SW overview paper, attached.

Semantic Web vision paper
1997 Alexander Chislenko. - Version 0.28 - 29 June, 1997
http://www.lucifer.com/~sasha/articles/SemanticWeb.html


excerpt:
[[
Since 1995, there started appearing various proposals for meta-data
representation and communication standards, and other services and tools
that may eventually merge into the global Semantic Web. Hopefully, in the
next few years we will see universal adoption of open standards for
representation and sharing of meta-information.

news that I first heard on the collaborative filtering list; I've since
found this tribute site:

Alexander "Sasha" Chislenko

December 2, 1959
-
May 8, 2000

Among his many accomplishments in life, Sasha Chislenko created one of the
most popular web sites devoted to transhumanism, futurism, and other
subjects he enjoyed. His site will likely continue to be a rich source of
information and inspiration to thousands, and will be still be ahead of
its time for years to come.

Because his network of friends is literally a network with no physical
location, it seems appropriate that we virtually gather here to pay
tribute to him. This small site contains some personal tributes from
friends and fans who knew him or his work during his physical lifetime,
and who mourn its passing. If you would like to share something about how
Sasha touched your life, send mail to sasha-memorial@piclab.com and it
will be included here.
