OK, starting right now:-)

Just a quick note to thank you for finding the time to take a look
at this.  I've had a cursory glance at the attachment; looks
interesting, but I'll need to take a much harder look in due course.

These are SP error messages: James Clark's originals, as modified
by Liam and myself.  It's not easy to get them universally right:
for example Liam's versions (which were written explicitly for
his validator in about '97) often refer to "(in this HTML version)",
which looks rather silly when validating a non-HTML document.

I do envisage revisiting the messages.  But there's no silver bullet ;-)

Yes, it has me pondering.

One question on this.  If I generate EARL, I'll need some clientside
tool to deal with it - in the first place, to see that my work makes
any kind of sense.  I recollect raising the matter, but I don't
recollect exactly what was said.  Can you point me at any URLs
for EARL client (operational or testbed) software?
