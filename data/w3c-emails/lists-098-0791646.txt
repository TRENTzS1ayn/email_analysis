[[[
15:37:48 <sbp> sbp has joined #rdfig
15:38:29 <sbp> <AaronSw> sbp, any thoughts on the anonymous nodes proposal
the WG is discussing today?
15:38:32 <sbp> * sbp chases that up
15:40:18 <sbp> taking that to be the thing discussed in
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Oct/0141
15:42:13 <sbp> I'm indifferent to it. The proposal does not suggest that
bNodes cannot be identified with URIs AFAICT, it just states that those
particular resources do not have URIs in the model: that they are
unlabelled. A resource could have a bNode in one graph and a URI in
another, I presume, so that's alright
15:42:30 <sbp> er... actually, it does suggest that bNodes don't have URIs,
but that's not what I meant
15:43:12 <sbp> s/suggest that bNodes/suggest that the resources identified
by bNode labels
15:43:40 <sbp> I'm not massively happy with:-
15:43:41 <sbp> [[[
15:43:42 <sbp> These names are not URIs, and
15:43:42 <sbp> > > their scope is the N-triples document in which they
appear.
15:43:43 <sbp> ]]]
15:43:52 <sbp> what's a document, please? Normative definition?
15:44:35 <chaals> "This"
15:44:42 <chaals> * chaals hides
15:44:59 <sbp> This?
15:45:18 <sbp> come out of hiding, and lay your money on the table!
15:45:58 <ArtB-logg> ArtB-logg has left #rdfig
15:46:21 <sbp> I'm also not so sure about "asserting the existence of at
least one resource". Don't forget that the existential itself is/can be/+ a
resource
15:46:52 <sbp> I guess that's suitably implied, though...
15:47:22 <sbp> * sbp decides to mail this to Aaron "Two Monitors" Swartz
