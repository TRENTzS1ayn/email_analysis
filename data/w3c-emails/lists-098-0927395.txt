Hi,

I just signed up for a Google Groups account, and noticed that
the signup process violates the HTTP protocol. The message I
received (attached) said:

> You are receiving this email because you have signed up to post to

and when I accessed that link, it automatically confirmed my account.

This violates the HTTP protocol; retrieving a URI (i.e., an HTTP GET)
should not have side effects like confirming a registration; you
should use HTTP POST for that.
