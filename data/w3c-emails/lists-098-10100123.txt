Hi Ian,

I am increasingly preparing myself for having a go at enriching the world
with another DL reasoner!

This would be:
- part of Jena
- written in Java
- with a Berkeley style licence
(see http://www.hpl.hp.com/semweb/download.html )

My intent is to refer to as many DL implementation papers as possible while
writing it. (I want to reimplement rather than reinvent the wheel).

I would also like to refer to the FaCT codebase while reimplementing.
http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~horrocks/FaCT/
I note that currently this would not be wise, since I would probably "copy"
(in the legal sense, not byte by byte) some of the content of the FaCT
codebase. Given that FaCT is GPLed this would then require us to GPL Jena
(which we do not wish to do).

So, may I have your permission to copy parts of the FaCT codebase into a
Java DL system, to be freely distributed under a Berkeley style license (but
without a copyleft restriction). I will not use automatic translation tools
in this process.

As yet I haven't looked at any of the FaCT code ...

If the reply is positive, please reply to all.
This will log the reply in www-archive.

Jeremy
