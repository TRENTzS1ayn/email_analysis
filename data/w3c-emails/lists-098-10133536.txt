Yves, 

You and I have an action item to raise on issue regarding;

    'Clarify the use of XML version in the envelope infoset'

I can't remember whether this was

'Why do we have XML Declarations when the examples are infosets?'

or

'Do we mandate XML 1.0? ( and by implication rule out XML 1.1, 2.0 etc )

Can you remember?

Gudge
