Summary/TODO:

  1) make a scehma
  2) update http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/RDB-RDF.html
  3 ) link to and from coed
  4) change bind to  suggestPrefix(prefix, ns)?


Hmm... "alpha-testing" or "peer review"?
Anyway...

Mar 06 10:40:22 <DanC>timbl?
Mar 06 10:40:42 <DanC>export
PYTHONPATH=/tux/u/connolly/lib/python:$SWAP
Mar 06 10:41:28 <--libby (~libby@yaddle.ilrt.bris.ac.uk) has left #swad
(libby)
Mar 06 10:45:05 ---DanC has changed the topic to: alpha-testing
dbview...
Mar 06 10:51:23 <DanC>use the same name for the users class and the
document that gives you the columns in the users table?
Mar 06 10:51:32 <DanC>TimBL: no... ones' a document and one's not.
Mar 06 10:52:22 <TimBL>i think   /administration/users is a document, a
table schema
Mar 06 10:52:48 <TimBL>i think   /administration/users#zipcode is a
concpet, a Property
Mar 06 10:53:20 <TimBL>i think   /administration/users#__Class is a
Class, teh class of exactly things which are in the table
Mar 06 10:53:26 <TimBL>i think   /administration/users#__Class is a
Class, teh class of exactly those theings which are in the table
Mar 06 10:53:29 <DanC>see the docstring under class DBViewServer in
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/dbork/dbview.py
Mar 06 10:54:51 <DanC>does this document vs. abstract-thing stuff apply
to MIME types too?
Mar 06 10:55:03 <DanC>TimBL: hmm... yes. er.. maybe not...
Mar 06 10:55:31 <DanC>TimBL: we could say the mime type name denotes a
registration document...
Mar 06 10:55:43 <DanC>DanC: why can't we do that for database tables?
the class is a document.
Mar 06 10:56:33 <DanC>TimBL: I think I want to be able to refer to SQL
table-classes as distinct from table-schemas.
Mar 06 10:57:58 <DanC>see
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/dbork/dbview.py
Mar 06 10:59:15 <TimBL>http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/dbork/dbview.py
Mar 06 11:00:46 <TimBL>CLASS
Mar 06 11:00:55 <DanC>bzzt.
Mar 06 11:01:13 <DanC>__Class is much better
Mar 06 11:01:24 <DanC>yes, we want an XML name that isn't an SQL name.
Mar 06 11:01:53 <DanC>(and a property to relate the class with the
class's schema document)
Mar 06 11:02:13 <TimBL>suppose /admin db:table /admin/users#class
Mar 06 11:02:59 <TimBL> ===>  /admin/users#class  db:hasSchema  [ is
log:racine of /admin/users#class ] 
Mar 06 11:03:22 <TimBL> ===>  /admin/users#class  db:hasSchema  which
has log:uri which is log:racine of /admin/users#class .
Mar 06 11:03:48 <DanC>looks good; how would you like to write the
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/dbork/sqldb schema?
Mar 06 11:04:21 <DanC>... so I could take the @@ out of SwDB =
Namespace("http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/dbork/sqldb@@#")
Mar 06 11:05:16 <DanC> sink.bind('db', (RDFSink.SYMBOL, str(SwDB)))
Mar 06 11:05:24 <DanC>should just be  sink.bind('db', str(SwDB))
Mar 06 11:05:53 <DanC>TimBL: and bind() is a funny name...
suggestNamespace() maybe?
Mar 06 11:06:17 <TimBL>suggestPrefix()
Mar 06 11:06:21 <DanC>yup. much better.
Mar 06 11:06:34 <TimBL>suggestPrefix(prefix, ns)?
Mar 06 11:06:39 <DanC>yup.
Mar 06 11:06:53 <TimBL>*ACTION :x implement .-2
Mar 06 11:07:00 <DanC>btw... may I send a log of this chat to
www-archive?
Mar 06 11:07:12 <TimBL>yes
Mar 06 11:07:15 <DanC>thx.
Mar 06 11:08:06 <DanC>TimBL: did I already write the sqldb schema?
Mar 06 11:08:10 <DanC>DanC: yup..
http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/RDB-RDF.html
Mar 06 11:08:29 <DanC>esp " Mapping an RDB into the Web - strawman"
Mar 06 11:12:04 <TimBL>...
http://example:9003/dbview/inventory/products/1432
Mar 06 11:12:32 <TimBL>...
http://example:9003/dbview/inventory/products/1432  is a row defining
document
Mar 06 11:12:44 <TimBL>...
http://example:9003/dbview/inventory/products/1432/cost  is a cell
defining document
Mar 06 11:14:43 <TimBL>...
http://example:9003/dbview/inventory/products/1432#cost may be the
actual cost
Mar 06 11:15:19 <DanC>for a cell, you had emps/rowid=123;col=shoe
Mar 06 11:15:34 <DanC>is that a document? is this like the distinction
between a document and a formula that is its contents?
Mar 06 11:17:00 <DanC>RESOLVED: implementations should link to
designissues notes and vice versa.
Mar 06 11:18:18 <TimBL>WESHOULD   2) update Catalog
Mar 06 11:18:24 <TimBL>scuse me
Mar 06 11:18:33 <TimBL>2) update
http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/RDB-RDF.html
Mar 06 11:18:38 <TimBL>3 ) link to and from coed
Mar 06 11:18:41 <TimBL>1) make a scehma
Mar 06 11:19:01 <TimBL>swap/db
Mar 06 11:19:18 <--dom has quit (need network for my laptop setup)
Mar 06 11:19:28 <DanC>404 at http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/utils ;
forbidden at http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/util
Mar 06 11:20:55 <DanC>after all these details, the issue of UPDATE/POST
looms large.
Mar 06 11:21:48 <DanC>good... amaya didn't totally screw up newlines...
lines: +11 -2
Mar 06 11:26:30 <TimBL>4) change bind to  suggestPrefix(prefix, ns)?
Mar 06 11:26:42 <DanC>DanC: wanna alpha-test the HTML forms interface?
i.e. getting data, not just the schema?
Mar 06 11:26:45 <DanC>TimBL: not just now.
Mar 06 11:28:34 <DanC>TimBL: when you spit out the schema, include
count(*) while you're at it.
Mar 06 11:28:40 <DanC>a table schema, that is.
Mar 06 11:28:47 <TimBL>Size -- curent size of the table is a very
useful ything to know up front for query opt
Mar 06 11:29:16 <DanC>ADJOURN.
