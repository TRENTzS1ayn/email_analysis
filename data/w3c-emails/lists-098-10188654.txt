Noah also points out that the examples currently use <?xml version= /> Is
that part of our abstract envelope.  Gudge:  version is now in the
infoset.  Noah: do we use it in the definition of Envelope.  Resolution:
Yves to open an issue to cover our use of infoset for the envelope, and
particularly the status of version.   Examples to be made conformant.
