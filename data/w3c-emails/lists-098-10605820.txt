The discussion is recorded in

LMM: yes, re / question, the text of 6.H isn't quite clear...

this would require enhancing our test infrastructure to take another
input.

I think I presented it to the WG as a whole; I think
Jeremy grokked... I think the result was some actions
to change test cases and stuff in the syntax spec...

yeah:

[10:03:50] mdean_
ACTION: jeremy review error2 and error3 test cases

In short, #15 was easy; yes, we're correct.
#12 is more subtle, but I think we're agreed
what to do and Jeremy is doing it.
