I thought of an enforcement mechanism: make a CGI script that takes the
requestors IP address and makes a mailto:$clientIP link and says

This page is copyright W3C.
We expressly prohibit the use of
this information for sending
bulk unsolicited email.

In particular, we charge $350 for
delivery of mail to _this mailbox_.

Mail received in this mailbox will
result in an immediate report of abuse
to your ISP.

Then if we get mail there, we could track the spammer (or at least one
of their ISPs) by the IP address.

If the spammer identifies themselves in their
message, we could sue them in small-claims
court for the $350 and get a summary judgement.
