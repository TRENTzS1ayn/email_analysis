The nomenclature in this space is so fuzzy that I've found it difficult
to discuss in the past.  But I have run into this before, in trying to
describe the difference between the bag-o-bits, and the resource
identified by the Content-Location URI describing that bag-o-bits.  For
example, if I had a clock;

GET /time HTTP/1.1
Host: clock.example.org
Accept: text/plain

response;

HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
Content-Type: text/plain
Content-Location: /time/text
[blank]
12:34:56

If I reinvoked GET on that Content-Location URI, I wouldn't expect
to receive "12:34:56" 10 minutes later, I'd expect to see "12:44:56".

So in this case,

http://www.w3.org could identify the W3C, but
http://www.w3.org/index.html (or whatever it is that you use) could
identify the HTML representation of the W3C.  But I would expect that
each would reflect the current state of the W3C organization.

Looking forward to it.
