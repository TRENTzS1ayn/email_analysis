bijan: Alpha release, temporary site ("Cool URIs may not change, but
geeky URIs change all the time!"0
bijan: It actually reads and runs a reasonable subset of N3. I have some
confusions about []/log:forSome, built-ins aren't built, er, in yet. Nor
does it (yet) support any of cwm.py's cmd line interface. It does have a
REPL, though. A partial one, at least.
bijan: It can handle rules12.n3, which isn't too shabby.
bijan: Performance looks pretty good, thus far. Parsing is a bit slow,
and using rdf_db.pl to write each result (even when filtering) isn't
very speedy, but you can construct very fast Prolog queries against the
n3 store.
danbri_: Very cool! But have you considered rewriting this in Python?
bijan: No.
AaronSw: Sean has something similar in Python, though.
bijan: Well, GEEZ, TBL has something similar in Python too!
AaronSw: Silly bijan, his isn't a CLONE!
bijan: Annoying Aaron, the original is similar to its clones.
bijan: WOOHOO! Just got a hand-compiled, builtin-using rule to work.
bijan: Still havn't a clue about existential quantification...
