Tim,

At python10, I got the intuition that
kjBuckets might be a good technology
for optimizing cwm/llyn.

As we discussed, you think it's promising too.

Set and Graph Datatypes for Python: kjbuckets Release 2.2
http://starship.python.net/crew/aaron_watters/kjbuckets/kjbuckets.html
Aaron Watters

Abstract: This is the documentation for the kjbuckets C extension to
Python (second release), which defines graph and set datatypes as well
as an alternative dictionary data type. These types are tightly coupled
at the level of C, allowing fast and powerful algebraic combinations of
container objects.
