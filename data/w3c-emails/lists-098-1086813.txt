CC/PP is meant to be a framework for device profile information, the web
misses CC/PP pedants for users profile and content profile information.
User profiles not in terms of CPEX ("Customer Profile Exchange",
business steal^Wcollect and exchange user data to do more business, see
http://www.cpexchange.org/) but it terms of VCards for XForms. User data
needs trust, P3P is a single means to provide trust, but it is not
sufficient, since it lacks of validation. Content profile information is
necessary just like CC/PP is necessary, especially on a XML web, MIME
content description doesn't work with XML. TimBL suggested, that
Content-Types should be URIs, this is the first step, go and develop the
technologies.
