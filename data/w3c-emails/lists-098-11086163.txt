Using Perl 8.0 and libWWW comline (you can use wget, lynx, etc) I have
retrieved and successfully built a parser with this version of
dtd2yacc.pl.  I should note that the "xml:lang" tag through Bison/Yacc
for a loop as this is used to delimit rules.  I replaced this by hand
with "xmlClang".  The dtd.pl is from the perlSGML package.  For example,

 "http://www.nacs.uci.edu/indiv/ehood/perlSGML.html"

Hey... great! I'd appreciate it if you'd make your results available;
maybe send a pointer to www-html@w3.org? Or just send a copy
to www-archive@w3.org; it's a mailing list where nobody's
expected to subscribe; just a convenient place to archive stuff...
