Hi Jacek,

thanks for this. I've been trying to compose a response. As things stand I
can't represent anyones views other than my own, ie. I can't speak for the
RDF groups. I'll get a reply out asap. Also I'll send heads-up to SemWeb
CG and RDF Core WG.

Short preview: I agree that pluggable encodings allows RDF etc to be
serialized. But there is a large cost associated with using alternate
encodings, so we should invest some effort in mapping RDF into SOAP's
object model. Maybe the resolution of the issue could be refined to ack
that we don't encourage folks to diverge from using the default SOAP
Encoding model/syntax.

what's your view?
