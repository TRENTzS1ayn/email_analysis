Hi Joseph,

I'm metadata advisor to the Creative Commons, so I'll tell you some of 
what we're currently planning to do with RDF (plans may change, std. 
disclaimers, etc.) . I'm sure other members of the team can answer the 
other parts of your email.

Yes, one of the things we're working on is an RDF Schema for our 
licenses. It will be roughly like this:

work1 license license1 .
license1 requires copyleft, attribution, ... .
copyleft description "The license requires that each modified version of 
the work is ... " .

I'm hoping to expand the characteristics (like copyleft, etc.) so that 
we can describe other licenses like the GNU GPL or the EFF OAL. Building 
something like Zooko's Quick Reference[1] from the RDF data is an 
interesting place to go. So if one were to say that MIT-style licenses 
were those that only required attribution and no warranty, then they'd 
be easy to categorize.

Yep. While I doubt that our web site will be able to do that kind of 
thing, it should certainly lay the framework for others who are 
interested.

Others can probably explain a little better why software was excluded. 
Reasons I've heard are:

  - a lot of work has already gone into software, and so we should focus 
on the more neglected stuff
  - software, by its nature of practicality, has a lot of issues that 
other content doesn't. When was the last time you bought a CD that had a 
shrinkwrap license disclaiming warranty?

Anyway, I hope this answers some of your questions. Thanks for your 
interest in the project and your letter.

All the best,
  - Aaron
