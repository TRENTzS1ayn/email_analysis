For those without MS Word, I took
http://www.daml.org/listarchive/joint-committee/1109.html
http://www.daml.org/listarchive/joint-committee/att-1109/01-DQL_Summary_5-24-02.doc

And did SaveAs HTML -> then HTML Tidy'd it to XHTML.

Please don't cite this version without pointing to the original, in case
the conversion did anything misleading.
