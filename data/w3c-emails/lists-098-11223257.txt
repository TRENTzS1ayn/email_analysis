Aaron and Larry,

Thank you for your answers! Some follow-up questions are below which don't 
require immediate answers; they're the sort of questions I've had in my 
mind while trying to understand the direction of CC.

One of the things I've been wondering is to what degree would this be used 
as self-labels and third-party labels (harkening back to the PICS days) . 
For instance, I might want the ability to self describe the license for my 
content, and other organizations might want to say this is "OSI certified" 
or "GPL compatible."

Yes, this would be nifty.

Question, when I register my content [1] at your site will I have to send a 
URI for every single Web page? Can I specifiy domains such as already done 
in P3P [2] (and other applications?) (Also, it'd be neat if I could feed it 
RSS so new content is fed to CC automatically!)

I'd think one could take advantage of the work.

Is it the (Red book non-compliant) "copy protected" CDs that have been 
known to crash computers? <smile/> Regardless, even if for natural language 
content that is technical there is often a disclaimer [3].

Some other questions I have specific to your license include questions I've 
encountered at the W3C including: the right of translation, annotation, 
reformatting (e.g., html -> pdf), the right/authenticity of the submitter 
to assign the work under the stated license (is CC negligent/liable if 
abused?), and will you version the license so you can introduce a debugged 
one in the future, if so, is content under the old licenses also available 
under the new license (e.g., GPL).
