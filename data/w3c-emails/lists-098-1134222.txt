I agree with Dan - using a pluggable encoding for MOF/UML models is a
minimal solution that should work, but the preferred solution is to provide
a mapping from MOF/UML into the SOAP object model.  We have already done
something like this between MOF/UML and XML Schema, and believe it should
be possible here too.  I will open an issue in the OMG XMI Task Force for
this, and stay involved on the w3c side.

Hi Jacek,

thanks for this. I've been trying to compose a response. As things stand I
can't represent anyones views other than my own, ie. I can't speak for the
RDF groups. I'll get a reply out asap. Also I'll send heads-up to SemWeb
CG and RDF Core WG.

Short preview: I agree that pluggable encodings allows RDF etc to be
serialized. But there is a large cost associated with using alternate
encodings, so we should invest some effort in mapping RDF into SOAP's
object model. Maybe the resolution of the issue could be refined to ack
that we don't encourage folks to diverge from using the default SOAP
Encoding model/syntax.

what's your view?

dan
