In implementing the editors' action item:

"Generate a reference for the various features and bindings pointing
back to the appropriate place in SOAP 1.2 INSTEAD of the one-sentence
found like "Protocol binding specifications may use this URI to declare
their support for the MEP and its associated semantics""

I found it weird that in part 2, section "6.4 Web Method Specification
Feature", we call it the "Web Method *Specification* Feature". I would
have thought that it was merely the "Web Method Feature" or
alternatively "Web Method SOAP Feature", no?

The text in section 6.4 uses both versions but I wanted to check before
changing anything and you agree that this is nothing but editorial.
