Given the success of the table describing mU and role I was wondering
whether we can clarify issue 250 by adding another one listing the roles
in a similar manner (see attached) in section 2.2 where we have the list
of role definitions [1]. This may make it easier to see than the current
bullet list.

Btw, in table 2 "SOAP Nodes Forwarding behaviour", we should refer to
the names "next", "ultimateReceiver", and "none" as *short-names* as we
in section 2.2 defined the role *name* as a URI.

Comments?
