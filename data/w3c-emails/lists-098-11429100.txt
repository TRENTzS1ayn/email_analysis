Hi Bob,

If it's not too late, have a look at the attached XUL file in
Mozilla[0]. It does two things:

  - display your bookmarks as a XUL tree.
  - export your bookmarks as RDF

The code is very crusty, inlcuding the hard-coded export destination,
but shows a simple way to achieve this.

Please let m eknow if you have any problems/questions, but CC me in as I
don't read the list/group very often.

user_pref("signed.applets.codebase_principal_support", true);
