Overall I like it.  One editorial comment, though I think this is on text 
that traces to earlier versions.  Your table has:

"To establish itself as an ultimate SOAP receiver a SOAP node MUST act in 
this role. "

I've never liked that, as I think you establish yourself as an ultimate 
receiver by agreeing to undertake all the requirements of the 
specification for an ultimate reciever, including not relaying the 
message.  Since we've quite clearly established elsewhere what an ultimate 
receiver is, I propose:

"The ultimate receiver MUST act in this role. "

Sound right?
