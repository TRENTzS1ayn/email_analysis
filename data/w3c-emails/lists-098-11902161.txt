XHTML is simpler, more aesthetically pleasing, and works with deployed 
XML and HTML tools and specs (like namespaces). I see no reason not to 
use it now.

I don't see why this is bad. Relying on such slack is how we can build 
backwards-compatible specs; otherwise upgrading would require a flag 
day.

I don't use any.

That's pretty subjective; I don't consider that the main advantage.

Sure, invalid documents are invalid. What does this have to do with 
XHTML?

I don't take advantage of these.

ditto

And tools could parse and produce TeX too. By your reasoning, it'd be 
safe for the Web to move to TeX.

HTML 4.01 doesn't allow namespaces.

Even if the premise was true, that doesn't follow.

I agree with this, and I'd like to hear suggestions on how to address 
this problem. I have no problem sending my content with a special mime 
type to a client which will do the right thing with it, do you have 
code that will do this for me?

Kluge: I've set up http://xhtml.aaronsw.com/ to be identical to 
aaronsw.com except serve pages with an XHTML mime type. Doing this 
found a few problems, as your article suggests it would. It also found 
a Mozilla bug:

Test case: http://www.aaronsw.com/2002/fixedxmlns

Do you want to file a bug?

You have not listed one disadvantage.

This makes no sense. We know that we will have to rewrite HTML pages to 
be XHTML. We know how to do this. Why should we not do that now, 
creating less work for later?
