Hi Graham,

I've been busy trying to

+ address the outstanding editorial issues
+ generally tidy our document up.


The results of my labours (so far) are at:

http://sealpc09.cnuce.cnr.it/jeremy/RDF-concepts/20021121/Overview.html

The detailed changelog at the bottom is probably the right place to start.

I might work some more on the clown example ...

Hope you find it an improvement.

I am going to tell Pat of its existence ....

Jeremy
