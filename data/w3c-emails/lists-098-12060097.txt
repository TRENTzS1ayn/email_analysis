Hi,

  Attached are three HTML documents:

  excerpt.html => an excerpt of a larger HTML document
  e.04.html    => HTML Tidy 04 August 2000 output for excerpt.html
  e.lib.html   => HTML Tidy Library 23 Nov 2002 output for excerpt.html

Looking at those attachements using recent browsers you will notice that
excerpt.html and e.04.html will look identically (CSS added for improved
visualization), while e.lib.html doesn't. The <form> and <table>
elements are put to different places in e.lib.html. Current Tidy will
refuse to output a pretty printed version of the page unless using
--force-output. If we can re-construct 04aug00's behaivour, Tidy could
output a pretty printed version without problems (AFAICS).

regards.
