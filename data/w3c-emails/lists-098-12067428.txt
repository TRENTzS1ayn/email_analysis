Yay! I get to be a contestant on The Hixie Challenge. This is so much 
fun. It is with great trepidation that I challenge the Word of The 
Great Hixie, but here goes...

Ooh, that's a good one! Luckily for me RFC 1591 is only informative, 
not standards-track, so I don't need to meet this requirement.

Did you look at the headers? They're sent as:
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8

I consider <span> and <div> as base classes, to be subclassed (using 
class="...") when no more specific class will do. (If we had a decent 
format, we could use namespaces instead.)

Using well-known-classes for the banner allows tools like screen 
readers to skip over it. I think this is important information to 
provide.

> <div class="content"><div id="main">
> At least one of those <div>s is redundant, if not both.
content indicates the portion of the document that is relatively unique 
(not part of the banner/head or the footer). I can imagine screen 
readers and other tools that might want to jump straight to the 
content. Meanwhile, id="main" separates the recent weblog entries from 
the sidebar. Similarly, I see important structural uses for these.

All fixed.

Huh? Did you read the title or the last paragraph?

Removed.

Changed to alt="&#x2022;" - BULLET. A bullet is a type of dot, so I 
think I'm OK.

It's "Connolly". No, that's what I said[1]. Dan Connolly corrected me, 
saying "I take the <address> tag to provide a signature for the page; 
signatures usually include dates"[2]. I don't think signatures usually 
include copyright notices.
