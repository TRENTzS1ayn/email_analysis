I'm not sure what this means. How do you want the UA to support 
namespaces?

That appendix is informative so I don't need to follow it, but I'm 
pretty sure I do. Even if it was normative, it doesn't outlaw 
namespaces.

Not if they include namespaces.

It means I can include namespaces in my document without violating the 
spec.

This might be because most UA authors are, in the words of Mark Pilgrim 
"alpha male[s who] chase after bleeding edge technologies". Maybe if 
they spent time creating a UI indication of validity (ala iCab) instead 
of subjecting all readers to "user-hostile behavior", they wouldn't 
need such idiocy.

Mass-murder was one of the primary goals of nuclear fission's 
development. The main advantage of using nuclear fission [to generate 
electricity] is *not* mass-murder.

I know this. But I don't send invalid content. So I don't care.

I was pointing out the error in your reasoning. If tools are being 
used, then the same tools "might as well" name me Supreme Overlord of 
the W3C. But they don't. Why are you bringing it up?

According to who?

Does this follow? "The Library of Congress contains everything my home 
library contains, so there is little reason to use my home library in 
the real world." There's more to markup than what it can express, as 
you point out above (error handling, for example).

I've asked Mark for the code he's using.

That's insane. How does it handle the declared HTML entities then?

Why?

Oops, I meant I haven't agreed to one disadvantage that applies to me.

OK, maybe only I will have to rewrite pages to be XHTML. It's a 
court-imposed term of my probation.
