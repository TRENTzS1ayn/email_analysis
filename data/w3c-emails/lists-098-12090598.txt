Here's a write-up of the matched tests in a table form that matches
table 2 [1]. 

It has a set of proposed tests for intermediaries that are quite
straight forward to implement without adding additional functionality.

There are 7 entries for which we have no tests. We have marked 33 as
"not testable" given the discussion.

Who has the action item to set up the next meeting?
