It would be fairly easy (if a bit labour intensive) to add markup 
around every assertion and generate a number in the XSL. An anchor 
could also be automatically generated for linking. The problem would be 
(as always) keeping the spec and test collection in sync. IIRC, the 
test collection currently embeds links to sections so this would need a 
rework also.
