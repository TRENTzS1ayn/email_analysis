Excuse me. "Appendix C" there is an error for "Section 3.1.2", which does 
say that. In addition, RFC 2854, which is normative, says that XHTML 1.0 
defines a "profile of use...which may also be labelled as text/html", 
which suggests (at least to me) that RFC 2854 makes it mandatory that 
XHTML-as-text/html follow the guidelines of Appendix C. The XHTML Media 
Types note makes it pretty clear that namespaces are verboten in 
text/html, but that document is, of course, informative.
