Yeah. Like I said, it's a minor problem. In any case the "correct" domain
(.name, I guess) wasn't available when you started your site.

I did look at the headers, but apparently not well enough. I'm a little
confused here. I may have been looking at your xhtml.aaronsw.com site,
which doesn't have a charset header, altough of course it doesn't need one
since it unambiguously gets treated as UTF-8.

My bad.

This is not what XHTML says, though. The DIV and SPAN elements, in
conjunction with the id and class attributes, offer a generic mechanism
for adding structure to documents. These elements define content to be
inline (SPAN) or block-level (DIV) but impose no other presentational
idioms on the content. They also impose no semantic information.

Classes and IDs are also free of any defined semantics.

There is no such thing as a well known class. Any tool that makes
assumptions about classes is broken.

To quote from a recent blog of mine:

Says who? It could equally well delimit a span containing the protein
content of a recipe.

Says who? It could equally mean the "hand" part of a document.

Nope, I didn't read the final paragraph (hey, when you're reading a
site by its source sometimes you miss stuff... :-) ).

Ok, so the image does need reasonably alternate text. I would suggest:

   alt="There was an illustration in the Times today, depicting the
   corner of a building with a single vertically sliding window, open,
   with two hands having apparently just thrust a two-drawer file
   cabinet out of the building. The file cabinet is upside down and
   its bottom drawer is open, with papers and files falling out."

The important thing to note is that the image is conveying the
delightful illustration in this case, it is not conveying simply "a
file cabinet being thrown out the window".

Note how now it is definitely a paragraph (<p>) and not a section
(<div>). Also, be careful where you (don't) put spaces -- currently,
your first paragraph looks like: "A file cabinet being thrown out the
windowJon Keegan, New York Times". (Yes, that's "windowJon".)

The "(left)" part of the paragraph should probably be changed, too, as
there is little chance that the image will be on the left unless the
UA is a modern graphical Web browser with no user stylesheet (on
speech browsers, there is no left). As TBL would say, "don't talk
about the mechanics". Possibly a better solution would be to make the
text "delightful illustration" link to the image using a fragment
identifier.

That seems reasonable.

Oops, typo.

Ah, yes, that's the one.

Fair enough.


I think the clearest thing to take from this discussion, by the way,
is that XHTML needs to take some ideas from DocBook. We need a
"subtitle" element, we need a "footer" element, we need a "sidenote"
element and a "body" element. (Oh wait, we have that.)

We need some normative classes.

Basically, we need more semantics.
