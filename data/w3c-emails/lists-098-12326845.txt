Quoth Section 3.1 "This version of XHTML 1.0 provides a definition of 
strictly conforming XHTML 1.0 documents." Elements defined *by* XHTML 1.0 
may be used in documents with mixed namespaces, as described in Section 
3.1.2, but these are not XHTML 1.0 documents. They are *XHTML Family* 
documents, with their own DTDs. (Furthermore, XHTML 1.0 + namespaced 
content will not, AFAIK, be valid XHTML 1.0). Since the only form of XHTML 
permitted by RFC 2854 to be served as text/html is the Appendix C-defined 
subset of XHTML 1.0, and since documents conforming to one of the XHTML 
1.0 DTDs cannot include namespaces, it follows that content including 
namespaces cannot be served as text/html.

True. I simply intended to make the point that while Appendix C is 
declared to be informative, RFC 2854 makes it clear that the "profile" of 
XHTML 1.0 defined by Appendix C is considered by it to be the authority as 
to what subset of XHTML may be served as text/html.
