This discussion is out of order since the question is

While I believe that's true, that's actually not the point
of the rdfs:format proposal. In the RDFS format proposal,
it's just
jenny age "10".

i.e. the age property takes a numeral, not a number.

The RDFS format proposal is not incompatible with
datatype properties, but it's orthogonal to it.

with rdfs format, you just write:

            <prf:displayWidth>604</prf:displayWidth>
            <prf:displayHeight>200</prf:displayHeight>

and change the definition of displayWidth so that
it takes numerals.

er... let's see... xsdt:integer maps integers to literals...
so yes, those are equivalent. While I agree rdfs:format
is redudnant, I think it's probably worthwhile; especially
since the 2 triples above can't be expressed without
rdf:nodeID.
