Good.  I don't intend to say more there.

Agreed.

The point behind my analysis of CC/PP is that I think content negotiation 
works more cleanly given a consistent treatment for numbers associated with 
literals, and numbers that are genuine numeric values that one can test and 
express in other ways.  I suppose one could define, e.g., test:le that 
relates "1" to "2", "2" to "3" but not "3" to "2" in the numeral (text) 
domain, but my intuition is that that would ultimately lead to other 
confusions.

So I was explicitly looking at ways of expressing number values in the 
graph, as well as constraining literals.  This is something that the 
current datatyped literals give us.
