Your design seems to ignore the issues of *cascading* style sheets. How 
would a subsheet override your magical border declaration without 
wiping out all borders?

Your nesting-step proposal seems like an advanced version of float. I'd 
do it this way.

#topnav { float: top !1;}
#leftnav { float: left !2;}
#rightnav { float: right !2; }

What're the position pixel numbers for?

This is in CSS3.

Then why have you only pointed out warts instead of design flaws?

I'd still like to see alternative proposals.

I suspect there are major improvements that can be made, but they don't 
come easily and CSS works well. By comparison, the major brokenness and 
possible solutions of email, IRC, etc. are obvious.
