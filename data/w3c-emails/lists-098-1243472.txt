All the threaded programming I've done has been in an 
environment without mutable objects using a RDBMS as a 
datastore, so locking was never an issue. I was sort of 
disappointed that Python, rather easy-to-use in other respects, 
makes threaded programming so much more difficult.

Hmm, perhaps I do like Tcl more than Python. If only all that 
code available for it...
