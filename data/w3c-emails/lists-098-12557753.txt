Hi Jeremy,

just a quick one in between...
using Jena as
java -cp /w3ccvs/WWW/2002/03owlt/editors-draft/WEB-INF/lib/jena.jar;
         /w3ccvs/WWW/2002/03owlt/editors-draft/WEB-INF/lib/xerces.jar;
         /w3ccvs/WWW/2002/03owlt/editors-draft/WEB-INF/lib/icu4j.jar
     jena.rdfcopy %1 RDF/XML N3
we are quite happy to have the testcases in N3
e.g
http://www.w3.org/2002/03owlt/intersectionOf/premises001.n3
http://www.w3.org/2002/03owlt/intersectionOf/conclusions001.n3
http://www.w3.org/2002/03owlt/intersectionOf/Manifest001.n3

it's just that in the latter we (and cwm as well I see)
had some trouble with quotes-inside-quotes of of the
testSchema#description literal

therefore I made the manual change into what N3
normally uses for such cases i.e. """

I have no problem (appart from a too long proof at
our side) with your N3 production
