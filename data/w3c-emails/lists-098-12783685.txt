Ok, as indicated earlier, I've now populated the edtodo[1] with 
the issues at [2] that are marked "closed".

Could you please check the ones with a question mark ("JJM. 
Incorporated into spec already?"), and mark them as closed (in 
edtodo.html) if you have incorporated the resolution into the 
spec, or know for sure someone has?

Thanks,

Jean-Jacques.
