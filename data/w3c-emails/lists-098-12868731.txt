Only if you target the header to a role the intermediary is playing. 
The example you give above would work quite well targetted at 
'.../none'. The whole message is available to any intermediary so the 
information is there if required. An 'active' intermediary could take 
some action based on the presence of a header targetted at '.../none' 
if it so desired.

That would be fine too I think, provided everyone who played the role 
also understood the specific header - otherwise you would get the 
problem you describe.

I don't like the above - I agree that it stretches the processing model 
uncomfortably far.
