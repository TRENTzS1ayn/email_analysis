I agree with 1) but not with 2) because I think it only reflects part of
the story.

First, I think we agree that roles do have semantics and function in
some capacity. This is the case for both the roles that we define and
also implied in the processing model.

Second, I don't think the notion of removing unprocessed header blocks
is independent of role. It only applies to SOAP nodes that in some
capacity is an intermediary. For example, it doesn't apply to the
ultimate receiver as we explicitly say that at the time a messages
reaches the ultimate receiver then we are done. It also doesn't apply to
the initial sender as this implies generating a message and not
processing a message.

What we haven't done a good job at is explaining that the whole notion
of roles *is* about distributed processing based on a concept of a
message path. I think it would be good to clarify this but it is not a
stretch from what we have now although I do agree that it is not as
clear as it could be.
