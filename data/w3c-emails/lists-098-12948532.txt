Hi, I have two problems with the current procedure, I currently do not
have http access to w3.org (simple network problems, but I'm often
offline), and who knows when I'll get it back, whilst it's quite unusual
for me to be away from http access for the 7 day timeout it's not unique,
however being away from e-mail is a much rarer occurance, and I feel that
for an email list, you should be able to perform all the actions by
email, and not rely on http methods, which may not be available.

This is my other problem, I do not believe it is "right" for an e-mail
address to come from a source which responding to does nothing, at the
very least you can have a reply-to containing the same information as is
contained in the actual e-mail.

Cheers,

Jim.
