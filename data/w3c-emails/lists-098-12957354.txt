Sure it's possible. Our mirroring system is in fact using a similar way
to propagate the changes. I'm going to talk nicely to Ted since he is
the one behing our mirroring system setup.
So the plan is:
the cvs system sends a spaH^Hmessage for each update of
dev.w3.org:2002/ws/desc/wsdl12/edtodo.html
to a mailing list specific to the editors.
Is that ok?

That's the part I like with CVS. You cannot blame me for the merge
troubles :)
