I'm trying to generate the HTML from the XML for Part 1 of the spec.
When I do this I get a whole load of question marks in the TOC. They
appear to be in place of tabs or spaces but I can't figure out why.
Displaying the XML in IE using the XSL works fine, but transforming the
XML into the HTML using the same stylesheet gives me this problem. I
have a feeling the problem is with class='toc' as I can't see this style
defined for DIV or P but I don't know css that well :-(

Can someone else take a look and see if they can get a clean transform?

Thanks

Gudge
