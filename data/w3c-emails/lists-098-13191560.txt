Jeremy,

I had a strange editing mishap with this -- not quite sure what, but it 
seems I edited the wrong version.  I'm pretty sure the document is OK, and 
I have the CVS repository if problems come to light.

Anyway,  there are some remaining bits in my text that I want to leave 
until you've done the abstract syntax stuff.
