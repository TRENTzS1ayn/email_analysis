I am finishing for the afternoon, so I thought I would show you both where I 
had got to.
I have used class="added" (green underline) and class="removed" (red 
striekthrough)


http://sealpc09.cnuce.cnr.it/jeremy/rdf-jjc.html

See section 2.4.3, 2.4.4
New section 3 Predefined datatypes
Section (old) 3.2 Literals

I have also modifed the patent declaration in the status section.

I still need to:
- do a little polishing on what I have written
- review massimo's and tim's comment (I think I have done most of the harder 
bits)
- do a modification reflecting Jerome's comment (easy)
- (old) 3.1 URIs - the text is cumbersome

Brian - I am imagining that we could ask Misha to do an early review of the 
critical bits (mainly 2.4.4 and new 3.) in parallel to a WG review.

Graham - I have run the thing through tidy to chop your exceedingly lines up, 
I am expecting to undo that on the unchanged text before giving you back the 
lock.

Graham - there were a number of minor mark-up issues that I have put in purple 
at the top of the doc. Maybe we should talk about them.

I hope to be done some time tomorrow morning.

Jeremy
