(sorry for the slow reply, I am slowly catching up with email
after returning from vacation)

I agree it would be good for the system to accept confirmations
by email as well as HTTP; that's on the todo list, but I am not
sure when I will have a chance to work on it.

In the meantime I don't think this will inconvenience many
people, since I expect most regular W3C participants have
fairly reliable HTTP access.

If you select the option that says:

 ... [ ] This permission applies to any messages I send to any W3C
         list in the future. No need to ask me again.

you shouldn't need to use the form again. (unless you change
email addresses)

I sympathize with this because I think everything should be
signed by someone, but in this case at least 99% of these
messages will be going to spammers, who will either ignore the
replies or try to use them to harvest more email addresses.

If someone does reply to aa-sender@w3.org they will receive an
autoreply with links to documentation and the address for feedback.

thanks for your comments,
