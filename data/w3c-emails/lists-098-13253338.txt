How's it going (today being Thursday)?

I suggest you phone me when you're ready to hand back.

...

[I just thought to check www-archive:  I didn't receive your message, dunno 
why...]

Quick points:
- By all means chop long lines:  I just don't edit the HTML by hand.
- Markup points:  sure, let's discuss, but I'd like to focus primarily on 
getting the *content* right.  Relatively speaking, there's plenty of time 
to clean up the presentation:  from past experience, that gets a pretty 
thorough going over in last call anyway.

I'll plan to focus on another document (SWAD-E) until your ready to hand back.
