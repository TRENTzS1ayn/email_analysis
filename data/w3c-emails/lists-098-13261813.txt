I've just given up on getting the URIref text right.

I unearthed more problems with it. I suggest we postpone that bit until next
week. (There are no substantive WG-internal problems only wording, and
interactions with other specs and the I18N people to consider).

Otherwise I am very nearly finished:
- I have incorporated all comments I am minded to accept.
We should talk those through (particularly those I wish to reject).
- I have completed the datatyping stuff.

I will do a version in which removed text is removed, and added text is not
green; and leave the current version where it is.

Then let you know.

Jeremy
