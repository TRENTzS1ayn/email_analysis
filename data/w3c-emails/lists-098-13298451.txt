I wonder if the bit about inference engines is really aesthetic...
I can't quite put my finger on it, but it seems to me that
the IF semantics are expressible as horn clauses while
the IFF semantics are not.

As long as the IFF semantics can be captured as so called
"closure rules" (which are horn clauses, right?), then
yes, it's a coin-toss... I kinda lean toward IF on
the grounds that it's less constraining (and in some
sense more expressive...) but I asked TimBL about
this and he expects IFF semantics.
