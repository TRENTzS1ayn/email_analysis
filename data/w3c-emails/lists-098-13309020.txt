We *know* that that sort of reasoner (horn clause like) is going to be
incomplete wrt any sort of OWL semantics that the WG wants ...

I think it is quite a plausible position to say

Large OWL = all the semantic anyone might possibly expect.

e.g. we use some set theory, you get that bit of set theory
(student/employee cases)
we use some arithmetic, you get that bit of arithmetic (test case with
minCardinalities adding up)
you use some property properties, they really are property properties
(transitivity etc).

i.e. Large OWL seems strongly extensional in nature overall, and so making
it extensional in this respect seems cool to me.
It does seem cleaner to then put that requirement back down on rdfs if there
are no reasons not to.

[I am no where near deeply committed to this position].
