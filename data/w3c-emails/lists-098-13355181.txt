Hm. I want to write my RDF textbook someday.

Philosophy
Hierarchies are evil. On the computer, we no longer need for each 
object to only be in one place. Instead, we can put it in every 
relevant place and find it by searching or taking intersections, rather 
than hunting through a forest of folders.

Practice
Instead of putting unparsable HTML up on the Web, we'll use 
machine-processable RDF. Instead of having web pages we can look at, 
we'll have data structures we can pass back and forth. We'll have 
another Web revolution!

Pragmatics
Agents make statements, in the form of triples, each of which have 
three parts (a subject, a predicate, and an object), each of which is 
either a literal (identified by a string: "Hello, world!") or a 
resource (identified by a URI: <http://me.aaronsw.com/>).
