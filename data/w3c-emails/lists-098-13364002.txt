Hi,

I am looking to buy a 15" CRT, and I was wondering what the
difference is between the NEC 1550V and 1545V? I don't see any
differences in the specs. Retail outlets seem to offer one or
the other but not both.

I have seen good reviews of the 1550V and would like to make sure
the 1545V is roughly the same before buying it as a substitute
for the 1550V.

Thanks,
