Yeah, that's kinda unfortunate... I guess I hijacked the
agenda in some ways...

Meanwhile, after the telcon, JimH and Guus and I talked
about stuff to do about this rather than just letting
it sit for a week. We've got reviewers in mind and
stuff. Expect to hear from JimH.

Er... is there some reason you didn't include a pointer?

I hope we'll be prepared to decide next week.
Certainly by the following week.

I can't think of anything.

I don't see anything.

ok by me...

yup;

I'd prefer to just call it sameAs, since the domain/range
isn't actually constrained to individuals/Things.

I'd like to study the details of this a bit more,
but there's a good chance I won't get to it.
I'm not opposed to publishing in any case,
but I might not be ready to close this issue.

That meets my expectations.

I don't see much difference either way.
The guide should clearly say "don't do that."
What happens when you do, I don't much care;
whatever makes drafting the semantics easiest
is OK by me.

yup, ok.

That's ok by me, but I think DAML users expect this
functionality, and we need to check that they
find this acceptable, for now. We may need to
mark this POSTPONED in the issues list, rather
than claiming to have addressed it.

whatever that means. 1/2 ;-)

ok by me.

ok by me.

right.

ok by me, though I'm on the hook to propose the
Distinct/AllDifferent thingy.

I look forward to them!
