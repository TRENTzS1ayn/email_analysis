From the plane ride:

http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/200209/xul/simple/squish2xul.rb

It nearly works too. Feed it an RDF query and a few parameters, it spits
out XUL template code that should generate (and populate with query
results) a tree widget in Mozilla.

See the other files in that directory for slight bit more context.

Currently is some bug in the generated XUL that means it doesn't populate
the tree widget. Not sure what's up. I have a .xul that works (hand coded,
not from my script) that seems almost totally identical apart from
whitespace and trivial differences. I'll finish diffing it and hopefully
fix the bug sometime.
