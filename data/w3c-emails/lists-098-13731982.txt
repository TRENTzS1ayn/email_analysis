The issue calls for indicating that information items carrying URIs as
values should be specified in section as having a type of xsd:anyURI.
After looking through the SOAP envelope defined EIs that carry URIs, all
have mention of being of type xsd:anyURI in section 5. It would
therefore seem as replication to add it in section 6 as well.

Schemas' definition of anyURI [2] explicitly calls out the relationship
between IRIs, URIs, and anyURI:

"The mapping from anyURI values to URIs is as defined in Section 5.4
Locator Attribute of [XML Linking Language] (see also Section 8
Character Encoding in URI References of [Character Model]). This means
that a wide range of internationalized resource identifiers can be
specified when an anyURI is called for, and still be understood as URIs
per [RFC 2396], as amended by [RFC 2732], where appropriate to identify
resources."

IMO, we have nothing to add regarding this issue as it is a) outside the
scope of SOAP and b) addressed by the schema spec already.

I don't think we have anything to say about how URIs can be carried
outside the SOAP Envelope. For example, how the request-URI is encoded
in an HTTP request is HTTP's problem and not ours. I do not support that
SOAP should see it as a requirement to dictate rules on SMTP, HTTP, etc.

In summary, I think we can close this issue with no action.
