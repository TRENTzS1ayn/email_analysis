Looking at the HTTP binding [2] in part 2, we have two places where the
serialization is mentioned:

1) In Table 15, we say:

"Rules for carrying SOAP messages in media type "application/soap+xml"
are given in [SOAP MediaType]."

2) In Table 18, we say:

"The response message is assumed to be a SOAP envelope serialized
according the rules for carrying SOAP messages in the media type given
in the Content-Type header."

For the case of "application/soap+xml", charset issues are described in
[3] as 

charset 

This parameter has identical semantics to the charset
parameter of the "application/xml" media type as specified
in [RFC 3023].

And in RFC 3023, it is mentioned that 

      "utf-8" [RFC2279] and "utf-16" [RFC2781] are the recommended
      values, representing the UTF-8 and UTF-16 charsets, respectively.
      These charsets are preferred since they are supported by all
      conforming processors of [XML].

Other than an editorial change in the text in 2) above to include a
missing "to" and to say "header field" rather than "header" as in

"The response message is assumed to be a SOAP envelope serialized
according to the rules for carrying SOAP messages in the media type
given in the Content-Type header field."

I think we can close this issue as being appropriately addressed in the
current text.
