>The issue calls for indicating that information items carrying

>of xsd:anyURI. After looking through the SOAP envelope defined 
>EIs that carry URIs, all have mention of being of type 
>xsd:anyURI in section 5. It would therefore seem as

>Schemas' definition of anyURI [2] explicitly calls out the

>
>"The mapping from anyURI values to URIs is as defined in 
>Section 5.4 Locator Attribute of [XML Linking Language] (see 
>also Section 8 Character Encoding in URI References of 
>[Character Model]). This means that a wide range of 
>internationalized resource identifiers can be specified when 
>an anyURI is called for, and still be understood as URIs per 
>[RFC 2396], as amended by [RFC 2732], where appropriate to 
>identify resources."

>I don't think we have anything to say about how URIs can be

>In summary, I think we can close this issue with no action.
