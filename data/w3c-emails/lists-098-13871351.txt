Ok with me, what do the other editor's think?

Hmmm, I think people may have different expectation here, but I can live
with no action.

If this shrinks the proposal by 2/3 then I think we're done ;-)

Noah, can you comment on this as you were at the face to face?

This has always been the case and merely follows the convention laid out
in the Infoset spec. I do not want to move away from square brackets.

Oops, we've already made this change.

I merely mirrored what was in the existing text, which said 'SOAP
header'

Is what a cut and paste error?

This text is from your original proposal

I guess you want to amend your proposal then
