Hi,

this thread is intended as a brain storm about the social arrangements for the 
webont f2f in Bristol.

We need:

- a restaurant for Monday night dinner
- something less formal for Sunday, when people are likely to turn up at 
various times, and we can't easily commit to a number

I am hoping that we can come up with something ...

The hotel is very near ILRT and the University area

I wonder whether we might ask for the use of the Spanish Bar on the Sunday 
evening? Maybe it would be better to get out though.
