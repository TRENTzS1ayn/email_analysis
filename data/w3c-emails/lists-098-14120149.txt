312
346
347
348
349
350 (items 1,2)

"NON-TRIVIAL" EDITS ACCEPTED & INCORPORATED

247
274
293

MISDIRECTED AT PART 0
261 - accepted as P1 issue by other editors
262 - ditto
264 - ditto
265 - ditto
309 - accepted as a general issue; is it resolved by issue 333?

Yves: Perhaps the "trivial" edits can be marked as closed. The "non-trivial edits accepted and incorporated" could also be marked as closed unless you want me to first respond to the originator.  A general question I have is this: do I have to respond to every issue's originator? Please clarify.

Thanks
Nilo
