Not sure, I was going to suggest an alternative with a note duplicating 
the values.  Something along the lines of:

Note:  I share your (implied) concern about duplicating normative info 
from other texts.  On the other hand I share Gudge's concern with the 
pushback about implied indirection.  Three levels seems deep.  Would it be 
the lesser of the evils to say:

"Completing the transmission of a request message and the reception of a 
response message. The response message is assumed to be a SOAP envelope 
serialized according the rules for carrying SOAP messages in the media 
type given in the Content-Type header field.
Note:  For the case of "application/soap+xml", charset issues are 
described in [SOAP Media], which recommends the use of utf-8" [RFC2279] 
and "utf-16" [RFC2781]."

Not perfect, but I think it emphasizes that the source of the normative 
recommendation is through the media type description.  I'm not sure it's 
important to point out the second level of indirection, as the utf8/utf16 
recommendation is essentially part of the soap media type, even if it gets 
there by reference.

If we get pushback then I suggest we add a note pointing out the
dependency chain but not actually incorporate the values. Does that
work?
