+1, OK, but I think we owe Martin a careful and polite reply, rather than 
a "no change".  He raised the issue with some care and goes into some 
detail, and I worry that we will antagonize our reviewers if they try to 
tell us where they find the spec unclear, and we say "sure it's clear, 
trust us, we know it well."   Maybe the answer, as he also suggests, would 
be a bit of clarification in the primer?  Not sure.

I agree with this summary. So +1 for closing this with no action.
