Yes, definitely worth changing, but maybe with a further tweak to 
the 2nd sentence: "a hierarchical list of SOAP codes [...] is 
included in every SOAP message" invariably makes me think that 
you want to include all possible faults codes in every SOAP 
message, which is evidently not what you're trying to say. Can't 
think of a fix right now.
