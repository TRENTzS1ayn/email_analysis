Nilo, re. accepted trivial editorial edits. I would be satisfied if you
sent just one email to xmlp-comments & originators to cover all of them. In
this email you do not have to spell out each edit, just say "the editorial
issues X, Y, Z were accepted and incorporated". A second email should cover
all the not-accepted trivial edits.
Thanks for the update,
David

Dear Editors:
This, FYI, is the status of the edits for the primer (latest editors copy
at [1]), with LC issues categorised and some questions/comments appended.


NOT DONE (yet)
218
248
257
260
273
309 - is this closed per resolution of issue 333?
310
312
346
347
348
349
350 (items 1,2)
354(b)





NOT ACCEPTED
245 - need to respond to originator
275 - don't know what to say in response
308 (first 3 paras) - ditto
345 - need to respond to originator





"NON-TRIVIAL" EDITS ACCEPTED & INCORPORATED
238 - responded to originator
242 - not responded to originator - seems unnecessary
246 - closed at F2F with no changes
255 - not responded to originator - seems unnecessary
259 - ditto
272 - ditto; originator's "opinions" in first para ignored
287 - need to respond to originator?
295 - need to respond to the originator?
296 - have responded to originator
308 (last para) - seems unnecessary to respond to originator
311 - not responded to originator - seems unnecessary
344 - ditto
354(a) - ditto





"TRIVIAL" EDITS ACCEPTED AND INCORPORATED
247
274
293
313 - not everything accepted.
350 (all except items 1, 2)
351 - responded to originator
352
372


MISDIRECTED AT PART 0
261 - accepted as P1 issue by other editors
262 - ditto
264 - ditto
265 - ditto
309 - accepted as a general issue; is it resolved by issue 333?


Yves: Perhaps the "trivial" edits can be marked as closed. The "non-trivial
edits accepted and incorporated" could also be marked as closed unless you
want me to first respond to the originator.  A general question I have is
this: do I have to respond to every issue's originator? Please clarify.


Thanks
Nilo
