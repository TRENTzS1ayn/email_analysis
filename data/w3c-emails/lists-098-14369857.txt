It shouldn't be. It was agreed either at a telcon or a face-to-face
quite a while ago ( over a year I think ).

But the exact text 'defined' by the WG during the resolution is often
done in isolation, without much regard for other spec text either in the
vicinity of the change or elsewhere.

We decided not to work that way.

I don't remember changing any text. To be honest I don't remember
deciding to change 250 either, but obviously I did. It may be given my
mail that the reason I was asking for feedback from the other editors
was because I was unhappy with the wording, but I really don't remember.

I am sure he is aware. The discussion centred around the fact that it
was difficult to make text read well, and diffucult to avoid repetition,
if we had to 'replace sentence x with text y' all the time. The WG voted
that the editors had discretion to modify resolution text as they saw
fit.

I understand that that is a problem. You will notice that only one of
the resolutions I sent to xmlp-comments was worded in such a way.

OK

I'm difficult to offend ;-)

No problem.
