Whilst the editors had been given some liberty in incorporating 
changes, I would also like to point out that they have always 
tried to be faithful to issue resolutions, and, to the best of 
their abilities, to incorporate resolutions *as is* as much as 
possible. This is not as if we had been throwing issue 
resolutions to the bin whilst nobody noticed, or the like. And 
whenever we thought the changes we had to make were too large, we 
always went back to the WG, as we have done in the last few days 
for a number of issues.

Maybe this is a half-full, half-empty issue?

Jean-Jacques.
