Noah,

I have incorporated the resolution to issue 221. In doing so I have 
modified your proposed text as follows:

Original:
"Except in the special case of intermediaries (see below), envelopes
transmitted by SOAP senders MUST NOT contain PIs.

Receivers (including intermediaries)  receiving an envelope with a PI
SHOULD fault with a XXXX fault.  However, in the case where performance
considerations make it impractical for an intermediary to detect PIs in 
a
message to be relayed, such intermediaries MAY leave the PIs unchanged 
in
the relayed message."

New:
"SOAP messages sent by initial SOAP senders MUST NOT contain processing 
instruction information items. SOAP receivers receiving a SOAP message 
containing a processing instruction information item SHOULD generate a 
SOAP fault with the Value of Code set to "env:Sender". However, in the 
case where performance considerations make it impractical for an 
intermediary to detect processing instruction information items in a 
message to be relayed, such intermediaries MAY leave the processing 
instruction information items unchanged in the relayed message."

The main changes were associated with use of terminology from section 
1.4:

(i) envelope->message to make sure people don't think they can prefix 
the envelope with a PIII since that is not 'in' the envelope

(ii) use of 'initial SOAP sender' instead of 'SOAP sender but not 
intermediaries'

(iii) expansion of PI to processing instruction information item.

(iv) reference to sender fault made consistent with the rest of the 
spec.

I hope you agree that the changes do not affect the semantics or 
general spirit of the issue resolution. Please let me know if you 
disapprove.

Regards,
Marc.
