I think it's essentially fine.  One word minor suggested change, if you 
like it, otherwise stick with what you have.  This changes "the proc. 
insts." to "such proc. insts", more clearly indicating that it's the 
inbound ones that may survive.  Take your choice.  Many thanks.

case where performance considerations make it impractical for an

instruction information items unchanged in the relayed message."

OK, how about the following:

"SOAP messages sent by initial SOAP senders MUST NOT contain processing
instruction information items. SOAP intermediaries MUST NOT insert 
processing instruction information items in SOAP messages they relay.
SOAP receivers receiving a SOAP message
containing a processing instruction information item SHOULD generate a
SOAP fault with the Value of Code set to "env:Sender". However, in the
case where performance considerations make it impractical for an
intermediary to detect processing instruction information items in a
message to be relayed, such intermediaries MAY leave the processing
instruction information items unchanged in the relayed message."

Does that nail it ?

Marc.
