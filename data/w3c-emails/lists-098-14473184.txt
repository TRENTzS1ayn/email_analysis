Hello Henrik (and others if you wish to help):
Can you help me find a (first name, last name) name - made up, of course - which has all the "peculiar" characters of the Scandanavian languages, both Danish and Swedish, and if need be, Norwegian. You know the sort of things I mean: the ones with o's crossed out, circles above letters, ...the whole works. It need not be something you'd want to name your children, just hypothetical.

I am making the SOAP Primer more international in flavour - that was one of the last call comments - hence the desire to change the name "John Q. Public" to something that exercises the Unicode!
Thanks
Nilo
