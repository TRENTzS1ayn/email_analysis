I have received no answer from this address yet.
Besides, the account seems to have some trouble:

   ----- The following addresses had permanent fatal errors -----
w3cparticipant@hotmail.com
    (reason: 552 Requested mail action aborted: exceeded storage
allocation)

   ----- Transcript of session follows -----
... while talking to mx16.hotmail.com.:
>>> RCPT To:<w3cparticipant@hotmail.com>
<<< 552 Requested mail action aborted: exceeded storage allocation
554 5.0.0 Service unavailable
gombkoetoe@ASSOFT.COM... Deferred: Connection timed out with
assoftw.assoft.com.

I suggest "we" remove this address from the 100+ lists it has subscribed
to. yum.
