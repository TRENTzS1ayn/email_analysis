I'm sorry to spoil the agreement, but I find the paragraph 
really, really bizarre. First, we say MUST NOT, which to me 
implies never, never send a PI. But then we add: well, take it 
easy, we're not really serious, you can use PIs if you really 
want to. Am I getting something wrong? Is a MUST NOT really not 
that strong? Have we not created an untestable assertion (MUST 
NOT/MAY)?

Also, I think one of the initial use cases was that of an initial 
sender forwarding XML data, which could contain PIs, and over 
which the sender had no control. Are we not considering this use 
case any longer? Did I miss something?

I'm easy about PIs; but I tend to find it difficult for the spec 
to remain undecided.
