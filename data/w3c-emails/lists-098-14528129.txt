I agree that its busted, I wasn't championing a particular approach 
just trying to make sure the paragraph captured the (admittedly 
awkward) resolution of the WG in a crisp nailed down manner.

FWIW, I don't think the new text says "you can use PIs if you want to". 
It says message content originators MUST NOT use PIs but intermediaries 
don't have to check for them if they can't be bothered. There's a 
difference I think.
