I understand the concern with the sub-optimal wording.  What I think we're 
trying to say is:

* You really, really MUST NOT ever insert a PI into new content in a SOAP 
message (I.e. content from the initial sender, or newly inserted headers 
at an intermediaries.  Thus, if you ever receive a PI, the message is in 
error --- somebody upstream has a bug.

* For reasons of efficiency, we do not absolutely require that an 
intermediary detect and avoid propagating all such errors. 

* Presumably, a correctly written ulitmate reciever MUST eventually detect 
such errors, and an intermediary actually processing a header MUST detect 
such errors.  The only lattitude is in relaying content that's not 
actively re-inserted.

Make sense?  I'm open to any wording that conveys the above, and I agree 
that the proposals that Marc and I have offered could probably be 
improved.  Thanks.

JJM,

This is exactly the point I was making when I initially questioned the
resolution. But I decided that seen as the 'obvious' fix was not on the
table, I could ( just about ) live with Noah's formulation.

I still think its busted really.
