Yes, there are more XML tools than RDF. I wouldn't suggest otherwise.

This is an idea that many people are interested in, but it is still
largely a research issue. There are no widely used XML schema languages
that let us do this, yet. The RDF design, by separating graph abstraction
from our basic RDF/XML syntax, anticipates such developments but doesn't
require them. RDF/XML documents were made so that their meaning as a graph
was standalone self-evident, without the need to read and understand some
schema that articulated the mapping (or execute some XSLT program, for
that matter). There are some proposals (eg. 'meaning definition language /
MDL', see Google for url, which address this area, btw.

(yes, we could have a default order in the main Seq, represent a different
ordering in another Seq, or just have smarter clients that could order on
any property)
