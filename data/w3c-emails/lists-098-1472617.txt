I've noted this distinction between an acceptance of a license 
(unilateral?) and contract (bilateral?) before [1]; it's an interesting 
(and perhaps) important distinction that I don't completely understand yet.

However, based on this thread I went and had a look and most of the OSI 
license *do* restrict use:
