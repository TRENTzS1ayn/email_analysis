I have been thinking about this since my last blog [1] on the 'End of RSS
Innocence'.

I think that a common ground can be put forth if we include the mod_link [2]
module into RSS 0.94 then we can support advanced RDF and other functionality
within a simple RSS format in a very adhoc and decentralized manner.

I think this goes above and beyond what we did with namespace modularization in
that we can link to addition RDF/XML files without modifying the original (just
a link) RSS or bloating it.

I will formalize my thoughts and send off anoTher email shortly.

...Remember that corporations are amoral.  Not moral or immoral but
amoral. They logically determine how to make the most money. They make decisions
without regard to compassion or ethics, much like a computer.
