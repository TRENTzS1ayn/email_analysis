Contracts are bilateral in the sense that they are founded on an offer
and an acceptance.  Open source licenses generally tell you that you
may do certain things (otherwise forbidden by statute) on certain
conditions.  If you don't do the things, the license doesn't accept you.

These licenses allow, rather than restricting, use.  IMHO (IANAL) allowing
use is mere excess, having no effect.
