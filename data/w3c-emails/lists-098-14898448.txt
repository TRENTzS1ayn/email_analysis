Stevan- don't have time for a long response, and rarely respond to 
such things - but since we've known each other a long time - let me 
give you a quick response -- I personally believe that the single 
most interesting thing about the web is that symbol grounding (in web 
space) is doable, and that it is what the semantic web is based on in 
almost every respect (although I think many in the SW community don't 
realize it yet).  You might want to take some time to wander through 
Tim Berners-Lee's writings about web design [1] - and particularly 
his ideas about why URIs are so important and how they can be used to 
anchor meaning (start with [2] and follow links).   I think you'll 
see stuff relating to a lot of your interests -- the mapping to your 
definitions of symbol grounding are not immediate and 1-1, but I 
think you'll see a lot of interesting work there.
  I wish I had more time to discuss this with you in detail, but I'm 
busy trying to build the SW and not worrying as much about the 
philosophy and meaning as some people would like.  Pat Hayes is very 
involved, he'd be a great foil for discussion of this stuff...
