The response to my previous message made me wonder whether I had continuing
e-mail configuration errors....

A concrete possibility for the Sunday night would be to say that people meet
up in the hotel bar. I haven't a good feel for what it's like.

Any possibility of Libby having a look? (It is very close to you).

Any ideas as to where to eat for Monday night.
We currently have 22 people reigsitered.

I think we should have somewhere in walking distance from the hotel.
