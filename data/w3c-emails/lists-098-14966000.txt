Hi Jim,

Nice to hear from you again! 

First, as I admire your and Tim's work, I want to make it clear that this
is merely a "semantic" disagreement (about the semantics of "semantic"),
and not (necessarily) a philosophical disagreement -- and certainly not a
practical disagreement about the nature or value of the work.

I think the URL you sent me says it all: "Grounding the meaning of a
document in URI space" (or, as you put it, "symbol grounding (in web
space)": That's grounding symbols in symbols, not symbols in their
meanings!

So all I'm saying is that "The Syntactic Web" would have been literally
the right descriptor -- and still further testimony to how much
semantically interpretable mileage can be gotten out of pure syntax
alone! No shame in that!

Cheers, Stevan

PS The "Semantically Intrepretable Web" would be another straightforward
way of putting it, without needlessly turning the meaning of "grounding"
(or of "meaning") on its head...
