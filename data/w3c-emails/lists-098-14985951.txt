crud, sorry Jeremy. I did ask at work but didn't get many responses, in
fact this was the only one:

[[
Grillbar on a sunday if you like meet they can cater for lots of
people but they draw the line at RDF conversations......there is a
warning on the door  ;)
I heard that jamesons dont like DAML    :)
]]

I don't know where the grillbar is though...jamesons is ok - and they
have a cheap menu, but it's french and the portions are small.

I expect I could look at the hotel.

below are some previous restaurant recommendations of restaurants from
when I asked where to take my parents...

near ILRT there's also Browns, which is quite big, though I've never
been there; Azuma japanese restaurant which I like; oh, for Sunday night
we could go to the ILRT favourite the Hope and Anchor on Jacobs wells
road, which does rather nice food, though I'd have to check if they
serve food on sunday evenings (I just checked - they do until 9.30 pm),
and if the weather is poor it's not very big.

[[
coccobello's is v good in Colston St (based in the bottom of Colston
Tower).....they do pizza, main italian meals + plus they have a wet
board (fish) (I chose the monkfish which was v good)

see review:

however its not a BYO.....

---

How about Budokan?  It's not BYO but it's not too expensive.

Jamesons, opposite the BRI, is good but may be a bit pricey (and not BYI)

---

lovely montpelier of course!

bell's diner, or the indian place

---

there is Taste of Morocco at the top of pig sty hill - although I guess
that is about ten minutes walk up the gloucester road.

---

Red Snapper on Chandos Rd, Fish, NOT BYO

---

Just been last week to Juniper in Cotham (so just about walkable).
Very good, not BYO, slightly pricey (10-12 pound for a main course),
but definately worth it.
