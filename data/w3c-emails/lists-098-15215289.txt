<         <p diff="add">SOAP fault codes are intended for use by
<           software to provide an algorithmic mechanism for
<           identifying the fault. SOAP fault codes are organized as a
<           linked list of XML qualified names allowing a SOAP node to
<           identify the fault category at an increasing level of
<           detail of the SOAP fault.</p>
