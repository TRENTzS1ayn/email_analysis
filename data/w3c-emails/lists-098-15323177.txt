Right, this struck me as very odd because there's no "normal" Infoset item 
for this information, the namespace declaration is verbose (though I'm glad 
you didn't stick only a prefix in there!), it's difficult to write a schema 
to validate it, and  there's no other parameters that I can associate with 
it. If it was XML, I could have a nested/parameterized structure, validate 
it, extend it, query it with XPath or forthcoming XQuery, etc. Now that I 
understand the way in which you are attempting to query it I see the 
motivation at least...

Yep! I can then get at it with XPath or XSLT, don't need a special query 
thingy.

I'd avoid it if I could. (I have in the specs I've authored, and I've 
recommended it to others with mixed success and in the end it will be their 
headache...)
