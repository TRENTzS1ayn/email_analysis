All,

There are 4 long paragraphs of notes at the end of section 7.1. They 
trouble me aesthetically ;-). I'd like to propose that we create three 
new subsections:

7.1.1 Optionality - Put in 1st and 3rd paragraphs from notes
7.1.2 Use of HTTP - Put in 2nd paragraph from notes
7.1.3 HTTP Interoperability - Put in 4th paragraph from notes.

Any opposition ? BTW if anyone has suggestions for better subsection 
titles that would be good.

Marc.
