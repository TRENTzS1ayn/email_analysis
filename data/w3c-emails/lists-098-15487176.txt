Ok... what about adding the following sentence (*quoted*):

"MUST clearly and completely specify the content and semantics of 
the header blocks used to implement the behavior in question, 
including if appropriate any modifications to the SOAP Processing

We might wish to add a safety warning.

What do you think?
