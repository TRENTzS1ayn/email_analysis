Thanks! Other than by acronym, I had no idea what RDDL does until your
mail.

If I understand correctly, what you're suggesting is this:

  1. Keep RSS 2.0 as-is
  2. RSS 2.0 currently has all the "core" elements in an "rss20" ns/URI
  3. Put an XHTML with embedded RDDL info at the rss20 URI's "end"
  4. This would allow any RSS 2.0 reader to continue working...
  5. ...As well as allow RSS 1.0/RDF readers to transform RSS 2.0 into
RSS 1.0/RDF by following the rss20/URI, finding the RDDL info there,
downloading the XSLT, and making the transformation.

(If this is not what you're saying, please let me know!)

I think I see a couple of possible snags in this scenario:

  A) The URI (actually URL) isn't under my control. What if Dave
refuses?
  B) How would an RDF reader "know" what URIs to download and read as
RDDL? RSS 2.0 is namespace-extensible, so readers potentially have to
try several URIs, never knowing which the "correct" one is.

In a later post to my weblog I tried tackling both issues by embedding
"link" information into the original document itself. Now that you've
mentioned RDDL, there are quite a few similarities, which I'd like to
investigate further:

  (i) Are there any standard/recommended techniques for embedding the
rddl:resource links in the document (here RSS 2.0) itself rather than in
a separate document? (Note that rddl:resource is an element, and
obviously cannot be made the root element of the document; is there any
convention that says "child rddl:resource elements of the root element
necessary apply to the whole document"?; this is one reason I suggested
using processing instructions, BTW.)

  (ii) Is there any standard technique for embedding information in the
document itself that is an rddl:resource link pointing to the RDDL
itself of the document?

Thanks!
