Friends, you can find my first stab at a RelaxNG Schema for RSS 1.0 Core at:

http://www.w3.org/2002/09/rss-rng/
 rss.rng -- validates the core with extensible item content 
models quiet nicely.
 dc.rng -- a working extension of the rss.rng schema that 
attempts but fails to constrain elements in the
namespace associated with the dc:prefix .
 test.rss -- an rss instance I tested the above with

Presently, what I'm trying to do with dc.rng is beyond my relanxNG kung-fu 
(or not possible?). I'd like the dc:BAD element in the excerpt from 
test.rss to cause a failure when validated with dc.rng:

  <item rdf:about="http://xml.com/pub/2000/08/09/xslt/xslt.html">
    <title>Processing Inclusions with XSLT</title>
    <link>http://xml.com/pub/2000/08/09/xslt/xslt.html</link>
    <description>
     Processing document inclusions with general XML tools can be
     problematic. This article proposes a way of preserving inclusion
     information through SAX-based processing.
