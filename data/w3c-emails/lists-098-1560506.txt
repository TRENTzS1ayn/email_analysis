yes; these might be a bit out of date by now, but they
parse something pretty close to n-triples:

  http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/n3-simple.pl
  http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/n-triples2kif.pl

Neither of the above does string un-quoting.
I think the one that spits out KIF is more
current w.r.t. whitespace and comments.
