I didn't come out the way I wanted. Sorry, my bad. I'll rephrase that:

  A) The URI cannot point to an RDDL document. (Three examples: the URI
is not a URL, the URI/URL already has a well-known resource at its end
which cannot be changed, the document producer does not control the
URI/URL but would like to associate RDDL information with the document.)

I couldn't agree more. I'm a technical guy myself, and generally try to
avoid political issues like the plague.

Okay, although if I were an RDF developer I might have liked something
more explicit than that.

Generally, you want to put all the slowly-varying stuff in an external
document (for caching, to save bandwidth and disk space, to make central
modifications easier). However, there are sometimes benefits for
in-lining. DTDs, for example, can be either.
