Issue 353 has 4 parts in the editors' to do.  While working on the
response, I was cross checking the 4th of the four sub-parts which claims
our status is.

353  Part 2  Section 3.1.1: Fix language regarding element information
items, edges and nodes.  Incorporate resolution as in issue description
Low  Done. 20020823 MJG

The requested change is:

q) [Part2 3.1.1 Encoding graph edges and nodes]
The first sentence of this section is strongly worded, and suggests that
element information items *only* represent edges, when in fact they at
times
represent a combined edge and node. (for example in the first sentence of
3.1.3) Please correct this.

...but my  reading of the editors' copy is that the change is not made.
Current text is:

"Each graph edge is encoded as an element information item and each element
information item represents a graph edge."

What is our intended resolution?  I'm going to hold off with the formal
closing response until we decide.

The second part of that request is:

"Bullet 4 mentions "a graph edge [that] does not terminate in a graph
node".
This is confusing, and seemingly in conflict with the first sentence in
2.1:
" Edges in the graph are said to originate at a graph node and terminate at
a graph node."

While it's not reflected in the ed todo, I think I can say "we've
officially decided that edges can be dangling, inbound or outbound, and
that we've generally updated the text accordingly.  Right?  If so, it's
only the first part (of the 4th part!) above that's in question.

While I'm busy bugging my fellow editors:  am I supposed to change the ed
todo from orange to grey after sending the responses, or are we doing that
sometime later?  Thanks.

Thanks.
