Hi everyone,

I recently sent a draft to the urn-nid mailing list for consideration that
may be of some interest to this group: a URN namespace ("geo") for
geospatial location based on latitude, longitude, and an optional height. A
copy of the proposal is available from [1], and my original mail is
available from the uri@w3.org mailing list archives at [2].

Larry Masinter was kind enough to refer me to this group, and I was
wondering how compatable this proposal is with your own efforts, and
whether I should continue the registration process.

Cheers,
