Hi Jos

I've progressed somewhat, and wanted to share with you where i had got to; and 
then if you're happy, I will send a message giving the rest of the group a 
heads up.

So:

I have a version of my old document that now generates the triples and does 
some checking on the test cases.
This is found:

http://sealpc09.cnuce.cnr.it:8080/wowg/jsp/main.jsp

I also attach a static copy, just in case tomcat dies.
(Note the refresh and caching is a bit muddled, so don't expect it to show the 
very latest updates).



I also have created a web form for the creation and zipping of test cases.
This is here:

http://sealpc09.cnuce.cnr.it:8080/wowg/jsp/edit.jsp

(Again a non-functional static copy is attached).

The validate button is a no-op, and the zip button doesn't work the second 
time if you press it twice successively.
The author drop down list is a mock-up, not really implemented - it will give 
a list of all dc:creators of current tests, so that you can just pick your 
name off the list.

Try this, and then press the "Refresh from W3C" button.
Then maybe add an author and press the zip button.

http://sealpc09.cnuce.cnr.it:8080/wowg/jsp/edit.jsp?feature=InverseFunctionalProperty

A minor issue is that the tool presupposes a change to the way we handle 
Manifests.
The old approach was to have one manifest in each dir.
The tool does one manifest for each *test*, so that a test consists of either 
two or three files, one of which is the metadata.

The URI of the tests themselves also change:
old style
  *dir*/Manifest#testNNN
new style
  *dir*/ManifestNNN#test


Advantages of the tool:

- creation of Manifests
- verification against or avodiance of common problems.

I'll probably try and get the validate working before showing it to the group.

Once we've done that we should hassle people into producing some tests, e.g. 
Nothing would be an easy inconsistency test, and would give rise to an e-mail 
subject line:
TEST: please do Nothing
