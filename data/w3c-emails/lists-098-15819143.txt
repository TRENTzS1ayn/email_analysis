Good, thank you.

>> I think this covers the fourth entry for 353

But the comment was specifically about the first
sentence, which still says: "Each graph edge is encoded
as an element information item and each element
information item represents a graph edge.", which
borderline contradicts your change to the bullet. I
agree with the commentator that the first sentence
should probably change too, but if you feel not, then my
response to him should indicate that we have rejected
the specifics of his suggestion, but made another
change.  Since the Edtodo list implied we'd accepted
the suggestion, I wanted to doublecheck.

Good, thank you.

OK, will probably not be until Monday or Tues., but I'll do it.  Thanks.
