I am not sure "arbitrary" is the right word as it might bring the reader
to think of "random" and I am not sure this is what we are talking
about. Would it be useful to expand the sentence in *...* to say:

"The SOAP extensibility model does not limit the extend to which SOAP
may be extended and does not prevent extensions from modifying the SOAP
processing model as described in section 2.6."

Does that work?

Henrik
