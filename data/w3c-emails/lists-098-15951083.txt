The problem I see with your wording is that people will think that 2.6
tells them how to modify SOAP processing model. How about:

The SOAP extensibility model does not limit the extent to which SOAP can
be extended. Nor does it prevent extensions from modifying the SOAP
processing model from that described in Section 2.6
