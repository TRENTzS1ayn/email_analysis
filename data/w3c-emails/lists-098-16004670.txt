that is looking very well and I'm happy as I was able
to test it on my machine

right, on my machine, I checked it out, compiled it
and just got

[[[

but was able to run

and got the nice document with the following server log

wow, that is fantastic!

> A minor issue is that the tool presupposes a change to the way we handle
> Manifests.
> The old approach was to have one manifest in each dir.
> The tool does one manifest for each *test*, so that a test consists of
either
> two or three files, one of which is the metadata.
>
> The URI of the tests themselves also change:
> old style
>   *dir*/Manifest#testNNN
> new style
>   *dir*/ManifestNNN#test
>
>
> Advantages of the tool:
>
> - creation of Manifests
> - verification against or avodiance of common problems.
>
> I'll probably try and get the validate working before showing it to the
group.
>
> Once we've done that we should hassle people into producing some tests,
e.g.
> Nothing would be an easy inconsistency test, and would give rise to an
e-mail
> subject line:
> TEST: please do Nothing

fantastic!

as an aside
maybe we should explain somehow

Proof       EntailmentTest   | Reasoner

Found       Positive         | OK
Found       Negative         | NOT OK (unsound)
Not Found   Positive         | OK for *incomplete* reasoner
Not Found   Negative         | OK
