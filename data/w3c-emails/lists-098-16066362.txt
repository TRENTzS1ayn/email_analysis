Its broken, but I don't think you necessarily broke it ;-). The problem 
is the use of two different state machines in 6.2 and 6.3 that share 
the same relative names (e.g. Sending+Receiving) but now have four 
different base URIs:

http://www.w3.org/2002/06/soap/mep/request-response/RequestingSOAPNode/
http://www.w3.org/2002/06/soap/mep/request-response/RespondingSOAPNode/
http://www.w3.org/2002/06/soap/mep/soap-response/RequestingSOAPNode/
http://www.w3.org/2002/06/soap/mep/soap-response/RespondingSOAPNode/)

The main problem with this is that the HTTP binding text tries to 
describe support for both request-response and soap-response in the 
same place (section 7.5) by only referring to the relative state names. 
This was OK before we made the state names absolute since 
Sending+Receiving was effectively one state shared by both state 
machines. Yhat was why I left the value of reqres:Role in table 9 
unchanged in my original edit - to make both state machines share the 
same state names.

I think we have two options:

(i) rethink the base URI for the states such that they are shared by 
both request-response and soap-response - or -
(ii) Split section 7.5 into two, one for each state machine.

I'd prefer (i) but LC issue 305 might push our choice to (ii).
