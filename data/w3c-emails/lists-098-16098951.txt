Isn't the only place that 'RequestingSOAPNode' and 'RespondingSOAPNode'
only appear at the very top of 7.5.

Why not just change the bullets to read

For binding instances conforming to this specification:

A SOAP node instantiated at an HTTP client may assume the role
(i.e. the property reqres:Role ) of
"http://www.w3.org/2002/06/soap/mep/request-response/RequestingSOAPNode"
or "http://www.w3.org/2002/06/soap/mep/soap-response/RequestingSOAPNode"

A SOAP node instantiated at an HTTP server may assume the role
(i.e. the property reqres:Role ) of
"http://www.w3.org/2002/06/soap/mep/request-response/RespondingSOAPNode"
or "http://www.w3.org/2002/06/soap/mep/soap-response/RespondingSOAPNode"


Would that work?
