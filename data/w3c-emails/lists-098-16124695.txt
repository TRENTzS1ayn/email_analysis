Fine with me.  It was always my my understanding that the following was 
offered for exactly the purpose to which we're about to apply it:  I.e. as 
the editors' embodiment of the F2F decision.  So, I'm happy to proceed 
with this.   I think the earlier concerns may have come from Jean-Jacques 
and/or Gudge.  If they're  OK, I'd say we send a note to the WG indicating 
something along the lines of:

"We editors were asked to implement the F2F decision on 221.  For some 
time we had trouble getting concensus among the editors and accordingly 
picked up a to do to offer alternatives to the WG.  The editors have no in 
fact reached concensus on the following text.  Accordingly, since the only 
reason for consulting the WG was to get their assistance in gaining 
concensus. we are checking in this text and closing the issue in our list. 
 If this is not acceptable, please alert us ASAP (and of course, we can 
always revert the text if necessary.)

That way we can just do it and move on, I think. 

Thanks.

From an editorial POW, I am fine with this reformulation and if we all
think this is within the realm of editorial discretion then we should
just do it.
