The attached file is a little befunge-93 program that can convert "tag:"
URIs to "HTTP" URIs. There are some befunge-93 interpreters out there [1],
but I don't expect it to be of any serious use. I was just hacking.

Just got the new draft, BTW... seems good from what I can tell, but I'll
have to go through it properly :-)

Cheers,
