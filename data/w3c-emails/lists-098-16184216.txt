You might also like TRAMP, which makes RDFLib a bit more Pythonic:

Tradition in FOAF is to generally use anonymous nodes (nodes with no 
URI, so the parser has to generate one) and then use homepage, email 
and other properties to figure out who's who. Frankly, I think this is 
a stupid idea and give my foafy self a URI (http://me.aaronsw.com/).

I use it on my site, not my weblog.
