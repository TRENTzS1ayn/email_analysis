right, that

Proof       EntailmentTest   | Reasoner
-----------------------------------------------------------
Found       Positive         | OK
Found       Negative         | NOT OK (unsound)
Not Found   Positive         | OK for *incomplete* reasoner
Not Found   Negative         | OK

thinking about Jim's cardinality tests I think
we can have a nice example of a consistency test
for maxCardinality, I will try that today
BUT what about minCardinality
wouldn't it make sense to have also a kind of
completeness test?
I know that this sounds dangerous, but how else
could one make sense of a minCardinality test?
I mean something like
  given these facts, is this complete w.r.t.
  that particular property (in this case
  minCardinality)

no, I have them here and I will check them in into w3ccvs
sorry about that, but I was confused...

checked that out, is OK
