It's surprising that this file is served with the mime type "text/plain".
Hopefully the URI http://www.w3.org/2001/08/rdfweb/svg-foaf.html works
correctly.

This is my personal opinion about your "Things to Explore"
1. Annotea is able to annotate any part of XML document. If you have a SVG 
path that
   describes a part of an image you can annotate if with Annotea.
2. SVG and RDF are both XML applications.
3. The role of the Amaya Transformation language is to help the user in his 
editing
   task, like restructuring a set of paragraphs to generate a list of items.
   I don't know what kind of transformation you want to do, but if they are 
more than
   that it's a good idea to use an external XSLT.
4. No opinion.
5. I don't know what do you mean by "drag-and-drop editing of paths"?
   Concerning the SVG editing in Amaya, it is limited today. But a new INRIA 
engineer
   joined the Amaya team. His plan is to develop this functionality.
