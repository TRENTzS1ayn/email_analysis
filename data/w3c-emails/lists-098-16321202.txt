Hi Jeremy,

after I just replied that the attachment was probably
not what you intended, I was able to get the here attached
document from my local server after w3ccvs checkout
(wonderful, isn't it that Web)

well, I haven't found them in there
but I guess that's easy to fix

that's definitely meeting what I intended
or it's a positve entailment ;-)

> I've added Manifest description section.

looks fine to me

> References looking OK

what about filling the "Missing ref."s with
[RDF Test Cases] http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-testcases/

[Dublin Core] http://dublincore.org/documents/

[N3] http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/Primer.html
     Notation3 Primer - a quick introduction to semantic web using cwm and
n3
     Tim Berners-Lee, Dan Connolly

or w.r.t. to OWL pointing to
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/WebOnt/#FreqLinks1

good idea

right, I had to read that more carefully

points.

yes, time doen't permit very much
