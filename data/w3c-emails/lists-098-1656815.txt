Hmm, hadn't meant to advertise it in using it to share context with
the apache folks. I don't mind, it's just funny how urls get around.

"Drafty", I like the word.

I can commit to respond to comments and update this document in a
moderate timeframe. I am a bit distracted recently, but should be able
to be attentive to this.

I think the question is whether SOAP agents are expected to identify
the endpoint via some HTTP header so that firewalls can be allerted to
do application specific investigation.

We appreciate that.

There aren't a lot of automatic mapping details yet. This is an area
that needs some work. In the mean time, individual applications may
implement their own mappings to HTTP Extensions.

If you are referring to "Looking Past the MIME Header", I propose this
alternative to make it clear what people are implying when saying that
SOAP headers can be used to communicate the semantics which we
customarily get from the HTTP method.

tx, I sent this to www-archive in case someone wished to reference it.
