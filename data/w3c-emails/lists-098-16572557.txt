Re sgml-data, the following DTD catalog chain prevents any subsequent
HTML DTDs from being processed. For me, the issue arose when I was
using an xhtml1 [1] DTD:
  /etc/sgml/catalog:
   CATALOG /usr/lib/sgml/transitional.cat
  /usr/lib/sgml/transitional.cat:
   CATALOG /usr/share/sgml/html/dtd/catalog
  /usr/share/sgml/html/dtd/catalog:
   -- The Default DOCTYPE File ............................................. --
   -- Used the latest WWW standard if the doctype is html                    --
   DOCTYPE html                                                                    4.01/loose.dtd
   DOCTYPE HTML                                                                    4.01/loose.dtd

First request, wipe out DOCTYPE html entries from this (and all)
catalogs, or, give users a high priority dialog preinst message that
says they won't be able to add html DTDs to their systems via the
sanctioned update-catalog mechanism. See html_dtd_catalog.diff

Second request, for psgml mode, state what file had a DOCTYOPE
match. Currently, the frustrated user (that's me), can
(setq sgml-trace-entity-lookup t) and see:
  Start looking for dtd entity html public -//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN// system http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd
    catalog: /home/eric/WWW/2002/02/21-WSDL-RDF-mapping/catalog empty/non existent
    catalog: /etc/sgml/catalog exists
    catalog: /usr/lib/sgml/transitional.cat empty/non existent
    catalog: /etc/sgml/sgml-data.cat exists
    catalog: /usr/share/sgml/dtd/catalog exists
    catalog: /usr/share/sgml/entities/catalog exists
    catalog: /usr/share/sgml/entities/sgml-iso-entities-8879.1986/catalog exists
    catalog: /usr/share/sgml/entities/sgml-iso-entities-9573-13.1991/catalog exists
    catalog: /usr/share/sgml/entities/xml-iso-entities-8879.1986/catalog exists
    catalog: /usr/share/sgml/html/dtd/4.0/catalog exists
    catalog: /usr/share/sgml/html/dtd/4.01/catalog exists
    catalog: /usr/share/sgml/html/dtd/iso-15445/catalog exists
    catalog: /usr/share/sgml/html/dtd/catalog exists
    >> /usr/share/sgml/html/dtd/4.01/loose.dtd [by doctype html]
The attached patch (psgml-parse.el.diff) changes the last line to
    >> /usr/share/sgml/html/dtd/4.01/loose.dtd [by doctype html in /usr/share/sgml/html/dtd/catalog]

Hopefully, this will make such problems much easier to find in the
future. I would still caution against "DOCTYPE html" entries
(sgml-data issue above) as it will take the naive user a long time to
figoure out to turn on sgml-trace-entity-lookup and know what to look
for. I know, I was such a naive user.
In the process I learned edebug and lisp, but that was probably excessive.

This issue did not become a problem until I decieded to see why it was
I needed xemacs in order to have xml-mode work for (!x)emacs. xemacs
installs xhmtl1 dtds so I never had to use update-catalog to append it
with pointers to downloaded catalogs files. It may be nice to include
those in sgml-data as well.

I have archived [2] this mail so I and others may reference it easily.
