Paul, Mark, and Robert,

this message is to bring your attention to a proposal for the HTTP
binding in WSDL 1.2:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-ws-desc/2003Mar/0068.html
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-ws-desc/2003Apr/0024.html

This proposal has been presented to the WSDL WG:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-ws-desc/2003Apr/att-0019/20030403.irc.log.html

However, I have to admit that the interest for the HTTP binding in the
WSDL WG is low. I was therefore asked to ask you to review (and provide
feedback?) on the proposal, given your interest in the past for this
binding.

Thank you,
Philippe
