OK, Thanks.

Does it have to be on the point, or can it be on the marker? Also, is it
possible to have a keyboard interface that allow navigation to each point,
and then a move function (up, down, left, right keys, maybe with a modifier
key for bigger steps)?

cheers

Charles the never-quite-satisfied ;-)

  A Ctrl + Left button on a point should let you move the point.
  The problem is to catch the point with the mouse.
