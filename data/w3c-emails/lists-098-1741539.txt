Why didn't I think of this before?

   @namespace xhtml url(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml);
   xhtml|head[profile="http://profile.org/#"] + * xhtml|em { color:
#170573; }

It works in latest versions of Mozilla/Netscape6; (fairly) CSS2 compliant
browsers. You'd have to set a "normal" stylesheet:-

   em { color: #170573; }

and reference it from the page as a stylesheet, and then prompt people who
are using a CSS2 complient browser to add the profile style to a user
stylesheet.

Maybe it'd be a lot easier if people just embedded markup in different
namespaces in their XHTML... but oh, what MMIE type to serve it as?!

This has been another non-sensical late-night rant from...
