interesting/useful mailing list software feature: reject apparent
duplicate messages based on checksum of (partial) message bodies.

(but what is up with the both-justified text formatting? ugh!)

Subject:      Rejected posting to yyyyyyy@example.org
To: user@example.org


Your message  is being returned to  you unprocessed because it  appears to have
already been distributed to the yyyyyyy list. That is, a message with identical
text (but  possibly with different  mail headers) has  been posted to  the list
recently, either by you or by someone else. If you have a good reason to resend
this message  to the  list (for instance  because you have  been notified  of a
hardware failure with  loss of data), please  alter the text of  the message in
some way and resend  it to the list. Note that altering  the "Subject:" line or
adding blank lines at  the top or bottom of the message  is not sufficient; you
should  instead add  a  sentence or  two  at  the top  explaining  why you  are
resending the  message, so that the  other subscribers understand why  they are
getting two copies of the same message.
