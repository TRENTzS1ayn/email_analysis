we were thinking about a proposal for RDF/RDFS entailment tests

and Pat suggested

Because Pat talked about "references to the numbers in the MT table"
we found that the easiest thing to do (and fitting with
"the so called proof thing is a SOUND ARGUMENT").
So it is just used for that purpose
and indeed it requires
====
this log:forAll :s :p :o.
{ :s :p :o } log:implies { :s a rdfs:Resource }.
====
or maybe we have to find another predicate which is true
