Could you possibly use rdf:about for all of the declared terms? Then the
RDF will work locally as well as on the W3C server.

[[[
When possible, use rdf:about rather than rdf:ID
Your data will be able to be stored locally then, and will port much
easier.
For example, if you use: <rdf:Description rdf:ID="myProp"> in the file is
stored at "http://blargh.org/", then the ID resolves to
"http://blargh.org/#myProp". However, if this is then moved onto a local
filing system, the URI might change to "file:///c:/blargh.rdf#myProp".
