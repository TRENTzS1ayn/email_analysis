Hi Graham.  CCd to www-archive, not www-tag.

I fear I'm not communicating very well ...

For sure, but it's not specific to RFC 2774.  RFC 2616 includes at
least two headers that use the same referencing capability; Vary, and
Connection.  It's really inherrent to 2616 IMO (or perhaps 822), because
header syntax treats header content as opaque, so only the header names
can be used as reference points for other headers.

This isn't saying that Content-features isn't useful, it's just pointing
out the cost of using it over using separate headers.
