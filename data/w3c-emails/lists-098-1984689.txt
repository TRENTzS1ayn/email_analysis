Yes, agreed.  That is really what I was getting at with the bit of my 
message you didn't quote:  header fields are indeed a natural "unit" of 
metadata information in HTTP, but they do have their limitations.

Again, agreed, there is a cost to bear.

The point you raised, to which I responded, was that having Vary: apply to 
the Content-features field (rather than a feature tag) somehow meant that 
Content-features could not be used for content negotiation in HTTP.  Sure, 
I accept it would require negotiation software to delve inside the header 
content.  In this respect, it's little different from RFC 2295 "Transparent 
Content Negotiation in HTTP".  Indeed, the CONNEG work was designed with a 
view to being usable for content with both HTTP web access and Email, and 
Koen Holtman who implemented RFC 2295 in Apache was at one point 
considering updating his implementation to use the CONNEG framework.

Anyway, so much for the history.  One of my reasons for pursuing this 
debate was to raise awareness that I think that there is a path to 
convergence in RDF (+OWL?) for the IETF CONNEG work and W3C CC/PP work.  I 
am involved with some proposals that we'll see RFC 2506 feature tags mapped 
into URI space.  Tnen, CC/PP will be able to use the feature tags published 
and documented for CONNEG.  The description logic work that underpins 
DAML/OIL also provides a subsumption calculatio0n that is similar to 
conneg's feature matching.  So, in time, I think there's a path to 
fine-grained content negotiation that sits neatly in the family of Web 
technologies.
