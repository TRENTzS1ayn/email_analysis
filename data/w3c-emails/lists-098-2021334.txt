I've converted one of the earlier RDF/XML examples with your name in it (as
content).

If the rest of the WG accept these test cases then they will become part of
the RDF specs.

Are you happy with this, or would you prefer me to use a fictional
character?
(Note particularly the first two Black cases about "Du&#x308;rst" who
clearly isn't you!)

(Also do you think putting the literals starting with a combining character
into a grey area is satisfactory for the RDF specs? Assuming we get to rec
before you do!)
