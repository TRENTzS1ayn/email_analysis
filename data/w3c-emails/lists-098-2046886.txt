Core Working Group (as chaired by Brian McBride, cced). We agreed earlier
today to publish the first draft of this document as an Internet-Draft.

It is included below in both plain text and nroff as generated by Marshall
Rose's xml2rfc.tcl.

Many thanks for your help,

Abstract

   This document describes a media type (application/rdf+xml) for use
   with the XML serialization of the Resource Description Framework
   (RDF).  RDF is a language designed to support the Semantic Web, by
   facilitating resource description and data exchange on the Web.  RDF
   provides common structures that can be used for interoperable data
   exchange and follows the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) design
   principles of interoperability, evolution, and decentralization.

2. Introduction

   RDF is a language designed to support the Semantic Web, by
   facilitating resource description and data exchange on the Web.  RDF
   provides common structures that can be used for interoperable data
   exchange and follows the W3C design principles of interoperability,
   evolution, and decentralization.

   While the RDF data model [2] can be serialized in many ways, the W3C
   has defined the RDF/XML syntax [1] to allow RDF to be serialized in
   an XML format.  The application/rdf+xml media type allows RDF
   consumers to identify RDF/XML documents so that they can be processed
   properly.

3. application/rdf+xml Registration

   This is a media type registration as defined in Multipurpose Internet
   Mail Extensions (MIME) Part Four: Registration Procedures [6]

      MIME media type name: application

      MIME subtype name: rdf+xml

      Required parameters: none

      Optional parameters: charset

         Same as charset parameter of application/xml as specified in
         RFC 3023 [4] or the most recent specification that supercedes
         it.

      Encoding considerations:

         Same as charset parameter of application/xml as specified in
         RFC 3023 [4] or the most recent specification that supercedes
         it.

      Security considerations:

         Security considerations include many of those described in
         section 10 of RFC 3023 [4] and more, due to the semantic nature

         of RDF.  RDF documents may make assertions about anything and
         it is expected that future work with Digital Signature and "Web
         of Trust" will make it more clear how to build secure RDF
         systems.

      Interoperability considerations:

         It is recommended that RDF documents follow the newer RDF/XML
         Syntax Grammar [1] as opposed to the older RDF Model and Syntax
         specification [3].

      Published specification: see RDF/XML Syntax Grammar [1] and RDF
      Model Theory [2] (working drafts as of 2002-03) and the older RDF
      Model and Syntax [3]

      Applications which use this media type:

         RDF is device-, platform-, and vendor-neutral and is supported
         by a range of Web user agents and authoring tools.

      Additional information:

         Magic number(s): none

            Although no byte sequences can be counted on to consistently
            identify RDF, RDF documents will have the sequence "http://
            www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" to identify the RDF
            namespace.  This will usually be towards the top of the
            document.

         Consortium.  The W3C and the W3C RDF Core Working Group have
         change control over the specification.


4. Fragment Identifiers

   Section 4.1 of the URI specification [5] notes that the semantics of
   a fragment identifier (part of a URI after a "#") is a property of
   the data resulting from a retrieval action, and that the format and
   interpretation of fragment identifiers is dependent on the media type
   of the retrieval result.

   However, in RDF, the thing identified by a URI with fragment
   identifier does not bear any particular relationship to the thing
   identified by the URI alone.  This differs from some readings of the
   URI specification [5], so attention is recommended when creating new
   RDF terms which use fragment identifiers.

   The rdf:ID and rdf:about attributes can be used to define fragments
   in an RDF document.

5. Historical Considerations

   This media type was reserved in RFC 3023 [4], saying:

      RDF documents identified using this MIME type are XML documents
      whose content describes metadata, as defined by [RDF].  As a
      format based on XML, RDF documents SHOULD use the '+xml' suffix
      convention in their MIME content-type identifier.  However, no
      content type has yet been registered for RDF and so this media
      type should not be used until such registration has been
      completed.


6. IANA Considerations

   This document calls for registration of a new MIME content-type,
   according to the registration template in section 2.

7. Acknowledgements

   Thanks to Dan Connolly for writing the first version of this draft
   [8], to Andy Powell for reminding us we needed one, to Marshall Rose
   for his xml2rfc [9] converter, and to Graham Klyne, Jan Grant and
   Dave Beckett for their helpful comments on early versions of this
   document.
