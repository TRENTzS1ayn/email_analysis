But RFC3023 says that "Fragment identification" is part of the
'generic' processing implied by foo+xml.

--- http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3023.txt ---
7. A Naming Convention for XML-Based Media Types
    This document recommends the use of a naming convention (a suffix of
   '+xml') for identifying XML-based MIME media types, whatever their
   particular content may represent.  This allows the use of generic XML
   processors and technologies on a wide variety of different XML
   document types at a minimum cost, using existing frameworks for media
   type registration. 
...
   Some areas where 'generic' processing is useful include:
...
   o  Fragment identification - XPointers (work in progress) can work
      with any XML document, whatever vocabulary it uses and whether or
      not it uses XPointer for its own fragment identification.

just being a nit
