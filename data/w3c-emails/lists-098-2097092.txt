I'm not sure you are -- that conflict looks unpleasant.  The XPointer
people need to clarify that: do XPointer semantics apply to all
application/FOO+xml media types (as your text suggests), or only those
who say it does in their definition.  And if the latter, as the
suggest, what's going on between W3C and IETF on this?  Can you do an
official comment on it?

So when are you going to hatch into a louse?   I'm not sure I want to
be around for that!
