Do you agree that for Semantic Web purposes we can read the phrase "a
representation" of something (in REST documents) as "a serialization
of an RDF Graph mentioning/describing" the thing?

There's a lot of confusion because in some communities the word
"respresentation" means a "symbol standing for the thing"
instead of this meaning, which is more like "an asserted logical
formula containing a symbol standing for the thing."

(I don't think you've met -- you just seem like the right person
person to ask this.   I've CC'd www-archive for reference.)
