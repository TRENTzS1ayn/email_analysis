Since the representation is bound to change over time (and as you're
blithely ignoring content negotiation etc.), you can't use
http://www.mnot.net/ to identify the bits. You can only do something like
that when you're sure that the representation is fixed - and even then you
must be sure to point out that you're identifying in the representation and
not the resource to which is has a one-to-one correspondence.

It's quite easy to point to the bits in RDF. All you do is use some
properties:-

[ :theBitsAt <http://www.mnot.net/>;
  :date "2002-04-11T12-33-30";
  :contentType "text/html" ] .

Simple. Or you can use a hash as you pointed out (in fact, you can add that
to the mess of properties above).
