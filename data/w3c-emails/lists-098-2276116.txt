The practice is not necessarily direct, but the style is.

An HTTP GET is *asking for* something.

Other approaches to URI processing *ask about* something.

Minor change, major ramifications, especially since many URIs offer no
direct means of asking for but you can always ask about anything, even
HTTP URIs.  

Intermediaries are interesting, but very different.
