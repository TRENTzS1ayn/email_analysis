Hi All,

Can someone explain to me what the Change Column Layout link on 
<<http://www.w3.org/wai>http://www.w3.org/wai> does?? I tried to figure it out
by exploring the 
screen with JAWS and Window-Eyes outside their buffered (VPC or MSAA Mode) 
view of the page.? This is more like moving the mouse around the screen to 
see what's present.

I'm asking for an explanation because it wasn't obvious to me what was 
supposed to be changing.? Also, is whatever this page does something more 
web sites should be doing?
