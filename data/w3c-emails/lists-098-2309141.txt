Hi Kelly,

With your help I found the link to "Change Column Layout" on
<http://www.w3.org/wai>www.w3.org/wai.
Near the top there are four links "news - about - participation - resources"
and then, an icon which shows two vertical bars right arrow one vertical
bar" with the alt text and title "Change column layout." What that link does
is to take the column of navigation links which appear down the right side
and put them at the bottom. It removes the table that is used for formatting
and displays the page exactly as you see it, linearized. The two views of
<http://www.w3.org/wai>www.w3.org/wai are indistinguishable with the screen
reader.

Subject: [webwatch] Change Column Layout on WAI Page


Hi All,

Can someone explain to me what the Change Column Layout link on
<<http://www.w3.org/wai>http://www.w3.org/wai> does?? I tried to figure it out
by exploring the
screen with JAWS and Window-Eyes outside their buffered (VPC or MSAA Mode)
view of the page.? This is more like moving the mouse around the screen to
see what's present.

I'm asking for an explanation because it wasn't obvious to me what was
supposed to be changing.? Also, is whatever this page does something more
web sites should be doing?
