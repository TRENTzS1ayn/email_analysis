It was requested in our meeting yesterday at kr2002 that
the people on the small group shoudl be sent the email with our toulouse proposal first before the proposal was sent to the entire list.  thus, frank and i sent to the smaller list before sending to the full webont list so that members not present in toulous could have one chance to participate in the subgroup effort before results were reported to the larger group.

I am sending this to the archive 
in order to be compliant with both requests.
