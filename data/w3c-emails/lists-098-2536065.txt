This just looks like hand-waving and appeal to Authority,
not an actual technical argument.

Not to say that the burden of persuasion is necessarily
on you; but if you're trying to persuade me, this doesn't
do it. I would like to understand the technical argument.

which layering requirements? Definite descriptions
without clear referents don't help much.

What do you mean by 'syntactic constructions' here?
By my reckonning, the syntactic constructions of
WebOnt are exactly the same as those of RDF:

  terms: literals, bnodes, and URIref names
  atoms: S P O triples.
  formulas: conjunctions of atoms.

Please give an example of what you mean by syntactic
construct.

Quite. That's by design, and seems quite natural to me.

He has shown that it *can* be very dangerous.
He has not shown, to my satisfaction, that it
is must be dangerous in every case; that
there is no design that avoids the problems.

Look, if it's that well-studied, just spell out (or at
least point to) the argument. An appeal to authority
only makes me more suspicious of your position;
recall our exchange about orthodoxy and Des-Cartes
experiences.

Meanwhile, you found it worthwhile to read and criticize
Jeremy's attempt to do exactly this, no?
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-webont-wg/2002Apr/0202.html

That criticism doesn't seem to say that it's hopeless to
persue this line of work.

I don't understand how to reconcile your messages.
