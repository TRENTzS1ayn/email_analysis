I'm not sure what log:semantics is either, formally;
but re cyc-style lifting, see

ont:imports isn't just magic syntax. It's a property
that relates ontology documents. It can be specialized
using subProperty.

For example, in OntX:

my:imports rdfs:subPropertyOf ont:imports.

<> my:imports <OntY>.

:Collie rdfs:subClassOf :Dog.
:Lassie rdf:type :Collie.

in OntY:

:Dog rdfs:subClassOf :Animal.


So Lassie is an animal; but you have to do reasoning
to figure out what to import from OntX.
