Sure, I concur. Im just sloppy about CC lines, I tend to use the ones 
that get put in automatically.

I wasn't giving an argument. As Guus requested, I was trying to give 
clarification on what the issue was.

That OWL syntax be RDF syntax and that OWL interpretations include 
the same commitments as RDF interpretations (ie that an OWL 
interpretation of X which makes X true contains, or is an extension 
of, an RDF interpretation of X which also makes X true.)

Well, that is obviously wrong, even of DAML, since the DAML meanings 
of the RDF graphs are not *conjunctions* of the RDF meanings of the 
DAML triples.

In the case of DAML, I mean the lists in things like intersectionOf. 
The DAML MT treats them (correctly) as syntactic primitives, not as 
implicit existential assertions.

Even when the class that RDF says exists is the Russell set in OWL? 
Why would that be natural?

Right. OK, if you want to get involved with foundations of set theory 
every time a web language is created, then I guess you are entitled 
to take your life in that direction. Seems pointless to me. Apart 
from the waste of time, I would have no confidence that Id be able to 
do it. Proving consistency of set theories is heavy work.

Im thinking of the Russell paradox in set theory, Goedel 
incompleteness, Turing undecideability, Tarski's results on 
meta-descriptions (a consistent language can't be the same expressive 
power as its own metatheory), Montague's paradox (showing that even 
quite weak languages can't consistently describe their own 
semantics), and Quine's attempts to construct set theories that 
avoided the ZF constructions by using more 'natural' comprehension 
principles, like his New Foundations and the odd system in Set Theory 
and Its Logic - the first logic book I ever read! - which are now 
considered to be historical curiosities. (If Quine could't do it, I 
certainly can't do it.) Oh, and Kripke's demolition job on the 
substitutional interpretation of modal quantifiers.  All of these 
have a common theme: they are all variations on the liar paradox, 
which all lead to the conclusion that when you try to let a language 
define itself, or use definitions of its own semantics or meanings at 
all 'freely' (ie except under *very* tightly 'layered' conditions, eg 
ramified type theory, say, or Tarski's strict heirarchy of 
meta/meta-meta/..languages, each stronger than the one below it) then 
you get paradoxes. People have tried just about every dodge to get 
round it and none of them have worked.

Im not appealing to MY authority, in case you think I am, by the way. 
I'm not an expert in this stuff. Chris Menzel for example knows this 
area much better than I do. Feel free to ask anyone else about it.

Come on!!  I only read the damn thing because you yelled at me during 
the telecon about it. Normally I don't bother to read ideas about how 
to re-do set theory properly, unless they come with a VERY good 
provenance.  But you asked me to look at it and say what was wrong 
with it, and I said I would, so I did.

Perhaps I didnt express myself forcefully enough. It was meant to 
convey that general idea.

>I don't understand how to reconcile your messages.

I think Ive been fairly consistent on this issue. Maybe Ive been too 
polite at times, but we all have to try to get along.
