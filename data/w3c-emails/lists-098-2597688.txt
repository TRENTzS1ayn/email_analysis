nope.

Yes, they are; that is: the DAML meanings are
complete w.r.t. the RDF semantics; the DAML+OIL semantics
(the way I see them; ala the axiomatic semantics)
further constrain interpretations. But we've switched from syntax
to semantics somehow here...

intersectionOf is (a name for) a property that relates
one class to a list of classes. It's not a syntactic
primitive.

It is specified thus:

  <rdfs:comment>
    for intersectionOf(X, Y) read: X is the intersection of the classes
in the list Y;
    i.e. if something is in all the classes in Y, then it's in X, and
vice versa.

No, that's not natural. I'm not convinced that RDF (along
with DAML+OIL semantics) says it exists.

OK, stalemate there.

Those I'm familiar with...

That one I don't know; it seems clearly relevant; I'll
have to study it. Pointers are welcome.

OK; I see now. Thanks.
