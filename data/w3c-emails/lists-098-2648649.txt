I very strongly agree with this point and indeed I said  similar 
things at the f2f in Amsterdam.  It is crazy that we are making our 
life difficult by imposing a RDF syntactic compatibility constraint, 
which may only be worth enforcing for a short period anyway. We 
should rather focus on semantic compatibility (and indeed we do!)
