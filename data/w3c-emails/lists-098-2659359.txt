Just a small FYI correction: dc:creator means for creator(x, y) that x has
the creator y. Actually, it's not remarkably clear from the DCMI
documentation:-

[[[
<rdf:Property rdf:about="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/creator">
  <rdfs:label>Author/Creator</rdfs:label>
  <rdfs:comment>An entity primarily responsible for making the content of
the resource.</rdfs:comment>
  <eor:comment>Examples of a Creator include a person, an organisation, or
a service. Typically, the name of a Creator should be used to indicate the
entity.</eor:comment>
  <rdfs:isDefinedBy rdf:resource="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" />
  </rdf:Property>
]]]
- http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/creator

Dan Connolly notes that documenting with a for x(y, z) ... syntax is
important:-

[[[
comments: use full sentences! don't say "the size of the object". say "for
size(X, Y) read: the size of X is Y."

You may want to update the schema to make it less confusing.
