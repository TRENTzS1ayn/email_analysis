I like very much the way you grouped functionalities. I think it 
provides the right level of granularity for this discussion on 
compliance level.  However, I am not sure about the new proposal. My 
idea of a level 1 was something like a 'basic frame language', one 
which however is not as 'basic' as RDFS.  Your proposal, as Mike also 
points out, focuses on properties, rather than additional machinery 
for slot specification.  My intuition is that this is not what 
'basic' users of OWL will need.  What I would like to see is the RDF 
Schema stuff + machinery for specifying value/range/cardinality 
restrictions.  We could then discuss whether to add (In)equality & 
Property characteristics, but I guess these extensions will greatly 
complicate the implementation of reasoners for basic OWL, and may 
make pointless to have a distinction between level 1 and 2.
