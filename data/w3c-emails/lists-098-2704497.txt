Hello www-archive,

 This is an SVG test file for Indic language support, and two
 screenshots from implementations. One from Adobe ASV3 which has clear
 faults in the arabic script portions, and one from Batik 1.5beta1
 which appears to be okay.

 I am posting this to allow people who can read these languages to
 comment on the renderings. Comments on suitable fonts, particularly
 for non-Windows platforms, and screenshots from other implementations
 would also be welcome.
