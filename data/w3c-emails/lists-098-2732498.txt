Hi

I was dissapointed to follow a link from
http://www.oakland.edu/~grossman/related.html to your site
http://linux.com/interact/newsitem.phtml?sid=1&aid=12289
just now, only to find that you've 'improved' your site by breaking a
bunch of links.

For reference, the referring HTML says

[[
Kristina Pfaff-Harris
has written a delightful article
called ?Six Degrees of Paul Erd?s? for linux.com.
]]

I'd like to track down this article. Any chance you could repair some of
the broken links? See [1] for more background on why you might consider
spending time doing this.

cheers,

Dan
