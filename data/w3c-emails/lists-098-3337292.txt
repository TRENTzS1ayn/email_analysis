(Ah -- you noticed - I see  - in later mail.)

(You were  parsing it as N3.  Try cwm --rdf;

$ cwm --rdf http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/testSchema.rdf 
--no
$

It interesting that the parser keeps going assuming that
everything is a lot of long URls until it hits that
bit which happens to look like an n3 qname!)

Maybe I should make cwm by default, instead of
assuming N3  use the (try use content-type except guess) algorithm
which log:semantics uses.
