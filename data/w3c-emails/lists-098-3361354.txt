In llyn.py, why does the intern method
care whether there's a '#' or not in the URI?

In thing.py, why does the Symbol class
not include stuff like <foo#bar>?

I would think that contact:homePage
is a symbol.

I'd like to talk more about who interns what.
I'm having a lot of trouble tracking down
bugs... well, actually, I'm having trouble
figuring out whether various things are bugs
or not; i.e. what the invariants are.
