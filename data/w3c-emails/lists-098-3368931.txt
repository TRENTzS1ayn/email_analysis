reviewing recent changes, I see in
the log:uri built-in:


+       Note that relative URIs can be OK as the whole process
+       has a base, which may be irrelevant.

That's taken care of elsewhere in the code, no?
i.e. a base URI is constructed on input, and
then subtracted out on output.

If I just write
this log:forAll :X, :Y, :TXT.
:something rdfs:label "../foo".
{ :X rdfs:label :TXT.
          :Y log:uri :TXT } log:implies { ... }

in an N3 document, that shouldn't bind :Y,
should it? the ../foo label for something
could come from a different file. strings
don't carry their base URI around with them.

I guess I should write a test. But
this seems plain to me.
