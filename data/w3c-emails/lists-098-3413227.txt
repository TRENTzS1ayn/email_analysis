Argh, you're right: log:n3ExprFor. It's a silly error that I shouldn't have
made, but it does make me wonder whether semantics and n3ExprFor couldn't
be unified. The domain would be a union of Document and Literal, and AFAIK
it would be consistent, even if it does confuse people as to the difference
between a document and its log:content.
