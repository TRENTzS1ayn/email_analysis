In Jan 2000, I made a link from
  http://www.w3.org/2000/01/ala2349/all.htm
to
  XML Files, Oct 1998
  http://www.gca.org/memonly/xmlfiles/issue10/ice.htm

now I see

"GCA is now IDEAlliance. The information once found at this location can
now be found on our new site. Please use the navigation elements above
to find what you were looking for."

Er... I don't see why this burden is now mine.
Please undo whatever you broke, or at least
install HTTP redirects.

Pls see
