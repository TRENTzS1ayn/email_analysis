Yep Redfoot and RDFLib. 

RDFLib ( http://rdflib.net/ ) is probably the
one to look at first. It contains an RDF/XML parser and serializer, an
in memory TripleStore with query methods, etc.

Redfoot ( http://redfoot.net/ ) builds on RDFLib with functionality
such as integration with an HTTP server (Medusa) etc. Good for
creating RDF driven web sites.

If anyone has questions on either RDFLib or Redfoot, feel free to stop
by #redfoot on irc://irc.openprojects.net/
