Pat,

Here's the updated WD, taking into account typed literal nodes
and untidy literals.

Since the datatyping semantics are now pretty much based on
rdfs:range and "normal" RDF typing, the datatyping specific
MT seems to be pretty simple.

I was able to cut out *alot* of stuff from the previous
version, since none of the datatype property domain/range
constraints apply anymore, etc.

Feel free to modify the attached version as needed and submit it
to the WG.

Cheers,

Patrick
