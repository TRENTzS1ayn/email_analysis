Here you are...

Sounds reasonnable.

Since we don't indicate what happens when faults are generated in the first
place, I think the most we can say is that intermediaries MAY forward fault
messages.

However, I am wondering whether this is not raising a deeper issue, which
is how intermediaries forward response messages. I think sections 2.7.* are
written from the POV of request messages; do they cover adequately response
messages?

I also don't think we should.

I'm confused by the issue as well. Ignore?

Agree.

I think this would improve readability (although, strictly speaking, prefix
should be replaced by the corresponding URI ;-)).

I believe I have done this already about two months ago, after this were
pointed out for WSDL... BTW, this is not a stylesheet issue, we only need
to change the key in the bibtex entry (or whatever the XML production name
is).

The better long term solution would be to create and use a new XML element.
We should then s/[/<prop>/.

I agree with Marc, we should not do this. I also think this is out of scope
for the primer.

Possibly.

> 353c: I propose we change the section title from 'Rules for encoding Graphs in XML' to 'Mapping between XML and the SOAP Data Model' or some such. 20020820 MJG

Works for me.

Sounds good.

Agree.
