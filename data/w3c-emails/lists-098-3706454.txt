Well, my fever finally broke late this weekend, after hanging on all week. 
 I was back at the office for a half day yesterday, and expect nearly a 
full day to day.  Within the next day or so, will try and get to my first 
tentative contributions as an editor.  Sorry for all the delays.  I am 
also lurking on xmlp-eds today.  If there are any suggestions for one or 
two near-trivial and non-time-critical issues that I might tackle, just to 
make sure I get the mechanics right, that would probably be helpful.

Sorry for all the delays in getting back up to speed.  I have postponed 
the vacation we'd aimed for this coming weekend (until next weekend). so 
I'll have a few days to make at least some contributions (while digging 
out from 10 days of missed work.)  Thanks.
