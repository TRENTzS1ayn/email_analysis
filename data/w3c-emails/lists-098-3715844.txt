Noah,

Glad to hear you are feeling better, sorry to hear that your vacation
has been delayed.

Looking at the edtodo list, you might like to tackle 352, Section 8
XLink. It's just a deletion ( although that means adding markup and
adding an entry to the change log at the end of both part 1 and Part 2
and also updating the edtodo. ).

Should ensure that your CVS stuff is working properly

Gudge
