Well, when I tried ssh -v it asked me to enter my password, then said 
permission denied when I did.  This is the same password (I'm 95% sure) 
that worked when Yves and I set it up in Palo Alto.

cvs update (as suggested by Gudge) did no better.

The other thing to try is "ssh -v cvs.w3.org" and see where it 
hangs. This might give you some more info on how far the process is 
getting.
