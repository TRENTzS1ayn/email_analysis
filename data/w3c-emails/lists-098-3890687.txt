Getting up to speed - just looking at part 1 and 2 and noted a few
nits--otherwise looks great:

* In the inserted paragraph in section 3.1:

"The term 'SOAP Module' refers to the set of syntax and semantics
associated with implementing a particular feature (see 3.1 SOAP
Features) as SOAP headers. A Module is described in a Module
Specification, which adheres to the following rules. It:"

It uses the term "SOAP header". I think we should be careful and use
"SOAP header blocks" as otherwise people get confused as to whether we
mean *the* SOAP header or blocks. If you are ok then I can fix this.

* I don't understand the paragraph in section 3.2:

"MUST, if* the Module implements a Feature which has already been
defined elsewhere, clearly refer to that Feature's URI. Note that a
Module may EITHER explicitly refer to a separate Feature in this way OR
may implicitly define a Feature simply by describing the semantics of
the Module."

Is that a cut&paste error?

* In section 5.4.5, in the inserted paragraph:

"The Detail element information item MAY be present in a SOAP fault in
which case it carries additional information relative to the SOAP fault
codes describing the fault (see 5.4.6 SOAP Fault Codes). For example,
the Detail element information item might contain information about a
message not containing the proper credentials, a timeout, etc. The
presence of the Detail element information item has no significance as
to which parts of the faulty SOAP message were processed."

I think the last sentence easily can be misread to say that a detail
element says nothing about whether parts of the message processing
succeeded and parts failed. However, we know that a SOAP fault is for
the whole message and not parts of the message. What I think we want to
say is this:

"The presence of the Detail element information item has no significance
as to which parts of the faulty SOAP message failed during processing."

Thanks!
