The only thing we can do is re-open the issue and state why. I did 
this for one of the other post LC issues and the resolution was 
changed - I can;t remember the issue number off hand.

I think this is a deeper issue. Does the behaviour differ depending 
on whether the fault is due to something the intermediary did or a 
prior node in the message path ? Is there a difference between a 
request and response message as far as intermediaries are 
concerned ? How would an intermediary determine the difference ?
