BTW:  #sysreq's best minds are trying to figure out my lack of CVS access 
as we speak.  With any luck, they should have it set just as you finish 
all the edits, or failaing that, in time for my vacation mid- next week. 
Seriously, I am trying to get this turned on so I can do at least a bit of 
work with you all prior to the Sept. 3 target.  So far, they're still 
scratching heads.
