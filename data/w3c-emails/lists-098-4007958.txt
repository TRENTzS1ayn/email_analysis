David,

The spec is in pretty good shape. We've incorporated a lot of the issues
resolved at the face-to-face along with some of the editorial issues. At
this point we have 6 issues left from the face-to-face and 10 editorial
issues left to incorporate and one more editorial issue ( 373 ) which
we've punted to the WG as a whole.

Regarding editorial issues, are you expecting the editorial team to
respond to the originator of a given issue?

Regards

Gudge
For the XMLP Editorial Team
