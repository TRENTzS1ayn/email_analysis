Burned nearly 2 hours today on remote CVS debugging with #sysreg.  Still 
no luck.  RalphS has offered to help, but only at 2PM tomorrow, so it's 
looking bad for CVS this week, and it's also burning a lot of the time I'd 
allocated to editing.  Still, I feel I should do something to help.  If at 
some point one of you wants to zip up drafts, along with scripts for 
running XSL, etc. (I am not comfortable editing if I can't check the 
resulting HTML) and suggest a few changes, I might make them and have you 
check them back in.  Whether this is more or less trouble than waiting for 
me to come online officially, presumably next week, I leave to you.  With 
luck I'll have a bit of time Mon, Tues, and or Wed.  After that I'm out 
for the week, unfortunately.  Sorry for all the delays and for not being 
more help.

BTW:  #sysreq's best minds are trying to figure out my lack of CVS access 
as we speak.  With any luck, they should have it set just as you finish 
all the edits, or failaing that, in time for my vacation mid- next week. 
Seriously, I am trying to get this turned on so I can do at least a bit of 

work with you all prior to the Sept. 3 target.  So far, they're still 
scratching heads.
