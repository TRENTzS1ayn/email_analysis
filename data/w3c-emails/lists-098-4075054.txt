The link [2] may work better. FWIW, shouldn't the statement

"Let TAG be a name in an application, represented as a sequence of
characters encoded in a particular character encoding. "

instead read (change TAG to T)

"Let T be a name in an application, represented as a sequence of
characters encoded in a particular character encoding."

as T is used later but TAG is not?
