Noah,

I know we covered a lot of this on IRC and over the phone but here it is
for the record anyway.

I'm on #xmlp-eds now if you want to chat in real-time

All the files are in WWW/2000/xp/Group/2/06/LC

They will NOT move when September comes around ( if you ask me they
should not have moved when we went to LC but that's another story ;-) )

CVS deals with last modified dates. The docs you will be editing are

soap12-part1.xml, soap12-part2.xml and edtodo.html in the above
directory. These are already marked as editor's copies ( although they
still have the LC boilerplate )

Anything you 'remove' should be marked with a diff='del' attribute. This
attribute only works on certain elements so you may need to play around
to get the right effect. The main element I've put the diff attribute on
is <p>

Yes please. It lives at WWW/2000/xp/Group/2/06/LC/edtodo.html

Commit your edits using 

cvs commit -m "Log message goes here" filename

Don't forget to do a cvs update before you do any edits just in case
anyone else has changed the docs ( CVS will deal with it using merging
if you forget to do this, but it keeps merges to a minimum if you
remember to update before all editing sessions )

Don't worry about it, being sick is a perfectly good reason for not
being available to edit, I'm just glad you are feeling better.

If you have any more questions feel free to call. My number is +44 7776
231 336. I'm flying to Redmond on Sunday and will be there until Friday
evening Pacific.
