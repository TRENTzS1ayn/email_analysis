Just so the other editors know, with Gudge's help I went through the cycle 
of making a modest change (issue 357).  I might find a little time this 
weekend, but mostly will be available to help part time Mon and Tues.  So, 
I'll check in then.  If anyone wants help over the weekend, try the home 
phone 1-781-860-0689 (9AM - 9PM East Coast.)  Thanks to all for the help & 
patience.

Noah,

I know we covered a lot of this on IRC and over the phone but here it is
for the record anyway.

I'm on #xmlp-eds now if you want to chat in real-time

All the files are in WWW/2000/xp/Group/2/06/LC

They will NOT move when September comes around ( if you ask me they
should not have moved when we went to LC but that's another story ;-) )

CVS deals with last modified dates. The docs you will be editing are

soap12-part1.xml, soap12-part2.xml and edtodo.html in the above
directory. These are already marked as editor's copies ( although they
still have the LC boilerplate )

Anything you 'remove' should be marked with a diff='del' attribute. This
attribute only works on certain elements so you may need to play around
to get the right effect. The main element I've put the diff attribute on
is <p>

Yes please. It lives at WWW/2000/xp/Group/2/06/LC/edtodo.html

Commit your edits using 

cvs commit -m "Log message goes here" filename

Don't forget to do a cvs update before you do any edits just in case
anyone else has changed the docs ( CVS will deal with it using merging
if you forget to do this, but it keeps merges to a minimum if you
remember to update before all editing sessions )

Don't worry about it, being sick is a perfectly good reason for not
being available to edit, I'm just glad you are feeling better.

If you have any more questions feel free to call. My number is +44 7776
231 336. I'm flying to Redmond on Sunday and will be there until Friday
evening Pacific.
