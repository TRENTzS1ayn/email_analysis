Sorry for the delay--here are my comments...

Yup... I will follow-up on dist-app.

Yes, although there are some combinations that violate HTTP and some
that don't. I think it is ok that we don't go into that here.

I think so: As we don't say anything about how the forwarding feature is
defined for any SOAP messages other than stating that it is a feature,
this would also apply to SOAP faults--they are just a certain type of
SOAP messages.

+1

Yeah, but as I think we have the table up front in the document, I think
that's fine.

ok

Hmm, now they look like [references]--I think I would prefer some other
stylistic solution.

yup

I would say no--we just moved all examples to primer.

I actually prefer DataEncodingUnknown because "SOAPEncoding" is used to
mean the encoding defined in part 2 while this subcode can apply to any
encoding.

I don't understand this--their issue [1] says that we are not required
to do this and I think we pushed back on this some time ago, no?

Hope this makes sense,

Henrik
