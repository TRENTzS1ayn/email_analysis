Gentlemen:
Ploughing through the issues list, I notice that Issues #261, 262, 263 (closed), 264 and 265 have their "Title" reference Part 0. However the text of the issues are from Part 1.

I was wondering if you have looked at these from the POV of Part 1, or has the title misled you into skipping these?

I notice that Issue 263 was also similarly mislabelled in the title, but it was handled and closed in the F2F as a main specification (Part 1) change. So perhaps you have considered the others as well.

Thanks
Nilo
