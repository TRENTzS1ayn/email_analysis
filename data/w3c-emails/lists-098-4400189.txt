Subject: Issues 261, 262, 264 and 265 misassigned to Part 0?



Gentlemen: 
Ploughing through the issues list, I notice that Issues #261,
262, 263 (closed), 264 and 265 have their "Title" reference Part 0.
However the text of the issues are from Part 1.

I was wondering if you have looked at these from the POV of Part
1, or has the title misled you into skipping these? 

I notice that Issue 263 was also similarly mislabelled in the
title, but it was handled and closed in the F2F as a main specification
(Part 1) change. So perhaps you have considered the others as well.

Thanks 
Nilo
