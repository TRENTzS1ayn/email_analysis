I disagree.

RDF is an XML-based format, but fragment identifiers in RDF
don't (necessarily) refer to elements.

It seems to me that both in both HTML and RDF, a URI reference
foo#bar refers to 'whatever bar means in the document foo'.

I still haven't researched the details of how linking
works in SVG, so I'm not replying to www-tag just yet.

I just wanted to note that no, this isn't the issue
I was going to raise. Or maybe it is the same issue,
but it's an entirely different disposition.
