DC> RDF is an XML-based format,

I agree that RDF has an XML representation, among others. It seems
that the fragment identifier syntax for RDF is based on the RDF model
and is, thus, different to what the rest of XMl formats do.

Agreed.

I consider that an imprecise description.

It still baffles me why you need to 'research' the details of how
linking works in SVG rather than simply discussing whatever is
troubling you with Dean or myself.

OK well, my suggested text still stands as my suggested replacement for
a part of the document that other people have complained about (and
rightly complained in my view).

I guess I won't know whether its the same issue as yours or not until
you disclose what that issue is.
