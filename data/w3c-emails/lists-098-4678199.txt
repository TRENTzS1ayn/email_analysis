I've now read through Part 2. Here is a list of the things I noted, in
the order they appear in the spec.

Gudge

1.Section 1

The language we use for bullet 4 doesn't match the other bullets



2.Section 2.1

"this, if any" should read "thus, if any"

3.Section 3.1.1

We should put a cross-ref to Part 1 at the end of numbered
bullet 2.

4.Section 3.1.6

"considered to be of unspecified size" should read "considered
to have a single dimension of unspecified size"

5.Section 3.1.7

For consistency we should say the type is enc:valueType

6.Section 4

We should drop "only" from "not limited only to the SOAP HTTP
Binding" 

7.Section 4.2.2

First bullet should be removed ( left over text )

8.Section 4.2.2

The numbered bullets use the term 'terminal node', but that term
no longer exists in the data model. We should rewrite in terms of nodes
with a lexical value.

9.Section 4.4

The language in the numbered bullets doesn't seem consistent
with other language concerning infoset items

10.Section 5.1.1

First bullet has an example which is a QName ( should be a URI )

11.Section 5.1.2

Diagram. Should the cloud with "Net" in it read "Network"?
