I'll be fixing some of these since I introduced them in the first 
place (*zero*). Plus a few more. Details below.

Done. The asterisks in the original email were for empahising 
differences with the current text.

Not in the copy I looked at.

Done. I also had to remove all remaining references to the former 
Robustness section, since the spec no longer validated.

Done.

Done.

Done.

I can't find this in 3.2 MEPs.

Done.

Done. Also promoted the previous section. Also removed the diff 
markup. Also replaced "as described below:" by <specref...>.

Done. Copied the text for that section from 5.4.8, which also has 
a QName AII.

Done as part of above.

I also created subsections for 5.4.8, so the two sections are now 
symmetric, structure-wise.

Done.
