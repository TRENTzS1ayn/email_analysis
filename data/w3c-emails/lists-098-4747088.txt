Al

you may need a reality check on your irony, or maybe its an american 
thing?
anyhow apple deletes 297/300 emails a day, I hate to think how many 
personal emails get swept away, but as they say spilt milk
so I suspect their subject lines are far worse that you might hope....

on a more serious note, if sound on event becomes popular, a lot of 
people will be after my guts.
dyk that according to radio 4 in the UK mass unsolicited voice 
messaging is becoming popular, even though it is obviously  an 
extremely tiresome concept.
most probably the US has 10 years of this already

best wishes

Jonathan
