BTW Mike, another way to look at this is via a hierarchy of
generalization;


     Object/resource (all things with identity)
        +
       / \
      /   \
     /     +---Containers (all objects that can "contain" other objects)
    /              +
    |             / \
    |            /   \
 Light-Bulb      |    ...
                 
Tuple spaces coordinate at the container level, since a space is the
finest granularity of "identifiable thing" it understands, and just a
container, not a good way to model things whose state you need to
explicitly manipulate (see my "REST Compared" presentation[1] to see
how difficult it is to turn on a boolean lightbulb with tuple spaces).
