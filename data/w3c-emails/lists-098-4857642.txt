Marc and I went through the remaining of Gudge's issues for Part 1 and
here's what we think we (spec editors) need to do:

> 4Section 2.6
> 
> Bullet 3 should be reworded to be clearer and use infoset terms.
> "The Value of Code" seems ambiguous in the current langauge.

First time in each part expand with what it really means.

Marc to send out a note to the WG asking for guidance and also regarding
whether the sig stuff should go in appendix

Just do it

Do nothing

Just do it

Just do it

Nope, the constraint is on the parent. Do nothing.

Just do it

Just do it

Just do it

Just do it
