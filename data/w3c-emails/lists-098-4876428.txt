Marc and I went through the remaining of Gudge's issues for Part 2 and
here's what we think we (spec editors) need to do:

>8.Section 4.2.2
>
>The numbered bullets use the term 'terminal node', but 
>that term no longer exists in the data model. We should 
>rewrite in terms of nodes with a lexical value.

Pending Gudge's recovery

>9.Section 4.4
>
>The language in the numbered bullets doesn't seem 
>consistent with other language concerning infoset items

Add text to the first occurance of "Value of Code" as in part 1.
