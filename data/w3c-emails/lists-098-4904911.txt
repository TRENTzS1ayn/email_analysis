Marc and I went through the remaining of Henrik's issues for Part 1,
section 4-App A and here's what we think we (spec editors) need to do:

>General Comments

Just do it

Just do it

Update after we move the spec into new location

>Specific Comments
>-----------------
>
>* S5.2.1, bullet 4: Add bullet for "relay" attribute information item

Same as Gudge's point. Just do it.

>* S5.2.4, 3 (just after bullet list): xs:boolean should be 
>marked (italic)

Just do it 

>* S5.3 bullet list: Is it intentional that Body can't contain 
>any character II children even if header blocks and fault detail can?

Ask the WG. Should detail and body be the same? Ok that header block is
different. Henrik to send mail.

>* S5.3.1, bullet 1: Why do we have a namespace note on the 
>body child elements descendents but not on header block 
>descendents? Also, the former says "MAY" namespace qualify 
>whereas the latter says "SHOULD". Shouldn't we be consistent?

It's ok as is.

>* S5.4, P2 (just after bullet list): Change "only child of the 
>SOAP Body" with "only child of the SOAP Body element information item"

It should say only child element II of the body EII

>* 5.4.7.2, P1: Change "TheSupportedEnvelope" to "The SupportedEnvelope"

Just do it.
