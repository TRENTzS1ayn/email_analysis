First time in part 1 says:

Note: Throughout this document, the term "Value of Code " is used as a
shorthand for "value of the Value child element information item of the
Code element information item" (see 5.4.1 SOAP Code Element).

Now says: "If relaying the message, a SOAP intermediary MAY omit a SOAP
role attribute information item if its value is
"http://www.w3.org/2002/06/soap-envelope/role/ultimateReceiver" (see 2.7
Relaying SOAP Messages)."

Section 5.2.2 already contained ref to 2.7 (not 2.7.4). All three
sections now refer to 2.7

Ok

Added: "Note that the definition in of the lang attribute information
item requires that the [prefix] is "xml" or any capitalization thereof
(see [XML 1.0], Language Identification)."
