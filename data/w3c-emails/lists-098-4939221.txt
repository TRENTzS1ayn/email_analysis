Status: All done except

* things pending resolution to Marc's mail.
* rework of the relaying formulation. Henrik will send mail

>Marc and I went through the remaining of Henrik's issues for 
>Part 1, section 1-3 and here's what we think we (spec editors) 
>need to do:
>
>>General Comments
>>----------------
>>
>>* In some places we use "fully qualified name". I believe it
>>should be "XML qualified name" instead.
>
>Do it

Done

>>* In some of the new text we don't mark the phrases
>>"[attribute|element|...] information item" but in the old 
>>text, it shows up as italic. We should either remove the 
>>markup or add it to the new text as well.
>
>Add to new text

Done

>>Specific Comments
>>-----------------
>>
>>* S1, P1: We use "such" in three places right after each
>>other. Suggest slight reformulation to avoid this
>
>(is P2) Get rid of some of them

Now says: "SOAP attempts to meet these goals by omitting, from the
messaging framework, features that are often found in distributed
systems. Such features include but are not limited to "reliability",
"security", "correlation", "routing", and "Message Exchange Patterns"
(MEPs). While it is anticipated that many features will be defined, this
specification provides specifics only for two MEPs. Other features are
left to be defined as extensions by other specifications."

>>* S1, P3, numbered list: We need a bullet for the
>>extensibility model. Also, I suggest reordering to say
>>
>>1. SOAP processing model
>>2. SOAP extensibility model
>>3. SOAP protocol binding framework
>>4. SOAP message construct
>>
>>as this follows the ToC
>
>Just do it

Done

>>* S1.3, P3: Change "defined by Parts 1 and 2" to "defined by
>>Part 1 and 2"
>
>Leave it

Ok

>>* S1, last P: Add reference to part 2 appendix A (media type
>>definition)
>
>Change to part 2, app A. Check that the bibref SOAP media type 
>isn't used anywhere else and remove

Done although media type is still used by status

>>* S1.5, SOAP feature: Remove "optional"
>
>Just do it

done

>>* S1.5, SOAP header block: Change "fully qualified name" to
>>"XML qualified name"
>
>Just do it

Done

>>* S2, P2: Change "with a feature" to "with a SOAP feature"
>
>Just do it

Done

>>* S2, P2: Change "each such feature to define such combined"
>>to "each such SOAP feature to define any combined"
>
>Just do it

Done

>>* S2, P3: Flip 1st and 2nd sentence to have them ordered
>>according to ToC
>
>Just do it

Done

>>* S2.4, P1: Change "by the combination of [local name] and
>>[namespace]" to "by the XML qualified name"
>
>Just do it

Done

>>* S2.4, P2: Change "SOAP header blocks MAY carry
>>mustUnderstand attribute information items" to "A SOAP header 
>>block MAY carry a mustUnderstand attribute information item"
>
>Just do it

Done

>>* S2.4, P2: Change "the SOAP block is said to be mandatory"
>>with "the SOAP header block is said to be mandatory"
>
>Just do it

Done

>>* S2.6, P2 (after numbered list): Change "fully qualified
>>name" to "XML qualified name"
>
>Just do it

Done

>>* (NOTE: this may not be seen as strictly editorial) S2.6, P3:
>>This applies to all faults and not just header fault: 
>>"Header-related faults other than those related to 
>>understanding SOAP header blocks (see 2.4 Understanding SOAP 
>>Header Blocks) MUST conform to the specification for the 
>>corresponding SOAP header block.".
>>
>>I suggest saying:
>>
>>"SOAP faults other than those related to understanding SOAP
>>header blocks (see 2.4 Understanding SOAP Header Blocks) MUST 
>>conform to the specification for the corresponding SOAP header 
>>block or SOAP body."
>
>Wait but Henrik will send email

Pending

>>S2.7, P1: Remove "and then expressed as SOAP modules or as
>>part of the underlying protocol binding" as the relationship 
>>between modules and features is better described in section 3 and 4.
>
>Just do it

Done

>>S2.7.1: This section is very hard to read in the current
>>location because the notion of an intermediary is not 
>>introduced before the next section. Also, section 2.7.2 talks 
>>about "insert" and "reinsert" which is also used but not 
>>described in section 2.7.1. I suggest the following reorg:
>>
>>A) Reorg the sections as follows:
>>
>>2.7.1 Forwarding Intermediaries
>>2.7.2 Relaying SOAP header blocks
>>2.7.3 SOAP Intermediaries and relayed infoset
>>2.7.4 Active Intermediaries
>>
>>The reason is that 2.7.1-2.7.3 talks about forwarding
>>intermediaries while active intermediaries are somewhat different.
>>
>>B) (following new numbers) Move the three bullets in 2.7.1
>>into 2.7.2 and replace it with a reference instead.
>>
>>C) Add a bullet to the three bullets (as bullet 0):
>>
>>0) Retain all header blocks not targeted at the forwarding node
>
>Just do it

Think this requires some more noodling and will send out proposal

>>S2.7.1, last P: Remove first "In addition"
>
>Just do it

Done

>>S2.7.3, P2: Not clear whether this is a requirement or not but
>>I would expect it is and hence change "All Infoset properties 
>>of a message need to be" to "All Infoset properties of a 
>>message MUST be"
>
>Part of Marc's mail.

Pending resolution on Marc's mail

>>S2.7.3: Add "" around URIs for c14n
>
>Just do it

Done

>>S2.7.3: Update references (two) to section 2.7 to the proper
>>sub-section.
>
>Depends on outcome from Marc's mail

Pending resolution to Marc's mail

>>S2.8: P1: Change "the qualified name" to "the XML qualified name"
>
>Just do it

Done

>>S3.1, last P: Change "hop-to-hop" with "hop-by-hop"
>
>Just do it

Done

>>S3.3, bullet 3: Change "SOAP Processing model" to "SOAP
>>processing model"
>
>Just do it

done
