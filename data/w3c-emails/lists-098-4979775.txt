Some of the examples are not well-formed XML:-

[[[
    <xmls:Schema rdf:about="http://example.org/L.xsd">
]]] - http://www.w3.org/2002/11/rddl/ex3.xml

per section 2.3 of the XML 1.0 recommendation:-

[[[
Names beginning with the string "xml", or any string which would match
(('X'|'x') ('M'|'m') ('L'|'l')), are reserved for standardization in this
or future versions of this specification.
]]] - http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#sec-common-syn

IE 6 correctly raises an error, but an error which sometimes prevents one
from viewing the file. Could you possibly fix the files?

Since the examples are CWM output according to the comments on those files,
outputting XML names starting with "(?i)xml" is also bug with CWM (hence
the CC to www-archive+n3bugs).
