Arriving somewhat late (early morning here though): I agree with 
your other comments; but regarding the one below, I'd be for 
removing the markup alltogether. AFAIR, it was introduced 
originally so we could see what an infoset rewrite would look 
like. Now that we know, the need for the italics is less obvious.

Thanks for your careful reading,

Jean-Jacques.
