What about defining an HTTP header to carry RDF metadata, such as the
CC license info.  We have a standard and open (URI-based) way to
define new HTTP headers [1].  And we have <META HTTP-EQUIV ...> to let
it go really inside the document, while still being valid [2].   This
approach is documented for embedding PICS in HTML [2], so I assume
some of y'all have experience with it.  :-)
