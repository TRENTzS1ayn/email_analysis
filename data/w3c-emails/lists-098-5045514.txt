(with date added to title)

From the changes section:
Changes since the 8 November 2002 working draft
  http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-rdf-syntax-grammar-20021108/

  * Updated References

  * 7.2.1 parseTypeLiteralPropertyElt Removed reference to RDF
    Concepts canonicalization and added new paragraph describing
    the freedom on the lexical forms of XML Literal.

    Added Exclusive XML Canonicalization [XML-XC14N] to normative references.

  * Updated links to match RDF Concepts new definitions

  * Status, abstract, notes: Updated

  * Appendix C (now Appendix B). Removed older changes to leave only
    those since the last working draft. (Appendix C in 8 November
    2002 draft)

  * Appendix B Other Syntax Schemas (Informative). Deleted. (Appendix
    B in 8 November 2002 draft)

  * Appendix A Issues. Deleted. (Appendix A in 8 November 2002 draft)

  * 6.1.6 Identifier Event. Split this into URI Reference Event
    (6.1.6) and Blank Node Identifier event (6.1.7).

    6.3 Grammar Notation split notation identifier() with uri() and
    bnodeid(). Updated the grammar to use these.

  * Added generated-blank-node-id() grammar notation to explictly
    show when such things are generated 

  * 5.2 Identifiers expanded Blank Node Identifiers description
    including rdf:nodeID values and generated ones 

  * 5.3 Base URIs retitled Resolving URIs

  * 6.3 Grammar Notation Added resolve() grammar action notation to
    explicitly note when URI resolving is done as RDF URI References
    are built from string content and in-scope base URIs.

  * 6.1.8 XML Literal Event. Replaced with Typed Literal Event.

    6.3 Grammar Notation. Replaced grammar action notation xml() with
    typed-literal()

    This matches the terms in RDF Concepts.

  * Replaced rdfs:XMLLiteral with rdf:XMLLiteral in 5.1 RDF
    Namespace, 7.2.1 parseTypeLiteralPropertyElt.
