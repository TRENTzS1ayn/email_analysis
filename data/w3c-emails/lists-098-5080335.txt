Note following text from RFC 2279

  -  Character values from 0000 0000 to 0000 007F (US-ASCII repertoire)
       correspond to octets 00 to 7F (7 bit US-ASCII values). A direct
       consequence is that a plain ASCII string is also a valid UTF-8
       string.

    -  US-ASCII values do not appear otherwise in a UTF-8 encoded
       character stream.  This provides compatibility with file systems
       or other software (e.g. the printf() function in C libraries) that
       parse based on US-ASCII values but are transparent to other
       values.
