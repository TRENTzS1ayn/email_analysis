There was an email thread following my post where all the participants  
agreed that SHOULD rather than MUST is the right level of compliance.  
We also agreed this in the concall. Reason is that the Text element is  
just for human readable stuff and isn't really an interop point of  
failure. If a receiver gets two Text elements with the same value for  
xml:lang the it can just pick one.
