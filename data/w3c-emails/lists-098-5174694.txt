I know I'm late going through these, but I think it's appropriate to 
continue editorial refinements as we move between CR and PR.   Overall, I 
think your proposed improvements are terrific.  There's one I would roll 
back (presuming it happened:  I'm offline and can't get to the latest CR 
draft):

You propose:

* S2.4, P1: Change "by the combination of [local name] and [namespace]"
to "by the XML qualified name"

Though I like this use of "qualified name" in principle, I don't think 
we've introduced it in a rigorous manner, have we?    Lacking that, I 
think the original is less ambiguous.  Some might read the revised as 
applying to the {prefix,lname} pair.  I'd revert to the original.  Thanks.
