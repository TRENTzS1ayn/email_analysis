Hmm, I have always read the term "XML qualified name" in the context stated in the description in the namespace spec:
 
"Note that the prefix functions only as a placeholder for a namespace name. Applications should use the namespace name, not the prefix, in constructing names whose scope extends beyond the containing document."
 
I vaquely remember that the WG agreed on using this term some time ago but I can't find the reference anywhere. Can somebody remember the details?
 
The potential problem by using the old phrase is that it is not clear whether or how the "combination" should be computed: because we don't say: should they be concatinated, or something else?
 
In any case, we use the term "XML qualified name" fairly consistently so if we have problems in section 2.4, then we may have it in other places as well. In any case, I agree that it is an editorial edit.
 
Henrik

I know I'm late going through these, but I think it's appropriate to
continue editorial refinements as we move between CR and PR.   Overall, I
think your proposed improvements are terrific.  There's one I would roll
back (presuming it happened:  I'm offline and can't get to the latest CR
draft):

You propose:

* S2.4, P1: Change "by the combination of [local name] and [namespace]"
to "by the XML qualified name"

Though I like this use of "qualified name" in principle, I don't think
we've introduced it in a rigorous manner, have we?    Lacking that, I
think the original is less ambiguous.  Some might read the revised as
applying to the {prefix,lname} pair.  I'd revert to the original.  Thanks.
