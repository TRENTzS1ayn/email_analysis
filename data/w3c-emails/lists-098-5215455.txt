Jos,

what was the motive for removing the <code> tags in some of the test 
descriptions...?

Genuine question.

(I had put them in, allowing XHTML in the descriptions).

Please copy www-archive or www-webont-wg on correspondence about the test 
document, (I am having difficulties getting to my e-mail at the moment).



Jeremy
