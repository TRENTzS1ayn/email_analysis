? 02.12.18.we | W3C Design Contest: Wanking the Site

   People will always groan about design aesthetics; aesthetics are
   fairly subjective -- fortunately usability is testable. But, when I
   noted the WthRemix challenge to redesign the W3C site, I figured the
   results could be interesting, until I read:

     The design must use tableless XHTML 1.0 Strict and CSS. JavaScript,
     GIF, JPG and PNG images may also be used. Server scripts,
     databases, and plug-in based media are not permitted. Designs
     containing animated GIFs and Flash are acceptable, but will face
     tough scrutiny.

   JavaScript: bringer of nasty pop-ups and security holes you can drive
   trucks through?!? GIF: an encumbered format for which PNG is a great
   alternative? Flash: surely you jest?! I have JavaScript turned off
   (only permitted on 4 specified sites), haven't produced a GIF in over
   a year, and the only site I enable flash for is howstuffworks.com .
   There's enough self-congratulatory/masturbatory design demos out
   there, I don't see why folks feel compelled to wank over a site that
   is standards conformant, doesn't introduce privacy or security
   nasties, accessible, and readable on both my PC and PDA. The real
   challenge would be to meet the same requirements currently satisfied
   and better them.
