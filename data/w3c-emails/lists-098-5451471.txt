Do you want to send a note to WG or should I.  I would have to do a bit of 
research as to exactly what our current text says, so if you happen to 
know you might just dash off a note.  If I don't see you do it within the 
next couple of days, I'll try and get to it.  Thanks.

Yup (and logistic issues may indeed be hard to ignore)

While it does seem editorial in nature, I agree that such things from
now go on the issues list for WG review. In general, I think this
applies to pretty much any change given where we are.

Thank you,

Henrik
