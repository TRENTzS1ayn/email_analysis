Permit me to summarize my requests/comments from the two bug reports and 
discussion.

1. No brainer: please have konqueror show valid URIs (in particular the 
file: scheme) in the konqueror so I can cut and paste them into other 
browsers (for html/css rendering tests), do actions on them in klipper, 
hand them to wget, curl, etc. For instance,
  file:///tmp/ or file://localhost/tmp/  not  file:/tmp
(or perhaps make it an option).
2. No biggie: consider registering the various URI schemes you are using 
such that we have browser interop (if these were pervasive, I could 
actually use them in html across browseres), collision prevention, and 
appropriate security consideration. However, I know IETF/IANA can be a pain 
on this point, so if informal mechanism achieve the same end, so be it.
3. Pretty please: don't require colons for shortcuts. They look like schemes 
when they're not, are counter to opera and phoenix (mozilla) conventions, 
and are painful to type. (I'm hoping that the next version of XBEL would be 
supported by open source browsers (I think galeon and konqueror already do) 
and include an element for the shortcut token, and that shortcut behaviors 
would work *across* the browsers. The shortcut is part of Phoenix's 
bookmark manager which is very convenient!)
