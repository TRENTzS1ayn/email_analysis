Until you can distinguish by a test between levels like the name and 
person
or location and contents one can argue for hour to little use about 
philosophically
which is identified.

The fundamental difference between a document and a file is
that a file has only content bits, while a document has pairs
of  (content bits, metadata which explains how to interpret them).

Well,  I'm sorry -- there never will be a perfect match between the 
english
words we have used before and the architectural concepts of a new 
system.
It is worth going to a certain amount of trouble to use words in a way
which matches the english as well as possible. But a certain amount 
only.

Well, we had forms of living documents before - ask anyone in a stds 
cmttee.
But we will have new things which do not have a good analogy in the 
paper
world - but thats OK.

Yes, it is true that the "deep linking" seems to be less understood in
some way.  It could be that people like to have in any space
an orienting structure.  They feel uncomfortable without it.
They pick up an idea of the structure of where they are as they
go into a web site.  If they are catapulted in they feel uneasy.
But nowadays a link to a book on Amazon is more acceptable because
so many people understand where they are -- and know the surrounding
structure -- when they arrive.

In general, we must get the architecture right more important that
finding that it matches existing terms.  That is the thing
about  a paradigm shift. The world after can't be explained in the
old terms.
