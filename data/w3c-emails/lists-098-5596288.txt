Whenever Mark or Sam linked to a story on another site, they wrapped 
cite tags around the name. So where you would write:

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/someArticle">NY Times</a>: "A religious 
sect that contends that space travelers created the human race by 
cloning themselves declared today that the first cloned human had been 
born."

They'd do:

<cite>NY Times</cite>: <a 
href="http://www.nytimes.com/someArticle">Some Article</a>. "A 
religious sect that contends that space travelers created the human 
race by cloning themselves declared today that the first cloned human 
had been born."

Now they have a script that looks for all these <cite> tags and 
reorganizes them by the thing being cited. So the NY Times page lists 
all entries that have <cite>NY Times</cite> and so on.
