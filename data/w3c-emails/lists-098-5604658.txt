The problem is that it relies on the ability of the person who writes 
to do it always in a consistent way, which is almost bearable with 
one author and almost impossible in a multiple authors environment :)

and you can also do something like

<cite>NY Times</cite>: <a 
href="http://www.nytimes.com/someArticle">Some Article</a>. <q 
cite="http://www.nytimes.com/someArticle">A religious sect that 
contends that space travelers created the human race by cloning 
themselves declared today that the first cloned human had been 
born.</q>

I always thought that a mechanism was missing in HTML to associate 
authors and sources (like RDF does).

Because even in my example you associate easily the title with the 
citation, but you do not associate the journal in a unique reference 
system. Add to that an author.

<cite>NY Times</cite>: <a 
href="http://www.nytimes.com/someArticle">Some Article</a>. <q 
cite="http://www.nytimes.com/someArticle">A religious sect that 
contends that space travelers created the human race by cloning 
themselves declared today that the first cloned human had been 
born.</q>, <cite>Paul Smith</cite>

A reference system could have been, but not very practical:

<cite inref="art001">NY Times</cite>: <a 
href="http://www.nytimes.com/someArticle" inref="art001">Some 
Article</a>. <q cite="http://www.nytimes.com/someArticle" 
inref="art001">A religious sect that contends that space travelers 
created the human race by cloning themselves declared today that the 
first cloned human had been born.</q>, <cite inref="art001">Paul 
Smith</cite>

Another way could have been

<cite href="http://www.nytimes.com/someArticle">NY Times</cite>: <a 
href="http://www.nytimes.com/someArticle">Some Article</a>. <q 
href="http://www.nytimes.com/someArticle">A religious sect that 
contends that space travelers created the human race by cloning 
themselves declared today that the first cloned human had been 
born.</q>, <cite href="http://www.nytimes.com/someArticle">Paul 
Smith</cite>

:))) so much to do, the future has many things to come.

And talk about poetry ;) and the structure of poems and it's even wider :)
