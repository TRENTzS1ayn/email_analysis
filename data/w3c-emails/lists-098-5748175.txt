How would you know it was DC?

Or more pedantically, what would it take to make it true that the markup

What about this?

     <html>
      <head>
      <title>Dan's XML course</title>
      <meta name="abstract" content="blah blah blah" />
      <link rel="made" href="mailto:danbri@w3.org" />
      </head>
      <body>
        ...
      </body>
     </html>
