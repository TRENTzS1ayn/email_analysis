Hi

A few people have pointed me at http://cmap.coginst.uwf.edu/ 
and it looks pretty interesting. One thing that isn't clear from 
your website (unless I missed it) is whether one can easily export
the maps (and their visual representations) in some open text format.
For the visual representation, SVG [1] would seem ideal. Have you 
considered this? For the abstract data structure, I'm wondering whether you've
looked at W3C's Resource Description Framework (RDF, [2]).

BTW am also excerpting from the RDF Interest Group online chat 
where we were just discussing this. I thought it better to get in touch
than just speculate! :)

IMAP tool for composing Concept maps
 posted by Seth at 2002-02-08 22:07
AaronSw: Nearby: Pat Hayes
danbri: It would be great if this could export W3C SVG images. They make it easy to zoom in on regions, can be searched textually, and are well supported by Adobe's SVG plugin. 
danbri: Many other graphing and visualisation libraries (eg. Graphviz, GNU Plotutils) and applications (eg.RDFAuthor) support SVG, at least as an export format.
Seth: but for those of us who don't program the IMAP tool is already there in a package to download free and use
danbri: Exactly. Their tool seems a pretty neat modeling environment, but doesn't seem to make it easy to get the data out in useful formats like SVG. Maybe I'm wrong there, and missed the online docs. SVG export would be a very neat feature to add (for programmers and non-programmers alike).
Seth: IMAP should read IHMC
Seth: actually collaboratively working on a map would be a great boost for the semantic web ... but sadly nodbody seems interested in doing that
Seth: "map" should have read "graph"

Thanks for any advice on your plans...

cheers,

Dan
