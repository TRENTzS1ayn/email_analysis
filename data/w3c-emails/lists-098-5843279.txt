Not true. The doublet idiom itself communicates the fact that
datatyping is being used. Any application may interpret a bNode
with an rdf:value with literal object and rdf:dtype property
with URIref as being a doublet idiom. It is recognizable by its
structure and vocabulary alone.

This is not true for the datatype triple idiom.

Again, you have to have external, additional knowledge to
recognize the datatype triple idiom as a datatyping idiom. You
have just admitted as much above, by saying that there must be
some way to 'recognize' datatype names, if that idiom is to
be interpreted as a datatype idiom. Do you now see my point?

The rdf:dtype property has a pre-defined range of rdfs:Datatype,
provided by the MT itself, no? So why can't some application expect
that (barring bad data) that the URIref is a datatype? Of course it
can.

But the fact that ddd is-a rdfs:Datatype is why rdf:dtype exists. Thus,
an idiom that uses rdf:dtype embodies that semantics.

IMO, it makes no sense to use rdf:dtype with a non-datatype class. And
in fact, the range constraint would either assert or require that it
is a datatype class. No?

Well, that's the idea used by the proposal, which has been
the basis of our 'discussion'. Please don't tell me you have
been basing your arguments on other premises.

Again, I disagree. See above.

And if none of the idioms are trully local, then we have failed
to provide the users with what they require.
