It's an error in the context of datatyping.

Or alternately, you could say that you have a non-cannonical lexical
space where for some members (the actual value strings) the mapping
function from lexical space to value space is the equality operator,
but that doesn't seem right for the ietf:enum example.

If you have a literal in a datatyping idiom/context, it is a lexical
form. That is imposed by the datatyping interpretation.

If you want to use some other non-datatyping idiom to express
string representable values otherwise, fine, e.g.

   _:1 ietf:enum "+441235123456" .
   _:1 actualValueRepresentation "6.5.4.3.2.1.5.3.2.1.4.4.e164.arpa" .

but the latter literal is not a lexical form. It's just a literal.
Saying

   _:1 ietf:enum "6.5.4.3.2.1.5.3.2.1.4.4.e164.arpa" .

is an error because "6.5.4.3.2.1.5.3.2.1.4.4.e164.arpa" is not
a member of the lexical space of ietf:enum and the datatyping
property says that it should be.

Only if literals are untidy. A actual lexical form is a member of
a datatype lexical space, and thus denotes a specific value.

A literal is just a literal, but in the context of a datatype
interpretation it is taken to *represent* a lexical form (be
string equal with a lexical form) and in the interpretation denote
a specific value.

The distinction is critical, and one that I've tried a few times
to communicate, but folks don't seem to get it. Pat certainly doesn't.
(He doesn't want to consider anything outside the MT semantics, which
 is a pity, because that's where datatype interpretation actually
happens...)

Graham, I'm CCing the others in this thread as well, rather than
maintaining two separate ones -- I had simply forgotten to include
you in the original CCline earlier...

No. Let me clarify.

I am proposing that an "RDF Datatype Class" (i.e. rdfs:Datatype) contain
as its members the members of a datatype's value space and lexical space.

The datatype is not the same thing as the RDF Datatype Class. The latter
is the basis for datatyping in RDF and how one interprets a
literal-in-context to obtain a value. The former is external theory
adopted mostly from XML Schema.

An rdfs:Datatype is a particular treatment of a 'datatype' as defined
by XML Schema and the Foundational MT.

You could say that an RDF Datatype Class contains all the members
of both spaces of a datatype, irrespective of the internal space
partitions, but we can re-partition them as needed using range
intersection with either rdfs:Literal or rdfs:Resource and the
graph syntax makes interpretation unambiguous and consistent.

The reason why the RDF Datatype Class has to have both lexical forms
and values as its members is to allow a consistent interpretation
for both the inline and datatype triple idioms, since the property
value can be either a literal or a bNode (a lexical form or a value).

I appreciate that it is a somewhat radical view, at first, but
if you look through the commented examples I sent last night, I
think (hope) it will become clear that it's really quite simple.

(it just seems complicated because it's so different than how we've
 been looking at datatype URIs -- with such strict and fine precision
 of which actual space they denote, so the union idea at first may
 feel sloppy or fuzzy, but in fact, it's just the right amount of
 flexibility, I think  ;-)

Cheers,

Patrick
