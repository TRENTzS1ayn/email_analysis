One test that I just ran was a full eleven times slower under CWM 1.87
than it was under CWM 1.82. All of the test data is on the Web [but
the test data is RegExped from another site, so use at your own risk].
The command line:-

   cwm data.n3 --filter=q.n3 > out.n3

data.n3: http://infomesh.net/2001/12/map/data.n3
q.n3: http://infomesh.net/2001/12/map/q.n3

Time with 1.87: 4:08
Time with 1.82: 0:22

The simple test was actually to benchmark other N3 parsers/inference
engines, but I was surprised that the latest CWM took so long, and
slurped the 1.82 version off of the Web. The full tests are at [1] and
[2].
