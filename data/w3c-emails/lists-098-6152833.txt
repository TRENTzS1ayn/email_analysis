Martin, Mischa,

Here is the icircumflex/Benoit example you were after.
The SVG should work fine in both Adobe and Batik.

To style the circumflex, just play with the
embedded style sheet at the top of the file.

(It's not as impressive as Chris's!)

Remember, the payment for this is an easy path
for SVG 1.1 through last call :)

Dean
