I know I've made one of these before, but this one outputs a proper
subset of NTriples, so you can just run wc to count the triples etc.
Attached as <<norm.py>>. If you're using --ntriples in CWM, you might
want to pipe it through this script (you can use '-p' in the command
line) before spewing it out.
