s/subclass/subproperty/, btw., since foaf:depiction is a relation.

http://swordfish.rdfweb.org/photos/2002/02/27/001698.JPG depicts eric and
nadia, just as the picture of ian horrocks and jim hendler in
http://www.cs.vu.nl/~dieter/mm/webont/ depicts them both.

One way to think about it is by having a notion of a sub-image, defined as
a region of an image. There is defintely a sub-region of 001698.JPG that
depicts Eric, and since that's the case, any images that include that
sub-region also depict him.

What we're getting into is the difficult of characterising the content of
a scene. Pictures that depict non-existent entities, people etc are a
variant of the problem...

I reckon keep foaf:depiction liberal for now, and then use types to
classify the images themselves more explicitly, or intermediate nodes that
talk explicitly about the mode of presentation within the image. Mostly
that'd be unncessary, but could be useful for the pedantic.
