3. Modular Structure in general: Circles and Arrows

   The  assumption  is made  that  the system  to be described  can be
broken up into "modules".    It is generally  accepted  that this is a
necessity  for  any  modifyable   or  maintainable   system  involving
computers.   No assumptions are made about how the breaking up is done
-- RDF imposes no constraints on the high level design.

   A similar way of describing  a structure  is to draw, on a piece of
paper, circles with arrows in between.   The circles ("modules") could
be programs or pieces of hardware,  for instance, and the arrows could
mean "passes  data to", "is composed  of", or "is started  by".   This
method,  with  a variety  of different  shaped  boxes,  and  different
coloured  arrows,  is useful, clear, and commonly  used.   The RDF
system allows a more complicated system to be described than would fit
on a piece of paper.    It than allows an interactive  user to explore
the system in search of the information  he requires,  seeing only the
parts which are of interest.

   RDF  divides  both  the  modules  (circles)  and  relationships
(arrows) into broad categories.    This makes it easier to analyse the
structure  you end up with.   For instance the realtionships  "is part
of" and "includes" show the division of a module into smaller modules.
Also, when altering  one part of the system,  it is useful  to know by
which  other parts it is used.   These are generalised  reletionships,
just as Document, Program, Machine are generalised types of module.

   The modules may be all sorts of things.  They are referred to below
as  "nodes",  because  of  the  role  they  take  in  the  network  of
interrelationships within the system.
