I'm interested in the RSA Conference series. Could you please point me to
an accessible version of the conference information and registration? By
this I mean a page that doesn't require javascript and macromedia flash, a
page that is accessible to the disabled, those on PDAs or text browsers,
and those that use standard technologies? Thank you.
