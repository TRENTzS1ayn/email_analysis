Hi there,

Jim Hendler forwared your discussion about why DAML can't be layered atop
RDF. I found it very interesting (and I think I even understood it!) but I
had one comment to make. I agreed with what you wrote entirely...

...however, it was my understanding that this was the purpose of
reification. TimBL writes:

[[[
The RDF model currently is that of an (unordered) set of assertions. We will
demonstrate that this remains all that is needed to represent the new
langauge features. Every new feature can be introduced as a new RDF
property. However, we will see that this is an impractical way of actually
processing information, as it involves using RDF indirectly to describe the
parts of a statement instead of making it directly. This process (called
reification) is described in the RDF Model & Syntax document.

Does this solve both the reification and the layering problem?

(I hope you don't mind that I've cc-ed www-archive on this.)

Thanks for your help,
