I second the poll.  Go ahead and create one, Danbri.

Another thought... Should we consider moving everything but our mailing list
conversation over to a Weblog hosted somewhere?  I've been using
MoveableType [http://www.moveabletype.org] for some time for my own Weblogs
and it's feature rich: discussion, file upload, multiple
authors/administrators, RSS feeds, and so forth.

If someone volunteers to host it (it's a couple-three Perl scripts) I'll be
glad, as chair, to act as one of the editors/admins.  There should also be a
few more folks from the WG who'd edit/admin.
