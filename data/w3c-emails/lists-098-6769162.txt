Hi Guido,

sorry for this late feedback. I must say I disagree with this 
view: the part-of relation is in my opinion a "formal" relation, in 
the precise sense that it does not imply any constraints on its 
arguments: you can have parts of ideas, parts of objects, parts of 
events... In all these cases, I believe there is a common meaning of 
the notion of "part", which corresponds to a minimal set of axioms: 
part-of is intended as a partial order (asymmetric, antireflexive, 
transitive), plus the so-called "weak supplementation" axiom, which 
says that if x is a proper part of y then some z must exist, which is 
als a proper part of y but it is different from x. This corresponds 
to what Peter Simons says at the end of his seminal book "Parts - A 
study in ontology" (Clarendon Press 1987). I quote below a 
significant passage (p. 363):

"If this is all there essentially is to the part-of relation, why can 
stronger principles sometimes apply? The answer lies not in the 
part-relation itself but in the nature of the objects to which it 
applies."

An important case of a specialized part-of relation is the member-of relation:
a member of a collection is a special part of the collection, which 
exhibits a peculiar property: unity. This is why member-of is not 
transitive, while part-of is. Again, however, member-of is a formal 
relation.
