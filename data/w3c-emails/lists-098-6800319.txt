Great idea, danbri. A few comments:

It depends on the kind of PURL set up. I think with the current set-up we
don't need to copy everything.

It's way too long for a poll, which <sarcasm>YahooGroups kindly eliminates
linebreaks and HTML from</sarcasm>.

How about: 

Do you support having http://purl.org/rss/1.0/ files redirect to someplace
in http://www.w3.org/2002/01/rss/? See
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/rss-dev/message/x for details.

 - Yes
 - No
 - Abstain

As I'm tempted to get this completed ASAP, can I suggest that we not run a
poll/vote unless someone on the list dissents? (If there's unanimity, I
don't see the point in a poll/vote.)
