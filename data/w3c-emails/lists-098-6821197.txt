>Does this solve both the reification and the layering problem?

Im not sure what the 'reification problem' is, but reification does 
not solve the layering problem. Or rather, it introduces problems of 
its own that make it impossible to solve the layering problem this 
way. Or, well, to be excruciatingly precise, its really not clear 
what reification actually means, but *if* it means what the RDF M&S 
document seems to say it means, then it introduces those problems.

The reason why is that (according to the M&S), what reification means 
is that the reified assertion exists. That is, the reification 
asserts that a piece of syntax exists. Now, while that indeed does 
not assert that piece of syntax, it also doesn't assert whatever that 
piece of syntax was supposed to encode in the 'upper' language (in my 
example, if you reify the triples encoding a rdfn:notAll, what that 
reification means in RDF is that some set of triples exists; but that 
still doesn't assert the content of the rdfn:notAll, and what it does 
assert is not entailed by that content. What we want, rather, is some 
way to make those encoding triples "invisible" to RDF; they shouldn't 
assert *anything*.

Now, Dan C. tells me that this way of understanding reification is 
wrong (which is why reification isn't in the MT yet) , and that there 
is a better way to understand it. Maybe that will enable reification 
to solve the layering problem, but as I don't yet grok this 
alternative way of understanding reification, I can't yet say....

Not at all.
