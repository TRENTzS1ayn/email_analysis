I was visiting the redesigned AI Lab homepage (at least redesigned since I
saw it last, which was, admittedly, a while ago). I'm disappointed at the
use of GIFs and Javascript for navigation. I think CSS (especially the
a:hover attribute) would be a much more effective and accessible way of
doing this.

I also note that you have a valid HTML 4.01 button at the bottom, but it is
unlinked to the HTML validator. Were it linked you might more easily notice
that your page is not actually valid.

I hope that you fix these problems and do your part to increase the quality
of the World Wide Web. Many thanks for your help, and let me know if you
need any assistance.

(I am ccing www-archive, a public archive of the W3C's for emails like
this.)
