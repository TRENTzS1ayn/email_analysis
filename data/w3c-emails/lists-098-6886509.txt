Thanks for your note.  Actually, over a year ago when I ran the page 
through the W3C validator, the page did come up as valid otherwise I 
never would have put the icon on the page. Admittedly, there have 
been some minor revisions since then and I probably should have 
revalidated the page. In any case, thanks for pointing out that one 
tag was in error. As for using image maps versus CSS, that's a 
personal choice made primarily because of the extremely poor cross 
browser compatibility of CSS. Text only browsers and those with 
Javascript turned off can get to any page on the site through the 
text links.
