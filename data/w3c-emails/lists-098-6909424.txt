Hi Dan,

I think it's a good idea and an honnor for RSS 1.0 to be hosted on the 
W3C Web site but I am wondering under which licence it will be published.

Will it it covered (or absorbed) by a general licence applying to 
documents published on the W3C web site or can it keep its current 
licence unaltered?

Thanks

Eric
