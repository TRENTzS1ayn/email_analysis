Sounds good.

Yes. P and D.

Well, S does seem to be leading in the WG, but I'm not so sure
as far as the broader RDF community.

Quite so, and the issue of backwards compatability and machinery
I think will kill S when folks have PD to compare it to.

Agreed.

I plan to take Sergey's document and hack it to read the way I think
it should, for only P and D, based on the "pairing" model.

Hmmmm... I'll have to think about that, but it doesn't seem
like a processing model the way I normally think of processing
models.

There is no manipulation of the graph, nor any ordering issues.

But we should definitely clarify that, if only to put some
pre-emptive discussion about it.

I'll have a look to refresh my memory. I'm sure I read it.

The "pairing" model itself should absolutely be defined as part of
the MT. It was only the idioms that would be left out of the MT. But
perhaps the idioms also need to be in the MT, but modularly, as a
layer on top of the pairing model, so we retain the insulation of
the core data typing model from changes/evolution of idioms.

I.e., define the math for each idiom separately, on top of the common
pairing model.

Fair enough.

OK. I will also take a stab next week on my reworking of Sergey's
document, most of which is golden.

Cheers,
