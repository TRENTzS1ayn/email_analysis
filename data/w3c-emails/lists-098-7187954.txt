A solved problem, no?

I've looked at it... several times. It seems to be exactly
what we need. (Actually, the KIF v3 version is less constraining
and looks more useful).

But metaknowledge aside...

I'm still trying to figure out why the axiomatic semantics
for DAML+OIL isn't perfectly good basis for WebOnt. It
seems to play nicely with the RDF model theory, as far as
I can tell. That is: the RDF model theory gives
an n-triples document (and hence any RDF document)
a meaning that corresponds
directly to a KIF formula of the form

(exists (?x1 ?x2 ?x3)
  (and
    (p1 s1 o1)
    (p2 ?x1 o2)
    (?x3 s3 o3)
    ...
  )
)

I trust you'll grant me that (PropertyValue p s o) isn't
interestingly different from (p s o) with the menzel indirection trick,
no?

What's wrong with specifying ont:complementOf ala:

 (forall (?C1 ?C2)
  (iff (ont:complementOf ?C1 ?C2)
       (forall (?x)
         (iff (rdf:type ?x ?C1) (not (rdf:type ?x ?c2)))
       ) ) )

How does the model theory paradox you presented earlier show
up in an axiomatic specification like this?

I agree that it's hard to train my brain to make arguments
without using the LEM, but in my experience building
Semantic Web agents, I haven't wanted nor needed it yet.

(of course, I get along with very little use of negation
at all. I only use stuff like string-inequality
and log:notIncludes).

I think I grok the relevant stuff... from what I can tell,
you do have to be a bit careful, but it's not impossible.
KIF's wtr is an example of a solution, no?

i.e. TimBL's log:Truth is pretty much the same thing
as KIF's wtr. And log:implies works sorta like:

(defrelation (log:implies ?P ?Q) <=>
  (wtr '(implies ,?P ,?Q))

it interacts somewhat strangely with quantification.
