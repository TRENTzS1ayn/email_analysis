Is that the case for the KIF v3 version of wtr too?

I know the dpans KIF disallows any occurence of wtr inside wtr...
but the v3 version didn't have that constraint; it just required
that the not's be pushed out or something... I guess I should
look it up...

  Changing Levels of Denotation
  http://meta2.stanford.edu/kif/Hypertext/node35.html

So it's pushed in, not pushed out.

No..

Er... I meant to say that DAML+OIL/WebOnt could be based on
KIF modified with the menzel indrection trick. I gather
PatH is working on making this the standard model theory
for KIF.

Hmm... I don't quite follow.

If you have a few minutes to take that rough explanation and
make it pricise/rigorous, I'd appreciate it.

But suppose they did. i.e. look at KIF with a model theory
similar to RDF's, where the relationship between
properties and their extensions is indirect, and
likewise for classes.

It seems to me that this would work.

Really?
Why not? I'm using the KIF v3 version of wtr here.

Whenever I write down the Liar's paradox, TimBL usually counters
with something about the excluded middle not applying... I agree
that there's not much to talk about there until we figure out
what we're using in place of the law of the excluded middle.
