[snip]

Just to jump in here with a quick book recommendation. Susan Haack's
"Deviant Logic" (republished and extended as "Deviant Logic, Fuzzy Logic",
with a critique of the fuzzy logic agenda). It seems to be out of print and
unavailable online, and my copy is in the UK, but if you get the chance,
see it in the bookstore etc., I'd recommend taking a look. This thread
was slipping into 'hackers versus theorists' posturing, which isn't going
to do any of us any good. The Haack book seemed to me to provide a careful
survey of the arguments for/against moving away from classical logics.

Initially proposed as rivals of classical logic, alternative logics have
become increasingly important in areas such as computer science and
artificial intelligence. Fuzzy logic, in particular, has motivated major
technological developments in recent years.

Susan Haack's Deviant Logic provided the first extended examination of the
philosophical consequences of alternative logics. In this new volume,
Haack includes the complete text of Deviant Logic, as well as five
additional papers that expand and update it. Two of these essays critique
fuzzy logic, while three augment Deviant Logic's treatment of deduction
and logical truth. Haack also provides an extensive new foreword, brief
introductions to the new essays, and an updated bibliography of recent
work in these areas.

From Library Journal
The success of fuzzy logic in certain technological applications such as
in controllers for air-conditioners and other appliances, in subway
braking systems, and so forth, has led some philosophers to see it as a
rival to classical logic. This book is an extended defense of classical
logic against attacks by proponents not only of fuzzy logic but also of
many-valued, dialethic, intuitionist, and other "alternative" logics.
Haack (philosophy, Univ. of Miami) deals here not only with logic but also
with important issues in epistemology; however, the level of discourse is
such that its main audience will be logicians and serious students of
philosophy. The book contains the complete text of Haack's 1974
publication, Deviant Logic, and five other essays that have also appeared
before
