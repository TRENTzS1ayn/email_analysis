Well, maybe, and maybe not.  It is, of course, very hard to determine the
answer to this because there is no definition of N3!  In particular, there
is neither model theory nor proof theory nor axiomatization, at least that
I could find from the N3 ``home page'',

http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Notation3.html

If there is a definition for N3 I would sure like to get a look at it.
