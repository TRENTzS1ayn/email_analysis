Hi Jeremy,

Attached is the latest draft of the TLD (PD) proposal. It's starting
to come into form. Pretty much the only remaining rough section is
appendix A.

Hopefully it is now in mature enough form for you to get a handle on
the needed math.

I know you're at the WebOnt f2f so I'm not expecting any replies
this week.

I think I'll have a pretty final draft by Friday's telecon, and will
probably submit it to the rdfcore list on Thursday sometime. I won't
be expecting you to have the math by then -- and I'm hoping that most
folks won't need it to understand the basics of the proposal.

Cheers,

Patrick
