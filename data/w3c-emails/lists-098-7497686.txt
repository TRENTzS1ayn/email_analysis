Right, exactly. The 'weak' 3-valued logics do this, but they are then 
so weak that you can hardly do anything with them. They act like 
2-valued logics but if anything is undefined then all assertions just 
vanish into undefinedness. (They actually model computation quite 
faithfully in a sense, if you interpret 'undefined' as 'no value gets 
returned', ie 'wanders into weeds', in Sandro's phrase.Then if 
anything subexpression wanders into the weeds, you never get a value. 
But what you can't ever do is *conclude* that something is in the 
weeds.)

Yes, but that is what 'truth' means in logic as well. Don't think 
that not knowing whether something is 'really' true implies that one 
has to abandon 2-valued logic. The logic only says, in effect: IF 
these are true, THEN this other stuff Ive deduced from it must be 
true as well.

Good example. Its a bad idea to even allow things like that to be 
said, because the task of telling whether some larger DB implies one 
of them isn't computable, in general, so you can never be sure you 
have filtered them out. If paradoxes - not contradictions like (p and 
not p), which are always false, but *paradoxes* - which can't 
rationally be either true or false - can be stated in the language, 
then all reasoning from any source is suspect. And (again unlike a 
contradiction) the problem might not show up in any way you can 
detect. You just have incompatible conclusions where each of them 
might have impeccable and checkable derivations, both warranted 
correct, but disagreeing. Not a good thing to have.

Sure, but a paradox is worse than a contradiction. Contradictions are 
orcs, but a paradox is a balrog.

That sounds very like intuitionist logic, or maybe some other 
constructive logic. The key idea for the intuitionists was that to 
prove not-P, it wasn't enough to just demonstrate that assuming P 
produces a contradiction. You had to actually prove the negation 
*directly*. It amounts to a restriction on kinds of proofs that are 
allowed.
