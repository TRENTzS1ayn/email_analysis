The reason why locations are not parts of objects is due to the very 
nature of objects and locations, not to the specificity of the part 
relation. The part relation is general, various entities behave very 
differently with respect to it, that's why there are various kinds of 
entities, but just one kind of (general) part...

Again, the role parts play in identity criteria of classes is 
different, but this is not an argument in favour of a multeplicity of 
part relations, it is just an argument for a multeplicity of 
entities...

Yes.

The relations you mentioned don't fall in this class, since they are 
all symmetric (I assume...). If x coexists with y also y coexists 
with x.

I agree with the last point: there is no need to introduce a relation 
as primitive if it can be axiomatized. However, you need a suitable 
expressivity for axiomatizing it (for instance, to express the 
supplementation axiom).

Of course we need these things. Type vs. role is certainly a very 
important distinction for an ontology language.

Cheers,
