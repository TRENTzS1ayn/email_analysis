Just to keep you posted: one of the outcomes of the Web Ontology Working Group meeting at Bell Labs on Mon/Tue was the decision not to include part-whole explicitly in the language, but to make sure that it could be axiomatised. (I believe it can in fact already be axiomatised in DAML+OIL, including the supplementation axiom).

This distinction did not make it into the requirements list that was determined at the meeting. In fact, it never even came up. It also did not show up in any of the few dozen use cases that the working group collected. If you want to push for this, bring this to the attention of Guus Schreiber <guus@swi.psy.uva.nl> (who I've cc'ed for this msg).

Thanks for your continued input on this issue!

Frank.
