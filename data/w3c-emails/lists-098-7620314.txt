We are agreed about that.

Unfortunately, for the web, we have to insist that it can be said.
Basically, while a databse can be seen as a tree-lie expression,
the web isn't.   A document A can assert that  [the formula one
gets by parsing a representation of] document B is false.
Document B, under separate authorship and control, can
indpendently assert that document A is true.

I maintain, as I can't see any other way, that the language
must have the power to make each of these two important stataments.
And the language must have the power to be able to express the
conjunction of two documents.  So I don't see any way to prohibit,
in the expressive power of the language, a paradox from
being written.  So we are stuck with tackling the problem
on the other side - by limiting the infernce.  Which does look like
Intuitionalistic logic as you say.

In classic logic, but not all logics.

Absolutely.  However, there must be a set of formulae which you can
show do not have this problem, where I am including inference rule
as a formula.

And you will probably tell me that to determine whether a given
formula (for example, set of semantic web pages) is in this set of
safe formulae is just unscalable- it takes a very long time for
a set of any size.  And then i would suggest that this is life,
but there may be ways of simplifying the problem.  This is why
we design modular systems.  When I figure out whether I should
get mony out of the ATM, I  don't absorb all the internal formulae
in the ATM.  There is an interface which hides them.
By absorbing only certain sorts of information from certain sources
I can made  a limited and safe system.   It means that for any real system,
the actual complexity of the information actually belived is limited.

(So for example, when I write rules to check whether a document is
schema-valid,
the system only looks at the the document and reads it like a bunch
of data without believeing it, and the same with the schema.
Then in a separate operation it creates a new formula which is
the dedcutive closure of the document and the schema and the axioms
and looks for inconsistencies in that formula.  But it never belives it.
In fact it deliberately trying to make a contradiction within  that sandbox)

Beliveing neither is good.  Hearing someone mutter either should not hurt
you.

Yes... in a previosu message I said how I see therebeing some Properties
with
converses, and some Classes with complements.   When working with those
then you have limited ways of shifting the "not" around.  When working with
others
you don't.  In n3 (ish) one can infer

forSome n2, n3
    p2 log:converse n2.
    p3 log:converse n3.
    {x2  p2 y2}   ->  { x3  p3 y3}
    {x3  n3  y3}
___________________
{x2 n2 y2}

which is much more limiting than being able to infer

forSome n3
    p3 log:converse n3.
    {x2  p2 y2}   ->  { x3  p3 y3}
    {x3  n3  y3}
___________________
forSome n2
    p2 log:converse n2.
    {x2 n2 y2}

Guess I should look up this Intuitionalistic stuff - it hard enough to
pronounce.

intuitionist logic
<spelling> Incorrect term for "intuitionistic logic".
