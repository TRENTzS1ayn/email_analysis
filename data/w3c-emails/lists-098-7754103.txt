I have a deep interest in the metaphysical assumption I see behind your
opinion (monism). Of course, it is as a specific position among many
others. For sure, monism is not the metaphysics position closest to the
'common sense'. Many authors (e.g. Achille Varzi, "Parole, Oggetti,
Eventi", 2001 ) recognize that natural language does not witness in favour
of the reduction of all entities to time-spatial events. In fact, objects
and events are reflected into different syntactic categories. Now, I think
that we should be as close to the common sense as possible, "salva
veritatem".

On this, I see that there is a general agreement. Personally, I think that
the language should allow a sort of 'rigid denotation' for 'standard
axioms' such as those realated to mereology. I mean: the possibility to
refer them with simple identifiers rather than full specified logic
expressions. Most of the semantic web application wouldn't be able to
evaluate arbitrary logic expressions anyway.

Fine. We should work on this in the future. Is there room for a proposal in
this direction ?
