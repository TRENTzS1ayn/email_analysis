Hi,

Your site's discussion area [1] uses POST to bring up the various
threads and messages, which makes it impossible to refer to them
anywhere else. POST should be used for actions which may have
side-effects - anything for which the user should be notified if they
attempt to send the same data again. GET should be used for all other
situations; cf. [2]. Please change your forum so that it uses GET, to
enable people to use it effectively.

Thanks,
