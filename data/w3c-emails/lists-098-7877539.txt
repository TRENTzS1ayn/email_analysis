Yes, that helped, thanks.  But I still wouldn't claim to be able to
confidently review it for accuracy.

Right.  Do we have any plans to do that as a WG?  Or are we planning to
rely on human review for accuracy?

I think that it less accessible, yes.  If it could be sufficiently
reviewed or executed & verified, then what we could do is make it
normative, but also go with either the tabular or prose format in
an informative manner.  This would allow developers who didn't want
to use the formal model to implement from the informative text, but
would also provide an authoritative, testable, correct model from
which ambiguities in the informative description could be resolved.
Some might balk at that (including some developers who'd be concerned
about working from informative text), but I believe it to be a
practical compromise.
