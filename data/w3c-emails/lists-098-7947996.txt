Hi Patrick,

I reply to some of your earlier questions below.

I attach a snapshot of where I am at with the Model Theory, along with some
comments on your text. The text I have produced so far is not either the
simpler or the more advanced text that I am planning to produce and hence is
not ready for insertion into the document yet. It's somewhere in between.
Once I have finished it at this level I will both simplify and embellish it
to produce the main text and the appendix text, respectively.

References for bit are:

The version of the RDF Model Theory I am working from is this one:

Unfortunately not, see on.

In practice we have to address the question of what happens when there are
two types specified. This motivates a significant part of the complexity. S
is significantly simpler in this respect, but buggy. (i.e. on the "as simple
as possible but no simpler" axis, S-B, IMO goes too far).

Yes, because the global type information can only be accessed through the
MT. e.g. a range constraint may be through any number of subProperty
relationships etc.
