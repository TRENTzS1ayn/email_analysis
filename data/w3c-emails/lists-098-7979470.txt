Presumably this is a choice -- the output makes sense and
correctly encodes the data but just isn't
rdf as she is spoken normally.

The output scares me too, because I have not been able
to find an intellectually satisfying API for the generator.

I had a look at it yesterday and decided it should be low
priority but if it used to work, or is actually incorrect, I'll fix it
before other things.
