Can we replace "it is up to" with "it is the responsibility of" ? I 
don't think we should mention WSDL. The text still sounds a little 
muddled to me, instead how about:

When a particular feature set is required, it is the responsibility of 
the application developer to choose a suitable combination of binding 
and in-the-envelope expressed features. Often when a particular feature 
is implemented in the binding, utilizing it in preference to an 
in-the-envelope representation will provide for optimised processing.
