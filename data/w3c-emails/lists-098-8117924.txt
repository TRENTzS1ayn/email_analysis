OK, I've finished the discussion of the desiderada and all the
other wordsmithing I think is needed at the present, including
all of the editorial changes you suggested.

It's online at http://www-nrc.nokia.com/sw/TDL.html.

I have a few questions/comments about your stuff which
is written in red, mostly about using rdfs:Literal as
the default type rather than xsd:string, to retain
neutrality from XML Schema while fully supporting it.

As soon as you send me the final draft of section 2.2
and the appendices, I'll add them in.

Cheers,

Patrick
