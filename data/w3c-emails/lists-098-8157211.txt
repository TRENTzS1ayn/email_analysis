All,

Below is the Face-to-Face breakout group summary for the Content
Interoperability Use Case that Jonathan Dale was kind enough to scribe
for us and distribute to the breakout group members. I am also attaching
the notes in MS Word format from our session on Jan. 15 (which Jonathan
scribed).

At the weekly telecon today (1/24), it was agreed that we need to do the
following:

1) complete the description of the 2 use cases which will be used by
WOW-G for the content interoperability use case category:

A) The combined AgentCities/Travel Planning use case: Jonathan Dale and
Mike Dean will consolidate a combined description and submit this to us
and Jeff Heflin, the editor of the combined use case and requirements
document.

B) The OntoWeb use case: Raphael Volz will revise the description of
this use case and also submit it to us and Jeff Heflin. 

Note that these should be completed as soon as possible: Jeff suggested
by early next week.

Jonathan, Mike, Raphael -- is this agreeable to you all?

I believe that Jeff can use the descriptions of the requirements that we
already had in the original large use case document reported at: 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-webont-wg/2001Dec/0104.html

Thanks!
Leo
