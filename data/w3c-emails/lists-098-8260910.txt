I know that my views are not in line with yours or
Tim's, but I have not yet come to the view that they
are at odds with the views of the majority of the
RDF Core WG, or the world at large for that matter.

I think that there are alot of folks (the majority)
who do not yet have a view -- but have simply eaten
whatever the W3C and IETF have fed them. And
interestingly enough, more people that I talk to
who do have a view seem to have one closer to mine
than not (and I don't think my perspective is so
severely ego-warped as to just be seeing things as
I would like them to be).

And of course, just because my views are different
from others does not mean that I would not faithfully
represent the consensus of opinion or concern from
RDF Core.

And I simply was volunteering...

In any case, regardless of any relation to the RDF
Core WG, I would like to participate in the URI CG.

Can you advise me on the official process?

Thanks,

Patrick
