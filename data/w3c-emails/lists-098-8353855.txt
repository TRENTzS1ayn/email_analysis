OK, let's back up.  The original show stopper in this case was, in my view, 
the lack of self-entailment of a document, which was in turn a consequence 
of the treatment of untidy literal nodes.

Jeremy offered a proposal that overcame the self-entailment problem, but 
which required a fundamental change to the handling of RDF (relative to at 
least DanC's and my understanding).

The non sequitur here is:

   Proposal A is broken for reason of problem B.

   Proposal C fixes problem B

   =>  Proposal A+C is not broken.

Roughly, you have to consider the wider picture,  you can't just pick off 
problems in isolation.
