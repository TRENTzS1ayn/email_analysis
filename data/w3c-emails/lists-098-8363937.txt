My suggestion was that there only was an entailment problem if you
subscribed to the view that literals are globally unique in meaning.

Since it was shown that such a view is not correct, does then the
entailment problem go away?

I was not referring to Jeremy's revised proposal -- which really is
not another proposal, but a way to view/implement TDL which makes
the tidy/untidy issue a bit more explicit.

This was not what I was saying.

I was saying

  Proposal A (TDL) is broken for reason of problem B ("Duh!").
  There is no problem B.
  Proposal A is not broken.

Never did. You seem to have misunderstood me.

Is the above now clearer?

Cheers,
