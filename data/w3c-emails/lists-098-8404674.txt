My ideal outcome for the datatyping discussion is something like we agree on
TDL or S-P (perhaps with an S-A idiom but S-P semantics) and then Pat works
his model theoretic magic so that the literal strings somehow vanish from
the model theory.

I, never having got passed the apprentice stage, can't weave such wonders.
