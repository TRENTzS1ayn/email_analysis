Jeremy,

Did my thoughts on an MT for TDL make any sense to you?

Essentially, I was treating literals like blank nodes, but with some extra 
conditions.

Originally, I started using a mapping from literal nodes to datatype map 
members, a bit like Pat's "A" for blank nodes, then felt I could could say 
the same thing without it.

I've sent of copy of that bit of my note to the archive, with some links to 
Jeremy's related notes, available at:
