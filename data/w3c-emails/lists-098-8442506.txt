Then I guess I really don't grok the problem.

It seemed to me that Dan's expectations of tidy literals was
that he was treating node equality with value equality, rather
than just string equality.

Insofar as the graph itself is concerned, literals are just
strings. They don't become values without interpretation
based on a datatype context.

So all you could entail between two literal nodes is string
equality. 

But I'll just but out of this particular discussion and let
you more capable and learned folks hash it out.

(I knew I should have slept less in math class...  ;-)

Cheers,

Patrick
