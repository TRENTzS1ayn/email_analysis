Apologies. All of the following fixes are incorporated in afon.py of $Date:
2002-07-10 05:03:50 $.

I've changed it so that it now uses uripath, including a pointer at the
import to uripath.py.

Yes; I've been tweaking the grammar about a bit, and some of the names of
the productions are probably not best suited to their semantics. In the
case of "name", these are things which--in general--can be subjects and
objects but not predicates.

Not according to the DesignIssues document (see especially the wonderful -
to _ mapping hack), but I've reinstated them for the time being in afon.

Many thanks for your feedback.
