I'm not sure how I feel about having something like this in the arch
doc, but I know I wrote something like it before. In case you
also find it relevant:

[[
Abstract

The architecture and implementation of the World Wide Web are evaluated
with respect to Douglas Engelbart's requirements for an open
hyperdocument system. Engelbart's requirements are derived from
experience in using computer-supported collaborative work (CSCW) to
support large scale electronic commerce. 

[...]

Conclusions

Support for Engelbart's requirements is far from ubiquitous. But the
architecture in no way prevents them from being realized, and the
quantity of resources integrated into the system provides ample
motivation for research and development.

In each area where facilities to meet the requirement are not
ubiquitous, a demonstration of sufficient facilities has taken place.

This gives confidence that the requirements will eventually be met and
become infrastructure.

If in fact Engelbart's requirements are an effective way to measure the
viability of a platform for electronic commerce, the Web is very likely
to be a viable platform for some time to come.
