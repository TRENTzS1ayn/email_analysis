Then how would you say that "x + 1" means the sum of x and one ?  We still
can't (dont't want to) use quoted literals as subjects in n3, can we (do we
want to)?

{{y > xPlus1 } => {x a foo:Interesting} } (works for) me.

Or alternatively maybe we *should* allow + and - to appear in names:

{{y > x+1. x+1 sumOf  (x, 1)  } => {x a foo:Interesting} }
