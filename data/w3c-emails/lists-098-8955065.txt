Let's be clear at this proposed syntax, clear for which I wanted to keep 
the way.
(which I wanted to keep the way clear for).

x + 1  would be short for   [ is math:sum of (x 1)]
The BNF would have to become a typical expression
  sum :: factor : sum * sum
and so on

I'd like to keep it open, anyway,

BTW, The other thing which I am must more eager to put in is

my:event.cal:start.cal:timepart.time:hours
as shorthand for
[ is time:hours of [ is cal:timepart of [ is cal:start of my:event]]]

The expression above could, incidentally, be written

(x 1).math:sum

using this "rdfpath"  :-)  feature.

Re quoted literals as subjects, I want to. I do. cwm accepts it.
It is more symmetrical, which is simpler, and good.
The lack of literal as subject is IMHO a bug in RDF 1.0

"0" cal:englishDayOfWeekName "Sunday".
"1" cal:englishDayOfWeekName "Monday".

(  Also, while a given system of logic may have axioms that
for example literals and predicates are distinct, I don't think that this
should be enforced by the N3 base syntax necessarily.
Certainly bnodes can be predictaes as in
:joe [ is daml3:transitiveClosue of :parent] :alan.  )
