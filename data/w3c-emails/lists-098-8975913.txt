Have you seen the section in part 2 [1] that talks about how parameters
that are used to identify resources should be part of the URI? This is
entirely independent of the request method used (in HTTP-speak), just
saying that parameters that in some sense identify a resource should
when possible be part of the URI.

Does this address your concern?
