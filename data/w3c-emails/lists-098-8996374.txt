Because a major difference between RPC and the Web is that RPC doesn't
provide the concept of identifying resources with URIs which is why the
section starts:

"The World Wide Web identifies resources with URIs, but common
programming conventions convey identification information in the
arguments to procedures, or in the names of those procedures."

That is, in plain old HTTP, it is the common mode of operation to
identify resources using URIs.

Yeah, I have heard about the goals of HTTP ;)

From a spec point of view, I actually think this does address the issue.

If you believe there are editorial improvements to the primer then I
suggest you generate a new issue as this is somewhat different from this
issue.
