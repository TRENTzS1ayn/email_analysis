Is the W3C XSLT Service at http://www.w3.org/2001/05/xslt supposed to be 
working?

Using the example URIs supplied on the page evokes this error -

> Proxy Error
> The proxy server received an invalid response from an upstream server.
> 
> The proxy server could not handle the request GET /2000/06/webdata/xslt.
> 
> Reason: Could not connect to remote machine: Connection refused

- as do others I try.
