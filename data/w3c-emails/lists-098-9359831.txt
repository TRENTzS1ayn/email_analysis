Hi,

please view the following test page in Opera6+ or Mozilla 1.0(RCx); it 
should be empty.

http://www.pinkjuice.com/temp/IE/css2.xhtml

It uses XHTML1.0, and CSS2, both current core webstandards.

Then view it in IE6.0; at the top, there will be
"Please use a more recent browser with better support for current core 
webstandards, such as Mozilla 1.0+, Netscape 6.2+, or Opera6+."

This is because IE6.0 still doesn't support the > sign in the CSS2 
selector syntax.
http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/selector.html#child-selectors

In the source of the page:

   ...
       body > .older {
display:none
         }
   ...
   <body>
       <div class="older">
   ...

I'm looking forward to better support of core webstandards in IE6.0+.

Windows Millennium [Version 4.90.3000]
Internet Explorer 6.0.2600.0000
