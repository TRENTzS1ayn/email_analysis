Not of the particular service, which is the context in which I've been
using the term.  Obviously some shared knowledge has to exist in order
for things to interoperate.

Right.  I don't claim that either approach does anything special here.

But I will point out that HTTP permits a client to ask for a specific
format, and that there are several orders of magnitude less data formats
than there are possible methods.  Plus, data formats are standardized,
whereas methods rarely are.

Intermediaries such as firewalls also understand what "1"/GET means.
