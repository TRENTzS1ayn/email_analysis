Thanks for redirecting to a list I'm not subscribed to ;-)

So you get back application/xml ... so you can parse the result. Is that 
useful without knowledge of the semantics associated with the document?

Sure, but can they tell the difference between,

  GET /benign-uri

and,

  GET /malicious-uri

any more than they can tell the difference between benign and malicious 
request entities associated with a POST? Granted the parsing costs will 
favour the URI over the entity, but it's not clear to me that that's 
likely to be all that big a gain.

That might be true, but you haven't persuaded me yet. And who's to say 
that non-zero-sum doesn't pan out as negative-sum?

Cheers,
