I took a look at the comments changes.  Basically OK, but there is at 
least one spelling error:

<current>
Comment information items MAY appear as children and/or descendants of the 
[document element] element information item but not before or after that 
element informaton item . There are some restrictions in the processing 
model with respect to when comment information items can be added and/or 
removed (see 2.7.2.1 Relayed Infoset).
</current>
<minimalChangetoFixSpelling>
Comment information items MAY appear as children and/or descendants of the 
[document element] element information item but not before or after that 
element >information< item . There are some restrictions in the processing 
model with respect to when comment information items can be added and/or 
removed (see 2.7.2.1 Relayed Infoset).
</minimalChangetoFixSpelling>

<possibleAdditionalChangetoMakeClearer?>
>Although not explicitly called out in the sections below,< comment 
information items MAY appear >in the Envelope infoset< as children and/or 
descendants of the [document element] element information item, but not 
before or after that element >information< item. There are some 
restrictions in the processing model with respect to when comment 
information items can be added and/or removed (see 2.7.2.1 Relayed 
Infoset).
</possibleAdditionalChangetoMakeClearer?>

Reasons for proposed additional changes:  (1) makes clear that lack of 
discussion below is intentional (2) make clear that we do consider these 
part of the Envelope infoset and thus subject to transmission.   I think 
that's the only coherent interpretation anyway, but someone might be 
tempted to look at the sort of oblique introduction of comments at the top 
of the chapter and say:  "well, if they really mattered, they would have 
been called out properly."  My proposal to make it an explicit note 
failed, so I'm wondering if this helps a bit.

Honestly, I'm not pushing either of these changes hard.  If all we want to 
do is fix the spelling, or to adopt just the first of the additional 
changes, I'm fine with that.  Thanks.

Yes, I added a paragraph to the start of Section 5[1] and removed the
entry from Section 1[2]
