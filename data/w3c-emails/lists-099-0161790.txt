Tim,

I have modified the easter testcase at
http://www.agfa.com/w3c/euler/easterP.n3
in that it now uses math:integerQuotient
(we now also support rules with more than one
triple in the conclusion but without bnodes).

I have also tested with cwm and it indeed
gives


    2003     a <easter#Year>;
         <easter#hasEasterOnDay> 20.0;
         <easter#hasEasterOnMonth> 4 .

    2004     a <easter#Year>;
         <easter#hasEasterOnDay> 11.0;
         <easter#hasEasterOnMonth> 4 .

which is like we get with euler asking
http://www.agfa.com/w3c/euler/easterP.n3
(just wonder why the day has got a dot
and the month not)
