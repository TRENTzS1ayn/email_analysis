I have a picture in my head of what an HTTP binding should look like,
but unfortunately it works directly against the "protocol independence"
approach that Web services seems to hold so dear, including this new
binding AFAICT.

In my opinion, any binding which does not recognize that the
wsdl:operation is "GET", "POST", etc.. when using HTTP, is not a valid
HTTP binding.

I've described how I feel this should be addressed here;
