Gudge's suggested style is fine.
Btw, I am on vacation today and tomorrow, sorry for the late notice and

I will double check prior affiliations against my membership/roll call

Yves/Carine - any news on the 'gateway' meeting with TBL?

Both as an editor and as one of the people who has had a dual affiliation,
I'm OK with whatever our chair suggests is appropriate.
