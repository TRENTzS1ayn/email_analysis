This open issues deely is great...
  http://www.w3.org/2002/12/open-issues

It would be even greater if it would tell me,
at a glance, which of the open issues has had
no replies at all.


By the way...

it's signed with a pointer
to http://www.w3.org/Team/Dom/. I'd rather it
referred to a world-readable info about you.

Also, are you the only person who supports this
thing? Or is there some group that I should send
requests for enhancement to? I'd like to see some
part of the QA activity endorse/support it.
