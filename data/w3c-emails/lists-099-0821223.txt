Yes.

Yes. I think 9. is not that important.

Well, except that we talked with them about dropping language from
datatypes, and explained to them that this was the right thing
because the XML Schema datatypes are designed as language/
locale independent notations (just integers, just dates,...).
What we never expected from them is to a) shoehorn XML Literals
into datatypes (which may be okay if it helps them and doesn't
hurt us), and b) turning around and nuking language information
from XML Literals.

Not exactly. Adding language information to things such as integers,
decimals, dates,... leads to all kinds of weird questions. We have
had to work quite a bit on Schema for them to not do that.
(because you could write a date as 8/6/03 or 6/8/03 or many other
ways, and claim that they follow different languages, and even
if that claim is a bit weird, you could very well claim it for
Wednesday August 6, 2003,..., but overall, that would not lead
to interoperability at all).

Thanks!       Martin.
