Dear Yukiko Ogura,

Thank you for your message.   The .htm suggests this is for my 
information. However, I notice that one of the enclosed documents 
mentions a request for WAI to review a document.  So I suspect that 
this is a request for review.

I don't know whether this is  part of an existing conversation. In any 
case, I hoper Judy Brewer will be able to fit into place.

Sincerely,

Tim Berners-Lee

PS: I enclose your enclosures unzipped so that they are accessible from 
our archive.  I would point out that we find it much easier to work 
with groups who use standards for their own communications, and I am 
grateful for the HTML and plain text documents which you enclosed.

I note to readers of the archive however that the HTML and text are NOT 
alternative renderings of the information in the *.doc documents

Title : Liaison Statement to W3C WAI Committee on Auditory and Visual 
Impairment tools in MPEG-21 Digital Item Adaptation

WG 11 (MPEG) would like to draw your attention to our work on ???Digital 
Item Adaptation??? (MPEG-21 part 7, ISO/IEC 21000-7). The most recent 
version of this document is attached, together with an overview of the 
MPEG-21 Multimedia Framework.

Section 5.3 of ISO/IEC 21000-7 specifically covers adaptations of 
digital content to address the needs of people with auditory and visual 
impairment.  WG 11 would appreciate input from your experts on the 
validity, relevance and completeness of the tools defined in these 
sections.

To be able to reflect your comments in the next stage of the 
standardisation process, we would encourage you to respond before our 
next meeting (October 20-24, 2003). WG 11 also invites your experts to 
participate in the ad hoc activity on Editing MPEG-21 Digital Item 
Adaptation FCD & AM (Chairman and contact point: Anthony Vetro - ).

We are looking forward to receiving your comments and feedback.
