Hi

FWIW I agree with Pat.

I wouldn't say that the LC design could not have been patched to the point 
where it would just about work - but that doing that would have made it 
sufficiently unlikely that there would be many implementations of XMLLiteral 
(particularly in OWL, where the resistance was higher and the difficulties 
also higher). Sandro's message I suspect could also be patched to the point 
where it does produce a self-consistent design - but that's not necessarily 
one that will get support and certainly cannot be characterised as 'cheap'.

I think the current design is a distinct improvement on the LC.

Jeremy
