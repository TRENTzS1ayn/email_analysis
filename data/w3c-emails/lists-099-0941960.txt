What does it mean to "own" a name?   How can you tell who or what "owns"
a name?   In what scenarios does ownership matter or appear?

I have some drafty answers to these, near to:
  http://esw.w3.org/topic/FollowLinksForMoreInformation
  http://esw.w3.org/topic/NamespaceSquating
  http://esw.w3.org/topic/NamespaceDistortion

Lately I've been reading Kripke and getting a better handle on this,
but I haven't expressed my thoughts on it yet.

And yet human and machine networks only scale when you have a global
context, like URIs and the web.   That's why we treat URIs as having
(mostly) a single meaning, right?
