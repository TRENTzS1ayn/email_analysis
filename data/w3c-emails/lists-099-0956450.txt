Would you consider making use of machine-readable metadata about site
update policies?

The RSS-DEV group developed an RDF vocabulary for use with RSS1.0 which
might be relevant. We could encourage folks to link to a robots.rdf from robots.txt
or with a LINK REL from homepages. See http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/
-> http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/modules/syndication/

This gives markup along lines of:

     <sy:updatePeriod>hourly</sy:updatePeriod>
     <sy:updateFrequency>2</sy:updateFrequency>
     <sy:updateBase>2000-01-01T12:00+00:00</sy:updateBase>
     
Something like this should be useful, though I guess you'd want a way to 
know the schedule for the entire site rather than for each page
separately. 

I'd also strongly encourage you to use RSS1 feeds (or any RSS feeds) to
gather info about new pages on the site, to allow your index to stay up
to date with info about recently changed pages on each site. There are 
LINK REL conventions for finding RSS feeds too...

cheers,

Dan

cool :)
