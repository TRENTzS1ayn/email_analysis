Gold star, norm!


[[[

21:23:41 <ndw> DanC, can I test my gross-level understanding of GRDDL on
you?

21:23:53 <DanC> by all means, ndw

21:24:14 <ndw> I publish my documents in "schema of choice" and include
a link (using xml-stylesheet or HTML link or whatever's appropriate) to
point to an XSLT stylesheet that spits out the RDF for my document.

21:24:29 <DanC> yup, norm

21:24:37 <ndw> Tools will become smart enough to look for said link and
"do the right thing"

21:24:55 * ndw applauds

21:24:56 <DanC> yes, here's hoping tools will become smart, norm.

21:25:10 <ndw> Five stars. Two thumbs up. And a gold star, to boot.

21:25:17 * DanC takes a bow

21:25:38 <ndw> I'm not sure it completely solves the problem, but it's a
huge win for the 80% case.

21:25:50 <DanC> yes, there are drawbacks. but I keep finding it useful.

21:27:57 <ndw> It looks like I could put the trackback ping in my own
META element and have my stylesheet turn that into the trackback RDF.
"Win."

21:28:29 <ndw> By extension, I can turn Atom into RDF. "Win."

21:29:04 <ndw> Heck, it's even the direct answer to James' question at
the RDF panel at XML 2003. "Win."

21:29:10 <DanC> yes, if you find a moment to atom2rdf.xsl, ndw, I'll
give you a gold star right back.

see you at the W3C Tech Plenary in Cannes 1-5 Mar 2003?



attached mail follows:
Dan,

Here's a first cut. It seems to do an OK job. It doesn't handle the
full generality of Atom yet, but since that's not baked yet, I'm not
inclined to spend time trying to dot i's and cross t's just yet.

You can try converting http://norman.walsh.name/atom/whatsnew.xml and
comparing it with http://norman.walsh.name/index.rss, for example.



                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
