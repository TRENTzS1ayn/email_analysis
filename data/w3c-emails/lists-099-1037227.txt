Dan,

The application is here:

jar:http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/duplicates.jar!/duplicates.xul

The actual data is located here:

http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/data/duplicates.rdf

Or here:

http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/duplicates.cgi?ctype=rdf

The script is available for others to use.  It's checked into CVS here:

http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/webtools/bugzilla/duplicates.xul

Note also this example (which will look awfully familiar to you, and 
which uses XSLT to convert Amazon's XML into RDF for consumption by 
Mozilla):
