The Semantic Web development team is announcing the At A Glance RSS 1.0
aggregator, an RDF-based implementation in Java using HP Lab's Jena 1.6.0
and Apache Tomcat.  The installation on w3.org can be found at:

  http://www.w3.org/2001/10/glance/view/

At A Glance is configured with an RDF file [1] using RSS vocabulary along
with a small set of Glance-oriented RDF terms.  It interacts with the ACL
system in place on w3.org and can be customized for those with Member
login privileges.

Further customization is possible for those with a reasonable working
knowledge of RDF and RSS 1.0 and login privileges.

More general documentation is available at:

  http://www.w3.org/2001/10/glance/doc/about

and personalization documentation at:

  http://www.w3.org/2001/10/glance/doc/personal

Please contact Ryan Lee (ryanlee@w3.org) and cc: to Eric Miller
(em@w3.org) and the www-archive@w3.org public mailing list for questions
and comments.  We have not yet worked on packaging the software together
as a release, but if you are interested in setting up your own
installation of At A Glance, please contact us.
