As per the planned timeline, I had hoped to see the first iteration of 
the repository live today. Regrettably, I hit a couple of snags on my 
side with the code. Nothing to show yet today, but I am working on it.

I think we should set our eyes on a catch up IRC at the beginning of 
next week? Would that work for people?

Thanks (and more as soon as I have something to show...)

Greg
