Thanks, Benjamin.

I was looking at RAP a bit last night and felt it meant re-architecting 
a lot of code

However, rdfworld.php [1]  looks very shiny, converting RDF into PHP 
objects. That could
map very nicely. Will look more. Thanks!

Question still stands for me...is the hasPart or the Rectangle the 
object?

Greg

P.S. (Love this group!)
