Hi Greg,

>I mean we've talked about using rectangle or path, but if we are

>foaf:Image (an object)
>      image:width (a property)
>      image:height (a property)
>      image:HasPart (an object)
>         HasPart: width (a property)
>         HasPart: height (a property)
>
>Or put another way, would we *ever* have an image:hasPart without
>having an image:Rectangle? From the vocab, if an image has a
>image:hasPart it must have an image:points.


You can use rdf:parseType="Resource" to make hasPart behave as an object
while being a property.

 <foaf:Image rdf:about='...Closingpanel5.gif'>
  <image:width>535</image:width>
  <image:height>367</image:height>
  <image:hasPart rdf:parseType='Resource'>
   <image:points>6,106 84,181</image:points>
   <dc:description>Joseph Hardin looking interested</dc:description>
   ...

However, you cannot put rdf:ID on this hasPart (actually you can, but with
totally different meaning). Also, the spec defines the value of
image:points to be interpreted according to its subject type, e.g., if the
parent is image:Circle, the value means "X,Y R", etc.

I think the syntax with image:Rectangle is better for clarity and
interoperability. But if image:Rectangle is a problem for you, maybe you
can use the above syntax for internal use of Fotonotes as a transitional
format (you may want to add an extra property like
<fotonotes:selectionId>1</fotonotes:selectionId> inside the image:hasPart).
This is a legal RDF, and a clever tool may be able to guess that this
implies a Rectangle from the value of image:points.


cheers,
