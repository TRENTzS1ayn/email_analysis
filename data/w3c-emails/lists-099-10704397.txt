Hi,

Now a few weeks passed after the discussion of the w3photo vocabulary, I
want to make the current situation of proposed terms a bit clearer.

As per discussion by Morten and Jim, following classes and properties were
proposed [1]:

In addition, property 'coords' was discussed in the same massage:

I find two resources that explain the vocabularies of w3photo: Libby's
W3PhotoVocab Wiki page [2] and Benjamin's OWL pages [3].

Libby's wiki seems to show examples with existing vocabularies rather than
proposed one, but includes 'image:regionDepicts', which is not a part of
Jim's vocab. Benjamin's page has both existing and proposed terms, but not
contain 'coords' and 'regionDepicts' properties.

All those combined, the current situation of the vocab is a bit confusing
for me. Shall we just wait for the new namespace (who will define ?), or is
there still any argument ?

Sorry if I miss some important notes, but I think it'd be happier to have
clearer information on this.

cheers,
