Yeah, it's ok and understandable for both non-native RDF users and
non-native English users ;-)

(actually, the subject of width/height/hasPart is the rdf:about uri of
<image> element, and image is its rdf:type. Likewise, the subject of points
etc. is '#P1', and Ractangle is its rdf:type. But forget about these
details for now..)

I'm looking forward to seeing RDF version of Fotonotes description !

cheers,
