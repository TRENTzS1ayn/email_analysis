Hi Dan

this message is to you as chair of RDF IG.

Chris Bizer is visiting HP for the next couple of months.

He and I are intending to work on trust, contexts, named graphs etc.
(see threads in RDF IG)

We have agreed that work we do together is public. In order to clearly 
implement that we are inclined to frequently cc: www-archive with our 
on-going work, and then send occassional summaries to rdf-ig linking to the 
www-archive thread.

Please confirm that this is an appropriate use of www-archive.

(Others in HP will be working with Chris on bridging between RDF and SQL, 
and may choose to use the same technique for clarity about intellectual 
property).


Jeremy
