That has also been my experience. And I think it reflects one of the 
fundamental goals of the w3photo project, namely to facilitate RDF 
annotation and thus provide a repository of data and metadata for future 
people to experiment with in developing applications that *do* something 
with the data/metadata.

I've got lots of ideas for cool ways to manipulate the metadata I'm 
collecting in my own project, but currently I'm just gathering the data 
and metadata. Hey, I figure I've still got a good 9 years left to figure 
all that out...
