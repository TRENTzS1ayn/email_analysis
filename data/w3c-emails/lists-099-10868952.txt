Hi Libby and all,

Thanks Libby for updating examples. W3c namespace seems fine.

I noticed, by looking at Libby's example, that 'width' and 'height' are not
part of the proposed vocabulary. Why not adding them to the vocab ? I think
we have a lot of use cases for these properties, and find no reason to
leave them alone in Jim's namespace.

cheers,
