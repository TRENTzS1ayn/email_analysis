I've adjusted my stuff and replaced the image regions namespace uri [1]
with [2]. If we really get an "official" w3.org namespace, I'd agree with
Masahide that this should include width and height as well (though the
semantics are different from Jim's terms, that can be both used for images
and regions). And it should have connections to foaf:Image. I'm not sure 
about depicts and depiction though: deployment-friendly re-using from foaf
vs. re-defining+mapping and having a complete image vocabulary.

For easier discussion, I put a proposal for [2] online. It follows the
latter approach and redefines the terms from the foaf vocab but redundant
terms can easily be removed:
