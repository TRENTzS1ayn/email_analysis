Hi Sandro,


sorry to jump in the discussion, but it's because it reminds me 
something.

In the past, I asked if it was possible to have tarball of the cwm 
package.

When you think a version is stable, just make a simple 
swap-stable.tar.gz and keep a version number to the cvs tree.

So people will be able to use it without too much problems.
