DanBri, Guus,

I'm getting my head around the TP week...
  http://www.w3.org/2004/03dc-nce/trip.html

wondering when/if to present GRDDL at the SWIG meeting
  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/interest/meetings/tp2004.html
and/or the BPDWG meeting. (DanBri, I'll be in touch
separately about a possible RDF calendar task force
update.)


I owe my time to the TAG on Tuesday, so I'd the SWIG
discussed GRDDL on Monday if at all.

EricM, thanks for the pointer from
  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/
to the SWIG meeting. Now it's easy to find, but the
BPDWG ftf agenda is still kinda hard to find.


I still have to go back to Ralph's message of
2 Feb to the CG to find it...
  http://www.w3.org/2004/03/04-SWBPD
  .

I see RDF-XHTML slated (v 1.6 2004/02/02 20:08:32)
for Friday morning... hmm... that conflicts with an invitation
to a Voice WG meeting to talk about TAG stuff.

Hmm... still no "this is different from the best
practices meeting" on the SWIG page, danbri...
nor vice versa, Ralph/Guus.

So I'm aware of at least one piece of feedback
pending on each of those FTF meeting pages.
Please address that issue and as many others
as you can in the next day or so and let me know.
