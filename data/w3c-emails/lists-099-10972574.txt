I note that the latter is Member-ACL'd. It would be useful 
to have this public, so that SW IG members can see what's planned 
for thurs/fri. Is there any particular reason not to have it 
public? 

http://www.w3.org/2003/12/swa/swbpd-charter.html is Member-only too. 
I'd like to put this on the SW IG agenda too. Can we have it be public, 
rather than having to cite earlier (public) versions?

Re GRDDL, I'd welcome a lightning talk on this work. Any prefs re monday
vs tuesday?
