Thanks for the kind words!

The straightforward way is for SnapBuild to join W3C; see...

  Apply for W3C Membership
  http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Prospectus/Joining

If SnapBuild joins W3C, you would have the right to participate
in the WebOnt/OWL WG. But it would mostly
be test suite maintenance and discussion of errata; not very
exciting stuff.

I think the best opportunity for somebody to get involved
is...

  1-2 March 2004 Meeting of the W3C Semantic Web Interest Group
  Cannes-Mandelieu FRANCE 
  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/interest/meetings/tp2004.html

Meanwhile, the main public discussion forum for OWL is
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-logic/
and you're welcome to participate there. We also
have a wiki; see, for example,
  http://esw.w3.org/topic/OwlTools

I hope one or more of these opportunities helps you
get more involved in W3C's work.
