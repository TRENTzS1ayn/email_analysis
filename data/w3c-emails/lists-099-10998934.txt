Tood - let me second what Dan said below and add one more thing -- 
please feel free to join the discussions on the ww-rdf-interest and 
www-rdf-logic mailing lists and let people know what you are doing 
and how you are using the Semantic Web technologies.  There is a 
strong and collegial developer community out there, and we are doing 
all we can to encourage the sharing of ideas and products in the 
semantic web space.
