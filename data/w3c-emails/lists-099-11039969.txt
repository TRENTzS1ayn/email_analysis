So what does your application layer look like, Jim?  Does it have
operations?

Is the type of interaction you're trying to describe that of, say, the
submission of a document to a fax machine, where the document is nothing
more than an MS-Word file?  Is there an operation there, either at your
WSDL-describing layer, or your application layer?  If yes, how is that
operation specified with respect to the message itself?  If no, how do
you distinguish between the submission to the fax for immediate
printing, and the submission to the fax for queued printing (kind of a
weak example, but hopefully you see what I'm asking)?  And how would you
*request* something from the fax machine without an operation, like
asking it for its status?

Mark.
