I am most interested in the QAF review and issues Monday PM, (with a flow
over onto Tuesday PM). Hence I would prefer if the SWIG topics that I have
expressed interest in (particularly contexts, etc) were Monday or Tuesday
AM. I would hope to attend QAIG on Monday PM, and make a call Tuesday
lunchtime as to which (QAIG or SWIG) to attend Tuesday PM
