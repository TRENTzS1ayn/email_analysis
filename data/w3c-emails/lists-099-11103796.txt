Can we schedule an IRC chat for whoever is interested to QA and test 
the Alpha version of the default repository? Anytime over the next few 
days would be great.

I think I have something worth looking at with a reasonable process 
flow and an initial look and feel. I'm still working on the RDF 
generation, but I've become a bottleneck on getting the repository 
online. I didn't want to wait any longer to start some further QA.

The repository is at
http://w3photo.org/photos

Hopefully it is self-explanatory. Here are a few notes, however:

- Only registered persons can annotate or contribute.

- Photos are stored in directory corresponding to conference, e.g.,
w3photo.org/photos/www2003
w3photo.org/photos/www2002
w3photo.org/photos/www10
etc.

- Uploaded images are stored in 3 resolutions: original HQ; resized for 
web; thumbnail. These versions are respectively stored in the 
directories
w3photo.org/photos/www2003/photos_hq/
w3photo.org/photos/www2003/photos/
w3photo.org/ photos/www2003/photos_thmb/
etc...

- Images won't be accepted into the core until all the necessary 
metadata has been added into each image. I'd like to add some 
indicators that tell you which of your images have sufficient metadata.

- You can browse all photos or just your photos. I'd like to eventually 
change this so you "all photos" means your photos + those that have 
been accepted into the collection.

Sorry it's been slow bringing this online.  The workflow was tricker 
than I thought and I kept finding bugs.

best,

Greg
