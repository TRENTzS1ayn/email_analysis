Fair enough. Though we could consider the attribute value as
a short hand, which generates a second anonymous graph containing
the statement about assertion of the first graph.

We may, though, end up with an infinite recursion. I.e., we have
a graph X that is asserted. In order to say that X is asserted,
we have to have another graph X' containing a statement that
X is asserted. But if X' is also asserted, we have to have another
graph X'' with a statement saying that X' is asserted, etc., etc.

Fair enough. I have no problems changing the name of the root element
for the sake of avoiding confusion.

Right. That's pretty much how I've thought about trust, not that
I've delved into the topic anywhere near as deeply as Chris or others.
