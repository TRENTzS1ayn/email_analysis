I think we should, since otherwise inference-capable system will get 
confused, and think a region is an image that can be displayed - like we 
talked about earlier.

The prose for coords property is really hard to understand (what's the exact 
difference between "separated" and "delimited"?). I know it's probably based 
on my own bad write-up, but still! :-)
An example for each region type would go a long way.

Morten
