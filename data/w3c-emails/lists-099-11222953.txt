hey, thank you. :-) I hope you didn't do view-source..

I can see three options then:
- create width and height with domain=Image
- re-use width and height from Jim's SVG vocab (domain=Resource)
- create regionWidth and regionHeight with domain=Region
But there is probably no need for option 1 in the imreg vocabulary. and
Libby said there will be an "official" image+EXIF schema at w3.org soon,
which I guess will have width and height props. re-describing jim's width
and height for the DL version should not change the semantics (what I just
did. I will change the domain to owl:Thing). Do we need width and height
for regions at all (re option 3)? It'd be another "boundingbox in 1D", I
guess..

yes. sorry. I made it even worse ;-). will try to find a better description.

examples would definitely be helpful. my doc-publisher doesn't support them
yet. I'll try to add the feature at the weekend.
