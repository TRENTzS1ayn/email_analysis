Hi Gerald,

  The <html-tidy@w3.org> mailing list got recently a number of messages
from @yahoogroups.com mailing list. I've asked the list maintainers to
remove it, but for at least some lists not <html-tidy@w3.org> had been
subscribed but rather <aa-sender@w3.org>. An example of such a mail is

  http://www.w3.org/mid/002201c36d7f$85a0fbe0$0202a8c0@WorkGroup

As you maintain both addresses, could you look into this issue?

Thanks.
