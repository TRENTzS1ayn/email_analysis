Not an option, methinks, re the confusion issue.

That could work, but not really desirable.

That could also work, but then 'width' and 'height' would be better (the 
region part is already in the namespace).

That's a very good point. We could very well use that instead, it'd help the 
adoption of boundingBox, and not confuse anyone. However, should someone wish 
to add widht and height properties, it'd be better to have them defined, but 
discouraged, than not at all. I'm not sure what the best approach would be.
