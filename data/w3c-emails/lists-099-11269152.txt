I included width/height in Exif vocabulary as convenient terms to describe
those values from JPEG information, not Exif tags. But now I'm afraid
'exif:width' may imply this value is contained in the Exif data in a image,
which could be misleading.

I've been thinking to deprecate these properties (actually, my exif2rdf
uses Jim's width/height instead), but the vocabulary went public ...

I'm not sure whether this is a problem or not. If not, fine to keep these
terms in Exif vocab, and use them in image descriptions.

cheers,
