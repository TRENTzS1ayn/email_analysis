Hi Brian.

I'm CCing www-archive ...

Yes, I saw that, thanks.  But that decision was made before I raised my
issue.  I also didn't see any discussion in the resolution of that issue
that suggests that the group considered my issue.

Yes, I think that's much more closely related.

Yes, that is also very relevant to my issue, though I don't believe that
the decision that has been deferred could yield a future resolution that
addresses my issue.  I could be wrong about that, but I don't think so
based on what I've learned from following public-sw-meaning since its
inception.

Ah, I wasn't familiar with that.  Very interesting and relevant.

If that feature were part of the RDF model, it may very well have
sufficed (though would still be suboptimal).

No, I don't believe so.

From the discussions I've had with folks on this issue, it seems as
though I'm certainly in the minority, so I'm not exactly expecting to
have this resolved in my favour.  But it would be nice to have the WG
respond officially about its position on this subject so that I have
the option of going to the TAG with a URI to the decision.

I don't believe it's a serious enough issue - all things considered -
to hold up going to Rec, though I do believe it (the use
of application/rdf+xml for messages which assume RDF Schema inference)
an architectural flaw that will need to be addressed at some point.
Hence my request for a decision to be rendered.

Thanks for your prompt and thorough(!) investigation into this matter.

Mark.
