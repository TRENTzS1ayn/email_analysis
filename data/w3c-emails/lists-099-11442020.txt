ok, me too.  This email has some process'y stuff first and ends with a 
constructive suggestion for moving forward.

The responsible editor didn't see your message as raising a new issue, 
as you acknowledged in your last message in the thread.  I don't see any 
new information that should have caused the WG to reconsider its 
decision on the existing issue.

I think you have that.

Note the issue specifically asks about a mime-type for rdfs:

   http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#mime-types-for-rdf-docs

[[
Issue mime-types-for-rdf-docs: What mime type should RDF Schema and 
other RDF documents have?
]]

There is the WG's original decision documented in item 8 in the minutes.

   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Apr/0112.html

which is a WG decision that this issue can be closed by defining a 
mime-type for RDF/XML documents.

The WG considered that issue and decided.  That you asked the same 
question again later doesn't change the fact of the WG's decision.

Whew!

If you take this to the TAG, you are going to have to explain what is 
special about RDFS (or some small set of RDF vocabularies) or that 
mime-types are an appropriate mechanism to use to specify arbitrary 
required processing of published documents, which I think will be a very 
tough sell.

Another approach to this would be to take your *requirement* (i.e. a 
mime-type for rdfs is a solution, not a requirement) up with the (about 
to be?) proposed rdf best practices WG.  You could email Guus Schreiber 
and see if they would be willing to take it on.  If not then you could 
go to the SW coordination group and see what they (we) have to say. 
Its a bit of long winded dance, but then, if all that fails, you will 
have done all you can before escalating to the TAG, if escalation is how 
you see it.
