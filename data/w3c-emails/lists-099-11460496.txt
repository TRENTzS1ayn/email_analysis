Yes, there are several...

  - jena has OWL support
  - OWL API by Bechover et. al.
  - Cerebra from network inference

For pointers and such, see the WG implementation report
  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/WebOnt/impls#Implementations

in fact, I just copied this info into a Wiki that we use
as a collaborative FAQ...

"... What RDF APIs can I use? ..."
  -- http://esw.w3.org/topic/WebDataInterfaceDesign

If you find any other APIs or useful info, please share
it there.

As noted in that wiki topic,

 XML.com: Building Metadata Applications with RDF [Feb. 12, 2003]

is a nice intro. That article uses python, but the ideas translate
to RDF pretty well. Hmm... I'm not very familiar with any OWL-specific
introductory programming articles, but I think there perhaps some
in...

  http://esw.w3.org/topic/OwlTalks

You'll also find links there to the official OWL Guide as
well as other introductory materials.
