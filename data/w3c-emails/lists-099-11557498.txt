Apart from the import loop bug (which seems to be fixed now), the style
sheet at http://tantek.com/CSS/Examples/highpassfilter.css is actually
invalid. As per CSS 2.0, @import must be followed by a URI as a string
or inside the url(...) notation, <null?"{> however is no legal URI since
'"' and '{' are excluded from the URI syntax (section 2.4.3. of RFC2396)

regards.
