No, per CSS2(.1) grammar[1] and prose[2], @import may be followed by a
*string* which is then interpreted as a URI.  Nowhere in CSS is it required
that the string be a valid URI -- user agents are only expected to be able
to parse it as string.  Thus the style sheet is still valid CSS.

The only thing that the validator was complaining about was the MIME type of
the null?{ file which I believe I have fixed but am unable to check because
the CSS validator is timing out when attempting to read any HTTP resources
(like I tried CSS validating http://yahoo.com for example so I know it is
not a problem with my web server.)

That certainly appears to be so.  I'll investigate an alternative with a
valid URI.
