Yes.

It is only in processing queries to filter the contents that the
separate items in the list are treated separately.

Right.  There is no way to have some cells with one property and other cells
with another via headers=id association and the consequent heredity from the
'axis' value for a header cell.

Now I suspect that you have an application where you would like to have
an irregular pattern of category-membership-properties in the superficially
regular array of data cells.  Is this true?  Are you looking for an HTML
coding technique where one cell can have the "toxic waste" and another
have the "into watershed" property in patterns more irregular than

  row X column ==> cell properties

??

In cases like this, the print practice is usually to use some styling
effect, a variation in background color, cell boundary, or a small icon,
to signal the changes from cell to cell.  And provide a key somewhere on
the page.

class="toxicWaste intoAtmosphere" -- on one cell
class="toxicWaste intoWatershed" -- on another

Note that the HTML syntax lets you do this with 'axis' attributes on the
TD cells.  You don't have to inherit an 'axis' value through a header.
However, unless you have the community of browser and AT tools committed
to processing the 'axis' attribute in special ways already, it makes more
sense to use 'class' which style writers will understand as grist for
their selectors.  Not that selectors couldn't select on values of 'axis,'
mind you, but there is no practical (meaningfully enforced) difference
between a category invoked with 'axis' as opposed to a category invoked by
'class.'

Unless IE fails to cope with multiple tokens in the 'class' attribute
(is there a bug like that?) I would suggest this is the superior approach.

One way to code this 'accessibly' is with class tokens on the data cells and
a machine interpretable key somewhere in the page or associated with the page
in a way that the assistive technology will recognize as associated with the
page in a way it cares about.

If you wish to pursue a solution to that problem I suggest that you
get in touch with Lisa Seeman and work on the RDF techniques.  RDF is
one way to provide the machine-interpretable key for cell properties
that are marked with 'class' tokens.

Compare with the request for something that works like labeledBy from the
Java Access API.

True, and I would want WAI to furnish or cite such an example if I thought
that AXIS were worth fighting to save.

No way.

Our experience is that for each one list member with the courage to ask
a "dumb question" there are ten who are lurking out there who don't
know the answer.  The only dumb question is the one you were too afraid
to ask.  Keep up the good work.
