Regardless of the exact form of the schema, I would argue only that,
while we should use owl and rdfs, we should not assume that all
processing tools can use them, and so we should not rely on tools
being able to process them where this is unnecessary, hence my quoting
Dan Connolly in my previous message.

I think we're on the same side here :)

In the example files I showed, I've used a number of different
vocabularies, and the generated schema just links to them, giving some
hints as to where it is acceptable to use each of the properties and
classes.

I's say interoperability rather than 'expediency'. It's a mistake to
ignore existing work *where relevant*, hence the use of geo, creative
commons, dublin core, foaf and Jim Ley's SVG vocabulary in the examples
I gave; however, where a vocabulary does not meet the needs of the
project then it makes sense to consider designing a new one.

cheers
