Hi all,

I've been looking at the ontology Jennifer Golbeck presented for
representing information about conferences. Overall, the ontology is fine
and captures the domain in about the right amount of detail, and there are
only two areas in which I think that the ontology needs clarification or
amendment.

- Date and Time

  Why are these resources rather than datatyped literals? (I'm assuming
  because there are inverses of the hasStartTime/hasEndTime properties)

  What's the relation between times and dates? Are there detailed
  properties which give the components of dates and times, or are they
  completely opaque?

  I'd be in favour of datatyped literals instead of resources here (I'm
  not sure how useful the inverse properties above are likely to be),
  preferably as XML Scheme dateTime (CCYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss)

- Conferences/workshops have at least one start/end date
  (i.e. are a subclass of the restriction of things with at least one
  start/end date). I'm not sure that this makes sense - can a conference
  have more than one of each? Suggest this be changed from
  owl:minCardinality to owl:cardinality
