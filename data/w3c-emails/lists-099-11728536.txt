I believe link must be supported, it would be silly to demonstrate a
semantic _web_ that only actually supports a  semantic server.

My fear is what is defined as commercial work, if I use the resource simply
as sample data in my free, open source (but funded by outside body) image
cataloguer, is that commercial work?   What if I take an image, or some
metadata and aggregrate it into to my commercial FOAF aggregrator (it's only
1 file out of many millions I aggregrate, and I take maybe 2 triples from
the metadata) is that against the terms of the licence, how do we make such
available to scutters in a language they can understand?

Commercial use and privacy are completely orthogonal to my mind, it doesn't
matter if you're compromising my privacy for profit or fun, you're still
compromising it.  I'd also be very interested in seeing a citation of the
actual law that prevents random photos of people being sold, as it will
likely have other issues for us to consider.
