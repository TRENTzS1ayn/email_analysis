hi folks,

how easy would this be....

while browsing photos from the conference on the website, people can  
either 1) supply their foaf file URL in a web page field, 2) choose the  
"Hide Me" checkbox.  They then click their face (just a point, not a  
region).  The same page would come right back, though now their face  
would either 1) have a hover label with their name (and caption below  
with their name), or 2) their face would be covered by a paper bag  
image or some other concealing image.

This would accomplish two things:

1. allows everyone to annotate
2. allows everyone to opt out

Best of all, this would be less labor intensive for the maintainers.   
It would also allow you to keep photos with multiple people in it.  You  
wouldn't have to pull it just cause one spoilsport was shy.
