Hi all,
I'm a researcher in the Next Media Group at Microsoft Research. My
background is all over the map - I did undergraduate in Neurosciences at
Brown University, a Masters in robotics at the MIT AI lab, and a PhD in
computer graphics at the MIT Media Lab. 

I've been at Microsoft Research for 8 years now and worked on a variety
of projects ranging from social computing, avatars, interactive TV, to
image processing. I've been doing a lot of interface work and most
recently have done a series of projects on organizing and annotating
photos and videos. I've called a lot of the projects consumer level data
visualization. My web page is http://research.microsoft.com/~sdrucker. 

I've been swamped for the past few weeks and am heading into another
heavy week for trying to get a SIGGRAPH paper done, but I'll try to
kibitz here and there when I can!

Seems like a great projects with a lot of interesting people involved!
--Steve

Good idea. My name is Antonio Cavedoni and some of you may already know 
me (Libby, Dan: hey there!). I am an Italian student, writer, Web 
developer and designer, and have been quite interested in RDF and the 
Semantic Web in the last year and a half: I even spent six months in 
Bristol! - though completely unrelated to any SemWeb stuff.

I am currently working on a small project to integrate the archives of 
a mailing list I manage with FOAF profiles for the list members, and of 
course I have been thinking about writing an RDF image gallery program 
for quite a while, though I'm still pondering how to do it in a decent 
way.

I code in PHP, Python, JavaScript (and ActionScript) and have done some 
work in XSLT as well.

I have also been doing a good amount of work in (X)HTML, CSS and web 
accessibility stuff, so I think I can help with those if needed.

Thanks for listening.

(Notice the obligatory FOAF .sig ;-)
