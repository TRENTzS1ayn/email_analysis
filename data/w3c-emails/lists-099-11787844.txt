I think that what libby suggests below is both sensible and workable 
-- I would, however, hope that someone who knows more about the legal 
issues takes a look at the license (and also if someone who knows 
what it means would know if we can avoid some of these issues because 
of the research exclusion to the "fare use" aspect of copyright law)
