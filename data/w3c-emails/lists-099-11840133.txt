Libby and I hope to IRC a bit regarding UI.

I've put up the very mockup of Fotonotes in which three fields have
been added to annotating a depiction. The three fields don't work, by
the way...this is just a look at an interface.

1. select an image
2 click and drag over an area of the photo
3. works in IE, Mozilla, etc. (but not in Opera or Safari)
