I'd like to propose a couple of meetings.

1. one to talk about the possible vocabularies for images and parts of
images

2. to decide which vocabularies to use and come up with a sample
piece of RDF that represents the sort of annotation we want


(1) is one of the purposes of the new W3C proposed image description
list, but obviously we need a quick decision - we need to pick one that
does what we want, and we have a couple of examples.

(2) is also becoming urgent, as it impacts on everthing else, including
the UI and getting on with annotating.

Somewhere we might also talk about what things we need to identify
(images, people, parts of images, places etc), and how we might go about
it.

Any takers? I can do (almost) any time - any prefered?

Libby
