In IRC today, Jim Ley suggested decoupling the annotating UI from the
RDF repository.

[[
<JibberJim> Greg, I think the most important things to agree are the
vocabulary for the annotations themselves.

<JibberJim> and the way of telling the central resource about
metadata, either posting raw RDF, or posting a link to some remote rdf,
or posting a link to a jpeg containing RDF.

Does that make sense to people? it would mean that any tool could post
to the server (once we have decided on an RDF vocab), although Greg's
could remain the 'default' UI tool.

I offered to temporarily host a put server which would simply take RDF
and put it on a webserver for others to harvest. Another possibility is
to put images on such a server with embedded RDF in them (I'm a bit more
reluctant to do that). One possibility is to use Annotea.

I'm happy for someone else to take this on if they would rather. If I
did it it would have to be temporary.

cheers
