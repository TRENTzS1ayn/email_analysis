One thought is Dan's suggestion that we register the domain  
w3photo.org.  Then we can point it toward a server temporarily  
(preferablly unix/linux) and put photos there, then RDF stuff either  
there, or on Libby's box.  I can also temporarily put things on my  
server.

With that domain registered, we could more easily move things between  
machines in the future.
