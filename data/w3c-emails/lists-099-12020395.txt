I very much support this idea -- in fact, what would be really cool 
in the long run is to be able to see a picture and have it linked to 
different sets of markup done by different tools - this wouldn't be 
that hard to do (although I'm not volunteering to support it at the 
moment) -- the decoupling above, however, would make it possible to 
migrate in this direction
