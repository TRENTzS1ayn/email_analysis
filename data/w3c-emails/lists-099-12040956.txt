Greg and all-
  just thought I'd point out that the default "reply" address for this 
list is to go to everyone, rather than just to the sender -- might I 
suggest we all be careful about who the responses go to?   Greg, you 
might consider changing this so the default is to return to the 
sender unless one uses a "reply-all" -- from my experience in WGs, it 
is often the case that one sends a hasty reply intended just for the 
sender and only later realizes it is going to everyone - the set up 
where reply goes to sender and "reply all" goes to sender plus list 
is a nice way to get around this and avoids a lot of embarassing 
mistakes
