I may be in the minority, but...
All this naming subdirectories and registering domain names that have the
word photo in bothers me. (w3photo, etc)
Since none of the sub-directories proposed were without it, I didn't offer
an opinion then, but here goes.

I suggest that the word photo should be avoided, if possible.
Because:
a) Although the photo bit of the activity is perhaps the most obvious (and
where the whole thing started), it is not everything. Actually we are trying
to create something like a semantic web site for the conference. It will
certainly be, I hope, an interesting resource to go to for things other than
photos.
b) Who knows where it will be in a few years time. It might well have
evolved to a beautiful example of how to present a knowledge-enabled web
site of a conference series. It might even become *the* site for a whole
bunch of conferences. The word photo would then become irrelevant,
misleading (as now, I think) and even embarrassing. Surely all
knowledge-enabled thingies will be multimedia.

I'm still not sure what would be a good name, however - sorry.

Hugh.
