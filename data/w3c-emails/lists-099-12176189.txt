I've modified the original website that Greg put together. If you have 
any suggestions or comments, please let me know.

There is still room for improvement of course. It doesn't quite validate 
to xhtml yet, but it's a lot closer.

I'm especially interested to hear how it performs in other browsers and 
operating systems. If it looks wacky send me a screenhot, please.

Cheers,
Bryce
