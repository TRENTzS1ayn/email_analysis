yes, i'm interested to know of these. we might as well strive for 
perfection.

i fixed the space between divs (actually they're <li>'s) in 
opera7-winXP. can you check again to verify that the page renders 
consistently?

good catch. i fixed these errors.

i think these links[1] could be organized better. any 
suggestions/preferences?

also, i forgot to mention in my previous message that the original 
version of the site is still online, but moved to here[2].
