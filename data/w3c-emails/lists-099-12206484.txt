Why a transitional doctype, be strict, no need to be transitional on a new
document many years after the transition could've occured.

Why an XHTML doctype served as text/html?  if you're going to do this,
please follow Appendix C.  Much easier if you just switch to HTML 4.01
Strict.

That javascript is wrong and dangerous, remove it, it also fails basically
accessibility points (don't move focus for example)

<a href="javascript:void(0) >  No, very bad...

onClick="JavaScript:resizeWin"  No, it's onclick in XHTML for a start, but
there should be no label in an intrinsic event.  All the rest of that script
is also useless, remove it.
