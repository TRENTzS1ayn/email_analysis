Hi everyone,

I've been working on the website[1]... it now validates to xhtml strict 
and also passes Bobby with AAA.

I created a .png favicon using the colors from the site. If anyone is 
inspired to develop a logo from this, you can find an .svg version 
here[2]. Should I create a .ico version of the favicon, or just ignore 
Internet Explorer?

What about this line:
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/xml; charset=iso-8859-1" />

Is "text/xml" what I should use?
Should I change the charset to utf8?

If you have any suggestions, complaints, or accolades for the website 
let me know.

the Adobe Illustrator gibberish... wasn't sure if i needed that or not.)
