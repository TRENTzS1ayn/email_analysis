No. Since you are writing in XHTML you should use the proper MIME type, 
which is "application/xhtml+xml":-

  <http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-media-types/>

The problem with this is that some browsers (Internet Explorer for 
Windows, chiefly) don't recognize it, so you would have to have some 
server-side script to filter IE & friends and send 
application/xhtml+xml as per the spec to the ones who do understand it.

Also, I don't think it's a good practice to specify the MIME type in a 
meta http-equiv header. I reckon you would be better off sending that 
with the HTTP headers.

Only if you plan to have UTF-8 content in these pages. Recently I tend 
to prefer using UTF-8 myself but the author has to have extra care when 
editing documents with this encoding so it might not be worth the 
hassle for you.

You've done a good work, and you did it quickly. Keep that up :-)

Cheers.
