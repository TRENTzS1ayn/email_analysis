Much better, but it's not Appendix C. conformant,  (you need xml:lang in
there, you need the charset in the XML:PI, you need to not have an XML PI
(meaning you need to switch to UTF-8 or 16.)  You should have you link to
the stylesheet in a PI (but you need to not have XML PI which means you need
to lose the stylesheet)

Are you sure HTML 4.01 wouldn't be better, after all very few people will be
using an XHTML user agent to view it?

It's also not AAA, although the only big problem is the coming soon link,
and once that is a link that will go away!

Your SVG version is served with the wrong mimetype, the Adobe stuff can be
safely removed

Only if you change the character set of the document to it, which would be a
good thing anyway, but you shouldn't really have this line at all, it
certainly shouldn't say something different to the HTTP headers (which is
the main reason it should be avoided, I may load it through a proxy which
changes the charset, or I may save it locally in a different charset.)

It looks good, keep up the good work and you'll get me to stop moaning (this
will be an achievement!)
