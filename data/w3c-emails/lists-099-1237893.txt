I just skimmed through the XForms Basic Working Draft 4 December 2003:

http://www.hixie.ch/specs/html/forms/xforms-basic

and have a few comments. The draft directs comments to
htmlforms@damowmow.com and www-archive@w3.org which i guess are mailing
lists. I'm not subscribed to any of these, so please cc replies to 
bob@db.org.

First of all, if you're going to refer to an RFC it should probably 
be RFC 2822 which obsoletes RFC 822.

Second; please don't force client and server programmers to parse
the horrible syntax of an RFC 2822 "mailbox". If it's unclear why
this is a bad idea, I can come up with a few examples of valid 
RFC 2822 "mailbox"-es to show how bad it can get. Or you can just
believe me when i say it's a disaster :-)

You probably meant to say "..the client must not..."

Other then that, nice initiative!
