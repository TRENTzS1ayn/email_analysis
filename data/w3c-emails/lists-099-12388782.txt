Ian,

Point taken. However, I still think that the diagram needs a paragraph to 
introduce it. It's not until the paragraph *after* the diagram that you 
start to describe the transformation model, so when you hit the diagram, 
you've no idea what it's illustrating. If you move the diagram down by one 
paragraph, you'll get the 'overview' paragraph and then the diagram, which 
makes more sense (to me, anyway). 

Incidentally, is there any way you can make the diagram more compact? It 
really needs to be looked at while reading the text, but that's impossible 
given its current size.

You, of all people, using presentation to imply semantics? I'm shocked! 
shocked! 

Sorry, couldn't resist. I guess that's ok, I'll just have to make sure I 
don't read the spec on my phone :)

I've made two alternate examples for the datetime type (attached, I hope). 
Let me know if they're ok, and I might see if I can make some more.

How should the receiver decode the character set in these cases? If a BOM is 
used, I could see that that would work, though you don't mention that 
(should you?). Is this just a case that the receiver should have some idea 
what it's being sent?

Those concerns are with the x-www-form-urlencoded algorithm, not this one, 
right?

Oh, that's interesting: I hadn't realised that. 

Perhaps a note to that effect would be useful?
