Ian, 

darn. missed one: 

# 5.4. application/x-www-form+xml: XML submission
# The message entity is an XML 1.1 document, encoded as UTF-8, [...] 

I think that requiring the character encoding to be UTF-8 conflicts with the 
sentiment expressed by the TAG in
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-i18n-comments/2002Jun/0000.html 

(excerpted)
"We believe that specifications SHOULD NOT add rules for character encoding 
beyond what is provided in XML. They MUST NOT restrict character sets beyond 
what XML allows. In other words, the TAG disagrees [that] a specification 
should mandate a unique encoding. We believe a specification must not 
mandate a single encoding to the exclusion of UTF8/16." 

Regards,
Malcolm
