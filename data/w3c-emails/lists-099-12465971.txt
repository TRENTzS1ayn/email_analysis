"Benjamin Nowack" <bnowack@appmosphere.com>>- what about subclassing Polygon
and Ellipse, so that

This isn't possible since the coords property changes its semantics
depending on the rdf:Type of the class, if we subClass like the above, we
end up in the situation that with

<some img:Rectangle>  img:coords "20,20 40,40"

then doing the sub/superclassing

<some img:Polygon> img:Coords "20,20 40,40"

Which is not equivalent!
