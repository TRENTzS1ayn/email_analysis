Yep, thanks for the pointer, I've fixed it.

I agree on it being easier to parse, but you're right about the reasons. It 
was an conscious decision, to support a syntax that covered both of SVG 
(which doesn't care) and HTML image maps.

I see that Masahide has also commented on this, but I'll be happy to write a 
simple named XSLT template that handles the conversion. :)

Seriously, yes, this way is somewhat harder to parse, but only by a fraction, 
and it has the clear advantage of being able to be directly fed to both of 
SVG and image maps, the two (so far) main identified "platforms".
