Me and Morten just discussed this (ending at)
http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/discovery/chatlogs/rdfig/2004-01-21#T22-00-31

and I think as there's really no tools we can imagine that are so stupid
they can't do the conversion from space to comma for image maps - we might
aswell have space.

So unless any objections are voiced we're now proposing a space seperated
list of points which are integer pairs.

A circle would be "X,Y R"
A rect would be "X1,Y1 X2,Y2"
and a Polygon would be "X1,Y1 Xn,Yn ... "

On another topic, I'd also like an SVGPath Class which has a path attribute,
this is not limited to Integers and allows the full functionality of the SVG
Path, for this I would encourage a rectangular bounding box to be included,
but also potentially a PolygonBounding box which we may also want to define.

Thoughts on that?

Cheers,

Jim.
