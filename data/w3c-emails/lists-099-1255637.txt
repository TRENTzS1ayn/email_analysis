Yeah, they're ugly too. :-)

It could. I think that would confuse the example a bit though so I'll
leave it as is for now.

Interesting idea. I'll look into it.

I did consider this, but as this is intended to work in an XHTML context,
I think it would look a bit odd.

It uses the XHTML namespace. I do not want to require that authors declare
two namespaces just to write Web pages.

1.1 support should be available by the time this spec becomes widely used.
(It is trivial to upgrade a 1.0 parser to 1.1.) The point is to limit the
possible outputs as much as possible so that the job of parsing the result
is very easy.

What about it? A new version of this spec could be released to address
this, if needed.


Thanks for your feedback!
