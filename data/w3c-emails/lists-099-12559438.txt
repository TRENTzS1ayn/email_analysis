Yep, and an ellipse would be "X,Y Rx,Ry".

I changed my mind, convinced by Jim (it's happened before, and it will 
again...), who pointed out that there doesn't seem to be a lot of need for 
image maps anyway, and whitespace separation is more in line with XML specs 
in general.

Sounds good to me, but I hope we can find a better name for the class 
(wordnet seems to suggest "Shape" or "Figure", but since it'd be a subclass 
of region I'm not sure what the best option would be)?

Good idea, boundingPolygon perhaps?
