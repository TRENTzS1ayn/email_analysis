Ouch, it was a typo ;-) I agree with you for the need of a 'page' though.

Yes, good idea.

Fragment id's for region seems tricky, because there are almost infinite
combinations of coordinates in an image. I think it's reasonable to have
rdf:ID's in annotation's region constructs. I mean, not:

 <Region rdf:about="image-uri#fragID">

but:

 <Region rdf:ID="idInAnnotation">

is much more manageable. People can mention to the region via this
annotation like:

 <rdf:Description rdf:about="annotationUri#idInAnnotation>
  <dc:description>more comments ...</dc:comments>
  ...

This will ensure people talking about the same topic (annotation).

You mean a third party can add boudingBox to the annotation without it ?
Maybe that's an idea. And I think idInAnnotation can help this. Make sense ?

cheers,

(I think I got around mail address, and hope this message will be archived)
