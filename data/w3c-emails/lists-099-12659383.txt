Sure ... CC may be compulsory for www2004, but just recommended for common
use ?

Do you think to use 'creationEvent' for location ? I hope this also will be
determined in this discussion (not this week).

Property for annotator (an:author) is taken from Annotea schema, and it is
defined just as subPropertyOf dc:creator, no range is specified. So,
foaf:People can be allowed as the object of an:author, but may have the
same confusion as dc:creator.

Also, I've noticed this property is rarely used in annotation, even in
Amaya output. I'm not sure how we should treat this one.

Yes, possibly

 <an:author>
  <foaf:Person>
   <foaf:mbox_sha1sum>e8198...</foaf:mbox_sha1sum>
   ...
  </foaf:Person>
 </an:author>

although annotators may not want to give their mail addresses. It'll become
too complicated if mbox be optional to input annotation ?

Hmm... the latter is simpler, and easier to implement.

If we follow Annotea syntax, I think the latter will become something:

<an:Annotation>
 <an:annotates rdf:resource="imageuri"/>
 <an:body rdf:resource=""/>
 ...
</an:Annotation>

In this sense, the former style will be:

<an:Annotation rdf:ID="annot1">
 <an:annotates rdf:resource="imageuri"/>
 <an:body rdf:resource="#annot1"/>
 ...
</an:Annotation>

But is this too tricky ... ?

cheers,
