I don't know if these are representative, but I've annotated some -
they're linked from:

http://swordfish.rdfweb.org/discovery/2001/08/codepict/

or all events

http://swordfish.rdfweb.org/discovery/2001/08/codepict/aboutevent.jsp

or events by homepage

http://swordfish.rdfweb.org/discovery/2001/08/codepict/aboutevent.jsp?uri=http://www94.web.cern.ch/WWW94/
http://swordfish.rdfweb.org/discovery/2001/08/codepict/aboutevent.jsp?uri=http://www2002.org/
http://swordfish.rdfweb.org/discovery/2001/08/codepict/aboutevent.jsp?uri=http://www2003.org/

If you click on the images you can see some data about them.

There are lots and lots out there - see for example
