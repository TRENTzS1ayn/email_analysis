hi Greg - I'm going offline for the rest of the evening now - but I've
written a 'validator' for the allowable versions of image descriptions
outlined in

http://esw.w3.org/topic/W3PhotoVocabs

It's pretty low-tech (I think owl tools could do at least some of what
it does), but should be easy to tweak when/if we alter the vocabs, and
might be helpful at this stage to ensure various tools are generating
useful data for this particular project.

cheers,

Libby
