Ah... this is an IRI-related bug.
Looking at the cwm code, it seem to be all over the
map re IRIs:

wierd... from sax2rdf.py: uri = (ns + ln).encode('utf-8')

the question is what sink.newSymbol() takes...
bummer; RDFSink.py doesn't say what newSymbol() takes.

________________________________________________________________________
hmm... notation3.py takes the output from uripath.join()
and gives it to newSymbol... maybe that's a clue...

no, uripath is silent on IRIs.

Tim? Did you say N3 is I18N-happy? In working that
out, did you decide whether newSymbol() takes IRIs
or URIs?
