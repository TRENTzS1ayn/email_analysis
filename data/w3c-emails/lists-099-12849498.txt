As far as I understand the CC instructions at [1], it is the date of birth
of the agent who "owns" the metadata. IMHO we could omit dc:date for
Agent. in CC's third example code they don't mention a dc:date (probably
because they are talking about an organization).
Furthermore cc:Agent seems to be equivalent to foaf:Agent, so we could 
perhaps state "foaf:Agent owl:equivalentClass/rdfs:subClassOf cc:Agent".
then we could add a foaf:mbox_sha1sum to cc:Agent to better identify the
metadata "owner". (don't know if people are going to enter a valid date 
of birth..)

another question:
is there a difference between the author of the metadata and the agent in
dc:rights of the metadata?
if they are (always) the same we could use a nodeID for more compact 
metadata, e.g.:

<rdf:Description rdf:about=''> 
  <an:annotates rdf:resource='...jpg'/> 
  <an:author> 
    <foaf:Person rdf:nodeID="p1">
      <foaf:name>...</foaf:name>
      <foaf:mbox_sha1sum>...</foaf:mbox_sha1sum> 
    </foaf:Person> 
  </an:author> 
  <an:created>2004-01-25T20:04:50Z</an:created> 
  <cc:license rdf:resource="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/..." /> 
  <dc:rights rdf:nodeID="p1"/>
</rdf:Description> 

but I don't know if this eases or complicates code generation and
reasoning.. I'll shut up now.
