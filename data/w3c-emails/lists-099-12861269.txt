I agree with Benjamin here: it is the date of birth; I think we can (and
should, for privacy reasons) omit it; and I think it is important to
have an identifying property for the Agent, like
mbox_sha1sum/homepage/weblog/page.

Are there any objections to this? If not, I'll make the changes to the
examples, the wiki and the validator.

I *think* they will always be the same. That shortens things a bit,
which is nice (this technique could also be applied to the license for
the image and the dc creator of the image).

The only difference is that the dc:title of the Agent isn't there any
more. It was a little odd to use dc:title there in the first place, but
if there's a lot of data out there that uses that formulation, that
might be a case for continuing to use it.

Any opinions?

I don't think so - unless tools are looking out for that dc:title...
