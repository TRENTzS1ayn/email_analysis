Suppose you have a large document relevant to the Web that you wish to give
multiple colleagues access to.  All the people you *know* you want to get it
to are on some mailing list.  But not everyone on the list would want to
read it, and some on the list have slow network connections.  If there is no
reason an arbitrary member of the public *shouldn't* have access to this
document, www-archive may meet your needs.

If you address an email message to <www-archive@w3.org> that message will be
archived on the Web. where the general public has access to it.  Despite the
fact that you sent it as an email or email attachment, to an address that looks
like a mailing list address, it will not be distributed to anyone by email
or any other push protocol.

This way people with slow connections are not burdened with a big mailgram,
people with fast connections can casually look at what you are providing
and people with slow connections can apply a grain of salt before accessing.

You need to authorize archiving.  At the time of this writing, www-archive
is one of the mailboxes where this is being applied.  Watch your inbound
mail for a message

  From: W3C List Manager <aa-sender@w3.org>
  Subject: IMPORTANT: your message to www-archive

This message, if it is genuine, will offer you the URI for a short form
by which you affirm your permission to have W3C archive and publicly
redistribute your message.  Do check that the URI you have been offered
is in the form

  http://www.w3.org/Mail/review?id=...

where what follows the "id=" is a UUID-like long alphanumeric string.

If you have earlier filed a blanket authorization, you won't be bothered
for each post.
