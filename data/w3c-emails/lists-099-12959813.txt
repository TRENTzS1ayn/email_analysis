I think I fixed this bug by reversing a decision
that various methods only take python strings;
they now take ustrings.

But the ustrings need to be xxlified before getting
passed to urllib.urlopen(). Hmm... should store.load()
take a ustring or an xxlified URI? probably a ustring.

So I'm not closing this bug until that's cleared up,
or until a new bug about those problems is added.
