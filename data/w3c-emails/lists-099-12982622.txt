Hi,

I was going through teh tutorial and got a 404 on the URI
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/doc/Examples.html which was linked from the
page http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/doc/Built-in

I think the reference on that page should be to ../Examples.html which does
exist and is a bunch of examples.

There's also a bit of a hassle reporting bugs, since the main page says to
email Tim, Dan, or Sandro and then assumes you know who they are, instead of
giving a link. (This may of course be a deliberate test of people's desire
for a fix?)

cheers

Chaals
