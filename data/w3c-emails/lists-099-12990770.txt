Apologies to all for being so quiet. I'm actually using Fotonotes at 1 
day conference today (http://www.trendagenda.org ) and have been 
cleaning up the Fotonotes code (and buying a new digital camera).

So I'll have a good test run of some issues and will report back.

Libby also helped me earlier this week review the vocabs in greater 
detail. Haven't had a chance to assemble thoughts.

I think we are still looking good for Feb 5 launching of the repository 
(give or take a day or two...)

We do have a chat coming up on Feb 1, which I think we should keep.

More Saturday, Sunday...

Greg
