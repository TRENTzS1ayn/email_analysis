www-archive is the public archival system at the W3C:

   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/

...and htmlforms@damowmow.com is an alias for ian@hixie.ch.

Good idea.

Would you rather require that every form author write a parser instead?

Currently, forms generally try to validate e-mail addresses and frequently
do so in a naive way, leading to many people not being able to use those
forms with their e-mail addresses. (For example, people with periods in
their username.)

By requiring that the UA do this instead of the author, we reduce the
number of implementations that need to be debugged by maybe six orders of
magnitude.
