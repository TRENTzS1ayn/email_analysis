Nope, the idea of having a type="email" attribute for input elements 
is a good one. What I don't like is that the value of this element is
defined to be a RFC 2822 "mailbox"

The following is a valid RFC 2822 "mailbox":
-----[Start RFC 2822 mailbox]-----
Bob
(You wouldn't think\)
 Smith "at home)"Johannessen"
<bob
 @
(amazing)db.
 (isn't it)org>
-----[End RFC 2822 mailbox]-----

If you're looking for a field to only accept the address, without the
display name (bob@db.org, not "Bob Johannessen" <bob@db.org>), I'd
suggest you specify RFC 2822 "addr-spec" *without* FWS and CFWS. If 
you want to include the display name in the field, use RFC 2822 mailbox
*without* FWS and CFWS.

I'd prefer the former (limited/modified RFC 2822 addr-spec), as I see 
no reason why the display name can't be expressed in another input
element.
