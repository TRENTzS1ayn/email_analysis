The translations process is pretty well established. But as you know, 
there's more than the IPR FAQ that applies. Document use is also 
relevant. I don't believe there are any contrary informations in 
Document license. Frankly, it's usually a good idea to read more than a 
FAQ - especially when the relevant license is linked right in the lead 
of the answer to the question.

It's going to be much clearer soon.

I agree that clarity is needed.

I'll put that on the list of clarifications needed as well.

I think that is a difference in reading. When I read documents such as 
these, I _never_ assume that permission is automatically granted. 
Perhaps it is because I have had to focus in this area more intensively 
than the average person, but there it is. Your feedback on how you might 
interpret this loose language is very helpful.

Ok. I'm not responsible for the w3c-translators list, but I will get 
those who own it to be more responsive.

Not all members of the staff are authorized to do so.

Sure! Thank you.
