You'd be surprised how easy it is to get people to do stuff like copy
filenames into file upload fields. The less rope we give them the better.

Good good.

There are good theoretical reasons to be against scripting. :-)

No need for the expense of multiple attributes, the attribute is already a
multitoken field.

Obviously? Why would anyone care? (Then again, I've often wondered that
about some of our current Page Info features.)

Repeated blocks aren't associated with forms necessarily. You can repeat
anything you like.

Yes, you can. Well, more to the point, the form attribute means that forms
can be intertwined.
