The best time for catching up seems to be Thu Mar 4, freenode.net, on 
the #foaf channel.

Let's split the chat up into two parts: Image vocab related (starting 
at 15:00) and Event Vocab related (starting at 16:00). That gives us 
the following agenda:

15:00 - 15:40 GMT: Image Vocab Update
15:40 - 16:00 GMT: W3photo.org website update
16:00 - 16:40 GMT: Event Vocab Update
16:40 - 17:00 GMT: Misc., Wrap-up, etc.

Please try to make it to the relevant discussion. More notes and 
pointers coming during the next few days.

Thanks!

Greg
