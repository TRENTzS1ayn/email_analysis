I've culled the identified bugs and issues regarding the alpha version  
of the repository from the 2/26 IRC chat and added them to the bug page.

The most challenging unresolved issue is creating an easy web interface  
for correctly and uniquely identify people (e.g., making sure "Tim"  
"TBL", "Tim Berners-Lee" all point to or create the same unique  
identifier.
