I would say doing anything but using popups would be essential, with popups
being near universally derided, and having significant accessibility and
usability problems (they work fine if you close the window each time
perhaps, but if you don't and it's lost they're useless.)

We've seen great DHTML from you Greg, so I know you can do it, why not just
have "in page popups" where the images are placed in the page via DHTML
where supported (degrading to simple navigation, or similar if not.)

Sure that's a good thing, except of course there are plenty of solutions
which do use popups and achieve the same.

Of course they do!  IE6 in XP service pack 2 coming out soon is rumoured to
contain a blocker, there's no point implementing something that people will
hate!  -  We also wouldn't recommend a user preference approach (on page
mechanism defaulting to off perhaps...) as chasing into the cookies and p3p
privacy policies necessary to do this with our mixed content pages (I'm
assuming images may still be hosted elsewhere, or at least the service
support such.)  Even without cookies are best avoided unnecessarily.

Or people never seeing it, I detest such a feature, (although I've not seen
it here, the Crewe-London train not currently having any wireless.) and
can't see how a popup changes someones interaction with an image.
