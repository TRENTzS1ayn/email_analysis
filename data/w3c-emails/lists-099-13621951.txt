Ooops.  yes, the program was hosed.

This is hopefully fixed in 0.7.1 release
    Repository revision: 1.9     /w3ccvs/WWW/2000/10/swap/cant.py,v

There is no regression test for it, so support is not at the
regression-tested level. There is a test space in swap/test/cant
which has your example and some others.

I guess the regression test machine could be used for other programs
apart from cwm.

I have also started accumulating graphs with interesting differences
or otherwise in  swap/test/delta/*/{from,to,diff}.n3
in discussion with Sandro, for diffs.
