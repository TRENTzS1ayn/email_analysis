Global attributes are expensive. Don't forget that these attributes can
apply to _every_ single element. Keeping all the repeat stuff in one
attribute makes it easier to manage.

The DOM interfaces provide DOM attributes to make this unnecessary, at
least on the client side.

Because it is needed by people using forms. It is very related to forms as
far as authors go, it is only independent as far as implementations go.

The DOM interfaces already enable authors to implement this pretty easily,
but I don't know how you would do this declaratively. Any ideas?

Why? I don't see how this is ever a problem (other than it probably being
terrible UI).

Take a look at the interfaces again, specifically:

...which I just added.
