Quick update:

- Popups have been removed from http://w3photo.org/photos
- Have improved RDF
- Added a date created field for photos (click Edit button)
- According to Jim Ley, boundingBox should be:
upperX,UpperY,width,height (avoids need to calculate which coord is
upper left)

If you have a moment to upload a few photos for particular conference
years, please do.
