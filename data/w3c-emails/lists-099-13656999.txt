Sorry, Pat. I don't follow you.

If there is a graph X and a graph Y, and there is a triple in graph Y
that says that graph X is asserted, yet we find no triple saying that
graph Y is asserted, then is graph X actually asserted? If the triple
asserting graph X is not asserted, then how can graph X be asserted?

That said, I'm starting to appreciate some of Chris' arguments about
all statements being asserted, no matter what.

I still have some questions about how to "bootstrap" trust, such that
it seems there must be some requirement for each graph to contain
statements reflecting its source/authority (a signature perhaps?)
otherwise, how do you anchor your trust in terms of a given graph?
