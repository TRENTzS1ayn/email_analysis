There was a missing dependency, so this wasn't picked up automatically 
during build.
Should be now.

I'm looking for help on these new closure
flags.
   http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/doc/CwmHelp
   $Id: CwmHelp.html,v 1.4 2003/04/11 23:23:35 sandro Exp $

is no help.

As I recall, it's machine-generated, but I don't
remember how. Can you add a "how to update this
page" link or something? Maybe make it part
of make release or whatever?
