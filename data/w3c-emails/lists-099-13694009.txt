He should use appropriate vocabulary.
If he wants to express a quotation, he should use Pat's literal workaround.

If the graph is identified using a URI, the third party can claim that it
believes the graph or not.
If the graph is identified with a bnode, the third party has some problems.

Using subjective trust policies which take the above into account.
