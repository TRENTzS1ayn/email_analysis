That seems inconsistent with general Web architectural ideas, though. 
I publish some RDF, but what it means isnt determined until you read 
it and apply your trust function? Shouldn't I have some say in the 
matter? I'm the one doing the publishing. You are free to ignore me, 
of course, but what I assert is surely up to me to decide.

Well, the trouble is that most folk think that they are being 
asserted, at present. So we have to preserve this understanding of 
current normal usage.

Is this an architectural requirement, or just sound practical advice?

Again., this sounds like a private matter for people to decide, not a 
Web matter requiring protocols.

Is this required? What happens if a graph has no provenance attached?

Is there any requirement that provenance information provide a route 
back to the source, or identify a Web resource as the source? Or 
could something like a simple timestamping count as a provenance? In 
general, what is the intended purpose of provenance information?

Is it information, or better considered meta-information? Can the 
provenance info be accessed separately from the graph itself?

Policy reasoning can get very complicated, particularly as policies 
can be defined by OWL ontologies themselves. How deep do we want to 
get into this stuff?

I'll take a look.
