No. I was not presuming that publishing a graph equates to asserting 
it. Publishing
a graph is simply that, making it publically available. How it is 
intended to be used
or what its overall purpose is, is another matter entirely.

This came up in the long debates about social meaning. TimBL wanted 
what you are
suggesting, that if someone publishes a graph, they are accountable for 
the
statements made therein, as automatically asserted.

The problem with that, is (a) is publishing an RDF/XML instance the 
same as
publishing a graph? (b) how can one publish a graph as an example, such 
that
its purpose has nothing to do with the substance of any statements 
within it,
yet use of the graph as an example requires manipulation of triples (not
other forms of quotation, reification, etc.).

The ability to explicitly mark a graph as asserted is, I think, a 
needed mechanism.

Publication of a graph, or an RDF/XML instance, should not equate to 
assertion.

Right. Hence my recent proposal of a special vocabulary having 
intra-graph
bound semantics, which can be used to qualify graphs.

Right. One way or another, you've got to bootstrap your architecture. 
But
ideally, that bootstrapping machinery should be as lightweight as 
possible,
pushing as much as possible into the scope of the RDF MT.

It also should be as decentralized as possible.
