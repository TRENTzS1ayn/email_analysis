True. It's probably most practical to allow folks to presume that unless
explicitly stated that a graph is or isn't asserted, that it is 
asserted.

My recent proposal for a bootstrapping intra-graph vocabulary reflects 
the opposite
presumption, that unless explicitly marked as asserted, it's not, but 
that's
easily fixed.
