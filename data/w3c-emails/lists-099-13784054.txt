or simply

:someGraph { ... }

and presume that unless otherwise stated, it's asserted.

Note that 'x:true' and 'x:false' apply to whether the graph is or is not
asserted, not whether the statements in the graph are or are not true.

Can decide, based on the authoritative qualifications of the graph,
whether to take the statements in the graph into account.

Well, that's a more general problem, and one not directly IMO bound to
the issue of assertion or trust.

Well, so much for beginning to become convinced...

I can't accept this last, er, assertion ;-)

Whether something is or is not true, is quite different from whether 
something
is or is not asserted as true by someone.

We may choose to disbelieve what is asserted, but it still remains 
asserted.

???

Rather, we have a case where a statement is 
accepted/trusted/believed/relevant
for an information provider but not accepted/trusted/believed/relevant 
by
a consumer -- but assertion is something else.

Assertion IMO affects whether the statements are reasoned about at all. 
I.e.
are they in the domain of discourse or at some other level.

Right. So the information provider qualfies the graph (statements) in 
some
manner to indicate a possible degree of inaccuracy or precision. But 
again,
that is something other than assertion.

Right. And the consumer uses "authoritative" qualifications, based on
the bootstrapping machinery, to select which graphs (statements) are
to be considered 'trusted' (or for that matter, relevant to whatever
application -- one could similarly use such qualifications to provide
a generalized scoping mechanism by which 'trust' is merely one kind
of scope).

I think we miss out on alot of functionality by being forced to use
literals and/or reification for de dicto. E.g. one might want to
reason along the lines of "what if" someone actually asserted a
set of statements -- and to do that optimally, one must have triples.

By being aware of which graphs are or are not asserted, one can move
in and out of such hypothetical "what if" scenarios without losing
track of the "real" semantic web (that ever changing virtual
mother-of-all-graphs corresponding to the sum total of all asserted
statements accessible on the web).

Absolutely, but digital signatures and PKIs are merely forms of
graph qualification. Having a bootstraping vocabulary/semantics
to hook such machinery onto then allows for folks to have a clear
and explicit basis for determining that someone (a) explicitly
asserted some statement and (b) who that someone is -- which are
the key elements for accountability.
