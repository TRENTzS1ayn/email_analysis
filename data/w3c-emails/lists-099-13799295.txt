Note, though, that when it comes to social meaning, accountability,
etc. that even though SW agents may, by default, for legacy reasons
presume that unless told otherwise a graph is asserted, best
practices and legislation may both mandiate the presence of an
explicit statement of assertion for a graph, particularly if
contracts, agreements, or other legal contexts apply to the statements.

(more fun, and er, money for the lawyers...)
