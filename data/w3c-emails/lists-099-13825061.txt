Here's where I think we need to make an important distinction between
"authoritative" qualification of a graph and third-party qualification
of a graph.

It may be the case that an agent trusts certain third parties, and even
may choose to trust statements made about a graph by a third party over
statements made about the graph in the graph itself (e.g. the owner
of the graph specifies a higher accuracy percentage than the 
more-trusted
third party, or the owner of the graph doesn't explicitly state that the
graph is asserted but the third party does, etc.).

Note that the ability to consider third party statements about a graph
still doesn't preclude the need for a bootstrapping mechanism, since,
after all, one has to determine the trust associated with the graph
containing those third party statements as well...

We at least seem to agree on this particular point.

your right to first reply...)
