My proposal: a specialized vocabulary/semantics for qualifying graphs
in an authoritative manner by the creator/owner of the graph (probably
has to include manditory graph signing or the like).

By saying they trust the owner/source/authority of the graph.

Based on the authoritative qualifications of the graph, and auxiliary
information/policies founded on that boostrapping layer.

Is it really such a problem that the machinery allows one to state
paradoxes -- since one could have mechanisms to filter out or reject
graphs with such paradoxes?

(I'm well over my head here... but ask the question nonetheless ;-)

I agree. I find that most of what Chris says about trust mechanisms
and policies feels intuitively right, but that the machinery by which
such mechanisms and policies are grounded is not quite right.

The blurring of the distinction between asserted and trusted is hard
for me to overlook.

Cheers,
