Some published RDF/XML docs are asserted, some are not (e.g. WG test cases).
We dropped the sections of RDF Concepts that presumed that
publishing=asserting, partly because there was no consensus.

English works both to carry content and speech acts, I think the suggestion
is that RDF can carry its own speech act status, and the bootstrapping is in
the user perceptions (the trust layer).

I was initially taking this point of view, but it is just more data, and
apart from the bootstrapping problem, putting it all in RDF does seem more
minimalist.

Things can be bootstrapped from English ...

The fact that the WG Tests are not asserted is found in the Test Cases
Recommendations (not that they say so explicitly).
