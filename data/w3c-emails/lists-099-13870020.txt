I would prefer that we don't get into talking about belief. There 
will  be SW content published by software gents which probably can't 
even be said to have beliefs. Lets stick to speech acts: then the 
cases are

(a) publishes information and asserts that it is true
(b) publishes information without asserting that it is true, or with 
a qualified assertion
(c) like a, but this agent has nefarous purposes
(d) publishes text without asserting anything (except maybe that the 
text is what it is and other meta-infomation about it, which is 
handled like (a) )

I don't think we need to distinguish a from c, even if we were able 
to do so. Its not the SW's job to enforce honesty. So this just 
leaves a kind of spectrum of publication modes ranging from 
'asserted' to 'quoted' with maybe some 'qualifed assertion' types in 
between these (though Ive never seen any application area asking for 
these in-between cases, and kind of doubt they will be much practical 
use.)

I think we are talking at cross purposes. I agree that its up to the 
consumer to decide what to believe and what use to make of any 
information. But thats a different issue: I am talking about what the 
provider is doing. If A publishes some content and B reads it and 
makes use of it, can B come back to A and complain if it turns out to 
be false or misleading? If A has asserted it, then yes: if not, then 
no. B needs to know not just the content of C, but what A's stance 
was with respect to that content: was A asserting it, or merely 
reporting it, or intending to use it as the antecedent of a 
conditional, or even denying it or expressing doubt about it? None of 
this is visible in the normal semantics, which just give 
truth-conditions.

That does not make sense. Asserting is a relationship between an 
agent and some content. Nobody expects a consumer to be doing any 
asserting (unless they are also a provider). Its like the distinction 
between putting up a notice and reading a notice. Asserting isn't 
done by the one who reads the notice, it is what gets the notice put 
there in the first place. The consumer is irrelevant: one can assert 
something even if there was nobody else on the planet to hear you 
assert it. I think you mean something like 'accepted by the 
consumer'. Sure, A might assert something and B may read it but not 
accept it. Happens all the time, not an issue. I don't think we need 
to even say anything special about it. Obviously a reader is not 
obliged to accept anything. Caveat lector.

that would be nice, but there are so many things one COULD do, that I 
would prefer to wait until it is clearer from actual use cases what 
it is that people feel that they want to do. The world needs to 
experiment some with this issue: we can't mandate how to handle it.

But that is up to the consumer. I agree this will be important and I 
think it will become very complicated and in fact will become an 
entire economy, with lots of money to be made by people who can 
provide guarantees of trustworthiness of various kinds. Not our 
problem here, and far too big for us to tackle in any case.

I agree this would be very handy, and this case has already come up 
in practice many times. We need to be able to quote properly (ie not 
using reification). See my reply to Patrick for a simple suggestion.

I agree that the required technology gets into those issues, but I 
think we can reason about trust and responsibility and publication on 
a general level.
