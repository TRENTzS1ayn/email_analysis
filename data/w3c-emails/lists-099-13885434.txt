Interesting thought. Let me modify my earlier suggestion, or maybe 
extend it. Asserting is publishing with a publishMode="assert" tag 
(if tag omitted, publication is assumed as a SW default, but legal 
tightness might require it).  Alternatively, one can give a URI which 
points to another document which acts as a 'publication warrant'; 
this might for example record provenance information, give security 
key information, things like that. And it can be stored on a secure 
server somewhere, safe from harm, and providing a checksum to use as 
security against malicious changes to the warranted graph. The 
publication warrant should itself have a publishMode="assert" tag on 
it, and can refer to the original graph by name, and can assert in 
RDF that it is warrant for the named graph. This would be very hard 
to fake, and can easily be made exponentially harder by adding more 
warrant layers referring to even more secure sources of 
warrantability. The very fact that the warrant URI is in a secure 
namespace uses the Web to provide a high degree of security.

Notice also that this entire thing can  be set up without any 
publication actually happening until the publishMode property on the 
warrant is set, and changing this value can 'turn off' the 
publication; so this provides a kind of trusted-third-party control 
over assertion: if you hold my warrant, then you can un-assert my 
publications.  Of course I can just not refer to your warrant, but 
then who is going to trust me?

S'OK, I see this as a free-for-all in any case. One of the joys of 
email is that you can interrupt without actually interrupting, if you 
see what I mean.
