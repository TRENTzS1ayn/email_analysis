You can't bootstrap assertion/trust/etc. by putting stuff in graphs. 
These are all ABOUT graphs, so for example if you don't trust graphs, 
then having them say 'trust me!!' isn't going to make you trust them 
more.

Well, paradoxes are kind of nasty to try to filter out and they play 
havoc with any attempt to formalize. But this isnt paradoxical, so I 
don't think we need to worry.

I agree, this is important to get right. Not the same ideas.
