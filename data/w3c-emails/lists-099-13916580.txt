I know, but that section had a lot more controversial stuff in it 
than just this. Since there are no deployed ways of distinguishing 
asserted from non-asserted publications, it seems unlikely that the 
planet will now decide that all the published OWL and RDF and RDFS is 
all just kind of lying there until someone finds a way to get it 
asserted.

But there is a clear distinction; and in fact, English speech acts 
are conveyed more by things like intonation and contextual clues than 
in the language itself. You usually just assert or just promise: you 
only say you are asserting or promising in order to emphasize, or for 
rhetorical or ceremonial reasons. Same in all NatLangs.

But the problem is that one is not enough. Well, actually, I think 
that one is enough but only if its the publish=assert case. Otherwise 
you can't get any asserting bootstrapped off the ground.

Also, allowing speech act status to follow by reasoning is likely to 
produce unpredictable things happening in OWL, maybe even in RDF. 
Like, whether or not it gets asserted depends on how clever your 
reasoner is. So I think having explicit tags somewhere on the edge of 
the RDF is likely to be simpler than trying to do it in RDF.

RDF is a pretty weak foundation already, and we have overloaded it 
just by putting OWL on it. It can't take any more :-)

But I really don't think it makes sense. And what is more minimal 
than a single XML tag?

>Things can be bootstrapped from English ...

But this is a cop-out. We expect software agents to be using this 
stuff, right? If we could bootstrap from English, who needs RDF in 
the first place?

I propose that the way this will actually get done is that their 
objective publication status is vague and underdefined, but since 
they have no warrant, no serious agent is going to take them on trust 
as asserted, which is all that will matter.
