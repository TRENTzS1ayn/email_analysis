Mindful of time pressure ...

I suggest the following approach for our paper ...

1) introduce a property
    rdfx:assertedBy

whose domain is graphs and range is agents union documents.

2) include examples in which a PKI signature of such a statement is 
included in which the asserting agent signs the statement of assertion

3) include text that describes the bootstrapping problem and note that the 
example provides one mechanism for bootstrapping trust, but noting that the 
HTML web largely works, providing adequately trusted information, without 
widespread use of such mechanisms

We might also want an rdfx:notAssertedBy property for explicitly stating 
that a graph is fictional, in the eyes of its author (or anyone else).

4) We could include text that suggests that documents published in RDF/XML 
should be regarded by default as being asserted by their authors, and point 
to the social meaning discussion to show that this was never adequately 
resolved.

To me, at least, that provides enough mechanisms for the publishing of 
assertional intent, at least for most actual usage.

I think Chris is correct to indicate that the reading agent's trust is a 
separate problem that may be increased by the use of signatures but not 
increased to 100%.

I think we should address this by postulating a trust layer, which takes as 
input a set of named graphs and provides as output a single graph, being 
the merge of some of the input graphs, (those which the trust layer chose 
to trust). Chris provides some potential trust metrics, and we include the 
PKI signature as one of the factors which may be considered.
