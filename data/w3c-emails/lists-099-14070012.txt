Taking Pat's "asserting is a speech act", I tried to link the existing
terminology "Statement/Stating" used inconsistently today to your
x:GraphQualificationProperty. I think the term RDF Stating is used mostly,
when speaking about agents claiming stuff in an distributed, "social"
environment. The term RDF Statement more in situations where RDF is just
used as datamodel / knowledge model without taking agents and speech acts
into account. Thinking more about it and seeing that we just discuss the
agent scenario, the idea of somehow linking it with the
x:GraphQualificationProperty doesn't appear that convincing any more ;-(



Thanks for the comment,
