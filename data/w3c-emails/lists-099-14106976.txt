Also hmmm ... and I think we should forward this question to Pat.

1. If "assertion = speech act", the assertion *has* to take place in a
"context" for example a point in time.
Thus it is tempting to conclude that a graph is asserted, if it (1)
describes itself or (2) is described somewhere else with the properties
dc:author and dc:date.

2. Publishing an unasserted graph on the Web wouldn't be a speech act. What
would it be??

Correct me where I'm wrong.
