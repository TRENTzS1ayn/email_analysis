(cc'ing www-archive)

I'll start by saying that I really like the enhancements added to Web
Forms 2.0.  I have a couple of questions about the spec:

In what form is the data from the editable select drop-down made
available to the server?  I didn't find that the document made this
clear.

Does the user use the comma to separate each of the items?  What if one
of the items contains a comma?  Should the author be allow to specify
the separator?
