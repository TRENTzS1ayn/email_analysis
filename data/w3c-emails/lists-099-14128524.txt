It seems to me that no such approach can possibly fly.

The task is how to get graphs asserted. Asserted means that you are 
supposed to accept the truth of the statements in it, if you believe 
the asserter. If a graph is not asserted, in particular, you are not 
supposed to take it being true or making any claims: its just a graph 
for you to contemplate. It doesnt even have statements in it, just 
formulae: they only get to be statements when they are asserted. An 
unasserted graph is just wallpaper. So now, if asserting a graph is 
done by making a statement in a graph, how do ANY graphs EVER get 
asserted? Triples with that property in them can occur in a graph out 
the wazoo, but unless the graphs containing those triples get 
asserted, there's no reason to think that they are saying anything 
about anything: they are just there for you to contemplate. So they 
don't cause any asserting to be done.  There HAS to be something 
OUTSIDE the graph which indicates that the graph is being asserted, 
before there is any reason the accept the truth of any graph at all.

Having the graph refer to itself is no help: it you arent inclined to 
take it as being asserted, what it says about itself has no influence 
on you. If you are so inclined, then having it say its asserted is 
redundant.

I'm not talking about bootstrapping trust, but bootstrapping 
assertions. If publication is not assertion then right now, NOTHING 
is asserted in any RDF anywhere. How do we get this whole RDF Web off 
the ground?

??? But if we do that, what is the new property FOR? What 
functionality does it add?

Agreed.

Why do we need to address it? Seems like too large an issue for one 
short paper. Lets be casual whatever we do.
