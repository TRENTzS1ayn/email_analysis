Yes, I think so. It would require the entire MT to be rewritten, to 
do it rigorously. It basically introduces indexicals into the 
language.  And it has all kinds of odd operational consequences for 
inference engines; for example, in OWL, how would you know whether or 
not two graphs references were referring to the same graph?

Maybe Im not familiar enough with XML, but would adding a property to 
an element amount to a substantial change to RDF/XML? Seems kind of 
piffling to me. I assumed one could always add properties without 
breaking anything.

Well, good point, although the QLs are kind of irrelevant since one 
wouldnt expect to be asserting a query.
