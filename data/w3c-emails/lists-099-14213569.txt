Hi Benjamin, thanks for updates.

>the value

I don't think this is the consensus. Though there was no clear conclusion,
I think it's better be {x1,y1 x2,y2} as Rectangle (see bellow). [1]

>A region of type Rectangle uses two pairs of comma-separated integers. the
>pairs are separated by a space. "0,0 50,100" could for example describe a
>rectangle that starts in the upper left corner of an image, has a width of 50

>corner, the second one the lower right).

I think this explanation is confusing re: whether the second pair "50,100"
means lower right coordinate, or with/height pair. I want it stay the same
as we discussed so far, as well as the existing Jim's vocab (where 50,100
is the coordinate of lower bottom corner, rather than width/height pair).

Maybe example such as "10,20 50,100" is less confusing, and write clearly
the latter pair is lower right coord, putting width/height notion into
parenthesis ?
