If they owned G, and the statement about asserting G was in G, then 
they'd just change or remove G.

Because we only trust authoritative and authenticated statements about 
assertion.

If A is not the authority asserting P, per the statements in P, then we 
have cause
to conclude that A does not (necessarily) assert P.

This seems like a separate issue. It may very well be that for a given 
purpose
G is deprecated, and in that application area, we may trust B about 
such things,
but that doesn't affect whether G is asserted or authentic or who the 
authority
asserting G is.

I'd like to preserve a distinction between 'publisher/owner' and 
'agent'. It can
be that an agent can be a publisher of a graph, but I think there is a 
difference
between the 'publisher/owner' stating that a graph is asserted and some 
other
'agent' stating that the graph is asserted.

I actually do not think that it should be possible for anyone but the 
owner
to assert a graph (even though agents may make whatever statements they
like about the graph otherwise).

If we replace 'agent' with 'publisher' or 'authority', then I'm OK so 
far.

I don't, though, think that any agent other than the publisher/authority
can affect the assertiveness of a graph.

An agent can refer to a graph and make statements about that graph 
without
any relation to whether the graph is or is not asserted. Thus, an agent
could refer to a graph that is stated to be non-asserted (quoted) by
the graph authority as the hypothetical basis for some conclusion, yet
such a reference would not assert that unasserted graph (even if the
conclusion could not be reached without asserting it).

Because the statements qualifying one graph are irrelevant to any other 
graph!

If some graph A contains the statement

    :A trix:asserted "true"^^xsd:boolean .

and graph A is merged into graph B, which has no
assertion statements -- that does *not* result in graph
B being asserted, because there would be no statement

    :B trix:asserted "true"^^xsd:boolean .

in graph B.

Please look at my recent discussions of these issues. You are presuming
the use of a "thisGraph" mechanism, which I've abandoned, as well as 
perhaps
presuming that somehow the RDF and/or OWL MTs have to deal with the
special semantics required, which I think they don't.

I think you will find my latest proposal, which outlines the two
phases of interpretation.

Blech...

Yes. Insofar as graphs are concerned. And that's provide for using the 
intra-graph vocabulary.

A given graph contains statements qualifying that graph regarding
assertiveness, authority, etc. and includes a signature for
authenticating/validating the graph to be sure about who said
what.

The who in "who owns this graph" is the authority specified in the
graph. And the assertiveness of the graph is specified also in the
graph. And trust of the statements asserted by that graph is based
on the authenticated authority of the graph.

Seems pretty simple to me (but then I tend to be a bit simple minded, 
eh ;-)

But how do you *know* if the assertion is by the agent it says it is 
by? By another graph?!

I think it should be sufficient to define the 'operational' 
specification
of how the bootstrapping intepretation is done, per the semantics of the
bootstrapping vocabulary within the context of a particular, named 
graph.

RDF/OWL applications that don't understand the special vocabulary will
not be impacted by statements using it, but those that do understand
the vocabulary will know how to perform the special bootstrapping
pre-interpretation of the graph to test assertion and authenticity
prior to any further RDF/OWL interpretation.

Geee... what does this big red button do...?
