I'm myself pretty much sold on the vocabulary approach.

Could add yet another attribute to indicate authority. And another
for a signature...

I think this is the particular nail in the coffin for this approach.

This is a *PRO*, not a con!  ;-)

I think that assertion and agreement are two very different things.

Just because I agree with the statements in some graph does not
mean that I assert that graph (even if I myself assert another graph
having the same statements).

Eh?

I wonder if what you really mean by rdfx:assertedBy is really more
like rdfx:affirmedBy ...?

I think we add that level for either the XML or vocab approach.

Not necessarily, if the interpretation of statements employing that
vocabulary to qualify a graph is limited to qualifying the graph
in which they occur.

Perhaps we need to split this up into Intra-Graph Vocab and
Inter-Graph Vocab, the former providing for self qualifying
graphs, and the latter allowing for one graph to have statements
qualifying another.

I'm not sure how you could reliably derive the intent of the author
as to whether a set of statements was intended to be asserted or not.

Exactly how does one do this in RDF? I don't recall any facility
for differentiating between URI denoted resources and bnode denoted
resources in the range of a property. Does OWL provide such a
distinction?

This would, though, be a pro for the XML approach, in that one could
have an attribute for the authority that required URI values.

Nor I, unless there was some owl:sameAs equating it to a URI that
I trusted...

I would argue that this is a con for Inter-Graph vocab but not
Intra-Graph vocab.

One person's 'twisted' is another's 'elegant' ;-)
