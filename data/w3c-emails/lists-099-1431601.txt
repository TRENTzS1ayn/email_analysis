Cool - the clarification is good.  I'm still a little uncertain about 
entering items with a separator, however.  I always forget which 
character I'm supposed to use- especially when I'm forced to send mail 
with Outlook.  :)

I know that it's not the standard's job to specify the exact UI in the 
browser, but I'm certain the email-like GUI present in the spec at the 
current moment will end up in IE at some point.  ;)

I don't know if I have a better idea, but perhaps the recommended UI 
should be one that changes from this (when unfocused):

+----------------------------------------+
| matt@aclaro.com, foo@something.com ... |
+----------------------------------------+

to this text-area-like-one-per-line layout (when focused):

+----------------------------------------+
| matt@aclaro.com                      |^|
| foo@something.com                    | |
| whoever@whereever.com                | |
| *    <-- insertion mark (?)          |v|
+----------------------------------------+

Perhaps someone can come up with a better idea than myself, but the idea 
is there and might prompt some discussion.  :)

Matt.
