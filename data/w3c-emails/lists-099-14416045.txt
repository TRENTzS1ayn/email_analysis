Thanks for the comments, Masahide. I agree. I removed the width/height
stuff and changed the explanation to
[[
A region of type Rectangle uses two pairs of comma-separated integers. the
pairs are separated by a space. The first pair describes the upper left, the
second one the lower right corner. An example coords value for a rectangle is
"10,20 50,100" (upper_left_x=10, upper_left_y=20, lower_right_x=50,
lower_right_y=100).

oops, ok. I asked jim, morten and greg before I changed the doc. should I
change it back again? I could live with any syntax. another irc meeting 
required? what are the pros/cons, use cases?

{x1,y1,width,height}:
+ width and height can easily be extracted
- lower right corner has to be calculated
+ people see that boundingBox != rectangle coords

{x1,y1 x2,y2}:
+ lower right corner can easily be extracted
- width and height have to be calculated
+ same syntax as for rectangle coords

can't see a "huge" advantage of any of them..
/me clueless ;)
