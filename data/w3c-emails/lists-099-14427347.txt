Benjamin, thank you very much for prompt action.

New description for Rectangle looks very clear.

>/me clueless ;)

Well, since both Rectangle and BBox are the same type of shape, application
can reuse the same codes to process them if both use {x1,y1 x2,y2} value.
But, it's not difficult to process {x1,y1,width,height} value, I'm fine
with this if there is specific reason to choose this.

Personally, I don't think another IRC meeting is required. Just providing
rationale is enough.

cheers :)
