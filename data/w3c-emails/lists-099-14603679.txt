I am not sure how aware everyone is of already deployed PKI

On a windows environment

Open IE

Tools => Internet Options
   Content => Certificates ...

Then Intermediate Certification Authories or
       Trusted Root Certification

Then select one and click on View and you can find out a lot about it ...

I was surprised not to find an address - but you do get country and name

I think we can presuppose this sort of infrastructure or equivalent if we 
want it.


I would tend to see this as only necessary for financial transactions, and 
the algorithm I just posted is intended to be useful with different trust 
policies at step 3.
