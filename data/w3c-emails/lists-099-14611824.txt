Another tricky issue which we need a simple solution to is time.

Particularly for publishers who are not using signatures, (which is almost 
everyone at the moment), we may want to provide vocabulary to time-out an 
affirmation. e.g. an affirmation may have a start time and an end time 
explicitly associated with it. (or implicitly using OWL semantics say).
