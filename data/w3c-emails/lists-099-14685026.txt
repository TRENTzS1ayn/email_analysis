Agree with all of the above. Note however that there is no particular 
reason to believe any such claim of who asserted what, unless it is 
made by the asserter, which gets us into questions of how to identify 
the author of such a claim. I am happy to punt on giving an answer to 
that question, but I'd like us to identify it clearly as one that 
needs to be answered in order to anchor trust securely.
