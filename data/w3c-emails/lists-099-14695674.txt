Just to de-lurk, yes this all makes sense. One technique that I believe 
to be deployable (even if a pragmatic hack) is PGP signing RDF files.
For eg see http://usefulinc.com/foaf/signingFoafFiles

PGP only assures that the file hasn't been changed since the signer 
interacted with it, doesn't assure that the signer asserts it. My 
working guess is that, if the doc itself claims that the signer is its 
creator, that is enough to bootstrap the claim that the signer asserts
the triples encoded in the rdf/xml. Potentially tenuous but I can't
think of how else to roll this stuff out...
