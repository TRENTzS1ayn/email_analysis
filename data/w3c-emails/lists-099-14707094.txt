My guess is that with only a little bit of common practice to that effect, 
that this would stand up in a court of law. A digital signature is a pretty 
heavy duty device and is already understood as the analog of a written 
signature - and if the RDF stacks up as saying affirmed by Jeremy and I 
have digitally signed it as Jeremy, I think I would have a hard time trying 
to repudiate it.

Jeremy (not digitally signed, not affirmed, take it or leave it!)
