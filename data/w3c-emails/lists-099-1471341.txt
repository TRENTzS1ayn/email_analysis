PaulC

XQuery WG
....longest without a REC
....started out as largest
....big spec. 

went to LC on 12th.

[admin: agreed to make proceedings of meeting public]

LC ends mid feb. 3 month LC.
Want to make sure get good review from RDF and OWL folks. To get their 
view on whether we did good job of making a QL for XML.
Our method: first we did a data model for XML.
We don't necc insist that the datamodel is generated from 'physical'
xml.

the data model doc tells you how you'd go about creating the datamodel
instance.
incl schema input etc.
the QL operates thru a closed set of operators over that datamodel.
one objection we've heard: that you cant use xquery over rdf as rdf's 
syntax is overflexible. But... maybe its the mapping of rdf to xquery
datamodel that is the key.

xquery 1.0 is a superset of xpath 2.0 (readonly path expressions)
xquery allows construction, new instances, bunch of other stuff
...we have a separate data model doc.
