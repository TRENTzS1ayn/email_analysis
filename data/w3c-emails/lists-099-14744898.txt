When asked in IRC about which to use for rect, I said x,y,width,height, as
that is the natural mechanism for use in SVG, and HTML, so no conversion
would be required, I didn't notice that BBox was different, but I would also
say that should be x,y,h,w since that again is directly usable on the web,
and it's what API's such as getBBox() of SVG gives.

It doesn't matter much, both are interchangeable.
