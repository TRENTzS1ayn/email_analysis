True. Though I think the other arguments against a syntactic approach 
and for
a vocabulary based approach still strongly favor the vocabulary 
approach.

And uptake, given compatiblity with legacy systems/tools, will still be 
aided by
a solution that doesn't require re-tooling... so the number of years 
can still
be reduced.
