How about a simple property such as

    trix:validUntil
       a trix:GraphQualificationProperty ;
       rdfs:description "Specifies the date after which the graph is no 
longer considered valid (or asserted)." ;
       rdfs:domain trix:Graph ;
       rdfs:range xsd:date .

Thus, expiration is disjunct from assertion. Even quoted graphs can 
expire. But
an expire graph is clearly not asserted by the publisher.

Eh?
