Agreed.

Though I think that this is the question that needs to be answered 
*first*,
since if you can't answer that question, then you cannot presume that
the rest of your model will ever be workable, and how you approach
answering the other questions may be strongly influenced by how you
answered the first.

Any attempt to answer the other questions without answering the first
are not (to me) particularly interesting since they are all just
floating around in "la la land" and who knows if they can ever be
put to practical use.

I think, though, that we have the kernel of an answer to that first
question.
