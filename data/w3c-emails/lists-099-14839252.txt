Again, I think it's very important to keep separate the authenticity of
a graph from the intended usage of the graph by the 
owner/creator/publisher.

Just because a graph is signed, should not mean that it is explicitly
asserted (even if lots of agents might presume that it is).

Per my examples of conditional assertion, there can (and I expect will) 
be
lots of use cases where authenticity is important for non-asserted or
conditionally asserted graphs.

If we're introducing new machinery to address these issues, then there
is no justification for blurring distinctions that are/could be
significant just to have maximal reuse of existing machinery.

I agree. If there was an explicit claim of assertion. If there was only
a signature, then IMO all that would constitute is a test of origin
of the statements, not whether they reflect asserted claims.

I may sign my name on the inner jacket of a book, but that doesn't
mean I am asserting the claims made in the book -- only that I am
wishing to indicate ownership of the (copy of the) book.

If, however, I were to write "I affirm the claims expressed in this
book." above the signature, then that would be a different matter.

Origin of published content and assertion of claims (truth) are two
different things, and our machinery should capture that distinction.

Likewise ;-)
