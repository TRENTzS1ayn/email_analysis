OK. Perhaps using the term trix:Authority simply as a tool for 
discussion,
saying clearly that we're not going to define precisely what it is, but
e.g. that it *could* be taken to be the class of entities for which e.g.
the following example using PKI would act as authorities... etc.

I.e., the precise definition of what a trix:Authority is, is left as
future work...

Eh?
