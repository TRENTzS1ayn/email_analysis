You've not proved me wrong. You've proved what you have misunderstood me
to be proposing to be wrong, and I agree ;-)

What I'm *actually* proposing, is fully compatible with the above.

(a) Jeremy did not explicitly assert his graph (let's pretend the 
emails are graphs ;-)
(b) Dan did not explicitly assert his graph
(c) You explicitly asserted Jeremy's and Dan's graphs
(d) You did not explicly assert your own graph (oops! ;-)

Thus, we have no way to be sure if *any* of the graphs are asserted, 
since
we can't know if your graph is asserted, which would then assert
the other graphs.

Furthermore, even if you had explicitly asserted your graph, we would
still need that extra-RDF mechanism to allow your graph to be
deemed to be asserted, and thus to then assert the other graphs.

We also could have a very strict trust policy that would disregard
third party assertions, taking as asserted only graphs which have
first party assertions.

Anyone who would collaborate with the two of us, Pat, surely is a 
hard-core
masochist! ;-)
