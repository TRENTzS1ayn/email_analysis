This is an editorial problem, I will try and make the text clearer:

This is only meant to refer to serializing named graphs by using RDF/XML on
the web ... with the convention that the name is the retrieval URL - it
can't be an arbitrary URI because there is no retrieval algorithm - it is
not meant to prevent graph names being blank nodes.

I try to use URL when I am specifical meaning a URI with a built-in GET,
which I think is OK? (Perhaps you could educate me - briefly)

We certainly need to address the termination of the bootstrap ... I am going
to try and pick things off the thread.

Chris's earlier document

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2004Feb/att-0072/swig-bizer-
carroll

seemed to me to introduce the query language in about 1 paragraph + 1
example, and then save that space over by using the query language in the
later examples. I don't think we should overcommit to it - e.g. indicate it
as only for the examples and motivate it as a minor extension to RDQL.

I certainly don't think we have enough space to do anything more on query,
and it is not crucial, but I felt that swig-bizer-carroll flowed better
because of this part.
