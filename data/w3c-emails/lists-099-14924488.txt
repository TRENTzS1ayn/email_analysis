OK. Sorry. I thought you making a more fundamental claim. Nevermind ;-)

Well, OK. I guess that is fair enough usage of the term URL. I guess
I've been thinking so much lately about architectural rather than
application issues that I'm oversensitized to certain terms...

It might be cleaner (at least to me) to use the term URI but state
that we are primarily concerned here with URIs which are resolvable
to RDF/XML representations (commonly known as URLs),
and then use the term URI throughout to be more in line
with the latest practices recommended by the TAG/REST/IETF/etc
where URL is deemed antiquated and for the most part deprecated.

Especially since much of the functionality has nothing to do with
how one obtains the graph -- i.e. whether one got it by dereferencing
the URI denoting it, or by some other means.

But I don't intend to be pedantic about it...

Sorry for all the debris. Hopefully it won't be too hard to see
the good bits...

OK. No problem. I wasn't sure if we were talking 2 paras or 2 pages.
I agree that having something akin to the above referenced post
sounds reasonble and useful.

(though there is always the risk of having too many targets in one
paper for reviewers to aim at... and some folks take query rather
passionately ;-)
