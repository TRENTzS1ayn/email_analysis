On 1999/01/12, I made a link from the XML
page at W3C
  http://www.w3.org/XML/
to the XTech '99 homepage
  http://www.gca.org/conf/xtech99/xtecindx

We have since moved materials about the development
of XML before 2002 to a separate page
  http://www.w3.org/XML/hist2002

I just tried to follow the link from there
to XTech '99 and I got

"GCA is now IDEAlliance. The information once found at this location can
now be found on our new site. Please use the navigation elements above
to find what you were looking for. If you have any trouble locating the
information, please send email to webmaster@idealliance.org."

I followed the "events" link, then "past events"
to
  http://www.idealliance.org/events_past.asp

but I don't see anything about XTech '99 there.

Please arrange for your web site to respond to GET
requests for http://www.gca.org/conf/xtech99/xtecindx
to either

(a) return a 200 code, by restoring the relevant pages
to their original place

(b) return a "301 Moved Permanently" code, with a pointer
to their new location, if you have moved them, or
http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.3.2

(c) return a 410 Gone response if you have decided
not to publish them any longer.
