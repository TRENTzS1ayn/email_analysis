Dan,

My understanding was that there is fairly wide acceptance in the RDF
community from early on that role nouns are preferred..

Yes, it conflicted with my notion of "predicate" but I have grown to
appreciate it. I didn't realise the extent to which english if full
of these things and the richness of them. Often, for example,
there are nouns (cousin, mentor, arctan, etc etc) when no verb exists -
hence the growth of "isXXXof" or "hasXXX" forms when one
attempts to make verbs.

There was some early email about it.  I bet you can dig up more
stuff.  Yes it seems like work for the BPWG to put in a document.

I thought I had written it somewhere too but I can't find it.

Feel free to pass this on.

Tim
