Is this really ext/int, or is it the type/token distinction (here the 
graph/document distinction, more or less)? It smells to me more like 
the latter. If I assign a name to a graph, am I claiming naming 
rights over the abstraction itself, or just over my instance of it?

Ouch, I seem to have missed this. (Did I ever see a copy of this 
version of the paper?? I don't seem to have it.)

Indeed, that is (forgive me) a terrible idea.

Right. That need not be a syntactic prohibition, only an 
understanding that there is a need to standardize apart when 
combining information from different graphs which both use a bnode.

I'd just have no exceptions, frankly. Why do you need to involve 
bnodes at all? Bnodes aren't supposed to be names of anything; that 
is the whole point of having bnodes in the first place.

It shouldn't. It is fine to infer (exists (x) P(x) ) from (exists (x) 
(P(x) and Q(x)) )

No, let it happen. As long as when I import your blank nodes, they 
become my blank nodes, there is no harm in this and it might be 
useful.

Don't mess with blank nodes: we had them completely understood, and 
they are totally debugged by 60 years of close attention from the 
logicians. All we have to do is to stick to the idea that they are 
bound in a graph, and have no connection with any names in any other 
graph. Use URIs for any naming process larger than a graph (including 
naming the graph.)
