Pat,

the abstract syntax section of the first version of the paper is the most
finished and captures my current understanding of the treatment of blank
nodes, including the "blank nodes naming a graph" part, and blank nodes not
being shared, can you quickly review that and say what you think needs to
change.

Let's leave until after we've done the semantics the single issue of whether
blank nodes can or cannot be shared across graphs in the abstract syntax -
since we seem to agree that if we permit it, it has no semantic impact.
So once we've finished the semantics, we can experiment with removing the
constraint, and see whether we want to keep it or not.


Answering one of your points:

the motivation was in part to capture what N3 already permits with its
formulae, that can be seen as unasserted graphs that are named with a blank
node, which then participates in one other graph (typical the top-level
one).


Also, not permitting existentials to refer to graphs might require an
excessive use of skolemization to assign arbitrary names. I think blank
nodes capture such arbitrariness better than any name.
