A few comments on http://www.hixie.ch/specs/html/forms/web-forms . 
Apologies for not having time to study the draft in more depth.

- 2.1. expdate. Is there a less application-specific name for this type 
that could be used?

- Do the new types mean that extensions to RFC3106 might be useful? Is 
it the job of your spec to specify them?

- "The entire model can be emulated purely using JavaScript and the DOM. 
With such a library, this model could be used and down-level clients 
could be supported before user agents implemented it ubiquitously. 
Creating such a library is left as an exercise to the reader."

This begs the question: why not write and publish the library instead of 
writing a spec?
