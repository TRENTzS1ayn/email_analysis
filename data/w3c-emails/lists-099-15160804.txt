Agreed. But if it is signed AND if it says that is an assertion by 
the signer, then that seems to me to be good enough for everyone's 
pump to be primed. And we can build this into the rdfg MT.

(If the graph-saying involves arbitrarily long inference chains to 
establish, for no good reason....?  Lets leave that issue to the 
lawyers.)  A cautious lawyer might also require that both the 
asserting graph and the asserted graph were signed by the same signer 
(and that they also asserted in RDF that they were so signed in a 
checksum-checkable way, etc.)  That seems to me to be a bit like 
signing every page of legal document, but OK, in extreme conditions.

I think we all agree at this point.
