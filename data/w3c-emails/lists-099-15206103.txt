Easy to attack.

Yes: two reasons:
 a) N3 formulae is one of the most deployed `solutions' to contexts etc. and 
the topics of provenance, context, and embedding logic in RDF do get muddled, 
and we need to make it clear that we are opposed to that latter.
 b) Patrick and I have gone public with log:implies paradox being an issue for 
named graphs so reviewers are likely to require a solution

I found it came to less than a page to express the arguments why log:implies 
as documented is broken.
>I(n) = GN(n) for n in the set of graph-reference names; and

looks like the right direction to me ...

Agreed wholeheartedly.

>If its not, what is it?

In the Carroll/Stickler paper it was a file that contained a number of named 
graphs - i.e. this usage cannot be expressed with RDF/XML but you need new 
syntax. Two such files using different bnode labels but otherwise identical 
are not different in an interesting way.
