If I have understood Pat, the MT could embed such a relationship ...

thus

eg:g rdfg:hasSignature "...."

can either have operational semantics, RDF processors may go off and check
this, somewhat like owl:imports, or it may have formal semantics i.e. it is
true iff the bytes are a signature of the graph according to some other
document. I think it would be good to do the latter - a point which I had
been missing.

A nice thing about signatures is that the second triple cannot be
automagically generated (well not correctly), because the literal cannot be
spoofed. Thus embedding it in the formal semantics would allow me to do

  my:sig rdfs:subPropertyOf rdfg:signature

and then use my:sig instead of rdfg:signature, and everything would be
kosher and this would be robust against forged signatures (thanks to the
crypto technology).

That's my impression too.

That's what I understand.

I don't think I was particularly aiming at one thing or another .. the TriX
paper was weak because it presented a syntax with no semantics, and it
certainly is good to have Pat on board to help with that step - I am still
not committed to any particular solution there though.

We need some thought at the semantic/MT level and some thought at the
operational level - I am not trying to prejudge what the answer is. I think
we can get overly concerned about the termination and grounding problems.

It seems to me that if we adequately articulate the bootstrapping problem
then someone who choose to publish their statements of assertion and
statements of signatures in a way that is difficult to understand will
narrow their audience. But that happens all the time - e.g. academics will
throw insults at one another in footnotes that require a load of processing
to understand - and part of that is to narrow the audience. It might even be
useful - e.g. if I want to publish my e-mail address I can put an
arbitrarily complicated OWL derivation in order to get it, this might act as
a block on spammers (of course, they already know my e-mail address).
Anyone the point is that the vocabulary does not intrinsically need to be
used in a special way to enable bootstrapping, but merely the more
straightforward usage will be understood more clearly.

I think we can work on an orthogonal extension, which can work with RDFS or
OWL - probably not worth the effort to consider RDF (without S).

I see that as a publisher's choice.
