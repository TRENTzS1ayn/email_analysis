We may need both operational semantics and formal semantics -- i.e.
the operational semantics tells the processor what statements are
relevant to determine if a graph is authentic and/or asserted,
and the results of that determination feed into whether a given
graph is true or false, etc.

Eh?

Right.

In fact, rdfg:signature could simply have a formal semantics
defined, and then specific subproperties could have operational
semantics defined, such that the subproperty differentiates the
particular type of signature being used and what the processor
has to do to validate it.

Great. Light at the end of the tunnel (let's hope the tunnel doesn't

I think I'm probably pushing for more of a tangible solution that
the rest of you, due I'm sure to my practical "build it so it will work"
mentality.

Not that everything has to be fully cooked, but I still would like
to see all the ingredients in there somehow.

Hmmmm... I'm not sure I 100% agree with this, but let's pretend for the
moment that I do ;-)

Well, it's a publisher's choice what machinery they choose to use
to indicate assertion/authenticity -- but ideally there would be
a well defined model/methodology to do so which most publishers
and agents would both use -- and that requires a reasonable
definition of how those "bootstrapping" interpretations are done.

As shown in numerous examples, a bunch of statements and the RDF
and OWL MTs don't get you there. You end up either with the
chicken/egg question (how can a graph that is not asserted contain
a statement that asserts it) or the authenticity question (how do
we know that the authority of a graph as identified in a graph
actually is the origin of the graph).

I think what we need to do is to (eventually) provide a model
that publishers will want to use because it provides useful
answers to the above two questions.
