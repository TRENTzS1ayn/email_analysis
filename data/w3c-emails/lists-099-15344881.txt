I think we are all on-board that goal ... but we also should be doing the
best theoretical job we can within the constraints of actually being useful!

Agreed - the most obvious is that the assertion chain should bottom out with
a graph that:
- asserts itself
- and includes its own signature
- with a minimum of inference (e.g. none)
- possible contains noting else except assertions and signatures of other
graphs

A potential information-consumer can verify that signature, and particularly
if the graph does not contain other stuff, will be happy to accept the graph
as true - and the heart of the boot-strap is completed.
