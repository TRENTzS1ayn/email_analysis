I.e.


    rdfg:Graph
       a rdfs:Class ;
       rdfs:comment "An RDF graph (with intensional semantics)." .

    rdfg:equivalentGraph
       a rdf:Property ;
       rdfs:comment  "The subject and object graphs are equivalent as 
defined by RDF Concepts." ;
       rdfs:domain rdfg:Graph ;
       rdfs:range rdfg:Graph .

    rdfg:subGraphOf
       a rdf:Property ;
       rdfs:comment "The subject graph is equivalent to a subset of the 
object graph." ;
       rdfs:domain rdfg:Graph ;
       rdfs:range rdfg:Graph ;

And

    swp:Authority
       a rdfs:Class ;
       rdfs:comment "An authority, or origin, of a graph; such as a 
person or company." .

    swp:Signature
       a rdfs:Class ;
       rdfs:comment "A signature used to authenticate a graph." .

    swp:authority
       a rdf:Property ;
       rdfs:comment "The object is the authority, or origin, of the 
subject graph." ;
       rdfs:domain rdfg:Graph ;
       rdfs:range swp:Authority .

    swp:assertedBy
       a rdf:Property ;
       rdfs:subPropertyOf rdfg:authority ;
       rdfs:comment "The object is the asserting authority of the 
subject graph." ;
       rdfs:domain rdfg:Graph ;
       rdfs:range swp:Authority .

    swp:signature
       a rdf:Property ;
       rdfs:comment "The object is the signature to be used to 
authenticate the subject graph." ;
       rdfs:domain rdfg:Graph ;
       rdfs:range swp:Signature .

Seems reasonable to me.

It also further narrows the focus of the 
bootstrapping/grounding/terminal
interpretation to an even more minimal vocabulary.
