No, I didn't mean that more paranoid people just trust fewer graphs, this is
still the easy case :-)
I meant, that an agent trust graph A more than graph B, e.g. he descides to
trust graph A with a trust value of 0.8 on some trust scale and graph B with
a value of 0.4.

I think, we should at least teoretically be open to this kind of stuff.
