Maybe I'll find time to fix this, but not just now...

<dajobe> anyone here who can fix http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Overview.rss
?
<DanC> in what way is it broken?
<dajobe> the dc:date fields have a trailijng :
<DanC> ew
<dajobe> so they get piled on top of planetrdf, since the regex doesn't
match ( I think )
<dajobe> I suspect either the html or rss is built from the other
format, since they all have the :
<dajobe> (first 3 news items)
