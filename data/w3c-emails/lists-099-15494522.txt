Is trust then always and only concerned with truth of information? 
That seems rather restrictive as a general theory. For example, there 
are people I know who I trust to be rational, or to be objective, or 
to be honest: but none of this means that I necessarily believe what 
they say to be true.

One can make similar claims about any situation involving 
propositional attitudes of any kind. Such philosophical havering is 
easy, but not convincing unless it is backed up by some deeper 
analysis. (IMO). Is there anything special about trust that makes it 
inherently continuous? If anything, the potential link to action and 
agency usually makes things more polar, not less polar, since its 
impossible to act in a continuum: you either do the action, or not.

None of this seems convincing to me. It reads like pop sociology.

OWL and RDF are inherently bipolar (boolean 2-valued) in their basic 
assertional semantics. However, one can make assertions about a 
continuum within a boolean language, provided that you refer to the 
values somehow (which would likely be a good idea anyway). You can 
say that (it is true that) my trust in foo is 0.1637, or that my 
trust in foo is greater than my trust in baz. You can have a 
multivariate-valued trust datatype if you want :-)

So I don't think we are *excluding* anything by having a 
truth-functional language to say it all in. The logic is one thing, 
the content another. Messing with the logic is usually not as 
practical as inventing an ontology of your own favorite continuum.
