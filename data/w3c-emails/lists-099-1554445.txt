I like your proposal, both for its improvements to wording and for having 
been written by someone who knows MIME better than I do.  Notwithstanding 
your wish not to join a protracted debate, do you have any objection to my 
pointing the workgroup to the archived copy of your note?  Thanks.

        Subject:        Re: Proposal for Miffy MIME Headers


Noah,

I don't plan to join a long public debate, so I'll pass these comments 
privately, to treat as you will...

(1) Notwithstanding what the MIME spec says about Content_* headers, I 
think it's the HTTP spec that says what HTTP passes is *not* MIME, just 
MIME-like.

I've been working on a header registry spec (with Mark Nottingham and 
Jeffrey Mogul), and part of the feedback we got from Ned Freed (one of the 

MIME spec editors) was that we should be clear about distinguishing MIME 
headers from others.  But I think this is kind-of academic, and shouldn't 
get in the way of the real issues.

(2)  I found some of your proposed wording seemed (to me) a bit 
laboured.  So here's my bite at the problem (feel free to use or ignore 
any 
or all of it):
[[
<newProposal>
MIFFY Documents MUST be valid MIME Multipart/Related documents, as
specified by [rfc2387]. Ordering of MIME parts MUST NOT be considered
significant to MIFFY processing or to the construction of the Target
Infoset.

The root MIME part MUST be an XML 1.0 serialization [xml1.0] of the
Optimized Infoset, and MUST be identified with the [ TBD ] media type.

MIME parts including the root part MUST contain header XXXX and YYYY, and 
Miffy processors may use these to interpret the MIME data.  Other MIME 
headers  may be used and, when used, must be recognized to the extent 
needed to properly decode the MIME structure.  Otherwise, Miffy processing 

does not depend on the presence of any MIME headers other than those 
noted.

For example, Content-Length (RFC 2616) is an optional header:  one or
more parts in a Miffy document may contain a Content-Length header.  If
present, its may be used to optimize buffer management during 
reconstruction of the Infoset, reconstruction of an Infoset should not be 
declined to due to lack of a Content-Length header.
</newProposal>
]]
