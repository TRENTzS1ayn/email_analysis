It wasn't meant as a general theory but as a domain specific definition
aiming at domains like the Semantic Web, where trust in information is kind
of relevant.  The definitions used today are usually domain specific,
because general definitions tent to get so abstract, that they aren't
operational anymore. If you want more action orientated definitions you can
look at the ones used in game theory. If you want definitions which don't
oversimplify the complexity of trust you can look at the ones used in
psychology and sociology (I can guarantee that you will not like them
either).

Agents and their decision making is one thing. Ranking information found on
the Semantic Web is the other.

An agent might find 500 contradiction assertions about a specific topic. He
may prefer to rank them using a trust policy and display the ranked results
to the user, leaving the final decision to him.

You should be convinced at least by the first two, because we are proposing
them in our paper. Our agents use subjective trust policies. One agent might
trust a graph, another agent might distrust it in the same situation because
he uses a more paranoid trust policy. The policy used depends on the
specific task (context). If you buy something worth a million you are more
paranoid than if you are searching for my papers :-) When an agent gets
access to new background information (e.g. role of an authority or
certificate revokal) his trust in a graph changes.
