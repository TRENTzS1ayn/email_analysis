The practical difficulty with this is that it's not clear that
folks will indicate the certificate of the authority in any
consistent manner via an rdf:seeAlso reference.

Better to have it explicit, e.g.

:G2 (:G1 swp:assertedBy ex:chris .
      ex:chris swp:certificate <http://...> )

This sounds like a reasonable way to go, but I think for this particular
paper, all we need to define is swp:signature and swp:Signature and
simply cover their essential function, leaving it to future work
to define the rest.

I.e., go ahead and put together a proposal vocabulary, which may in
any case be useful in clarifying things for the present paper, but
let's keep the two activities distinct. OK?

OK, so either way, all we need is the swp:authority and swp:signature,
and then via the URI of the authority we obtain a certificate for the
authority, where the CA of that certificate is either the authority
itself (PGP) or is specified in the certificate (X509).

Right?
