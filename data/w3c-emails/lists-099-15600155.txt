Yes, nearly. With the extension that X509 uses certification hirarchies,
meaning VeriSign (the usual root CA) certificates other CAs who themselfes
certificate users and other CAs. The PGP aproach doesn't rely on root CAs
but on independent trust chains.

Yes. In the X509 case you should trust a root CA (all internet explorer
users do, because the VeriSign certificate is build in :-), and all
certificates are chained up to this root CA (or other CAs you trust on the
way). In the PGP case you need to trust somebody in a chain that connects to
the certificate you want to check. Knowing that the signeture is valid your
agent can start thinking about, if he trusts the authority on information
content in the specific application domain.
