Agreed. I put that in there simply for the example. The less said about
specific methodologies the better -- so long as the message that the 
most
important/widely used ones will be fully supported gets through.

The MT would only, I think, concern itself with the swp: terms and 
criteria
such as "a warrant is valid if the specified authority is authenticated
and the signature checks out" -- and the additional properties 
describing a
warrant simply allow that to happen. In some cases, no further 
properties
are needed. In other cases, proprietary properties are needed. But it 
falls
below the "opacity level" insofar as the MT we define is concerned.

Yes?

Oops. No surprise.

Please point out what's wrong so I can avoid similar mistakes in the 
future.

Looks OK to me.

Though perhaps just swp:graph is enough, since the domain/range make
the rest clear.

(I tend to prefer having predicates that closely match the range. I've
found that users grok an ontology much better when things line up
mnemmonically in that fashion)

OK. I look forward to understanding what concerns you.
