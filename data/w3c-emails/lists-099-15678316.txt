Just to be pedantic, giving us:

:G (

      some:resource some:property some:value .

      [  a swp:Warrant ;
         swp:graph :G ;
         swp:assertingAuthority ex:Bob ;
         swp:signature "..."^^sig:PGPSignature .
         swp:certificate "..." .
         swp:certificationAuthority <http://www.certificates-R-us.com> .
      ]

      [  a swp:Warrant ;
         swp:graph :G ;
         swp:authority ex:Bill ;
         swp:signature "..."^^sig:X509Signature .
      ]

      [  a swp:Warrant ;
         swp:graph :G ;
         swp:assertingAuthority ex:Mary ;
         swp:signature "..."^^xyz:XYZSignature ;
         xyz:policy xyz:blargh .
      ]

)

... er... what to do about

      :G swp:warrant 
<http://www.foo.bar.com/us282uss82wsauia9whjrui.wnt> .

???

Oops! There go our external warrants! Then again, that might not be such
a big deal...

Or do we really have to constrain each warrant to a single graph in the
swp: ontology itself -- since each warrant's signature is graph 
specific,
there is simply no utility/means to have the same warrant authenticate
two different graphs -- so perhaps the swp:warrant property is OK and
the limitation to a single graph is enforced by the nature of the
signature rather than by OWL semantics.

Eh?
