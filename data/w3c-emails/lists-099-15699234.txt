A datatype is useful when you map from a lexical form to a value - I don't
think these datatypes above are doing that ... It is more that this sig is a
binary blob that gets treated in the semantics which discussed the truth of
certain triples, handing that off to the X.509 or PGP or other crypto spec.

However the sig by itself (without the rest of the example) is neither valid
nor invalid. (It is true that only some blobs of binary data are X.509
certificates).

Thus I suggest we use xsd:base64EncodedBinary  (possibly misspelt there)
