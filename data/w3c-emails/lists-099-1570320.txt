hi Aaron,

I wondered if you could give us some advice.

We are working on a project to gather together photos from various
WWW conferences and annotate them with depiction data[1]. As well as
ensuring we have permission to display the photos and the associated RDF
data, we would also like to enable others to use the photos and/or the
RDF for their own projects - to try out their own tools.

We'd like to use a Creative Commons licese to enable this, and were
thinking of perhaps Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike:

http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/1.0/

We were thinking that we would get anyone who contributed photos to
agree to this license (or some license) and also include the CC RDF data
in any RDF description of the image.

I wondered if you had any experience of this sort of project or know of
any pitfalls we might run into with respect to licensing?

Many thanks,

Libby
