ok, I updated the doc. both boundingBox and coords for Rectangle now should
use x,y,width,height. I also added some mini inline code examples to the 
coords doc [1] (thanks for the suggestion, morten). (I'm thinking about 
adding inline image support as well but don't know yet if I will find the
time for that extension.) I'm trying to focus on annotation forms and this
remote query thing now...

I have one question left: the basic svg shapes seem to allow float values
for coordinates, should I change "integer" to "float" or omit the units
in the doc?
