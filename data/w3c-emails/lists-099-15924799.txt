Pat's unfortunately right here - if you want to use a URI in RDF and be 
sure that I mean the same as what you do, you need to use
<URI>^^xsd:anyURI ... :( which somewhat shuts out much of the interesting 
stuff. I think that can be partially fixed, but that's another paper!

I have got rough text that covers this distinction now ... give me a few hours.
