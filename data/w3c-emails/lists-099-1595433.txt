Dear Yukiko Ogura,

Thank you for your mail.     I am glad that MPEG is planning  to be 
closely compatible with W3C specs such as SVG.   Chris Lilley (Ccd) is 
the w3C team contact for the SVG working group.

I have taken the liberty of putting the enclosures on the web and 
converting them where necessary to standard format.  (We have rule that 
standard formats be used for our work.)

You ask for the W3C, presumably the SVG Working Group, to review a
Call for Proposal.  I could not find the call, though.  There was only 
one attachment, a zip file.

Tim Berners-Lee
Director, W3C
