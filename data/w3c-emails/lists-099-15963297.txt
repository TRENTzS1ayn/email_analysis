There can be more than one first-party agents associated. The
distinction is really between first-party (named in the graph
itself) and third-party (named in some other graph). E.g. given

:G ( :G swp:assertedBy ex:Bob . :G swp:assertedBy ex:John . ...)
:H ( :H swp:assertedBy ex:Mary . :G swp:assertedBy ex:Mary . ...)

then Bob and John have a first-party relationship to G
but Mary has a third-party relationship to G, yet all three
assert graph G.

We can treat the first-party agents as the owners/publishers of the
graph, and the third-party agents as supporters/affirmers of the graph.

There's a significant benefit to the distinction. Those authorities 
named
in the graph itself, such that the signature(s) validate have a tighter
relationship to the graph, and hence a stronger claim of 
ownership/authorship.

I.e. the owner of the graph is the first-party authority identified in
the graph. Others may assert/affirm that graph, but they are not the
publishers of it -- if they were, they *they* would be named explicitly
in the graph and not someone else.

Basing ownership on who named a graph I think would be difficult to
do in practice. Tell me quick, in ten seconds, who minted the following
URI:  http://sjaiu.bib.to/qijeoaafoail/72812784/gkai.ais ???

Better to have the authority explicitly named in the signed graph, and
treat the first-party authority as the owner/publisher.

True, and then they are joint owners/publishers, if that signing occurs
in the graph itself.

No, I think we need to be clear about first-party vs. third-party
authority. Otherwise, you're left hanging in the wind when it comes
to resolving mutual conflicting claims of ownership all made within
graphs other than the graph in question. Having the authority explicitly
stated in the signed/authenticated/validate graph makes it crystal
clear who the owner/publisher really is, since no'one else would be
able to produce such a graph and have the signatures check out.
