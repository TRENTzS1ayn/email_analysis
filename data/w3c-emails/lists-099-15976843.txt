Initial comment: The signature of a graph can not be included into the graph
for technical reasons.



Signing a graph works the following way:



1. You take a graph

2. You calculate the hash of it

3. then you encrypt the hash using your private key.



Having the signature inside the graph makes it impossible to calculate the
hash, because things are getting circular.



I will think further about the other points of your mail ....
