The attached version is a current snapshot - I already have a long list of 
corrections etc from myself and Chris - however I am off home now, so it 
won't be til tomorrow afternoon that the next version is ready.

Particular interest is sections 4 and 8 with semantics and section 7 that 
tries to cover the semantic web publishing.

I suggest this as a heads up, maybe a "looks good" or "seriously wrong" 
binary type response at this stage, with a more detailed review tomorrow 
after I've worked in the current comments.

Further tasks will be:
- do we want to model it differently (i.e. move the classes and properties 
around)
- do we want to rename things
- do we need some more examples to make say bootstrapping clearer
- what other sections do we need
...
