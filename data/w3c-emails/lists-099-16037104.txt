Yes I know.

I commented on this earlier. The hash generated can be based on the 
graph
without the warrants, or simply without the signature values themselves.

So, given a graph

:G (
     ...
     :G swp:warrant [ a swp:Warrant ;
                      swp:assertedBy ex:Bob ;
                      swp:signature "..." ] .
     ...
    )

The hash is generated based on

:G (
     ...
     :G swp:warrant [ a swp:Warrant ;
                      swp:assertedBy ex:Bob ;
                      swp:signature _:s ] .
     ...
    )

I.e., the only bit of information that is not captured by the
signature is the signature itself.

Validation of the signature then simply requires filtering
out the signatures before testing the hash.
