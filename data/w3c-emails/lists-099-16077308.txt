Last week was very busy. I was remiss in sending out an update of 
exciting developments.

WWW2004 Panel +1
We have the go ahead from local hosts to do a panel on W3photo Tuesday 
or  Wednesday of WWW2004. We can also do a booth...if we can organize 
people/ourselves to have people at the booth.

Privacy/Annotation Issues +1
Great IRC discussion led to thinking of contributed photos like blog 
posts: contributor can annotate, others can comment on 
annotations/regions. This simplifies certain policy issues. Of course, 
this is the semantic web, so others can create annotations on their own 
sites that point to photos.

WWW2004 is a starting point +1
AKTive Space is going to focus first on organizing conference material 
for www2004 and then go back to past years. It probably makes the most 
sense if we present w3photo at www2004 as the beginning of something 
rather than a finished presentation.

Collaborative Workshop?
Mike and I discussed if the w3photo booth should be more like a 
collaborative workshop...an ongoing opportunity for people to see and 
to explore the building of this archive.  Thoughts?

best,

Greg
