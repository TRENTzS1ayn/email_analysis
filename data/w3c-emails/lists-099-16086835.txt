panel is good, also  like the booth idea - but see below

I would be upset if anyone ever considered this something different - 
I only bought in to the current design (slightly Sem Webbie) because 
I assumed we'd be doing more in the future

Why not run as a "kiosk" where people can bring photos, mark them up,
