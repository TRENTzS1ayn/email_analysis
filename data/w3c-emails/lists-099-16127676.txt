SVG 'rect' element uses x, y, widht, height as independent attributes, not
put them in one attribute like "10,20,30,40". On the other hand, 'points'
attribute of SVG 'polygon' or 'polyline' has values in one attribute as
"10,20 30,40". It depends on point of view which is closer to SVG, IMHO.

And, I'm not a native English user, but do we call 'x,y,width,height' as
coordinate ? It's confusing, at least for me.
