OK, these are the options I see:

a)
boundingBox -> {x1,y1,width,height}
Rectangle.coords -> {x1,y1 x2,y2}

b)
boundingBox -> {x1,y1 x2,y2}
Rectangle.coords -> {x1,y1 x2,y2}

c)
boundingBox -> {x1,y1,width,height}
Rectangle.coords -> {x1,y1,width,height}


may I suggest that anybody interested sends a short comment to this 
list to which options he/she can/cannot agree and which he/she would prefer?
I'm sure we can agree on one of the options above and finally start using
this vocabulary...

best,
benjamin
