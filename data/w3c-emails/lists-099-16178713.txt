hmm, we get the same property naming problem with the syntax of coords
for Circle (which has a radius) and Ellipse (x_radius and y_radius).

do we have to rethink the coords property's name (e.g. change it to 
"attrs", "facets", "vals", "shapeInfo", ...) or even the whole property
(e.g. split it into "x", "y", "points", "radius", ...)?

I personally like the convenience of having a single property.
