In theory I agree, in practice I don't - let's hear what Pat has to say on 
this one. In theory, whenever you use a web dereferencable URI the resource 
denoted has a representation that is got by the URI-GET, however that is 
not a part of RDF Semantics and I don't think it is for this paper to add it.

Let's hear from Pat.
