Hi Jeremy,

You are of course right, that the standalone usage that Norm is doing doesn't 
depend on any relationships, but it is quite possible to do so.

Matt Biddulph has been doing this for a while, for his picture annotations 
(unfortunately the search thingy is down atm, pending a wordnet upgrade):

This approach does use the subclass relationships of the wordnet RDF mapping 
- it may not be perfect from a linguistic or semantic standpoint, but I think 
it's a good start.

Morten
