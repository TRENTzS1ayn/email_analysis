We need to finalize a namespace URI for this round of publications.

I suggest we go with something on Patrick's TriX site since he does a good 
job of keeping it up to date.

So suggest patrick gets to choose a URI directory and the following files 
therein:

- a trix namespace, with DTD and XML Schema
- an rdfg namespace with RDFS/OWL Schema
- an swp namespace with RDFS/OWL Schema

do we need anything else?

Jeremy
