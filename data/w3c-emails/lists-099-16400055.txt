I'm not suggesting that we add anything to the RDF semantics.

This is why I suggested that the value be a resource -- and whether
the URI denoting the resource is web resolvable or not is not 
significant
to the function of that resource -- which is simply to serve as a 
commonly
agreed method (however/wherever defined, regardless of the web).

By specifying that the value is an xsd:anyURI literal, you are IMO
just us much out on the fringes of, or beyond, RDF-land than talking
about whether the URI used resolves to a representation that defines
the method in question.

A signature method is a thing/resource, and we'd probably want to use 
RDF
to talk about that method in pretty significant detail. Using a literal
precludes that (in any practical sense).

I don't see it as any different than a vocabulary term. If it's best to
use xsd:anyURI values to denote methods, than it's just as valid to use
xsd:anyURI values to denote vocabulary terms (if literals could be
subjects or predicates, that is ;-)
