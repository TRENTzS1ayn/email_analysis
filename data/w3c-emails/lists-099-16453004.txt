If I've understood you want:
   to use / instead of # as the namespace separator
   doing a get on any of the terms will get a representation of that term
   we will collect each schema in a file with an unrelated URL

that seems OK to me. (Who knows what best practice is? :) )

We could also have a trix file with both the rdfg and swp schemas in it, 
named by the URIs at which you can get the individual schemas.

On the dc:rights
My copyright is held by "Hewlett-Packard Development Company, LP", put that 
last ... (as far as I understand any intellectual property I generate 
belongs to them)
