Tim, Dan,

In my test case work there is some use of

log:inconsistentWith a rdf:Property;
    rdfs:domain log:Formula;
    rdfs:range log:Formula;
    rdfs:comment """to say that F1 log:inconsistentWith F2
means that F1 and F2 cannot both be the case (F1 NAND F2)
or that either F1 is false or F2 is false (~F1 OR ~F2)""".

I am not expressing an inconsistency derivation as
{graph} => { } as we can't constructively prove false.
Instead I express it as
{graph} => {F1 log:inconsistentWith F2} and don't conclude
which one is false. This is up to an external actor...

I just wanted to make sure that I don't misuse the log:
namespace; is there an alternative (evt. log:nand, ...)??
