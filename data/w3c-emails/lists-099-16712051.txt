W3photo & WWW2004 project update:

We are on.

We will have a table, a flyer in the registration packets, and project 
will be announced to conference.  W3photo will be the photo gallery for 
www2004.

We have two 1 hour sessions as a part of Developer's Day (Saturday; 
will be following up more). m.c. Schraefel accepted a poster on w3photo 
project for her Tuesday workshop on Interaction Design and the Semantic 
Web.

I have been working steadily on the archive. I should have reported 
more. (I kept fantasizing about having it being done in the next day.) 
I've added code to retrieve images from directories via URL. I've also 
been reworking the presentation of a photograph and its notes toward a 
blog-style a presentation: the image (with rollovers) followed by both 
annotations and comments thereof listed sequentially below. (Hopefully 
up today??). Here's the page in progress: 
http://w3photo.org/photos/www2003/IMG_4780.FTW

I also now have code that allows for moblog posting from camera phones. 
I recently got back from a conference on camera phones and I can 
emphasize enough the resources that industry is investing in this 
platform.  I'm hoping I can incorporate the moblog code.

There is a marked increased interest in photo annotation this spring 
compared to 2003 or 2002. I'm telling lots of people (and companies) 
about Fotonotes and the W3photo project. The semantic web often comes 
up ... and being able to point  w3photo has been important evidence of 
how rich annotation could easily plug into other efforts.

In short, I think things are really taking off.
