Ralph,

Browsing around the swbp-wg archives, I found this interesting
note:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2004May/att-0003/n-aryRelations.html

We've done some similar writing in the ESW wiki, and we
actually found 3 patterns:

"NaryRelations can be reduced to binary using various patterns:
ArgumentList, CurriedFunction, RecordDescription."
 -- http://esw.w3.org/topic/NaryRelations

RecordDescription is pretty much the same as "Pattern 2".

Perhaps CurriedFunction is like "Pattern 1" but I'm not sure;
I think it's somewhat novel. It's perhaps too obscure
or contrived to recommend as best practice. I like it a lot
but I don't think I have figured out how to explain why.

But I suggest you incorporate ArgumentList. It's quite
straightforward.
