I don't agree with several assumptions you're making along the way,
but I'm happy with where you end up.  URIs are a particularly useful
class of strings because of certain conventions about how they are
used.  Understanding those conventions and establishing new
conventions to allow them to be used sensibly in RDF is both important
and possible.   But I'm still not sure how we'll get there from here.
Maybe a URI task force in the RDFIG?   Maybe something related to some
W3C URI activity; I dunno.

Something where the people involved in the discussion are actually
interested, willing, and fairly committed would help the tone of the
debate, I think.  The fact that most people on the TAG and www-tag
seem to be filled with fear and loathing at any hint of httpRange-14
does not really help the discussion proceed.

Absolutely.  I find rephrasing to avoid using certain
potentially-ambiguous terms to be essential to this discussion.  I
started by avoiding the term 'resource', and I've been toying with
avoiding 'respresentation', 'identify', and URI-as-a-noun (preferring
instead "URI string" which helps remove imagined mystical powers of
URIs).
