If my thesis were identified by that URI, then a GET on that URI might
result in an HTML representation, but the URI would never directly
identify that representation. If it did, I wouldn't be able to change
the representation.  Web pages are a construct resulting from an action
on the resource.

Because resource and representation are separate concepts within
the architecture and visibly different within the implementations,
thus deserving of different identifiers in those circumstances where
the naming authority wishes the representation to be separately
identifiable.

If the representation is identified by the resource URI, then how
does the server differentiate between different representations
of a single resource, particularly in the presence of remote authoring
and content negotiation?
