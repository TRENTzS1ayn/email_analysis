given that a representation of your dissertation is accessible via,

  http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm

I'm not trying to pick nits, but these two statements strike me as 
inconsistent. Would you agree? In which case which of them would you 
reject?

Or would you say that there isn't really an inconsistency here? I can 
see that you might argue that there's a difference between being "on 
the Web" and "existing within the Web", tho' I'd be interested to know 
what criteria such contrast would be based on.
