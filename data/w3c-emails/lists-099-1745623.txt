So when a client requests (using GET) "the HTML document that
describes X", the representation returned is not that document,
but merely a string of bits that represents it?

Yet it seems at other times it's been claimed that when the
resource is something concrete, say ... ME, then the representation
returned may be a document.  So a document can be a
representation, unless the backing resource is itself a document?

You may have guessed that I'm trying to figure out whether
one end or the other of this model is nailed down to something
concrete.  I'd be tempted to theorize that "representation" is
always a "string of bits", except that REST applied outside of
Von Neuman computing wouldn't have representations that
fit that description either.

One thing I'd like you to clarify is that when you say
"identity" or "sameness", are you implying a totality of sameness,
so that between A and B (two names for something that may
be one thing), that if A is identical to B, then there can be no
view from which a distinction can be found?  Or is identity
contextual in the sense that if in the current view(s) there are no
distinctions, then identity is operable?

Either way, it seems as though identities are always going
to be vulnerable to disintegration upon the discovery of new
information or views, but I guess that's okay.

Thanks,

Walden
