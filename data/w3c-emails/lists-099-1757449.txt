I reject that the URI above directly identifies my dissertation.
It is specific to the top of the HTML edition, which means it is
good enough for indirect identification (since there is a N:1:1
relationship between that and my dissertation), but not direct.

I mean that I can mint a URI (I haven't yet) that does have a N:1
relationship with my dissertation (not being representation specific)
and then provide representations of it.  A URI with accessible
representations is how I define "on the Web".

Meanwhile, the HTML and PDF editions of my dissertation are on the Web.
I don't know if this is splitting hairs or not, but it is consistent.
