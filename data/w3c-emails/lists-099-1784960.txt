How do RDF identifiers being http URIs help you with schema
validation?

The URI part of an RDF URIRef has no special status in RDF.  It is
explicitely not the address of a schema or such.  I argued it should
be and lost.

Tag: identifiers are no more dereferncable than than UUIDs.

In all three cases (http, tag, uuid) you have to find your schema (or
whatever) via extra triples (rdfs:isDefinedBy or owl:imports in the
instance data), or some out of band approach (eg google).  

Oh, maybe if you use a non-fragmwnt URI (like dc: and foaf: ) , then
http GET would be sanctioned.   You imagine http GET on dc:title
should get you the schema?

This is about the social meaning of uris, about people agreeing on
what a uri/symbol means.    Isn't it easier to agree on the observable
qualities of a URI than tose which are by definition in someone's
head?
