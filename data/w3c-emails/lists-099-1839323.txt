I plan to use it so I never have to write HTML again. It should also be 
forward-compatible to whatever Advanced XHTML 5.0 idiocy the W3C comes 
up with

Tx, fxd.

It hasn't come up yet it practice. If you really need them, suggest a 
syntax.

No, because no browsers support it.

Well, you have to include them somehow.

Who said it was text/plain?

Can't it be implied with blank #+ lines?

On what basis is it inferior? It seems superior to me in every way. 
It's wysywyg, but it works in your favorite editor. It's easy to write 
and easy to read. You can use diff and such on it and send it to your 
editors for direct proofreading, instead of translating to another 
language and translating back.

Why? SGML is fundamentally broken.

Sure, done.

Fxd.

Why does atx suck? Here's the master plan:

    atx for documents
+ rdf (n3) for data
= no more XML! (bwahaha)
