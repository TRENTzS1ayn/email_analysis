1. There aren't any.
2. People are very attached to their text editors.
3. Text editors are far more common than WYSIWYG editors.
4. WYSIWYG editors are less natural than atx.
5. WYSIWYG editors can't be used with other Unix tools.

atx solves all of these problems, and I don't think it introduces any 
new ones. (Can you think of any it does?)

Yeah, lots of blog coverage.

Yes, you really should upgrade to a UTF-8 compatible system.

Heh!

Alright, alright. To be honest I was considering it. How about:

    If you're a new implementor, you'll be shocked at how badly [822, 
the email
    format] was designed. Extracting even the simplest information from a
    message--the author's address, for example, or the sending date--is
    excruciatingly painful. And I see no sign that we'll ever be rid of 
the
    horrors of 822 syntax; how can we convince users to convert their old
    mailboxes to a sensible new format?
(from Internet mail message header format: http://cr.yp.to/immhf.html)

as a format?

Hm. It should be something like text/plain; format=atx

Header lines with no header.

Oh, I see. Hm. I guess we could do indentation.

It's easy to have Apache do it for you, or just generate it on the fly 
if there's not much load.

HTML _readers_ are widely deployed.

I'm sorry, but I'm not really interested in writing another <p> or

Close enough for RSI.

Can you be more specific by what you mean by decent? I am quite curious.

Well, like XSL-FOs, you can render to a non-semantic language to avoid 
redeploying.

XML has a power-to-the-people principle?
