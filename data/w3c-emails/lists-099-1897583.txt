Just read the beginning.

How you will deal with internationalization?

You start with a:

Double quoting: ``Hello, World!''
and gives for rendering: Double quoting: "Hello, World!"

Except that if I'm in a french context:
The  Double quoting: ``Hello, World!''
must be render as: Double quoting: ? Hello, World! ?
and it will be different in spanish, german, etc.


the thing I do not see, is that what you propose is a kind of "text 
to html2" language. And there's a lot of that already.

What's new?
