How do french speakers typically write ``Hello, World!'' in email? If 
they use French double quotes, then they should continue to use them. 
The conversion is mainly there because American double quotes are very 
difficult to type on American keyboards. (The same is true, I suspect, 
for the commonwealth.)

None of them are very good. I want something good enough to replace 
HTML and XML for writers.
