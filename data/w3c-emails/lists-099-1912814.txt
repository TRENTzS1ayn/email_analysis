Tim, sorry to come in again just before the TAG f2f meeting,
but I was wondering about implementing log:definitiveDocument
and log:definitiveService (they seem like very interesting).
I think that we would, when loading a fact
:p log:definitiveDocument :d.
prepare with a rule
{:p log:definitiveDocument :d. :d log:includes {?s :p ?o}} => {?s :p ?o}.
but we would (while proving)
1/ make sure that ?s and ?o are bound
2/ not look to other :p facts or rules

Is that what is intended with log:definitiveDocument ?
