The most standards compliant one, etc., is probably Amaya.

http://www.w3.org/Amaya/

Most people that I know seem to like it, but I tried it for ages and
didn't get on well with it. Haven't downloaded a recent version for
ages... perhaps they've fixed some of the bugs that annoyed me by now.
Heh, though looking at the bug fixes for 7.2, it seems like they've
got a way to go yet. It's a shame they don't have more resources,
because it's a worthy project.

It'll do CSS. As for RDF, I don't think that any HTML WYSIWYG program
out there will let you do that yet. Unless you do all your assertions
via Annotea :-)

Heh, yep. Now we just need WL in the thread and we'd end up with SWAG
