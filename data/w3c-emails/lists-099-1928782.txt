Honestly? No. Though if there were a decent WYSIWYG editor around, I
think that only item 5 on your list above would be a problem. And I'm
not even sure why that's a problem: there's not really much difference
'twixt "<h1>Blargh</h1>" and "# Blargh" except that the latter is
easier to type. I don't see why diff should care, but you've probably
got specific examples in mind that I haven't thought about. (No need
to supply them.)

Whoo! Yep, that's a good syntax, too. Puts one in mind of chumpy's
[title|URI] syntax.

Whilst I'm on the "[]" syntax subject, I'd just like to say that if I
were using atx, I'd certainly prefer using {} for links instead of []
since I commonly use [] for interpolations. That's tripped me up on
chumpy a couple of times when I've wanted to use interpolations and
they've been interpreted as links.

Feature bloat! :-)

I maintain a lot of HTML files for just me, and I don't tend to use
Apache to serve them up. Could add a menu function to update them, I
suppose. But it's a PITA... oh, or perhaps I could dig up my old
Python text editor and have it auto save as HTML. Heh, that'd be
rather cool: open HTML as atx if it can, and then save it as HTML
again.

Would you believe that I stopped using that editor because the cursor
blink rate was a little too high? That's pretty silly now that I think
about it: it had some good features (could save via FTP, for one;
could easily have added HTTP PUT). But man, that cursor was annoying.
I don't think that TkInter will let one change it.

Dunno what percentage of those are HTML, but still...

I'd still prefer WYSIWYG. A really good editor would even be able to
map "###" to the command for inserting an <h3>, for example (hey, now
there's an Amaya feature request in the making!).

WYSIWYG!

Ew. If you render headings as "big text" and lose the information that
they're headings, how do you expect people to be able to use an
Opera-esque header skipping function, or an overview script? XSL-FOs
should only be sent if requested. If a decent generic hypermedia
language were deployed, I hope that no one in their right minds would
request text/html.
