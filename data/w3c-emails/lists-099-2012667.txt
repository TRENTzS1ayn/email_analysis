Jos,

You do keep up to date!  I hadn't finished writing it up.
But you see cvs changes of course.

  I tried Euler. I wasn't sure how to get the bindings from it.
Or does it just check consistency?  I should go back and find your 
medical
x-ray example.  I just haven't put in the time I should have.

Yes. you have got it.

I think the axiom is in fact (distinguishing between documents and
formulae)

{?p log:definitiveDocument ?d. ?d log:semantics ?d. log:includes {?s :p 
?o}} <=> {?s :p ?o}.

In principle is a  implication both ways (iff)  you can also disprove s 
p o  by showing that the document does not
include it.   cwm doesn't do that, because it doesn't prove things 
false.  (yet - anyway!).

Tim
