The description [1] of w3t-talk says:

  "for anything which (1) is not particularly technical and (2) is 
   ephemeral and does not need to be archived, such as jokes (it is, BTW
archived)."

There is no need to limit w3t-talk to comedy. 

In fact, I would say that most of the things people send to 
w3t-talk aren't funny at all!
