WOWG Editors-
   In the interest of trying to continue to move to LC we would like 
to ask you to prepare a Last Call Candidate for your document by the 
20th of February.  In some cases the LCC can be the same as the WD 
you just released or updated to remove any "@@"s or other lose ends. 
We understand that there may be some last changes to some documents 
after that date, and we will be getting some more reviews, but we 
think having all the near final documents will be valuable in helping 
us to converge on the final details of the language design.
  Thanks for your help in this
  Jim and Guus
