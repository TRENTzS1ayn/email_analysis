oops... that http://www.agfa.com/w3c/euler/etc5-proof.n3
was a bit wrong; it's now 3 times smaller and hopefully
having the correct variable substitutions...

Tim,

W.r.t. those bindings, we have done something like
  explain the substitutions in the proof as
    {... ?s = :a. ?p = :b. ?o = :c. ?s ?p ?o} log:implies {:a :b :c}.
It actually seems as if one can do everything with log:implies (and
conjunction)
or at least a lot...
There are some examples in http://www.agfa.com/w3c/euler/etc5-proof.n3

Jos,

You do keep up to date!  I hadn't finished writing it up.
But you see cvs changes of course.

  I tried Euler. I wasn't sure how to get the bindings from it.
Or does it just check consistency?  I should go back and find your
medical
x-ray example.  I just haven't put in the time I should have.

Yes. you have got it.

I think the axiom is in fact (distinguishing between documents and
formulae)

{?p log:definitiveDocument ?d. ?d log:semantics ?d. log:includes {?s :p
?o}} <=> {?s :p ?o}.

In principle is a  implication both ways (iff)  you can also disprove s
p o  by showing that the document does not
include it.   cwm doesn't do that, because it doesn't prove things
false.  (yet - anyway!).

Tim
