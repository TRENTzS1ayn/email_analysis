That's not true. It takes exactly one dereference of a URI to get the 
REPRESENTATION of the metadata of URI X.

Sometimes, you need a previous URI dereference to know _what_ URI 
identifies the metadata of URI X, but heck, you very seldom care about 
the metadata of URI X without caring about URI X itself, so you are 
going to do two network transactions anyhow.

Furthermore, there is a big problem with the MGET proposal. It does not 
provide a way for a browser to be told that there is metadata available 
with a particular URI. This implies you need a header that says 
"MGET-available: true".

This "autogeneration" is what thousands of marginally skilled CGI 
programmers do every day. Furthermore, the data that comprises the 
metadata lives somewhere. Unless we presume some complicated metadata 
management system, I think that that metadata will live in hand-authored 
text files with names (.metadata.xml) that the HTTP server knows is 
magic (alongside .htaccess and /index.html). Therefore the 
"autogenerated" URI is merely uri/.metadata.xml

You are incorrect. POST _does_ specify a URI in the request. The problem 
is that POST-abuses use the same URI to "tunnel" requests to various 
resources. When SOAP is used to abuse HTTP, you look at the SOAP method 
and one or more parameters to figure out what the "real" object is. 
Similarly, with MGET, you must look at the method to know whether the 
data you see going across the wire is the representation of the resource 
or the representation of the metadata of the resource.
