Not at all.

If that were so, then you could argue that to server multiple
variant representations -- each of which is a distinct resource
separate from that denoted by the URI, and each could have their
own URI -- that you have one URI and many resources at that URI.

The URI only denotes one resource. GET returns a representation
of that resource (*not* the resource) and MGET returns a description
of that resource (*not* the resource). I see no issue.

This has been addressed already in these discussions. If a server
wishes to specify a URI to denote the body of knowledge known
about a given resource, and return that URI to identify that
body of knowledge explicitly, it can. Just as a server is free
to return URIs to denote individual representations returned by
GET. No difference.

Though, if you read my comments to Tim regarding Books vs.
Dictionaries vs. Cards, I think it is likely that even though
folks *could* assign URIs to the body of knowledge known
about a resource by a server, they won't generally want or
need to.

  {URI'} <full:of> shit .

And whatever {URI'} is, is up to the owner of the site hosting
the resource denoted by {URI}. It could be autogenerated according
to some regular transformation of the resource URI, such as
a (very ugly) infix:

   http://example.com/foo             the resource 'foo'
   http://example.com/META/foo        description of 'foo'
   http://example.com/META/META/foo   description of description of 'foo'
   ...

or any other means that the server wishes. It doesn't matter.

True. But the same is true for any resource. The point is that
most folks wont want/need any URI denoting that body of knowledge
explicitly, so why force every server implementation to provide
them. 

How many cards in card catalogues have unique identifiers denoting
the card itself?

No problem. Go ahead. If you have the URI denoting that metadata.

Well, what about representations that are not given explicit URIs
by the server?!

If a PNG representation of a photo is great, but the GIF representation
is crap, and I want to say so, I have no guaruntee that I'm going to
be provided any unique URIs by the server in a response to GET which
explicitly denote those representations.

How is this any different?! It's not.

Perhaps this is a fundamental flaw of the entire Web architecture. Perhaps
every response should have its own unique URI, such as a uuid: URI. After
all, one might want to also say something about each and every response
one might get from a server...
