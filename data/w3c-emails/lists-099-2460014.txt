Exactly.  "meta-html" is still HTML, so should be using the text/html
media type.  Conneg is for handling variability in representations,
not variability in resources.  The latter is what URIs are for.

Re OPTIONS, that's a good example, but it appears to me (as I've used

made of it, an extra round trip was a non-starter.

Re PROPFIND/PATCH, *YES*, GET and PUT should have been used instead.
