I use Accept: application/rdf+xml for now, even it we can't restrict
semantic to a single mime type. (I don't want to open the issue about what
mime type is _really_ ok for a resource, also ;) )

Well OPTIONS is intended to be extensible, may have a body both in request
and reply (even if it is undefined right now) and is mainly about
cummunication options on either the esrver or a specific resource.
But what is communication option? In the light of a HTTP URI, which is to
me an HTTP view of a more generic object, it is metadata of this
particular HTTP view of the resource. Also when you get a representation
of the metadata of a resource you only get a facet of it. How the metadata
of the HTTP view and the HTTP view of the metadata of this object collide?
If they are _clearly_ distinct, then OPTIONS has its use as being part of
a subset specific only to HTTP and accessible only via HTTP means.
