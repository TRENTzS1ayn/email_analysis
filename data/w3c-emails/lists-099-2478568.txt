8-)

But "Accept: application/rdf+xml" says "Send me an RDF representation
of this resource", which is different than "Send me an RDF
representation of the metadata about this resource".  You wouldn't
expect that if "Accept: text/plain" gave you "I'm Dan's car", and
"Accept: image/gif" gave you a picture of the car, that
"Accept: application/rdf+xml" would give you some RDF about the
metadata about the car; you'd expect RDF about *the car* (or
more technically, the state of the car), such as its colour,
its location, its mileage, etc..

RDF gets a bum rap as a "metadata" solution, when it's a perfectly good
data solution.

Some aspect of the protocol in use.

They collide by not being representations of the same resource.  For
one, it makes assertions with the URI ambiguous; are they about the
data or the metadata?  (as has been discussed ad nauseum)

OPTIONS isn't about resource metadata, it's about communication options,
like which methods are implemented.  It could be extended to communicate
WSDL-like stuff, like the acceptable/supported data formats, or other
supported protocols, protocol upgradeability, etc..  None of those
have anything to do with resource metadata, AFAICT.
