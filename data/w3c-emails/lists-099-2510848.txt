I have two responses to this:

1. The various representations say _the same thing_. That's why they are 
multiple representations. But the metadata presumably says something 
different or it would be just another representation. That's the 
argument from theory.

2. To the extent that they do not say the same thing, the fact that they 
live at the same URI actually _does_ cause real-world problems. For 
instance there is the problem of XPointers into resources that only 
return XML "sometimes". That's the argument from practice.

Among other issues, it isn't even clear what the distinction is between 
representation and description.

You think that get7 doesn't apply to this situation, but I was one of 
the people who agitated for get7 and it was exactly this kind of 
thinking that lead to it. "I _could_ assign URIs to stock quotes and 
purchase orders, but I generally won't want or need to."

You're missing the key point that forcing people to give URIs to data is 
a _good thing_ because it allows _other_ people to refer to that 
information later. It is _never_ the right decision to hide information 
without a URI. Yes, this includes representations. In my opinion, every 
represenation should have its own URI and to the extent that this isn't 
enforced in the HTTP specs, it is just a bug.

That's fine. But they should not have the right to prevent me from 
trash-talking their metadata by merely choosing not to give it a URI.

Because it costs little and pays great dividends.

I don't know, I haven't used one in years. But we're trying to build a 
system that is better than a print library. Let's use the tools at our 
disposal.

And if I don't?

You're right. And this is a problem. Let's not perpetuate it. Content 
negotiation isn't used enough for the problem to seem serious but if it 
was, it would.

That isn't useful because the response is ephemeral. Servers have no way 
of giving you "old responses". Nevertheless, the useful bit of this idea 
is in fact captured with the etag construct.
