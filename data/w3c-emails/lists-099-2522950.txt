Please cite any authoritative reference that reflects
that opinion. From what I can see in the authoritative
specs, there is no such constraint that representations
"say the same thing". 

An autogenerated abstract of an 800 page document is
just as valid a representation, according to the specs,
as is a PDF embodying the entire document. As is a JPEG
image of the cover page. As is an HTML document having
the document Table of Contents with links to the
relevant sections.

IMO, there are actually no formal constraints whatsoever
on what a representation might be, and that is why I don't
want my SW agents to depend on representations of resources,
even if those resources are supposedly bodies of knowledge.

But those cases do not violate the specs. They are perfectly
acceptable sets of variant representations.

A simple example (I hope ;-)

An RDF statement

  ex:foo ex:lastModified "2003-01-01"^^xsd:date .

is not part of the resource ex:foo. It is external knowledge
*about* ex:foo. Thus it has no place in a *representation*
of ex:foo (whatever that resource might be).

Thus, descriptive knowledge *about* a resource is not valid
content for any representation *of* that resource.

Now, if ex:foo' denotes the body of knowledge about ex:foo,
then the above statement *would* be acceptable content within
a representation of ex:foo' but not of ex:foo.

Is that clearer?

I'm sorry, but is 'get7' a typo, or are you referring to something 
other than GET?

Fair enough. And this view is fully compatible with MGET. If it
is strongly advised, as a matter of best practice, to always identify
all resources published/managed by a given server, then a server
supporting MGET could explicitly name both the body of knowledge
known about a resource as well as the particular response as well
as any other significant resource relevant to the request.

But users need not know any other URI but that of the resource in
order to get a description of it. Just as they need not know any
other URI but that of a resource in order to get a representation
of it.

There seems to be some kind of presumption that URIs are inextricably
tied to representations and that the only way one can interact with
a server in terms of a URI is to get a representation.

The URI denotes a *resource*. And any interaction with a server is
something indirect and separate from that actual resource. GET
interaction involves representations. MGET interaction involves
descriptions. This is a clean, intuitive distinction. In both
cases there is a *single* URI denoting the resource itself. But
one then specifies by the verb how one wishes to interact with
the server in terms of that URI.

That is a completely separate issue. Please don't confuse the
discussion about the merits of header tags versus new verbs with
this separate (albeit important) issue.

Again, this is a separate issue to that which I have been focusing
specifically on here.

Who ever said I was speaking of a print library? Digital libraries
also have "card catalogues". 

But regardless, the analogy still applies.

Too bad, but that's not a problem with using MGET for accessing
descriptions of resources -- no more so than not getting URIs denoting
each representation (or even each server response) is a problem with
the existing definition of GET.

My point is that this is not a problem with MGET. It is a more general
problem that should be addressed separately.

Just because most servers presently can't doesn't
mean we can't talk about those distinct resources...

Still, again, this is a separate issue, and not a problem with MGET.
