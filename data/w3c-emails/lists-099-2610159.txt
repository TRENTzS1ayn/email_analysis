Hi

I'm experimenting with loading up newsmonster's rdf file into SQL storage
for merging, query etc. It would make things a bunch easier if each 
RSS feed had an rdf:type arc pointing to the class rss:channel, since that 
is how my other code deals with identifying RSS feeds. Any chance you could
tweak your data format to support that? If not, I guess I'll have to check
the dc:format property as well, maybe add in the type properties by hand...

cheers,

Dan
