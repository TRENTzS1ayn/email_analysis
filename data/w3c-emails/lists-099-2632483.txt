Well... As I said earlier, I consider that http:// points to an HTTP view
of a resource, which is already a protocol view of this resource. So
information about the methods supported are indeed part of the same set of
metadata you may expect from this particular view. So it's not "this car"
vs "the car" but what we be retreived is the particular HTTP view of this
instance of a car.

For an HTTP view, it would just be a part of the metadata of this
particular view, even if it is not part of the metadata of the general
resource that will be viewed through this HTTP filter.
