Just asking for an issue doesn't make it one. The WG has agreed
that the chairs get to decide what's an issue and what's not.

Er.. oops, no, that's actually not the case. The chairs just
get to decide when to open issues. hmm...

"Issues are submitted by members of the working group. Such issues are
marked raised. The process for submission is described above.
  * The chair may open an issue, normally assigning an owner."

Jim, you/we need to go back over all the issue requests
we didn't act on and get them added to the issues list. Sigh.
