I am drafting an agenda for the social meaning section.
Where I have got to is:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2003Feb/att-0095/plenary

I would welcome comments at this stage.
From an agenda point of view, one of the scenarios involves a breakout group 
reporting back on Friday, is that OK?

I hope to have frequent straw polls (say at the beginning of each issuette) in 
order to guide the floor control (I suspect primarily to the supporters of 
having any text).

I would welcome Tim's presence at the meeting, since he is one of the key 
customers of this text.
