It's how the works in an informal, human way, but it doesn't seem
amenable to  machine processing.

To rephrase, approach #89 says that the denotation of an http URI or
URI-Reference is EITHER a living-document-like-thing (a maintainable
collection of information) or a domain-of-discourse thing which is the
subject (apparent and/or intended -- that's another issue) of the
document-like-thing.

Consider the RDF graph 
   _:sandro n1:likes <http://www.w3.org/Consortium/>
and assume you know that _:sandro is me.  You don't know if it's
saying I have the "n1:likes" relationship with the web page or with
the consortium.

But then the schema for n1:likes tells you its range is web pages, so
now you know.

But then you come across 
   _:eric n2:likes <http://www.w3.org/Consortium/>
and the range of n2:likes is organizations.   Organizatons and web
pages are disjoint in my ontology, so we have a contradiction.

To generalize, any RDF graph which tries to use the URI as both a
subject identifier and a page identifier (with non-trivial ontologies
for each) will be inconsistent.  This is likely to occur in lots of
real systems, especially as graphs are merged unpredictably.

Do you see a way out of this?
