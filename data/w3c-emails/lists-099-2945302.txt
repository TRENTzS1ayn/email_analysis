Sandro,

Do you have a worked out test case for this, using content negotiation
of an image document, rather than a 'real world vs online stuff' scenario?
I believe many of the same issues arise (w.r.t. '#' etc), but the situation 
is different in that there could be 3 or more different renderings of the 
image. W3C's logo URI is a good example, since you can get at least two 
flavours of it from the same URI.

Happy new year btw

Dan
