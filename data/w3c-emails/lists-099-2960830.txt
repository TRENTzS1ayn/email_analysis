As an aside, I've attached the output of converting my RSS RNGs to XSD via 
Clark's Trang. (Trang is very cool!) These actually work "out of the box" 
with Sun's MSV, and seem to need some tweaks (i.e., explicit schema 
locations) for xerces or xml mind's tools. (I've never gotten W3C's python 
to run locally...)
