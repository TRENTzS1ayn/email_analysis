Hi Edd, Dave,

We're looking into making sure #rdfig discussions have an archive at 
W3C. Probably the easiest thing to do is to agree a schedule for us to 
grab a tar.gz from each of your sites. In theory, the chump is completely 
derrivable; in practice, it'd be a pain to rebuild the site that way. 

Edd, could you re-remind me the url and schedule for your .tar.gz; Dave, do
you have / could you have a similar setup, so a w3c crontab could grab both 
at the same time? Or perhaps the full logs are so much larger than the 
chump logs that we'd need to do things different. Hmm, thinking out loud here!
What do you folks think?

Also I wanted to say thanks for running these invaluable services for the Interest 
Group; your efforts are much appreciated. Please take this offsite logging enquiry as 
an expression of the value that people find in the logs, rather than as an lack of 
confidence in your sysadmin skills, btw...! 

Let me know what you think would be best to do,

cheers,

Dan
