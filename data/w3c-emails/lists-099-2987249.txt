Hi, pardon my butting in...

I just wanted to note that grabbing regular .tar.gz's would use
much more bandwidth than some other more incremental approach.
It would be much more efficient (but slightly more work) to
http-crawl each site and just keep a copy of everything we see,
if that's ok with you.

(I don't know how much more work it is; I think it's fairly easy
to do stuff like this with wget, though I always need to rtfm)
