I'm writing to inform you that the W3C is now using a new software license 
and the link [0] to the W3C Software License found on your site [1] is a 
dynamic one which points to the latest version of our license. 
Consequently, it now refers to the latest version [2] which is intended to 
still be GPL compatible. Thank you.

   This formulation of W3C's notice and license became active on December
   31 2002. This version removes the copyright ownership notice such that
   this license can be used with materials other than those owned by the
   W3C, reflects that ERCIM is now a host of the W3C, includes references
   to this specific dated version of the license, and removes the
   ambiguous grant of "use". Otherwise, this version is the same as the
   previous version and is written so as to preserve the Free Software
   Foundation's assessment of GPL compatibility and OSI's certification
   under the Open Source Definition....
