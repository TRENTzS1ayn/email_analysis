I've copied the following document fro 12\CR back into 06\LC and checked
them in:

entitieswd.dtd
prevwgmb.txt
soap-encoding.xsd
soap-envelope.xsd
soap-rpc.xsd     
soap12-part0.html
soap12-part1.xml 
soap12-part2.xml 
wgmb.txt         
xmlspec.xsl

This is all the files whose version number was greater than 1.1 ( and
therefore had been changed since being copied from 06\LC to 12\CR ).

When I checked each file in I put the entire change log from 12\CR for
that file into the change log comment for the 06\LC check-in.

Yves,

Can you do the necessary boilerplate/entity changes to turn these back
into editor's copies, please? Once you have done that I will put a
change log back into Part 1 and 2.

Gudge
