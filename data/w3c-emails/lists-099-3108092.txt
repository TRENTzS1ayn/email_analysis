Scribe report - discussion of "Reference" document

discussion of role of document (Jeremy, Jim, Jos, MikeD)
  is not a reference, needs name change
  JimH - if we rename and shorten are we in correct space
  Mike, yes, Jos - probably, Jeremy - maybe

discussion of intended audience (same 4)
  JimH - I find it v. valuable for students who are past guide, but 
not needing level of detail of AS&S
  Jeremy - maybe, but then why not increase Guide w/this stuff?
  JimH - not clear, but it would need to be separable at end of Guide 
- it is good because it is short and concise
  Mike Dean - expected order is essentially Feature -> Guide -> This doc -> AS&S

  Discussion of intended audiences goes on in general

  Other roles of document
    Top of document tree  (has the what other documents dispatch)
    Dustbin of stuff that doesn't go elsewhere
     Mime type, Owl.owl
   JimH we use it sort of as our "strunk and white" - not the rules of 
style, but some advice.
    lots of discussion, consensus - not exactly a style guide, but 
more like that then ref

  Jos - we should call it Overview
    (Mike ok, JimH - likes, Jeremy - maybe)

discussion of value of the particulars of things in current document
    Jim shows what the embedding - maybe "scoping?"
   Jeremy - in short, this is the "syntactic rules of graph construction"
   JimH yes, Mike yes, and I could rewrite that way

conclusion (lunch time) -
  change to Overview
  Stress the graph nature
  Mike for example, I will retitle "A class node may have the 
following properties..."
  jeremy, I could probably live with that

(discussion of how much work postponed)
