The Part 1 editorial team have made numerous updates to the spec[1,2].
The remaining list of outstanding items is at[3]. 

We hope to complete the high priority items ( those related to type
systems ) by the end of the weekend. I don't think any of the other
items are on the critical path for publication, that said I may get to
some of them before Monday.

Some new sections are really early drafts which will need expanding
sometime in the future ( e.g. Modularization, QName resolution,
Equivalence ), they are really there to provide a first cut and to
signal direction.

Any questions, just ask.

Regards

Gudge ( for the WSDesc Editors )
