Hi Gudge,

My understanding of the spirit of the decision we made was to support any
type system in the component model but that there would be built-in support
for the XSD type system in addition. If the minutes aren't clear about it
we should ask the group rather than going with your memory vs. mine.

Why do QName references break if we don't have two separate properties? I
cannot grok that; the single types component would have xsdTypes and
xsdElements properties which are what the QNames refer to. So I don't see
why the approach I was taking doesn't work.

Let me finish what I was writing and then let's go back to the group and
decide. I suggest we go ahead and finish this draft and publish with that
structure and change it if needed. Given the nearly 100% change from the
previous draft it'll hardly be a problem to change something so small if
the group agrees.

I got home a few hrs ago- I will try to work on the early tomorrow morning
my time (which will be Saturday night US time) so that we can get this
wrapped up.

Sanjiva.

Sanjiva,

I have not undone anything that you have done.

When did we decide that XML type systems would be treated the same as
everything else? I think we agreed to have XML Schema as a
fully-supported type system and to detail how one might use other XML
based type systems ( which Amy did ) and also to allow other type
systems to play ( by basically using similar mechanisms to those used by
'other' XML type systems ).

At the FTF in VA we agreed that extension elements/attributes ( which
other type systems would have to be ) would annotate the existing
component model with additional properties, as necessary. There was no
suggestions that we would rid ourselves of {element declarations} or
{type definitions} as far as I remember, nor can I find anything in the
minutes. In fact, it stops QName references from working if we don't
have two separate properties. I really think that having a types
component with a single bag of stuff is the wrong approach. I suggest
that other type systems add properties to the definitions component just
like {element declarations} and {type defintions} and defined how
referencing works between the attributes they specify for parts and
these properties ( this is, AFAICT what Amy has done for RelaxNG and
DTDs )

Either way we can't publish today as the types sections are now
incomplete.

Gudge
