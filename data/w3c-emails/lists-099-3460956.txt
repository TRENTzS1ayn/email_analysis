thanks. 

I've made a first hack pass at an RDF output mode, see
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/200301/x2r/ht/a1/po-rdf.nt
(this outputs ntriples rather than RDF/XML, which is beyond my XSLT knowhow).

Main issue is that http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/200301/x2r/ht/a1/rdfOut.xsl
currently hardcodes the URI that I use to give each property name a full 
Web identifier / namespace. I've not disabled the indenting yet either, but it 
does at least now spit out something that could be loaded into RDF systems.

Another simplifying assumption it makes is that we never know the URI for the 
entities in the graph, only their properties. So we don't have to map to 
both URI-labelled nodes and 'blank nodes' (with generated IDs); just the latter 
each time. 

For now I also throw away the datatyping information. This would probably make 
for a good framework for testing RDF's datatyping model during Last Call, btw...

cheers,

Dan
