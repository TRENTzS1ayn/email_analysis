Lost in transit! Could you try re-sending? I didn't see any attachments...

 xsltproc --stringparam group no fopl.html.xsl po-fopl.xml > po.fopl.html

 ...works beautifully :)

I did that for now, for the ntriple generator I just sent (rdfOut.xsl).

However it does seem like knowing a URI for each edge-type / property in the 
graph is something that will be common across many of the output formats. Is the 
required information already in po-mapped.xml?
