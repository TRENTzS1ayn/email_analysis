I think that in 4.1.1 one link (OWL Lite..graph form) should point to
..#OWL_DL_Lite_graphs instead of ..#OWL_Lite_RDF_graphs


I guess that [RFC 2119] should point to the References which could say

  [RFC 2119] Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels
   -- http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt


I think you have made a good wording with
"MAY return Unknown..in the case where a resource limit has been exceeded."
(good idea as well btw ;-))

fine

maybe I've made some cases Full whereas they could have been Lite or DL
(wasn't always sure...)

I think this can move forward (I've also done testing and remain with 7
NP+)
