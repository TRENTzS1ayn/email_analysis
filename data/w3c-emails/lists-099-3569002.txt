Hi Amy,

First of all, my apologies for screwing this up. When I started working on
the draft again I looked at Gudge's edtodo list and picked out the types
stuff because that's something I cared about and liked. I had genuinely
missed your contrib and so I just edited it the way I thought it should be.

So I apologize for screwing up the process.

I ran out of time/steam to finish what I started .. I saw some recent
commits which indicated that Gudge may be wrapping up the editing ..

Jonathan: apologies for not doing my part this time. Gudge, if u can finish
up with Amy's writing too please go for it. I will propose changes later
following proper process if needed.

Thanks,

Sanjiva.

I dislike butting into a conversation which seems primarily between the
editors, but this seems to me to raise a question of process, and as it is
my labor that seems likely to be disregarded, I suppose it is up to me to
register at least an informal question.

At the request of Johnathon Marsh and the rest of the Working Group, I took
on the task of modifying the materials related to schema languages/type
systems.  This material was sent to Gudge, who suggested some
modifications.  It was then published to the list.  It caused relatively
little discussion, and at a subsequent teleconference, it was approved for
inclusion, and Gudge was asked to incorporate the submitted text with some
minor changes.

Since then, it appears that another editor, Sanjiva, has taken on the task
of writing the material anew.  I don't quite understand.  Was the issue
reopened at a teleconference that I missed?  I hope that that's the case,
as otherwise, it seems to me that the process we have in place suggests
that the submitted and approved drafts should first be incorporated, and
then (if need arises) challenged and changed.

I hope that I haven't misinterpreted, particularly by being out of the loop
on a conference call, and I hope that I do not offend by raising the
question of process for the handling of such solicited modifications.

Amy!
