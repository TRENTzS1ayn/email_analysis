RFC 2854:
# In addition, [XHTML1] defines a profile of use of XHTML which is
# compatible with HTML 4.01 and which may also be labeled as text/html.

XHTML1:
# The XHTML namespace may be used with other XML namespaces as per
# [XMLNS], although such documents are not strictly conforming XHTML 1.0
# documents as defined above.
