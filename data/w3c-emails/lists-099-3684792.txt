Hi Friends ,


 I want to Extract the RDF data from the Xml file . CAn any one provide me any solution for it. I have tried the rfdExtractify.xsl   from 


http://www.openhealth.org/RDF/rdf_Syntax_and_Names.htm


but it provides a very big output for a very small file. Is there any  other method for the XML to RDF conversion.


 


Regards 


Amit Khatri
