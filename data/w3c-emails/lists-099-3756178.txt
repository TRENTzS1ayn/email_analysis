that's fine Jeremy
(I couldn't resist to recommit with
-m "restored W3C-WD.css and w3c_home links" ;-))

as you said, the triples coming out of Jena2
don't have a deterministic order and this is
causing quite some fluctuation in the number
of steps that we need to prove some testcases

is there anything to "influence" that order?
(I'm asking this because in our implementation
we have an issue with clause/premis reordering
that we haven't yet resolved)
