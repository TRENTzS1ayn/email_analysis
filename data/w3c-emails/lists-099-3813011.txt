Hi Jim,

I think we should be handling these as issues - we've practiced that bit now - 
I don't have much faith in me and Peter trying to resolve our differences on 
our own.

This is what some issues might look like ...

Peter also silently removed xml:lang from OWL Lite.
(or forget to put it in ...)

==========================

TITLE: rdf:XMLLiteral, xml:lang in OWL Lite

DESCRIPTION:
AS&S does not permit these features in OWL Lite.
These features are critical for I18N; and needed for
addressing multilingual labels as seen in requirement 
[R16/R18 User-displayable labels].
and for including marked up text, such as needed for 
accessability, ruby annotation, or bidirectional text.
There omission also needlessly hampers interoperability 
between OWL Lite, OWL DL and RDF.

TITLE design trade-offs in syntax of OWL DL

DESCRIPTION:
any matching of RDF triples with a DL view is going to have some ugliness 
somewhere. The current AS&S design has prioritised a clean abstract syntax 
and allowed the concrete exchanged syntax to be very difficult to describe, 
test, implement or understand.
An alternative emphasis in the design on a clean characterization of OWL DL in 
RDF graphs, should be explored. This will put some of the ugliness in the 
mismatch into the abstract syntax,

TITLE: annotations

DESCRIPTION:
The annotations permitted in AS&S are:
- not particularly clear quite what is and is not permitted
- appear to have some arbitrary exclusions of certains rdfs properties
- break semantic layering
- appear to permit user defined annotations, without providing any mechanism 
for defining them

This issue is to resolve the syntax and semantics of annotations and their 
interaction with the rest of the ontology (if any).
