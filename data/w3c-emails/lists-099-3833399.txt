You've misunderstood what I'm talking about, which make me wonder if you 
read http://www.w3.org/2002/11/dbooth-names/dbooth-names_clean.htm too 
quickly. The section 
http://www.w3.org/2002/11/dbooth-names/dbooth-names_clean.htm#OneURLAndFourThings 
explains what I mean by these "four kinds of things".  I would be grateful 
for any feedback on what parts of that document you find unclear, because 
I'd like to improve it.

Yes, but I'm a little puzzled that you seem to be questioning this 
assertion, since the "different context" approach just means that something 
other than "different names" is being used to prevent ambiguity, so my 
assertion is clearly a tautology.  Were my descriptions of the "different 
names" and "different context" approach unclear in 
http://www.w3.org/2002/11/dbooth-names/dbooth-names_clean.htm ?  Again, I 
would very much appreciate specific feedback on any unclarity.

You seem to be implying that I shouldn't try to use "#foo" to refer to both 
the car and the picture of the car.  That's true enough.  But the point is 
that it's very helpful (and "good practice" according to the TAG), that if 
you're using a URI to identify something that does not exist directly on 
the Web (such as a car), you should place a document at the end of that 
URI, which describes the thing that you're using that URI to identify.   In 
TimBL's example, that document is a picture of the car.  The car and the 
picture are two different things.  Yet somehow I should be able to make 
unambiguous statements about either one.  For example, I should be able to 
make two statements of the form:

       X #is #beautiful
       Y #is #beautiful

(where X and Y represent some kind of designation involving the URI) and be 
unambiguously referring to the car in the first statement, and the picture 
of the car in the second statement.
Therefore I need a way to distinguish which one I mean when I make a 
statement.  There are two ways that can be done -- different names or 
different context -- and they have different pros and cons.

Sandro proposes some specific conventions[7] for making this 
distinction.  You may already have conventions that you like (such as the 
use of FragIDs), which may be why you don't think this is an issue.  Any 
convention must use either the "different names" approach or the "different 
context" approach (or even a mixture).

Again, I'd be very grateful if you could point out what parts of 
http://www.w3.org/2002/11/dbooth-names/dbooth-names_clean.htm are unclear 
in explaining this issue.
