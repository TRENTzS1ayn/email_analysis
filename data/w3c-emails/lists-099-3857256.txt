It's unclear whether you're talking about a string that conforms to the 
*syntax* of a URI (as specified in RFC2396) or a string that conforms to 
the *semantics* of RFC2396 (where "conforming to the semantics" of RFC2396 
means that the string denotes one particular thing).

It sounds to me like Bill is saying that

         http://x.org/MyCar

might mean the car in one context or language, and the picture of the car 
in another, which will always be true, because you *always* have to know 
the language in order to determine the meaning of *any* statement.

So it sounds to me like Bill is talking about a string that conforms to the 
*syntax* of an RFC2396 URI, while you are talking about a string that 
conforms to the syntax *and* (what you believe to be) the semantics of an 
RFC2396 URI.

Is that correct?
