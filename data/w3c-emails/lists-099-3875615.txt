Yah, I've had a look through that.  It's pretty thorough, though I
believe the premise to be incorrect; there need be only one kind of
"thing".

Of the three kinds of things you've identified (I don't include "name"),
what's common about them all that we can break out into a new, more
general model?  Each has identity, and encapsulates some state.  Agreed?

So with this new model, those three previously disjoint things can be
unified.  This model, the REST model, says that;

- the concept of love is a "resource", an abstraction
- resolving an identifier for the concept of love will end up as a GET
request on some Web server/proxy (just to bridge with your "Web location").
- the resolution of that identifier will return documents that represent
the resource

The REST model is the most appealing of the models I've seen presented,
as it seems to be at least as powerful(*) as TimBL's, plus it's more
general, since http: URIs would be able to identify anything; love,
cars, people, etc..

(*) the implementation would need work to match TimBL's model, ala an
HTTP extension header called "ConceptualWork" whose value is a URI.
But the model seems adequate, if only because this extension is
possible.
