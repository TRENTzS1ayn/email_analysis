there's an update of some part of the master thesis of Guido Naudts
http://www.agfa.com/w3c/2002/02/thesis/An_inference_engine_for_RDF.html

in there Guido also found that euler's anti-looping mechanism
will stop even for an infinite number of looping paths:
*Infnite Looping Path Lemma* if the closure graph G'
is not infinite and the resolution process generates an
infinite number of looping paths then this generation
will be stopped by the anti-looping technique and the
resolution process will terminate in a finite time.

the Python version is still in progress...
