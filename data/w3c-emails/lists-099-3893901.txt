My current belief is that this would capture it - I was reviewing the
requirements doc and note that the statements about statements requirement
is only met in OWL Full - I am happy with that but if we are back to the
issue phase you would be wise to prompt (Mike?) whoever wanted this as to
whether they feel the requirement is met (in OWL Full). (Like we have done
for some of our other requirements).
