Dan,

Two small commewnts on the RDF Schema spec:

> 2.3 rdfs:Literal
> 
> ..
 >
 > rdfs:Literal is a subclass of rdfs:Resource.

Is this correct? I thought rdfs:Literal was not a resource.
This is also what rdfs.rdfs states.

> 3.2 rdfs:domain
> 
> [..] >

> The rdfs:range of rdfs:domain is the class rdfs:Class. 
 > This states that any resource that is the value of an
 > rdfs:domain property is an instance of rdfs:Class.

This leaves open the possibility that rdfs;Literal
(an instance of rdfs:Class)  can be defined as a domain.
Is this intended?

Guus
