Yes, exactly.  

Without that, we're left with only the tedious and error prone
rdfs:isDefinedBy and owl:imports.  If that's all you have, there's
absolutely no reason to use http URIs.  This is why I proposed tag
URIs, to make this clear.  In fact, tag URIs suck -- because you can't
click on them.
