Sorry about this. I didn't actually want to make a formal LC comment; it 
were more like two points where I wanted to check my understanding. 
These came up when we upgraded our tools to the new RDF spec (so really 
outisde the scope of my Webont co-chair role).
I only use www-archive to have a reference, if needed in the future.

See below for specific points.

With rdfs.rdfs I meant the "RDF Schema in RDF/XML" in Appendix A:

<rdfs:Class rdf:about="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#Literal">
   <rdfs:isDefinedBy
rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#"/>
   <rdfs:label>Literal</rdfs:label>
   <rdfs:comment>The class of literal values, eg. textual strings and 
integers.</rdfs:comment>
</rdfs:Class>

If I understand you correctly, a "subClassOf Resource" statement should 
be added to this definition of Literal. We noticed it because it now 
turns up as an "orpajn" node in our RDFS subclass tree.

My confusion came from my intuition of resources and literals being 
disjoint. Having reread section 3.3.1 in the Semantics doc ("A note 
anout rdfs:Literal"), I now understand the spec. It could be worthwhile 
to add a explanatory note in the Schema document, because I guess other 
people might get confused in the same way.

My confusion stemmed from the same source, namely that literals cannot 
be objects in RDF statements, thus allowing them as a rdfs;domain  is 
counterintuitive. Again, the note in Semantics explains this.

Not really. The notion of Individual in OWL is much restrictve. You 
could of course define a subclass of Resource such as 
NonLiteralResource, but this would involve careful checking of the 
metamodel.
