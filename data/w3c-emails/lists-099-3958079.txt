To say that something is a URI indicates that it conforms to everything 
indicated in trhe URI spec, syntax and semantics.  This doesn't 
normally need to be said. If I send you
an RFC822 mail message, or an HTML4.0 file, this doesn't  mean I am
just sending you something syntactically constrained.
