[I'm really torn about what list to cc.  This just seems too trivial
for www-rdf-rules.]

I finally sat down to try to merge my change to the September version
of cwm, and I see retest.sh doesn't work any more.  I found retest.py,
and that look great, but...

Tests 4, 6, and 50 fail for me (on a fresh cvs tree).  They appear to
be missing some files, perhaps you forgot to cvs add them?

They are:

   /devel/WWW/2000/10/swap/test/includes/quant-implies.n3
   /devel/WWW/2000/10/swap/test/xml-syntax/in-xml.xml
   ref/no-last-nl.n3

Meanwhile, just for kicks, I tried running the tests out of
/devel/..., and still losts on tests 20, 21, and 22, which still fail
(just as they used to) with diffs like:

-            <rdf:_1 rdf:resource="/home/ndw/.xmlDate.rdf#id166"/>
+            <rdf:_1 rdf:resource="../../../../../../../../../ndw/.xmlDate.rdf#id166"/>

I remember looking at the code there once and being baffled.  Perhaps
I'll take another crack at it.
