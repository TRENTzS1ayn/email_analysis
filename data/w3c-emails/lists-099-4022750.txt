Huh? MIME type registry calls out the HTTP spec?
Perhaps you meant that the URI spec calls out
the URI scheme registry, which calls out the
HTTP spec.

But actually, the URI spec, RFC 2396, says
nothing about IANA nor a registry.

Perhaps you meant to include RFC2717 in "the URI spec".
  http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2717.txt

But you're asking a lot of your readers when you
leave all this implicit.

Anyway, all this is minor compared to...

> The HTTP spec says it identifies a network information object.

... which begs the question again: which part of the HTTP
spec says that? Ah; that has a reasonably straightforward
answer:

  The "http" scheme is used to locate network
  resources via the HTTP protocol.
  -- http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec3.html#sec3.2.2

But it's not at all clear that 'network resource'
is a synonym for doc:Work.

OK, I think I see your argument now, but you're asking
a lot of your readers when you leave all this
implicit.

I suggest you slow down and explain the chain of reasoning.

I have a lot of shared context with you, and I read your
message as saying

<rfc2396> log:includes {
{ ?x log:uri ?u. 
?u  string:match "^http://[^#]$" } =>
{ ?x rdf:type doc:Work } }.

which is plainly false.

The actual argument is much more subtle.

Hmm... might be fun to formalize the actual argument
and have Euler spit out the proof.
