Hi,

It would be very helpful if there was an option for the RDF/XML output
allowing to specify a style sheet to be added in a PI at the top.
For instance,
cwm toto.n3 --rdf --stylesheet=foo.xsl
would output a PI as follows at the top of the output:
<?xml-stylesheet href="foo.xsl" type="application/xml"?>

[I don't know how the mandatory MIME-type of the style sheet should be
specified; probably need another option].

The usefulness of such an option is that since I use CWM to generate RDF
files that I publish, being able to have these files more widely
readable thanks to a style sheet would be cool (of course, I could do it
with an XSLT, but that makes one more step).

Note that the option could be repeated several times, since there can be
several style sheets PI.

Thanks,

Dom
