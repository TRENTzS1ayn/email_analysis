Has this been done already?

I don't know what a direct description or an implicit description are.

Well, my view is on this is precisely that OWL Lite and OWL DL processors
should not have to do XML canonicalization, or understand anything about
XML documents.  If there is a way of keeping rdf:XMLLiteral under these
conditions I would like to hear about it.

Agreed.

Also, there has to be an easy way of distinguishing annotations from other
stuff.

More or less.

Annotations are already possible on individuals.

My view on the semantics of *annotations* (except imports) is that they can
be no more than isolated triples.  I would, of course, prefer no meaning.
RDF(S) compatible means a *very* heavy meaning for annotations.

Agree to disagree.  Good luck implementing social semantics.  :-)
