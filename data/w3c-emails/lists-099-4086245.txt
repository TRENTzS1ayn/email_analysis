Following guidance to the editors is from the IRC (where David asked us to 
find it):

<DavidF> Noah (& eds): re. SL's question in issue #405, we have decided 
that SOAP 1.2 is a single spec in 3 parts. Two of those parts (1 and 2) 
are "primary", and the third (Part 0) is informative. We will check the 
documents to ensure the language referring to the "specification" is 
consistent with the fact of it being a single spec.

and

<JacekK> ACTION 8=Editors to treat remaining content of Issues 405-408 as 
editorial at their discretion and to respond to Susan on the resolution.
