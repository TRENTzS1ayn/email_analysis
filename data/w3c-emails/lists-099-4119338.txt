No. They were created on different dates - for example.
The conceptual work people loosely call a web page is very real.
Its not a mystifying concept. Its what people actually refer to.
Kids are taught to be critical of it, ask who wrote it and what
their incentives are.   ("Conceptual work" is a cyc name in the cyc
public ontology, by the way - that's where I got it from.)
But the concept is actually common for anyone who uses the web.
