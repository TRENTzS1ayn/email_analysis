Hi Dan

I think my doc is ready - but I am not sure, and I need to get to bed.

It's at

http://www.w3.org/2002/03owlt/editors-draft/snapshot

The zip files that go with it are:

http://www.w3.org/2002/03owlt/approved.zip
http://www.w3.org/2002/03owlt/proposed.zip

It reports a huge load of broken links cos the link checker can't read RDF.

There are very many references to peter's editos draft, that need to be 
updated wuth the magic URL. Similarly some refs to the other docs listed with 
the wrong date (guide?).

Jeremy
