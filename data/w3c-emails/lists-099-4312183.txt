Martin,

Sure, but this starts to look like "overloading" to me.

I think these are exactly two cases that might be best handled separately.

The trouble with recommending namespace declaration sis that they apply 
*only* for properties.  rdf:ID, rdf:about and rdf:resource don't recognize 
qname syntax (much as we might wish they did ... RDFcore slightly 
considered this and decided it was out-of-charter).
