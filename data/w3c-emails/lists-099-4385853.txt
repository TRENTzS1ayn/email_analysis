I was just trying this with the online w3c xslt service, output is:
http://www.w3.org/2000/06/webdata/xslt?xslfile=http://www.w3.org/2003/02/colour-xml-serializer.xsl&xmlfile=http://rdfweb.org/people/danbri/rdfweb/danbri-foaf.rdf

...it seems to perform the right kind of translation, but the resulting markup
doesn't show as styled html in any of my browsers. Any idea what's going wrong?
Your RSS example looks fine btw in all the browsers, and the markup appears 
superficialyl to be bhthe same....
