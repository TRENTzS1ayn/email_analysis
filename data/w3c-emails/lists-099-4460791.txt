Is that supposed to be "his" or "this"?  I find Patrick Hayes' approach
far more plausible on "let it break" as he seems to start out _without_
the Platonic pretensions.  If it's "his" I agree here, but it doesn't
seem coherent with the following sentences.

I don't think most people expected URLs to morph into the philosophical
demilitarized zone of URIs.  From my perspective, the philosophy isn't
the fault of your opponenents - it's the necessary consequence of the
entire URI approach, especially as it enters new arenas for which it's
not clear it's appropriate.

It was tough for readers to argue with URLs.  It's very very easy for
readers to argue with URIs, especially when those URIs move between
contexts.

I think you've wandered miles from that, to say the least.  You may
think you're proposing the same thing, but in fact you're building an
enormous system of pieces which don't accept breakage easily - and then
saying "well, it may not always conform to reality, so hopefully people
will fix it."

I think you need to start from broken/breakable rather than pretend it's
just not broken.  Adding exception handling after the project is
complete doesn't make any sense to me.
