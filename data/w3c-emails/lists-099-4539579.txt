I agree with Stuart - I don't see any case for these being wrong.

In particular, Dublin Core is not going to change it's namespace or
URIs, so we have to use that to use the Dublin Core title element.
(Although I think Eric arranged DC to use the server trick of
redirecting from a slash URI to a hash URI)

I've read the wiki stuff and remain unconvinced that putting # at the
end of namespace URIs will have any technical benefit.  Maybe only
socially if people somehow feel they are "different" URIs.
