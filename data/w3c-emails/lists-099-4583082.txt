Hi Jos, Dan, Sandro,

this e-mail tries to explain how to generate the bits to publish for the OWL 
Test.

0) Use unix (I use Linux)

1) follow
http://www.w3.org/2002/03owlt/editors-draft/INSTALL
http://www.w3.org/2002/03owlt/editors-draft/README

2) Near the top of 
 wowg/jsp/main.jsp
 there is the date and status information e.g.
[[
<%!
// Date on the OWL and RDF documents (including this one)
// Note months counts from 0, e.g. 7 is August, 0 is January
GregorianCalendar owlPubDate = new GregorianCalendar(2003,7,6);
GregorianCalendar rdfPubDate = new GregorianCalendar(2003,0,23);

// levels of OWL and RDF docs - one of "WD", "CR", "PR", "REC"
String owlStatus = "CR";
String rdfStatus = "WD";
]]

indicates that the OWL docs are in CR published on the 6th AUgust, and the RDF 
docs are WD published on 23 Jan. These can be changed and all dependent 
changes should just happen (i.e. the references should not need further 
attention).


3) on the page
http://localhost:8080/wowg/jsp/update.jsp
There is a button "Working Drafts" 
clicking on this generates the documents

4) then (on unix)
cd WWW/2002/03owlt/editors-draft/draft/

5) use ls -l to check that the dates on the many files have been updated
 (I have had a hesienbug that sometimes makes the xslt do nothing)

6) ../../bin/stripsaxon

7) cvs commit

Jeremy
