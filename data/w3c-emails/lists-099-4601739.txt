1. I point you to a whole ontology - check the cyc classifications.

2. Nothing.  They are all conceptual. Only things which convey 
information
are works, in the sense of opus, oeuvre, something which decreases 
entropy
and hence takes energy to create.

I make no untestable statements about whether they are discovered or 
created.
But I do distinguish them from for example an RDF schema, which has 
content
and can be represented in RDF/XML or N3, can be copyright, etc etc.

Could you manage a transition to one in which you use  a hash, please?
It is going to be easier to fix it now than later.
