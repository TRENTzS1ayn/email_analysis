There's the basis of a distinction there, although the connection with 
the HTTP URI scheme naming policies is pretty weak.

For FOAF, we could probably pull the switcheroo now with a fair amount
of annoyance for implementors. But FOAF files also use Dublin Core,
RSS1, MusicBrainz, XMP etc namespaces, all of which are named with a
'/'. Also they use my wordnet namespace...

The wordnet case is trickier. We have a namespace with 50,000 terms
(classes) in it, named like http://xmlns.com/wordnet/1.6/Tree and 
dereference-able. There is no obvious parallel design with a # that
allows both (a) reasonably intuitive end-user markup in the instance
data and (b) terms to be individually derferenceable to something
useful and smaller than the entire multi-megabyte dictionary. 

Do you really think it's worth pulling the rug out from under the feet
of 80%+ of RDF early adopter vocabularies? Just as things are starting
to take off... Seems risky to me, for a somewhat academic point... If we
do it we'll need a damn good explanation for the disruption.
