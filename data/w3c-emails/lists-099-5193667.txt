Brian- OWL is handling our LC comments differently than RDF did, not 
breaking up messages into smaller pieces and parcelling these out -- 
makes our issue tracking easier for us (i.e. see [1] - Dan's 
automated issue tracker using RDF)
  However, while this has made it easier for us, it doesn't always 
make it easier for the people expecting comments to track what we've 
answered - so I took an action to email this to you (and you are 
welcome to forward in public as needed) to make sure we don't miss 
any of the LC comments from RDF Core.

1 - We believe that the email:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webont-comments/2003Jun/0011.html
responds to all but two of the issues raised in
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webont-comments/2003May/0004.html

The two not addressed are #owlref-rdfcore-owl-rdf-semantics
and #owlref-rdfcore-class-ontology

We will get you comments on these soon, but would appreciate your 
letting us know if the rest are addressed to the group's satisfaction.


2 - We believe that the email
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webont-comments/2003May/0052.html
is answered in
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webont-comments/2003Jun/0027.html

please let us know if this answer is satisfactory

3 - We believe that the email
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webont-comments/2003May/0053.html
(and its related thread) is answered in
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webont-comments/2003Jun/0037.html


please let us know if this answer is satisfactory

4 - We believe that the email
http://www.w3.org/mid/Pine.GSO.4.44.0305091706010.13980-100000@mail.ilrt.bris.ac.uk
was answered in two parts:
http://www.w3.org/mid/20030530.142215.40541163.pfps@research.bell-labs.com
and
http://www.w3.org/mid/20030530.142215.40541163.pfps@research.bell-labs.com

Please let us know if this answer is satisfactory


-----
Summarizing - we think we've answered all but two of your comments: 
(owl-ref-rdfcore-owl-rdf-semantics and owlref-rdfcore-class-ontology)
and look forward to hearing as to whether these answers appropriately 
address the issues raised.

  Thanks much
  Jim H.
