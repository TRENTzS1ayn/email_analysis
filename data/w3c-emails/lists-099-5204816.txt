My reading of that part of the semantics document is that it is not 
presuming any particular definition of xsd:string -- that comes from XML 
schema datatypes.  If XML schema datatypes were different, then the 
entailment might not hold:  it is not the place of the RDF semantics 
(alone) to define the entailment or non-entailment in this case.

That said, the text you mention may be viewed as less than helpful.
