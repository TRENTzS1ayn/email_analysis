I have got as far as what shows up on

http://owl.mindswap.org/2003/arbitrary/class.shtml?class=http%3A%2F%2Fowl.mindswap.org%2F2003%2Fsubmit-rdf%2F186.rdf%23owlClosedComment

which adds some info to what you have - it adds what the thread was 
about, and it adds what kind of action we took - things that have to 
be inserted by hand - but increase the quality of our comments.
  I want to change the owlC:ClosedType to be the class for each 
comment, because then I can merge the above with
http://owl.mindswap.org/2003/arbitrary/class.shtml?class=http%3A%2F%2Fowl.mindswap.org%2F2003%2Font%2Fowlweb.rdf%23owlComment

  and the comments would show up in the right places.

  I'm willing to continue doing the work of tracking the type of 
closing and adding a more mnemonic comment, and then we use cwm to 
produce a final document at the end.

  btw, you might be able to scrape my RDF more directly from the 
attached HTML file which is generated from the excel spreadsheet I 
created to help me track this on my own...


  -JH
p.s. The attached RDF is what I'm generating - but there's some 
namespace problems so I cannot map everything into the hierarchies I 
want - gonna get some help w/this tomorrow.
