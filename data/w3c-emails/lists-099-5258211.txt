Hi Herman

this is a personal msg, and not on behalf of RDF Core.

I would find it helpful to understand your opinion and/or Peter's concerning 
an informal discussion between some members of RDF core concerning how to fix 
the bug you detected.

This is minuted in:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Jun/0154

Summary:
**
The current design has extensional definitions of subClassOf and
subPropertyOf.
...
This could be changed to intensional definitions
...
transitivity and reflexivity can be achieved by fiat:
...
permit
semantic extensions to add back in the extensional reading of subClassOf and
subPropertyOf.
**


I cc this message to www-archive, feel free to copy any response to any 
appropriate mailing list.

thanks

Jeremy
