Well, this would amount to making a substantial change to a normative part
of the RDF Semantics in response to a bug in an informative part of the RDF
Semantics.   From a process point of view this seems to me to be
exceedingly strange.  

As far as the change itself goes I have no opinion on whether it is a good
change or not.  However, if this change were to be made changes would have
to be made to the OWL Semantics, either to put back in the extensional
flavour of subClass and subProperty, just as is currently done for domain
and range, or to use OWL versions of subClass and subProperty, as was done
for DAML+OIL.  I believe that either of these approaches would have to be
voted on by the WebOnt WG.
