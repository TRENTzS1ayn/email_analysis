Hi,
      I am having a HTML file with 2 frames(main.html). On clicking a link in the left frame, a XML/XSL file should open in the right side frame. I have implemented this.
      In the XML/XSL file, there are internal links. When i click on any of the internal link, it takes me to the particular location and on clicking back button, the main.html gets loaded instead of going back to the location of the internal link.
How should I implement this.
  I am using IE6 and Windows 2000. I am attaching the files for your reference
Thanks in Advance
Anand Kumar
