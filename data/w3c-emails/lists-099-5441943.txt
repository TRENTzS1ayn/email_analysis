[resend, sorry; I forwarded the wrong message last time.]

Hi,

I just joined a couple listbox lists, and the process is very nice
but the confirmation process misuses HTTP GET: fetching a URL should
not have side effects like confirming a mailing list subscription.

Could you please change it to use HTTP POST instead? (the URL can
display a simple web form that the user posts to confirm.)

Further reading on GET vs POST:
