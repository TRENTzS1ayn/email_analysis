Not done. I expect we'll discuss this more.

No change.

Changed to "depend on DNS and IANA"

Moved to future directions and edited.

Cleaned up.

Deleted last 2 sentences, moved to future directions, added references
to TAG issues.

Fixed (I think).

Change notion of "same" to "compatible".

I added reference to draft get7 finding since one point to
emphasize is value of URI addressability and its relation to
metadata outside the URI (i.e., choice of access mechanisms).

No change to "meaning of the resource." I think we'll need to
discuss that. [Dan and I have discussed this somewhat already,
but the phrase "meaning of the resource" is frequently used
in the arch doc.]

Done.

Fixed.

Fixed.

Not added.

Yes, I elaborated with more specs.

Done.

Done. Also improved dfn of unsafe.

Not done.
