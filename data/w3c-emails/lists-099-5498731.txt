You earlier commented on the RDF Core Last Call working drafts, particularly 
on the design of XMLLiterals.

This message concerns those comments, listed as:
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#reagle-01
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/20030123-issues/#reagle-02
and

"Confusion about wrapping of XMLLiteral"
which did not get an issue number assigned.

While contemplating various last call issues RDF Core WG has simplified the 
design of typed literals, particularly XMLLiteral, by removing the language 
tag.

This permits addressing:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JanMar/0434
Confusion about wrapping of XMLLiteral by simply removing the wrapper 
altogether.

The resolution to modify the design was decided on 09th May 2003
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003May/0138.html
and reads:
RESOLVED: Typed literals option 4 from msg 0086

which refers to
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003May/0086
[[
> Option 4:
> Language tag is simply dropped from all typed literals including
> rdf:XMLLiteral
>
>

PROPOSE
  Concepts is changed to say that a literal can have either a datatype or a
language tag and not both.
  rdf:XMLLiteral datatype is changed to have the identity as its lexical
value mapping (no wrapping), with consequential change to the value space of
rdf:XMLLiteral.
  Other editors to make consequential changes.
]]
we further clarified (20th June) that "the identity" was over-simplistic, and 
the value space remains a set of exclusively canonicalized XML,
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Jun/0156.html

The new text defining XML Literal can be found in the editors draft at:
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/TR/WD-rdf-concepts-20030117/#section-XMLLiteral


Please note that the I18N-WG have made a comment criticizing this decision:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2003Jun/0023.html
which the RDF Core has not officially yet agreed a response (although we have 
spent more than an hour of telecon time on it, with still a majority opposing 
further changes). 

I will update you on any further changes (well I hope not!).

Please let us know, copying www-rdf-comments@w3.org if:
Joe:
- these changes make the previously confusing decisions acceptable
- if you find these changes address
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-comments/2003JanMar/0434
"Confusion about wrapping of XMLLiteral"
in an acceptable fashion
