Dan, I believe I will completely follow
you in your reasoning.
As you might know, we have been struggling
with [...] as functional terms and then
using ...^^... as functional terms
and one of the reasons was that in order
to do backward chaining we thought we
needed to rewrite the existentials in the
conclusion as skolem functional terms
when we wanted to have horn style logic
(single triple conclusions).
While playing with substitutions I now
think that there is no more need for
such functional terms; for instance
in case of
  {?x :b ?y} => {?x :k _:u . _u :m ?y}.
we could simply rewrite that as
  {?x :b ?y. ?u = (:sf ?x ?y)} => {?x :k ?u}.
  {?x :b ?y. ?u = (:sf ?x ?y)} => {?u :m ?y}.
That seems to do the job; just make sure...
Also as you and TimBL have been evidencing
interpretation properties are perfect, so all
we need are just triples, plain conjunctions,
implications and all using just uris, bnodes
(which turn into univars in premises/queries)
and strings and that's it. I think I could
drastically simplify euler in that respect...
