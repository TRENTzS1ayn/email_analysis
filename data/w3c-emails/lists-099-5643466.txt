Dan, while testing the case mentioned in
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2003Mar/0001.html
i.e. wether

:a :b :c.
{?x :b ?y. ?u = [:sf (?x ?y)]} => {?x :k ?u}.
{?x :b ?y. ?u = [:sf (?x ?y)]} => {?u :m ?y}.

entails

:a :k _:v.
_:v :m :c.

I found that cwm wasn't --think'ing that

:a :k [...


I then added (the tautological)

[:sf (:a :c)] = [:sf (:a :c)].  ## needed for cwm

and then it was OK
    :a     :b :c;
         :k  [
             :m :c;
             :sf  (
            :a
            :c  );
             =  [
                 :sf  (
                :a
                :c  ) ] ] .


(maybe I'm working in the wrong direction
but I'm desperately looking to get rid of
my messing with functional terms but keep
the benefit of single triple conclusions)

PS tested with a previous cwm as the latest cwm on my laptop gives
