OK, I've swept Part 2[1] and the encoding schema[2]. Here are the diffs
as I see them:

1.The schema contains an attribute declaration for a 'root'
attribute, which the spec never mentions

2.The schema contains an element and type for a 'Struct' element,
which the spec never mentions.

3.The schema contains an element and type for an 'Array' element,
which the spec never mentions.

I would also note that many of the types that we derive from built-in
schema types don't work when incorporated into a soap encoded graph.
This is because we state that outbound edges that are a second reference
to the same node have a ref attribute and no content. Problem is, no
content is not a valid lexical rep for, xs:int, for example. This means
schema validation, if done, will fail. I do have a fix that's based on
unions if people are interested.
