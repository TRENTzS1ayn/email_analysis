This is a request from the W3C XMLP WG for information about status of
implementations of nodeType functionality. The WG would like to know
answers to the following questions:

A)Are you going to implement nodeType?

B1)If the answer to A) is 'Yes', can you please give a rough idea
of when this feature would be implemented.

B2) If the answer to A) is 'No', can you please give a rationale for
why you do not intend to implement this feature?

Regards
