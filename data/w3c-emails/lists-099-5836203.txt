No, this debate does *NOT* turn on the software reading the specs.

To situate RDF and OWL within the real world, you rely on particular 
vocabularies
which are processed by software which has been written by a human being 
who
has read the spec.   Open Financial Exchange bank statements are 
generate inside
a bank by a programmer who has read the OFX spec and understands what 
the
fields mean. On the consumer's side, on your desktop, the document is 
read by
software (such as Quicken) which was written by people who read or even 
wrote the
OFX spec.  (OFX is actually a SGML application but it could be an RDF 
application
and the RDF mapping is straightforward) If you as a use  RDF rules to
make a USA income tax return from that data, then you generate info in
in a vocabulary of IRS Form1040 line numbers.
The meaning of these fields are defined in a human-readable document 
which is
online.  The rules which you might use to classify your spending and 
income
maybe written in OWL and the data may be processed by an inference 
machine.

Specification-wise, the inference engine is only authorized to make 
those
inferences because the OWL predicates, when looked up, point to the
OWL spec.  The inference engine was not written by a computer program,
it was written by a person who read the english OWL spec.

Well, the english definition of the property is what we have. It 
includes reference to some
mathematical stuff in the spec,but i'd note that the model theory is 
invoked by the
english, when you look at how this spec gets its authority, not the 
other way around.

For formal stuff, there is a mapping   from ?x to ?x.log:semantics 
which is common (modulo real world
effects such as power outages, lying and cheating, etc)  to both users.

For most software today, such as Quicken or Microsoft Money or Apple 
iCal, the spec
has been read by a programmer who made the code.

Actually, this applies to OWL inference engines.  They can be 
considered, from the web point of view,
just RDF systems which have been programmed to have an inherent 
knowledge of the
meaning of certain terms.  This allows them to do certain things on my 
behalf.

Well, my Stack article outlines them. They are in fact defined by a 
rather large pile of specs.
RDF's job is only to be a relatively simple link in the chain.

They haven't been written up formally, but in the special case of an 
RDF document,
the RDF spec should tell you what an RDF document tells you about the 
referent.

Well, the MT, while central for you, is in fact a rather peripheral 
(though indeed useful) part
of all this. The RDF spec should tell me to go look in the spec of the 
predicate
to find out what   p owl:inverse q  means.  I go and look up the 
owl:inverse, get eth OWL spec.
It is a bunch of english and RDF which refer to each other, and the 
english bits
refer to the MT.  A programmer can then write code which will output    
a p b given b q a
because he understood  the spec with the help of the model theory.

That's the state of the art. When we can pick up (in the RDF bit) 
axioms for the new terms,
then the state of the art will advance a bit, and some of the 
functionality of the OWl
terms will be directly loadable by a more general reasoner.

Clearly not to your liking, and not really to mine, or we wouldn't have
a bunch of TAG issues on the subject. But the URI specs are the 
documents
which define that, in as much (a) you can understand what they mean
and (b) your philosophy allows for specifications at all of anything.

Whether something is a constant or a name then depends on whether the 
identification is "extra-logical", which
depends on the boundary you throw around some stuff you call your logic.
For the OWL MT by itself they are just names, while for the whole 
semantic web they would
be more like constants?

Voila. Hence the TAG issue. My own view is clear.

Indeed.  It is simpler on the web.  It may be the first time one has 
been
able to formalize the process.

The RDF spec only has to hand off authority to the pantone spec to 
define the actual relation
identified by  pantone:color.

Yes, we're not looking to a bot (in general) for an inherent 
understanding of redness.

(In fact we can build software which will tell you whether a picture of 
something is red.
But we don't expect an OWL engine for example to be able to figure 
things out.
You could actually write a level-breaking rule which told you whether a 
one-pixel
GIF was red by allowing log:contents and some string matching 
expressions.
But that is very much a corner case!)

We will work in a world in which robots work with a subset of the 
knowledge,
but are better at handling that subset than we are.
