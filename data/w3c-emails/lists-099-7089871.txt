Well, the encoding of the document is iso-8859-1, which is the default for
text/html. As "d8  ?", "f3  ?" and "c5  ?" are valid characters, they
don't need to be escaped.

The conclusion is, the document is OK as-is, or should use the proper
iso-8859-1 encoding if the plain characters have to disappear.
