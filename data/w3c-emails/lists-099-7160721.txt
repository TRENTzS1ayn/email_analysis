It seems to me that you may have set (perhaps inadvertently) your browser's
character encoding setting (typically under the View menu item) to UTF-8.
Volker, can you reset it to "Auto-select" and see if you browser cannot automatically
pick up the correct encoding ISO 8859-1 of the html document and display the
wretched (made up) name correctly in all instances.

Thanks,
