had to to cc w3c archive (learned from DanC)
and I'm convinced you don't mind

PS still assuming that
owl:Class owl:equivalentClass rdfs:Class.

indeed, owl:comlementOf a denumerable set
such as rdfs:Class (with cardinal number w)
seems arbitrary given the axiom of choice
when owl:Class is put after ordinal w
ie outside, we have a corresponding queue
where we put owl:Class at the first row and
then it is inside...

I agree this is really nasty one, but its an OWL problem. Meanwhile,
I think that providing a (non-normative, but) relatively precise
appendix in the RDF docs for these folk to use as a guide to 'layered
RDFS') will be useful and harmless. (No complementOf in RDFS)

I agree, and have been trying to fix this. owl:Class ought to mean
the same in OWL-Full as it does in OWL-DL; that would be the rational
way to go.  But it will take some work, because mapping between
OWL-Dl and OWL-full will now require reinterpreting owl:ComplementOf,
and Peter will not be happy.  But that's on the other WG.
