Regarding the <id> element, it would probably be nice to take
advantage of the October 5th TAG finding; "How should the problem
of identifying ID semantics in XML languages be addressed in the
absence of a DTD?";

<url:http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/xmlIDsemantics-32.html>

Though Atom will probably have a DTD declaring the semantics of
the ID, it would still be neat to follow the possible
reccomendation deduced by this finding.
