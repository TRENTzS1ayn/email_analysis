As far as I can tell, that finding concerns only XML 1.0 ID
attributes[1], a document instance local identifier.

Although some of the Atom examples were changed to show XML IDs for
<id>, the consensus and specs to date (on and off wiki) have <id>
being a URI, a global identifier.

Maybe it's time to reconfirm that <id> is a URI and update the
examples to match.
