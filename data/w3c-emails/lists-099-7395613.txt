Hey, thanks for reading that page.  I think you're the second person.
:-)  (You're probably the second person to give me any feedback on it.
The first was much more positive.   Hmmm, google rank around 25 for
"semantic web" within w3.org; how did you find it?)

I think, overall, your essay was quite unfair -- making up straw men,
calling them the Semantic Web, and then knocking them down.  Golly
Gee.  Your conclusions are fairly reasonable -- that something like
the Semantic Web is coming one way or another, and that it will be
built from the bottom up -- but they're not particularly
controversial.   Yes coming with an ontology which appeals to and
actually works for lots of people is hard, but is there really any other
way to achieve interoperability?

Oh, maybe you don't think the future systems will be "like" the
Semantic Web.  Through all the strawmen, I can't tell what you think
it is.  Maybe that's a failing of somebody's: not articulating the
Semantic Web vision clearly enough.... But of course no one can do it,
because it *is* a bottom up thing.  My writings on the subject are the
writings of one voice among many, down at the bottom, guessing at and
arguing for a particular direction.

Perhaps a more helpful approach would be for you to tell folks
what you think is coming, how it will happen, and what we can do to
make it happen in a better way.   And I'll try to edit 03/semweb to
better address some of your points.
