Yes, there are striking parallels here. But there are
also differences. An IETF WG is often disbanded once
Proposed Standards are published (the mailing list
usually lives on). A W3C WG would be considered to have
done a very bad job if they stopped at Candidate Rec.

Going to Draft takes at least 6 months; in W3C, there is
no time limit. Going to Full Standard in the IETF is often
ignored; the (numerically) major reason I have heard for
moving things to Full Standard is that something else is
trying to move to Full Standard that wants to reference
the standard in question. In W3C, moving to Recommendation
from Proposed Recommendation is in many cases a formality
(getting the official final approval from the W3C membership),
and it on average takes something around 2 months to
move from Proposed Rec to Rec.

Related to this is also the perception. I think implementers
are on average much more ready to implement and deploy on
a large scale a Proposed Standard than they are for a
Candidate Recommendation.
