Hi Dan,

I spotted your slide on Curried function notation, which of course has 
great resonance with my programming in Haskell (Haskell was Curry's first 
name).

The recent-ish discussion about RDFPath languages in RDFIG had startyed me 
thinking about using Curried functions as a kind of path notation -- 
something I could experiment with using my RDF-in-Haskell 
software.  Consider a path context (a node or set of nodes, I'm not sure) 
and a path expression being a function that "moves" from one path context 
to another.  Complex sub-paths could be expressed by function composition, 
so it should be possible to build an expressive path language from a few 
simple primitives.
