No change, unfortunately.

BTW, I decided to further try out Jena 2 support for
datatypes in generating the content for [1] (the Jena
2-generated pages aren't posted yet, pending a little more
work with use of reification to record dates and notes on
values).  I wrote a wrapper Jena 2 Model that takes range
constraints from properties and Restrictions and
automatically applies datatypes as statements are added.
ModelCom made it much easier to write this.  I'll post my
code along with the data.

Thanks!

Mike
