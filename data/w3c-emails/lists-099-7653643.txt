Agreed.

XQuery certainly would be my choice for XML query language. But, even once
you've settled on XQuery, there are a number of protocol issues that would
need to be addressed. For example, can clients ask that responses not exceed
a particular size? Are query responses resources, with a URI, and how long
can that URI be dereferenced? How should query errors be passed back to the
client?

True, although there is a growing class of DAV servers that sit on top of
XML databases, and so are interested in this capability.

Never hurts. I'm seeing some experimentation among DASL implementors
already.

This timeframe is probably right on. I think if things got rolling early to
middle of next year, that would be fine. Inaction on this does have
opportunity costs, but they're still fairly low.
