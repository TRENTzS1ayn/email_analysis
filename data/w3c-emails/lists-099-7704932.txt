Yes my own mistake, I followed the instructions of Tim for updating the 
code, but I thought I had to check in. I didn't see this mention 
explicitely or it was not said at the start when I developed the module.
I have forgotten about it after.

I have to check again that.
Thanks Dan for the modifications
