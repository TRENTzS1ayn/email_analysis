Er... this looks like the start of a separate issues list again.

Please just track comments; i.e. make sure the mail gets answered.
I recommend against sorting by document and I *strongly*
recommend agains making up new names.

In WebOnt, we relied on the comment archive as the authoritative
source, and built an automated index that allowed us to see
which threads weren't closed:
  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/WebOnt/lc-status-report.html

I can't really recommend the automation technique without
reservation; it took about 45 minutes to regenerate by
the end. So manual tracking might be easier. But
try not to shift the focus from the issues list
and the comments archive when you're tracking.
