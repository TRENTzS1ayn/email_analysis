Welty: 2 folkds meet. Book/libro. That's the world for these folks.

1 ontology? A few

Mitre guy: "e.g. 12staff months to map between aviation schemas w 7k 
attributes"

. Interop is funded point-to-point
. Few incentives to build in greater agility
. exploitation, not just capture!
amen!

"dod net-centric ...."

Pat: this discussion is like gourmets arguing over fine wine when 
zillions of people are starving. They just need a little bit of an 
answer to "how do I mark up my web page?"

. Fractal network structure... Cost/benefit of ontologies as some 
scale.
@@pls write up/down
Fallacy: "because we're talking about the same world, we're agreeing"

Discussion... Part of vs. Connected to... Philosophy.

Welty: conceptual modelling patterns.

Amen to exploitation
