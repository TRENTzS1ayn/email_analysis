As mentioned in [1], the attachment to this message is a file that can be 
uploaded to a Systinet WASP UDDI 4.5 registry to allow the browser GUI to 
that registry to show the RDDL taxonomy.


I will use this in an example of a RDDL document can contain links to this
upload file.

The RDDL file will have a
rddl:nature="http://www.systinet.com/uddi/web/doc/uddi/taxonomy.xsd"

and rddl:purpose="http://example.org/uddi/taxonomy/hierarchical"

My previous message [1] used the same rddl:purpose, but with
different rdl:nature.

The next message I send to www-archive will attach the RDDL file.

I had to send this and my previous message first so I could have the URLs 
from www-archive to put into the RDDL document.

Paul
