This is the third message and it attaches a RDDL document that describes a 
RDDL taxonomy for use in UDDI.

The first two messages contained attachments for XML files that can be 
uploaded to Microsoft and Systinet UDDI servers, respectively, so the 
taxonomy can be "checked" by these servers.

More importantly, these three messages (actually, the attachments to them), 
together with UDDI tModels published to UBR, provide an example of using 
RDDL as the target of the overviewURL in UDDI taxonomy tModels.

The advantage of using RDDL is that the rddl:nature and rddl:purpose can be 
used by "aware" applications to retrieve XML descriptions of the taxonomy, 
which can be used to upload to UDDI servers or download and cache in 
UDDI-aware clients.  Such clients can offer a better user experience for 
drilling down or browsing a taxonomy when compared to some of the web-based 
taxonomy browsing.
