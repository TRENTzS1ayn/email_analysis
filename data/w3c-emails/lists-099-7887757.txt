You're welcome to sink in how deep you want. The list is open
for everyone.

Yes.

The thing about <link> is that it most likely won't be globally
unique over time. But other than that, I agree.

Yes, most definately.

Yup. It should be represented in it's own form, e.g. atom:entry.

Exactly.

That's a shame.

True. Each article (or item, entry or whatever) doesn't necessarily
need to be obtainable in HTML, but it should be in some format. Atom
might be that format (or at least; I want it to be).

Yes, a great point for going with tag: URI ID's.

Great.

Are we? What happens if the site moves (not very likely in W3C's
case, but nevertheless)?

But the ID shouldn't only mean something to the originating site.
It should mean something to everyone, and it should be just as
unique and obtainable for everyone, without having to talk too
much with the source server.

When it comes to globally uniqueness, I think we do.

I'd actually rather discuss this mailing list-style, but I might
as well discuss it on the Wiki if you prefer it. I'll have a look
at the Wiki, at least.

I think you should, regardless of this discussion. :)

I don't think this works very well for the mirror.example.com
case.

They can ?potentially figure out what happened?, yes. I don't
think that's good enough. I don't think they should need to
figure this out, especially not this way. They should get a
notice, but it shouldn't come implicitly through the change
of namespace in the ID's or something similar.

A move should be explicitly told about, but an entry should
be obtainable at the new place without changing it's ID.
After all, the entry is the same.
