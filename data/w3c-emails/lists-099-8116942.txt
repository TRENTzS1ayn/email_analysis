Pat, Peter,

You will have seen that RDFCore has just published a new set of WD's - 
note these are not last call WD's.  I'd like to discuss with you how 
best we might move on to producing new last call documents.

The sort of thing that I have in mind is to see whether Peter could do a 
detailed review, particularly of the semantics doc before a second last 
call, so that we can go into a second last call knowing that any issues 
remaining are those on which we just don't agree.  I've also suggested 
that rather than discussing comments by email, organising a telecon to 
focus on review comments could speed things up.

If this approach is agreeable to you in principle, then the next step 
might be to agree a plan/schedule.

Brian
