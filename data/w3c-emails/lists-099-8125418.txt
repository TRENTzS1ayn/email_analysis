What might be best is to work by 1:1 emails to get as much done that 
way as possible, then a telecon to clear up any areas that seem to 
need more discussion/debate. That way, we can defer troublesome 
aspects to the telecon rather than taking up email-debate time.

I'd be happy to try this.

Peter, the documents (Lbase and semantics) which finally got 
published have changes made in response to your most recent comments, 
but of course if you can see any other issues I would like to know 
about them. I am not entirely happy, myself, with the proof appendix, 
which was modified in a rush to meet the publication deadline, and 
will be redrafting some of the proofs to make them clearer, probably 
using the 'extended interpretation' notion more comprehensively.

Pat
