> ImportError: cannot import name runNamespace

We found out that this is due to an old version of RDFSink being
used:-

http://ilrt.org/discovery/chatlogs/rdfig/2003-09-09.html#T07-30-16

There are, however, two syntax errors in what is meant to be the
current stable(-ish) cwm.tgz release. Is there not some way to
automate an "only make cwm.tgz if cwm passes the regression tests"
procedure?

Many thanks,
