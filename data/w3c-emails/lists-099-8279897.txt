Dear Semantic Web Developers,

I would like to know if you can acknowledge that these are bugs that I
have reported and if you can reproduce them? 

has any one else reported them? Do you have a bug tracking database?

have you thought about making a rdf notation for the bug reports? that
is something I would find very interesting, it could be like the
testing software...but on the other side of the coin.
