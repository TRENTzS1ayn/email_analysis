What do you mean by, "not locatable"?  There are things, like abstract 
concepts,
which may not be objects you find on the web, but they are things
which one describe.

The XSLT namespace is in fact

http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform

An engineer who comes across a document which
uses that namespace can look it up, and get information
leading him or her to the XSTL specification.

This is useful.  So while a namespace seems like an abstract
concept, to actually refer to it by the name of something
which can be looked up is variable.

In the semantic web, information can be used not only be
a person, but by a machine. So while the concept
of "two-digit US state code" may be a an abstract property,
in fact one can find the list of them and the correlation with
various other properties.  This is powerful.

You presumably mean that no one should ever look up what the
owner of the name said about it.
You need the "urn:" prefix not "uri:".
But betware that many urn: subschemes are actually less useful
because they are waiting for some sort of lookup mechanism,
and to the extent they have such a mechanism, they become just clumsier
versions of http:

The difference is an attitude of mind, and a mode of use.
Think of what you would like from your "uri:" space above, and use http:
space like that.

Use them like names not like locations. They are not locations.

That is a question of web site management.
The advantage of years is that in 100 years time, when someone
wants to reuse they string "xslt", they will not have a problem.

Think of them as names.
