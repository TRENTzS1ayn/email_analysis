The 5th meeting of the OntoWeb SIG on Ontology Language Standards
will be devoted to a

       WORKSHOP ON OWL IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCES

 Saturday 18th October
Sanibel Island, Florida
Florida

OWL is now nearing the completion of the W3C process (Candidate
Recommendation status has been requested), and the language is
stable enough for implementors to invest effort.

In fact, a number of tools have already been constructed:
reasoners, parsers, validators, editors, and API's
(see e.g. the Implementation Experience section at
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/WebOnt/rqim.html )

The goal of this meeting is both to learn about individual tool
implementations, and to share experiences on what is easy and what is
hard in realising such OWL implementations. For example:
- does the layering in Lite, DL and Full help or hurt
- experiences with OWL's RDF and XML syntax
- does the abstract syntax help or hurt
- experiences in migrating from DAML+OIL or other ontology languages
- experiences with leveraging other tools (e.g. RDF parsers)
- experiences with scalability

We sollicit contributions on both finished and on-going implementation
efforts.

DO YOU WANT TO PRESENT?

Please let us know before September 15 if you are interested in giving a
presentation on your OWL implementation experience, which tool(s) you
would like to present, and whether you are willing to give a demo during
the meeting. Send an email message to Frank.van.Harmelen@cs.vu.nl.

DO YOU WANT TO PARTICIPATE?

If you are will not be presenting on your OWL implementation
experience, but you are interested in attending this SIG event, please
send a an email message to Frank.van.Harmelen@cs.vu.nl.

Frank van Harmelen,
Ian Horrocks
(Coordinators of the OntoWeb SIG on Ontology Language Standards)
