I wouldn't use "partially" there, I'd say that resources are not
identified.  I don't think there's much of a middle ground when it
comes to the resource identification constraint.

Right.

Yes, I think so.

*can* meet them, yes.

In general, I don't think so.  Resource identification and the uniform
interface are absolutely core to REST.  If the interface were "very
general", without being strictly "uniform" (e.g. "PROPFIND", or
"SEARCH"), but resources were identified, then I would answer "yes".
But if we're talking about very specific methods like "getInvoice",
then I'd have to answer "No".

Just that if it's not late bound, then client software needs upgrading
whenever new services are introduced.  The opposite isn't true, however;
just because you are late bound, it doesn't mean you don't need client
upgrades to access new services.  Consider an FTP client that supports
ftp URIs; when a new scheme is introduced, it needs upgrading to be able
to use it.  It's really the combination of the uniform interface and
late-binding which is why the Web is so powerful; HTTP clients can
interact with *ANY* URI (perhaps with a proxy), because HTTP semantics
are uniform to *ALL* URI.

Something else you might want to consider, is that in an important
sense, you don't actually have a network until you're using late
binding.  Think about it. 8-)

Simply by reusing what's already out there.

R085 doesn't say that the URIs have to include sufficient information to
inform a client which interface can be used, which would be what is
required to mandate late binding.  It just says any URI, including
ones like http://api.google.com/search/beta2

And identification of resources doesn't necessarily mean allocation of
them.
