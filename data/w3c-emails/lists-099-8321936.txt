Ok, I found it :)  by a little human googeling around.

But I doubt that a machine could have found it, based on the information 
returned from that URI.  :(   It's just so very dissappointing that even 
the W3C has not seen fit to provide a standard path from a namespace URI 
to a normative specification document - if for no other purpose than 
just to show them to humans.
