No, PROPFIND isn't strictly uniform because it doesn't make sense for all
objects; it only makes sense on properties.

Think of REST's "uniform interface", as the interface that would be
exposed by the root object in a hierarchy, such as java.lang.Object.
You wouldn't put getStockQuote() on it, right?

No, just what I said above.

Yes.  When the out-of-band information (e.g. "action=1") is
*identifying* information, then we're in synch.  It's when the out of
band information defines the interface semantics that things go wrong,
because it messes with the contract.  For example, a successful response
now means something different; the success refers to the action, rather
than to the simple submission of data for processing.

> So when you said that "doc-lit SOAP is RESTful" what did you mean by that ?

Did I say that?  It *can* be, but 99.99% of people still put a method
in the body.  By definition, that's unRESTful.

I think I may have said that the RESTful use of SOAP looks like doc/lit,
but where there's no method in the body.  i.e. where the document is just
state.

Fire away!
