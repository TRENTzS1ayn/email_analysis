So, as far as doc-lit SOAP is concerned :
It can meet a resource identification constraint, either completely, by
using a URI which is fully visible (at least the latest SOAP specs recommend
it) or partially, by combining a Request URI and a control parameter like
(SOAP)'action' into a single URI (this combination will be done by a POST
handler and as such, a combined URI is not visible to intermediaries).
It does not strictly meet a uniform interface constraint when it retrieves
representations by using POST instead of GET.
However, when a Web Method feature is combined with a SOAP Response Pattern
(sorry, no links), that is, when an HTTP GET is issued and a doc-lit SOAP
body is returned (not WSDL), then these key constraints are met completely.
I'm not sure how tools support it at the moment.
It also probably meets other constraints, such as self-description and state
as representation, or at least can meet them.

Can we consider doc-lit SOAP as being "mostly RESTful" ?

I'd like to ask again about late-binding. You noted earlier that integration
costs rise significantly if a service is early-bound. Can you please explain
what you mean ?
I thought that the main issue, as far as integration is concerned, when RPC
method names and parameters, directly bound to some underlying objects, were
transmitted in a message body with any subsequent change in the
implementation requiring a new service interface.
Doc-lit SOAP services are early-bound, but I don't see yet how this fact can
increase integration costs. Also, it's not quite clear, how late-binding
would decrease them.
It seems a WSDL Requirement 085 allows for late-bound services to be
designed, which looks to me as if  late-binding is mainly about dynamic
allocation of resources.

Cheers
Sergey Beryozkin
