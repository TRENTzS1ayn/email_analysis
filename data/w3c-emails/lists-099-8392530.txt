Apologies, I thought it was "doc-lit SOAP".

OK, I think we agree that some of document-style uses of SOAP are RESTful.

Can you give a simple example of an unRESTful use of doc-lit SOAP ? This
would help me to see what you mean when saying that not all uses of doc-lit
SOAP are RESTful.

How could it ? Rpc/Encoded use of SOAP can't meet (by design) any of REST
constraints, can it ? The only constraint it can try to meet is that of
state as representation, and it's only with Rpc/Literal.

Can you please clarify a little bit more what you mean ? Most (or at least
not all) uses of doc-lit SOAP are RESTful. Do you mean specifying some
guidelines (that is constraining doc-lit sufficiently enough) under which
*all* (instead of 'some') uses of doc-lit SOAP can be said to be RESTful?

Thanks
Sergey
