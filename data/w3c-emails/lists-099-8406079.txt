Yes you did :-). And it's now in www-archive :-)

And I'm just trying to see how RESTful a doc-lit SOAP *can* be.
It seems you do agree that a doc-lit SOAP can meet a resource identification
constraint.
Doc-lit SOAP can also meet a uniform interface constraint, that is all
identified resources support the same uniform interface, at least POST and
GET.
The only question to me is it a uniform interface constraint which is not
met completely when POST is used instead of GET (the same as it can be used
instead of PUT and DELETE), I think it's a uniform interface one, and this
is what I meant when saying that doc-lit SOAP doesn't meet the constraint
strictly. Or is it some other, perhaps a derived constraint, which is not
met in such a case ?

Doc-Lit SOAP can also meet other REST constraints.
So, can we say that a doc-lit SOAP is "mostly" RESTful, taking into account
that it can meet all constraints ?

Cheers
