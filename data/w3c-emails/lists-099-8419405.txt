Ah, gotcha.  No problem.

There, "echoPerson" and "echoDocument" are the operations, which are not
uniform.

If the encoded operation is uniform, then it would meet the uniform
interface constraint.  Other constraints could be added.  With RPC/
literal, you're basically starting with a low level protocol on top of
which you'd have to reinvent HTTP.  Oh, and it would be rpc/encoded
over TCP.

Can you point me to one that you think is RESTful?

Right, though I'd want to use a new name rather than "doc/lit".
"RESTful doc/lit", say.  Or "state/literal" maybe.
