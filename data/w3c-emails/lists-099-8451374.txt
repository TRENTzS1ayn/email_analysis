Almost, but not quite 8-).  What you're missing is that POST - even when
extended as you describe - cannot RESTfully be used to have any insight
into what happens after the data has been submitted.  "echo" semantics
are such that there exists an expectation that what is submitted, is
returned.  It's that expectation which is not RESTful.

Hah! 8-)

Here's one that I think is RESTful;

Hmm, are you clear what "uniform" means?  It means that it's meaningful
to all resources.

But you snipped my comment about TCP.  Using SOAP over TCP, this would
be RESTful (assume it uses the SOAP encoding);

<e:envelope xmlns=...
  <e:body>
    <m:post>
      <foobar:data>lsdfiasdfasdf</foobar:data>
    </m:post>
  </e:body>
</e:envelope>
