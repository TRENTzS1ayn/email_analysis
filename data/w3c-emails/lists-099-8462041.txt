I have to admit I'm somewhat confused. It seems to me that "echo" semantics
are only 'visible' to a client and a service
A generic intermediary would probably be confused because it's not aware of
the semantics.
Is it more RESTful to POST Person details first and then GET it back or ask
a service to POST it to a provided URI, instead of combining it into a
single POST ?

I think that those uses of doc-lit SOAP which actually do RPC can be
considered unRESTful (empty input bodies, or perhaps with some structures
clearly representing parameters, many fine-grained invocations, etc)

This is why I'm confused. This example seems to be very similar as the one
with echoPerson.
That example shows an input message, which is followed by a response asking
for some clarifications. How POST in this example can be used RESTfully to
see what happens after the data has been submitted ?

Hopefully yes :-)

That's what I meant when saying that a uniform encoded operation will look
like an encoded document,
<m:post>
     <foobar:data>lsdfiasdfasdf</foobar:data>
 </m:post>
looks like a good-example of doc-encoded style (which is probably extinct by
now), even though 'm:post' is really a uniform operation
