Hello Daniel,

Very good summary. Just some comments:

   I guess you mean the bidi formatting codes provided by Unicode.
   The problem is not that they are not adequate for rendering
   bidi text ('perfectly'), e.g. for plain text; the problem is
   that they can interact very badly with markup, leading to
   things very similar to <i><b></i></b> crappy HTML examples.

Correct.

They were not explicitly designed for all XML-based specifications,
but they would still work easily with an extremely broad range
of XML specifications.

I do not think that the current XHTML solution is in any way
significant way non-comprehensive. I also do not believe that
any 'comprehensive effort' will lead to a proposal that is
significantly different from the current XHTML solution.
