I'm asking what difference does it make to an intermediary that some
document was *expected*  (echoDocument example) or *not expected*
(clarification request in SOAP primer) to be returned in reply to a POSTed
request ?
Your answer was that in a latter case an intermediary would not be confused.
If so, then what can it do with such (clarification) data that it can't do
with a document echoed back ?
As you explained, there's no the documented expectation that POST will echo
a document back. I just don't understand why is it a problem for an
intermediary.

Sorry, I was unclear, I was more concerned about code generation. With
early-bound services, one just takes WSDL and generates the code (proxies)
and that's it.
With late-bound services, how far the code generation can get ? One can use
WSDL support for HTTP GET/POST. For ex, a late-bound SOAP service would
accept :

GET soapgateway;stockquote:sunw
or
POST soapgateway;buystock:sunw
some data

Is it correct ?

Yes, you're right. In a perfectly RESTful environment one would use GET.
But I think you pointed out in an earlier mail that is not unRESTful to use
POST instead of GET (sorry, I can't find in www-archive, so here's an
extract):

What am I missing here ?

I guess one reason for using POST to get quotes from a late-bound doc style
SOAP service would be to be able to pass headers.

Thanks, Sergey
