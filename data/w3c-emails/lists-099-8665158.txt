Dear Colleagues, 
 
I have divided my presentation that gives an overview of UN/CEFACT as an
organisation and its work on a Business Collaboration Framework (BCF)
into 4 Parts.   Each part is still quite large (largest around 7 Mb),
but smaller then the complete file, which was up at 20 Mb (Sorry but
this is due to its construction from JPEG slides. 
 
The 4 parts are to be found at the bottom of the following messages to
the archives:
