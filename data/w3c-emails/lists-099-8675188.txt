Pat,

At some point, you mailed me about 5 axioms
for a modal "proveable" operator. Does that
ring a bell? What are they? Where do they
come from? I spent about an hour last night
looking for your message and I can't find it.

I think you sent them in response to something
about avoiding the excluded middle, or quoting
and self-reference, or something.
