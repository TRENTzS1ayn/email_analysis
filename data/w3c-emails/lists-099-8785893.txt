Yes, please.

Absolutely.  I suggest a separate one from math.n3
A good one, with the corner cases you can think of as
well as "normal" cases.

One request.   I assume that the normal mode of operation
is radians.   Then "degrees" as a function to return a number of degrees
makes sense.  However one would then expect "radians" to be the
identity operation.  I suggest you remove math:radians altogether,
and make math:degrees a Function and ReverseFunction.
That allows cwm to work either way.

You need to import the module from llyn so that it is registered
as  built-ins.
