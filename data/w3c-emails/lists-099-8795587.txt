ok doing that.

Right no, I see the following files:

http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/test/math/bug1.n3
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/test/math/bug2.n3
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/test/math/math-test.n3
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/test/math/math-test-subset.n3

You suggest that:

http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/test/math/trigo.n3 (doesn't exist yet)

Yes it works in radians. I hope it's correct, I have done that.

class BI_degrees(LightBuiltIn, Function, ReverseFunction):
"""
degrees (x)
Converts angle x from radians to degrees.
Convert angle x from degrees to radians.

     def evaluateObject(self, subj_py):
return degrees(numeric(subj_py))
def evaluateSubject(self, obj_py):
return radians(numeric(obj_py))

done. I hope I have done nothing wrong.

In  http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/llyn.py revision 1.96

         import cwm_math    # Mathematics
         import cwm_trigo   # Trignometry
....
         cwm_math.register(self)
         cwm_trigo.register(self)
