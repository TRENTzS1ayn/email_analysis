Yeah, sorry.   I didn't really notice that phrasing until about 20

Well, I didn't know what an "information space" was (not in any useful
sense), and I couldn't find out through Google, FOLDOC, or Wikipedia.
That seemed worth reporting.   I should have done it that more
clearly.  

(I'm still not being offered a definition that makes sense to me, but
I don't need to waste your time on that.  I'm taking this to off-list
archive space as a token gesture towards not interrupting the TAG.)
