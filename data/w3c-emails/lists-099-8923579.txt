Well, it's too late for SOAPAction.  But if we were still working on
SOAP 1.2, I would use something like;

Content-Type: application/soap+xml; action="some-uri"; strength="must"

That would indicate that the action URI MUST be recognized, or else a
fault must be generated.  If strength were not specified, or had value
"may", then it would work as SOAPAction did.

Mark.
