Hmm, yes, I see arguments for both options:



pro parentheses:

- we started with them and already used them in the SWIG paper

- a named graph is not a N3 formula, which is underlined by using
parentheses

- TriG is based more on N-Triples than N3.

- We didn't decide on a list syntax for TriG yet, or whether we want to
include lists at all.

- using braces would also imply braces in TriQL which would move it further
away from RDQL

- parentheses look "nicer" and are easier to reach on German and English
keyboards.



I think that all these arguments are not very strong. So if you have the
strong feeling that we should change to braces it is OK with me.



Chris
