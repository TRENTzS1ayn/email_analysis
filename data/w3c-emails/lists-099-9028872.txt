OK, braces in TriG.

What do you guys think about braces in TriQL?

SELECT ?a
WHERE ?b (?a <km:Skill> <km:Programming> .
          ?a <rdf:type> <km:Person> )
      (?b <swp:assertedBy> ?c .
       ?c <swp:authority> ?d )
      (?d <km:affiliation> ?e)
      (?e <rdf:type> <km:Project> .
       ?e <km:Topic> <km:Programming> )
AND COUNT(?e) > 2

or

SELECT ?a
WHERE ?b {?a <km:Skill> <km:Programming> .
          ?a <rdf:type> <km:Person> }
      {?b <swp:assertedBy> ?c .
       ?c <swp:authority> ?d }
      {?d <km:affiliation> ?e}
      {?e <rdf:type> <km:Project> .
       ?e <km:Topic> <km:Programming> }
AND COUNT(?e) > 2

I tend to stay with parentheses because it makes typing queries easier, RDQL
also uses parentheses and a query lanuage is related more to the abstract
syntax than to one concrete syntax.  Also weak arguments :-)

Any optinions?

Jeremy, do you have a up-to-date version of our paper, which you could send
me?

Chris
