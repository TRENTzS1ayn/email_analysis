hi all,

I think I'm right in saying that the people named above are the
principal contributors to the image regions vocabulary we've developed
recently as part of the w3photo project. (Many apologies if I've missed
someone out - I got this list from looking at
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/, Jan-April 2004.
*Please* let me know if I have missed you out so I can get your
agreement as below and make sure you are credited).

To get this vocabulary on the W3C site (probably at
http://www.w3.org/2004/02/image-regions#) Dan has asked me to get
everyone who contributed to agree that the vocabulary be put on the
site and made available under the W3C license:

http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2002/copyright-software-20021231

To get this moving could you please all send me a quick note, copying
www-archive@w3.org (or just replying to this mail, which will go to the
list and hence www-archive), expressing your agreement to the terms of
the W3C license for the image regions vocabulary?

Let me know if you need any more information.

Many thanks,

Libby
