We're running out of time -

in particular - we need to agree author list, title , keywords and abstract 
mnext Tuesday - which since I am leaving early on Thursday, and Friday is a 
UK holiday means Thursday a.m. (i.e. Wednesday for Pat)

Also stuff on TriX paper for Extreme below.

So for the paper I suggest:

Authors:

Jeremy J. Carroll, Christian Bizer, Patrick Hayes, Patrick Stickler

Title:
Named Graphs, Provenance and Trust

Areas from CFP:
http://iswc2004.semanticweb.org/CF/researchTrack.php
Languages, Tools and Methodologies for Semantic Web Data
Semantic Web Trust, Privacy, Security and Intellectual Property Rights

(any others??)

Keywords:

RDF, Syndication, Provenance,
Trust, Security, Digital Signatures,
Publishing, TriX, Model Theory, Graphs
(that's probably too many - suggested changes?)

Abstract:

The Semantic Web consists of many RDF graphs named
by URIs. This paper discusses the syntax and semantics
of such collections of named graphs. This enables
improved clarity in  Semantic Web
publishing, allowing publishers to communicate
assertional intent, and to sign their graphs.
Information consumers can evaluate specific graphs
using task-specific trust policies, and act on the
information from those named graphs that they accept.


(something upbeat for the last line?)


On TriX paper (Carroll/Stickler) - I don't think I am going to have time to 
update it after Pat's feedback on the named graph paper - hence I think we 
need to update in terms of the current draft plus planned changes and worry 
about any late changes after we have submitted it. (i.e. the version that 
gets reviewed may not be exactly the version that we wish to be reviewed, 
but close enough).
