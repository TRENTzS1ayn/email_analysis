Take 2:


The Semantic Web consists of many RDF graphs named
by URIs. This paper extends the syntax and
semantics of RDF to cover such collections
of named graphs. This enables RDF statements
that describe graphs, which can be used
in  many Semantic Web applications.
We explore in detail the important
application of  Semantic Web
publishing: named graphs allow publishers to
communicate assertional intent, and to sign
their graphs; information consumers can evaluate specific graphs
using task-specific trust policies, and act on the
information from those named graphs that they accept.
Graphs are trusted depending on: their content;
information about the graph; and the task the user
is performing.


(Chris noted that we needed to be clear that the paper is trying to rebuild 
the RDF stack, and should be more explicit about the wide applicability).
