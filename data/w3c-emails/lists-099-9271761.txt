Rigo,

I happened to skim the EPAL note and saw

  "Appendix 5.1 EPAL Functions"
  http://www.w3.org/Submission/2003/SUBM-EPAL-20031110/#Functions

That seems to overlap substantially with the XQuery
functions and operators
  http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-functions

That's the sort of overlap I think we're supposed to note
in the team comments. I looked at the team comment
  http://www.w3.org/Submission/2003/07/Comment
of $Date: 2003/12/01 14:14:05 $ and I don't see anything
about XQuery overlap.

Would you please add something? Would you mind if I added
something?
