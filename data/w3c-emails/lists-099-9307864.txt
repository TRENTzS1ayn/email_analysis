Hi,

I updated the draft for the Named Graph homepage and included the comments
from Patrick and Jeremy. I also added RDF/XML as a third possible syntax for
Named Graphs to section 3:

3.3 RDF/XML

A collection of RDF documents can be seen as a set of Named Graphs. This
gives Named Graphs upward compatibility with RDF/XML, but has the
disadvantage that retrieval URL, document name and graph name are mixed up.
