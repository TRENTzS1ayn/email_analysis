Dan, 

having not enough knowledge about XQuery, I'm reluctant to 
add a note. Especially as one can express more or less 
everything that P3P or APPEL do in XQuery as XQuery is 
a very generic specification. 

As P3P, EPAL and APPEL are designed for a specific 
area (privacy), they tend to try to limit overhead by making 
very lean specifications. This means that they only implement 
the functions they need. 

Now if you know xpath-functions well and can point to the right 
functions and how they mismatch with the functions specified by 
EPAL, this could be beneficial. But if it is saying: "you should require 
xpath-functions" I would say that this is not what they mean and 
surely not what I expect from EPAL. 

It would be good if you could add a word to remind the group if 
it is chartered..

Best, 

Rigo
