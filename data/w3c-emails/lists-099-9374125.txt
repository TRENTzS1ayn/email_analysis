I'm really liking "Certification", (or else "Voucher").

I think commitment may suggest alot more legal machinery (or need for
comprehensive explainations) than we want to bother with...

Given that a signature in a warrant/certification would be graph 
specific,
I'm not sure how this relationship wouldn't be percieved to be 
one-to-one
(not that I think the language of the comment necessarily states so 
strict
a cardinality).
