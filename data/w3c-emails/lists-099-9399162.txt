Locks etc.

Chris currently has the latex sources with lock.
Later today, he should send these sources to Pat and the archive and Pat 
can either change the latex sources or write plain text (like last time).

Chris would like the lock on Tuesday UK time, I would like the lock on 
Wednesday.

Pat could have the lock from this evening through to Monday night.

Hope this works,

Chris and Pat can probably sort things.

Please make sure there is an agreed abstract on the archive soon, since I 
will submit it Monday.

Jeremy
