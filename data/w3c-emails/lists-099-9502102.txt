Our signature method defines three things:
1. The graph/graphset canonicalization method (e.g. what Jeremy proposed in
his signing RDF paper)
2. The hash function for hashing the canonicalized graph/grapset
3. The Signature algorithm for signing the hash value.

There is no problem in defining a canonicalization method for graphsets,
thus it is also possible to sign them.

In order to avoid unnecessary metadata, I still think we should loosen the
cardinality between graph and warrant. Another argument is compatibility,
XML Signature also allows signing several resources at once.
