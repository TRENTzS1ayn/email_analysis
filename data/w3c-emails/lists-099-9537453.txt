To whom it may concern.

Using a not-so-anonymous hotmail address (microsectl@hotmail.com), 
someone sent several messages to public lists at w3.org with links to 
the 123webguru Web site, a web division, if I am not mistaken, of the 
microsec company.

Posting to these lists imply acceptance of the W3C mailing-lists 
policies, including the very clear policy on unsolicited commercial 
e-mail, or "spam". The e-mails (e.g [1]) sent by you or on your behalf 
are in clear violation of these policies.

[1] 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-validator-css/2004Apr/0002.html

All but one of these messages have been removed from our mail archives, 
and the addresses used are being refused access to our mail services. 
We are also reserving our right to conduct strict action against this 
violation of our policies.

In the meantime, we expect that the microsec company will not want to 
be known on the Web as responsible for spam, and that quick and firm 
action will be taken against the perpetrators of such "publicity". We 
hope, of course, that this kind of incident with 123webguru will not 
happen again.
