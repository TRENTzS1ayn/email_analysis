Noticed a few typos and tidyings in that section, whoever has the lock:

page 13

line -4
em warranting >> warranting (but written in italics)

line -1
I(g2)=g I(a)=person(g)
>>
I(g2)=g
I(a)=person(g)  (with person written in italics)

page 14

lines 3, 5 : formatting of the < w a>  is screwed up
line 4

person(w)  (only person should be italicised)

line 13
delete "under any such interpretation, i.e."

line 14

property >> triple

line 16
em only >> only (in italics)

line 17, 18. Delete last sentence "Thus, such a....true warrant."

next paragraph, delete last sentence "This could 
happen even .... , for example."

next para
warranted interpretation >> warranting interpretation
