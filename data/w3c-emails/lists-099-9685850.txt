Works for me.

Looks correct insofar as the RDF schemas are concerned (noting that
it is more constrained than the schemas since certain cardinalities
are not specified in the schemas -- Jeremy, if you could indicate
how to do that property, since I seem to have gotten it wrong
earlier, feel free to do so).

1. Do we wish to require swp:signatureMethod if swp:signature is 
defined?
2. Do we wish to limit a warrant to a single signature?


BTW, the updated RDF schema for SWP reflecting the same vocabulary as
Chris' diagram is attached.

I'm hoping that this is now the final vocabulary. Yes?
