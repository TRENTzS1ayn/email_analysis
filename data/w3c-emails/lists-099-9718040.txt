Yes, defining these cardinalities sounds like a job for our OWL fraction.

Yes.
It is impossible to express this constraint in the ER diagram.
Is it possible with OWL?

Yes. The cardinallity in the diagram is already "?". Would be nice to have
the same in the schema.

Nearly :-)

I think we should move to OWL in order to be able to express the cardinality
restrictions, or include them at least into the RDFS comments.

I think we should wait with instance definitions untill we have defined the
additional vocabulary that allows you to specifiy a method as a combination
of cantonalization method, hash algo and signature algo. PGP and X509 both
allow different hash and sig algo combinations. Thus it is a little
unprecise just to say X509.
