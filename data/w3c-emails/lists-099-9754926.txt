I would be happy seeing them expressed in the RDF. Earlier versions
had them, but apparently I was doing something wrong so I took them
out until Jeremy could say how to define them correctly.

I don't read the original wording as equating to a 1:1 relationship.

Saying "one or more" seems more confusing, as if the multiple
graphs participated in a three-way or more relationship, which
isn't the case.

Same as above.

Hmmm... I'm not sure I agree.

If you say something, then the utterance originates with you, no matter
how many other folks have said the same thing. I.e. to assert a graph
is to express the statements in that graph -- and as such, that graph
originates from you (and possibly many others).

If you make an swp:assertedBy statement about a graph in some other
graph, the end result is exactly the same as if you had included
that swp:assertedBy statement (and warrant) in the graph itself.

No?

The whole point of making these statements is to associate
some source/authority with the graphs. If you quote a graph
you are in essences uttering the statements of that graph
(even if not making claims by those statements) and, again,
whether the swp:quotedBy statement occurs in or out of that
graph has no affect on its meaning.

To quote a graph is to express/publish/present the statements
of that graph.

There is only one subject, and hence only one graph in focus
insofar as this property is concerned.

This does not preclude the same warrant being associated
with more than one graph, but the semantics of the terms
focus on a specific, single graph.

They are indirectly linked to the authority because only one
authority is allowed for a given warrant.

If multiple authorities sign the same graph, then there must
be mulitple warrants, one for each authority.

So associating the certificate with the warrant also associates
it unambiguously with a single authority, the authority for
that warrant.

Right?

Fair enough. I'll remove them. In fact, we may wish to define
the signature methods in a different namespace, or even use
existing URIs, if any are appropriate.
