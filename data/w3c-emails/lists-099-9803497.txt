Attn Chris, read this before reviewing next draft.

Pat,

I have now reviewed your latest text and I am happy that it addresses my 
earlier worries. In particular, I am now happy with the concept of a 
warrant graph as a useful primitive. I will add additional text at the 
beginning of 5.2 to the effect that warrants are social acts, which can be 
usefully embodied in some record of that act, in particular we will 
consider the case when a graph containing a description of the warrant is 
identified with the warrant, as a record of the social act. I may modify 
the first example in 5.2 to use a bnode for the warrant, and then the 
second example identifies the warrant as the graph itself.

I am integrating the text now, and hope to have it finished in a couple of 
hours (all outstanding changes - from all authors). I fear we will then be 
overlength, but I will circulate at that point. I shall then make whatever 
reductions are necessary. A possibility might be to cut the query languages 
section - but I will try trimming first. In particular I suspect we repeat 
ourselves concerning performatives.

Feel free to give me a call on +39 0586 89 03 55

Jeremy
