That would be OK, as long as we don't use bnodes as graph labels I'm happy.

Yes, we do. Suggest leaving that in the intuitive sections and 
removing it (other maybe than a few words) in the formal section. 
Also I agree that the query language stuff could be omitted or 
shortened simply to an example embedded in text, along the lines  of 
'here's how it would look in the query language [reference]; 
{example} "
