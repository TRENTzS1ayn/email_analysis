Another one.

Changes are mainly trivial; the most significant changes are 1 substantive 
change to Pat's text in section 2, and wording alignments between sections 
2 and 6.2 (also Pat's text).

Acknowledgements now fit.

The substantive change is that the old text talked about interpretations of 
named graphs, and said that if I satisfies g then I(name(g)) = g; I don't 
believe we interpret named graphs at all, merely the graphs (or a merge 
thereof) within the named graphs. Hence I have changed this to say that an 
interpretation conforms with a set of named graphs N if for every ng in N 
then I(name(ng)) = ng.

I have followed Chris's suggestion and capitalized Named Graph throughout, 
but personally I find it ugly.
