A simple example was in 6.2 where you had an interpretation I of a 
(named) graph g, I now have an interpretation I of rdfgraph(ng), 
conforming with the naming, [where ng is a Named Graph], it is slightly 
more precise (and hence uglier). A similar point in section 2 seemed to 
me to be more of a change than a clarification.

OK - we can discuss this later, but the modifications stands in the 
submitted text.
