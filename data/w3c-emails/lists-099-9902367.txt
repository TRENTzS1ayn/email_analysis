The attachments to this message are copies of an updated DRAFT
presentation on the use of XPointer and the HTTP "Range" header
as a possible scalable and extensible RDF data access protocol
that was prepared for the first face to face of the RDF data
access working group.  Both a PowerPoint and a PDF version are
attached.
