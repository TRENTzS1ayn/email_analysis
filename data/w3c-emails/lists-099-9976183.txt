I'm happy to announce that our work on W3Photo will have a track during 
Saturday's Developer Day at WWW2004!

The track will focus on Photography and Markup. I'm hoping those of you 
coming to WWW2004 will stick around for Saturday and participate at 
Developer's Day.

More to follow...


[WWW2004] SOS: Stay On Saturday!

The organizers of Developer?s Day would like to encourage you to ?stick 
around? for the Saturday after the Web Conference to join in some very 
exciting hot-off-the-presses sessions for developers, by developers. In 
addition, we are proud to announce that we have scheduled two plenary 
speakers: Doug Cutting, the leader of the Nutch open-source search 
engine project, and an interactive luncheon Q&A with Tim Berners-Lee.

The main focus of the day will be four parallel tracks split along 
several key themes to bring developer and specialist communities 
together:

* Semantic Web, a full day chaired by Eric Miller <em@w3.org>
* Trust and Reputation Management, chaired by Jennifer Golbeck 
<golbeck@cs.umd.edu>
* Photography Markup, chaired by Greg Elin <greg@fotonotes.net>
* RuleML & DAML-Rules, co-chaired by Benjamin Grosof <bgrosof@mit.edu>
* XForms, chaired by Steven Pemberton <Steven.Pemberton@cwi.nl>
* And new for this year, ?Cool Stuff?, a selection of application 
development techniques, usability assessments, search technology, and 
other experience reports culled by the DevDay co-chairs, Jim Hendler 
<hendler@cs.umd.edu> and Rohit Khare <rohit@ics.uci.edu>

Stay tuned for more detailed schedules and talk titles in your 
conference bags when you get to New York ? and book that extra hotel 
night to make the most of the bonus day in your WWW2004 Passport 
registration, Developer?s Day!
