Quick observations.
Gathering the metadata: ranking (photos, and yes people would be good).
But simple scales are good from users' point of view.
Doesn't change an algorithm unless it is used.
Algorithm is independent of metadata, as long as the metadata is fit for the
algorithm in use.
Cheers.
Hugh
