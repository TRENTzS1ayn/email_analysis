Thanks.

* I agree RecordDescription is essentially the same as "Pattern 2".

* I think CurriedFunctions are different and would prefer to avoid them in a simple primer because
a) They  get messy except in functional programming languages that can deliver functions as values of other functions..
b) In an SW/RDF/OWL context there is the question about whether the curryFunction created by one resource on the SW is equivalent to the curryFunction created by another.  I see all sorts of namespace and equivalence problems here I wouldn't want to face at this stage.
c) They put one in OWL-Full without delivering obvious benefit that I can see.


* The argument list is a common programming trick - e.g. functions that deliver tuples - but I think distorts the spirit of either RDF or OWL.  For OWL it has the added disadvantage of moving immediately to OWL full and - I think - requiring a data type property to hold the list for what is otherwise semantically an object property. (If I am wrong on this, somebody please correct me.)  It also leaves the semantics of the different arguments implicit whereas any of the other mechanisms make them more explicit.  I wouldn't oppose including it, but I would want those  'health warnings' attached.


(There is a notion related to curriedFunctions which is a trick involving hierarchies of properties.
 e.g.

at-least-associated
  at-least-partly-caused-by
      directly-caused-by

But I think that this should be delayed for a separate pattern. It would just confuse things here. It also raises some nasty technical questions for classifiers if it leads to a transitive property as the child of a non-transitive property, etc.)
