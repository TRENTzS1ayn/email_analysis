May I suggest using Danny Ayers'  review vocabulary for assigning the ranks:
http://www.purl.org/stuff/rev#

It's a scale from 1 to 10, with associated reviewer, and already seeing some 
use out there. I'm using it at foaf.dk/hosting for amazon's reviews, and i've 
recently started using it for exactly the purpose at hand: Photos.

How to use the ranking is a different matter, but I think a group/aggregated 
approach coupled with trust would be very interesting.
