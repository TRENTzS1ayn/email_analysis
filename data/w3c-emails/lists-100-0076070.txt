Excellent! It's an rdf vocabulary! very cool.

My thinking is a -1 thru +5 scale.

-1 = offensive
0 = null, nada, irrelevant
+1 = weak
+2 = just under average
+3 = above average
+4 = good
+5 = great!

database will track each person vote per photo; must be logged-in to 
vote.

any image marked with -1 is immediately pulled from being seen and 
reviewed

It might also be a certain number of people must rank and image +3 or 
higher for it to be included in any distributions of the repository.
