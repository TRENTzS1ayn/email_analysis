The data is a bit sparse in places, but its starting to come together.

The main thing thats missing is a way to get the RDF from Greg's app into
our server.

We could poll a directory of files, or theres an HTTP CGI URL on the
server that can be POSTed to - I'd prefer the latter, but anything to get
it working.
