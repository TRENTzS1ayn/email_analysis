hi Greg.

That's great news. What does it entail exactly? Should we be sending our
proposals to you or is it too late? (or can we sort it all out next
week?)

Also - do you have any plans for promoting the w3photo stuff before
devday or is it a devday thing because there aren't that many photos up
there yet?

finally...would people like to meet up for dinner or drinks or something
one day before Saturday? I arrive late Monday, and it'd be great to see
everyone.

cheers

Libby
