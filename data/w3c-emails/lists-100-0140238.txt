 >> finally...would people like to meet up for dinner or drinks or 
something one day before Saturday? I arrive late Monday, and it'd be 
great to see everyone.


I'm for meeting up. I arrive late on Tuesday.

I can ask my father and brother if they have a recommendation for a 
restaurant or bar that would suit us. Any preferences?
