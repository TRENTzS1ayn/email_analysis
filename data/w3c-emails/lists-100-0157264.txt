No proposal necessary. Eager to have all this group's participation.
I'm going to sort a few things out today...and we can build on next 
week.

We have 2, one-hour slots.
I'm thinking 1 session is tech show and tell:
- w3photo project
- rdf (imreg, events)
- related cool things with image annotation

and second session we mix up a lively discussion
- brief reprise on w3photo
- where does rdf go?
- how standardized v. how distributed
- new standard v. existing standards
- next steps

Geek Gods willing, archive will be *live* at beginning of conference 
for 2004 photos
We have a table, we are distributing a flyer.

Please! Let me host everyone for a dinner. What day is best?
We'd have to take a subway, but my choice is Korean BBQ.

It seems either Wed or Thursday would be best?
