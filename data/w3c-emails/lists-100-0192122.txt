I have finally got the named graph's page looking (roughly?) alright.
I suggest you take a look, I am expecting to see Patrick and Chris at 
least in NY, and after a verbal OK I will circulate this URL to 
rdf-interest

http://www.w3.org/2004/03/trix/

Various things fixed/changed/broken?

- added schemas etc on-line, at locations of my choice 

  - rdf schemas accesible though the directory url or the url of any 
item in namespace
 - dtd and xsd available underneath /trix/trix-1.0/ directory, directory 
itself shows minimal HTML file pointing at these two. No aliasing for 
items in namespace (could be added though)

 - rdfg and swp vocab - I took the latest rdfs docs I could find from 
patrick, and slightly modified them:
   + adding xml:base since this is our preferred option for naming 
RDF/XML docs
   + commenting out one or two vocab items where I thought Patrick got 
carried away in swp.

TriX syntax
   I think we had agreed the following

   root element  <trix> not <TriX>
   each graph has exactly one uri name

 I modified both DTD and XSD to say both of these

(Hmm currently it does not XHTML validate, and I need to do a link 
check)
