This message doesn't seem to have turned up in the ICANN archives [1,2]
so I forward it this public archives.  It is slightly edited version of 
the earlier message I sent to this list - a bit more about CSS, and a 
mention of support by the W3C TAG.

>
> Introduction
>
>    When the Internet was being collaboratively developed by a
>    substantially technical community around a growing but still
>    manageable Internet Engineering Task Force, the Domain Name System
>    (DNS) evolved as a hierarchical solution to the problem of keeping
>    track of which computers had which Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.
>    The tree structure was an improvement over the previous flat space 
> of
>    host names. It reduced the chaos, by allowing new names to be
>    allocated in sub-domains without recourse to a central registration
>    system. Because the frequency of allocation of new names decreased 
> as
>    one ascended the tree toward the root, the actual cost was kept
>    manageable.
>
>    As email and World Wide Web (WWW) use blossomed and became
>    increasingly important, domain names crept out of the messages 
> syntax
>    for Internet protocols and crept into daily parlance. It then became
>    valuable to own a short domain name. This turned domain name space
>    into a limited commodity. After some tussles for control (ongoing at
>    the time of writing) and some large amounts of money changing hands 
> in
>    some cases, the system has now settled down to a market-based one in
>    which names can be rented, transfer value can be asked by the old
>    owner of the new owner, and one-time and annual fees are typically
>    payable by any domain to any company managing the higher domain. An
>    anomaly was that unclaimed names were deemed to have no owner and no
>    value, and were allocated in a "first come first served" frenzy in
>    which speculators made great profits and held to ransom those who 
> may
>    have been considered the more logical owner of a name. This anomaly
>    created great instability. It has costs, in that any trademark owner
>    had to beware of parties who would register domains which included
>    their trademark. The Example Manufacturing Company had to ensure 
> that
>    it owned not only example.com which it had used for email and Web 
> site
>    for many years, but also example.net and example.org to avoid
>    unscrupulous competition setting up sites to benefit from Example's
>    excellent reputation. As the business grew, Example had to also
>    acquire example.fr and example.co.uk to ensure that confusion was
>    minimized.
>
>    The fact was that the public memory was not for the domain name, but
>    for the brand name which was sandwiched between www and .com. To 
> this
>    extent, in the world of memorable domain names, the
>    hierarchicalization of the domain system had failed to happen. In 
> the
>    public's memory, example was the mark, and the difference between
>    example.com and example.net merely a source of confusion.
>
>    As each node in the tree represents a potentially valuable asset,
>    control of any subset of the tree is valuable. Control of the entire
>    tree is managed by ICANN, which is set up to be a non-profit
>    international institution, with the intent that it should as such
>    carry the trust of the entire community in its efforts to manage the
>    system for the common good. Control of subtrees such as .net, .com 
> and
>    .org is delegated to set of parallel registries whose business model
>    is nominally the charging of registration and annual fees. There 
> have
>    been temptations for the registry companies to consider themselves
>    owners of unclaimed names. Rumors have abounded about systems which
>    would automatically rent a domain name about which a potential 
> renter
>    was inquiring, or would redirect traffic from an unclaimed Web site 
> to
>    their own Web site, and so on.
>
> The Cost of Change
>
>    The top level of the domain name system, and to a lesser extent the 
> IP
>    address space, are the single weak, centralised, points of an
>    otherwise strong, decentralised system. The Internet is a net, and 
> the
>    WWW is a Web, but WWW and email use DNS which is a tree, which has a
>    single root. Although there are many benefits to a system with 
> global
>    identifiers, there are also costs, such as a single common DNS tree.
>    As a community we have all decided that the benefits of the system
>    (such as being able to quote example.com anywhere in the world and
>    have it mean the same thing) outweigh the costs of the social 
> systems
>    required to ensure fairness in its operation. There is, however, 
> great
>    stress. ICANN is under constant pressure to alter its balance of 
> power
>    or modus operandi. It balances technical, academic, commercial, and
>    governmental inputs. The whole issue of domain names has created a
>    vast amount of concern. And because the DNS tree is so fundamental 
> to
>    the Internet applications which build on top of it, any uncertainty
>    about the future creates immediately instability and harm.
>
>    Our first instincts, then should be not to change the system with
>    anything but incremental and carefully thought-out changes. The
>    addition of new top-levels domains is a very disturbing influence. 
> It
>    carries great cost. It should only be undertaken when there is a 
> very
>    clear benefit to the new domain. In the case of the proposed .mobi
>    domain, the change is actually detrimental.
>
> The Economics of Domain Names
>
>    In practice, for most domain name owners, the part between the "www"
>    and the top level domain is their brand, or their name. It is
>    something they need to protect. This means that in practice, a 
> serious
>    organization to avoid confusion has to own its domain in every
>    non-geographical top level domain. For a large company, the cost of
>    this may be insignificant. For a small enterprise, a non-profit
>    organization or a family, the cost becomes very significant.
>
>    The chief effect of the introduction of the .biz and .info domains
>    appears to have been a cash influx for the domain name registries.
>    Example Inc. as mentioned above owns example.com, org and .net. Does
>    it also have to buy .biz, .info, and .name to avoid confusion and 
> the
>    misappropriation of my name by others? Will I have to also rent
>    "example.mobi" in case it want to make information available for
>    people who use wireless equipment?
>
>    The market for second-level domains is a market for a limited
>    resource. After an unstable period when the first come first served
>    system was in play and greedy squatters grabbed domains simply for
>    speculation, it has now settled down. Introducing new TLDs has two
>    effects.
>
>    The first effect is a little like printing more money. The value of
>    one's original registration drops. At the same time, the cost of
>    protecting one's brand goes up (from the cost of three domains to
>    four, five, ...).
>
>    The value of each domain name such as example.com also drops because
>    of brand dilution and public confusion. Even though most people
>    largely ignore the last segment of the name, when it is actually 
> used
>    to distinguish between different owners, this increases the mental
>    effort required to remember which company has which top level 
> domain.
>    This makes the whole name space less usable.
>
>    Is it fair to reduce the value of these domains which have been
>    acquired at great cost by their owners?
>
>    The second effect is that instability is brought on. There is a 
> flurry
>    of activity to reserve domain names, a rush one cannot afford to 
> miss
>    in order to protect one's brand. There is a rash of attempts to 
> steal
>    well-known or valuable domains. The whole process involves a lot of
>    administration, a lot of cost per month, a lot of business for those
>    involved in the domain name business itself, and a negative value to
>    the community.
>
> Fairness
>
>    As we have seen, the choice of a tree structure for domain names is
>    one which has costs and benefits, and the community currently 
> accepts
>    both. The cost of confusion, and of extra name registrations, is 
> high.
>    When the benefits of the new domain itself are small or negative (as
>    we discuss below), then one looks for incentive. The large amount of
>    money that has changed hands for domain names might lead a person to
>    suspect that this was the motivation. Under these circumstances, to
>    increase public trust, proposals from non-profit organizations would
>    raise less suspicion.
>
>    The root of the domain name system is a single public resource, by
>    design. Its control must be for and, indirectly, by the people as a
>    whole. To give away a large chunk of this to a private group would 
> be
>    simply a betrayal of the public trust put in ICANN.

>    The .mobi domain is described as being for the use of a community. 
> To
>    quote the proposal, the target community for the .mobi TLD is:
>
>      * Individual and business consumers of mobile devices,services and
>        applications
>      * Mobile content and service providers
>      * Mobile operators
>      * Mobile device manufacturers and vendors
>      * IT technology and software vendors who serve the mobile 
> community
>
>    This is in fact a mixture of reasons. It sounds as though there is a
>    use for ".mobi" when the provider of a service intends it to be for
>    the benefit of mobile users. There appears to be a desire to limit 
> the
>    use of ".mobi" to companies -- perhaps those in the group.
