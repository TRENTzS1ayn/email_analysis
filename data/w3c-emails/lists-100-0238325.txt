The annotation interface has been improved for identifying people.

Logged-in user see a drop-down RECOGNIZE list of names when annotating. 
Users manage their recognize list from their Account page, like a buddy 
list. An ALL list is also supplied to from which to add names to one's 
RECOGNIZE list.  The ALL list  currently includes all 2004 presenters 
and was cleaned up by Nick so it works with AKT's data.

Nick, we should see how to push new names back to you, or maybe ignore 
non-presenter names for the duration of the conference.

This isn't perfect, and there is the possibility of getting Robert 
Smith and Bob Smith. But it is a start.

To see:
1) http://w3photos.org/photos
2) login sample3 pw: sample3
3) Go to ManageAccount Page
4) Pick gallery, pick image
5) annotate
6) go to Account Settings
7) Adjust RECOGNIZE list
