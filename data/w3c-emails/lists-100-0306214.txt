hi all.

seeing that the spec and doc is linked from the w3photo site, and that 
the annotations use http://www.w3.org/2004/02/image-regions#, I changed
the namespace back from http://www.w3.org/2004/03/image-regions#, so that
spec and instance data have the same URIs.

I can read the logs only, but many people seem to be talking about the
project. congrats! I hope the server survives being slashdotted...


greetinx from europe,
benjamin
