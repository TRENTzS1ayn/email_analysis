hmm, can't check AKTivePhoto atm (my provider seems to have
routing problems), but the rdf at w3photo.org looks ok.
I only changed the namespace uri at [1] (spec and doc), which
had a "03" instead of "02". Does AKTive Photo already use the
"03" one (internally)? does this cause problems?

best,
benjamin
