Methinks the vocabulary scale shouldn't be changed. Mapping other scales into 
this seems quite easy, e.g. for Amazon it's simply a matter of multiplication 
by 2. There's nothing keeping anyone from displaying something different, 
perhaps even labels, in the user interface, as long as the code behind it 
takes care of the rest.
