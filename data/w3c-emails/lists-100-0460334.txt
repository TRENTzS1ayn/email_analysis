Dear colleagues,
 
 
Due to recent administrative/legal developments
within the structure of the Vienna Municipal Authority
- especially regarding the Office for Cultural Heritage and City
Archaeology -
we had to change the internet address 
of the conference "Archaeology and Computers 9":
Looted Past - Digitized Future. Hot spots in the Near East 
and the protection of cultural property - how computers can help
already a few weeks ago.
 
Those of you who have been entered in our conference data base 
before the developments took place have been informed by us via email.
 
Those of you who registered simply by sending an email had no problems.
 
Those of you who tried to register via the old web page
received some failure messages in return. 
We apologize for the inconvenience.
 
Therefore the registration deadline is postponed to 1st of June.
 
Please, take ad notam the new internet address: 
 <http://www.wien.gv.at/archaeologie/workshop/index.htm>
http://www.wien.gv.at/archaeologie/workshop/index.htm
 
The email address remains unchanged: 
kongrarchae@m07.magwien.gv.at
 
 
Sincerely, 
Friedrich Schipper.
(University of Vienna)
