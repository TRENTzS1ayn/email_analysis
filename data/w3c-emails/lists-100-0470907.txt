Dear photo fans,
 
  Let me add my compliments to all those who did the hard work to get the photo project launched.. especially Greg. Bravo!
 
  I hope we can now formulate a plan for the coming year, and attract sponsors to help us make the results visible.  I think the next challenge is to formulate clear scenarios of what a mature system would enable users to accomplish.  
 
  Of course we begin with the enjoyable aspects of finding pix of yourself and colleagues.  Then I think we should endeavor to be an intellectual resource to help users understand the evolution of the WWW community. I think the two-way tie in between the pix and the papers should be a primary goal.  Another interesting exploration might be to see if joint appearances of people in our photos are tied to shared interests, and maybe whether they predict future paper co-authorship.  
 
  What other scenarios do any of your think of?
 
  Regards from Seattle where I am at the NSF Digital Gov't conference... '
          best wishes... Ben Shneiderman
