Thanks to an early link to w3photo.org as an example semantic "web 
archive" by Mac World, and a subsequent slashdotting, W3photo seems to 
be getting repeated press coverage, plus mentions in many blogs.  
Congrats to all involved! And congrats, too everyone involved in RDF 
and OWL as both are being mentioned in all these articles.

Basically, the stories are about the TBL and the semantic web. But 
w3photo is mentioned on a short list of examples to explain the 
potential of the semantic web.  I think many of us here have a sense 
that attaching semantic metadata to photos could be an exemplary use 
case for the semantic web, a use case easily demonstrated and grok'ed.

Effective the Semantic Web is the Web as we know it put into database 
form and with added metadata. You can read more about it over on 
MacWorld and see a Semantic Web proof-of-concept at the Web Archive."

"Partially as a proof-of-concept for the Semantic Web, conference 
organizers are at work on a Web archive of photos from the current and 
past gatherings, complete with metadata annotations. The project Web 
site is http://w3photo.org/."
