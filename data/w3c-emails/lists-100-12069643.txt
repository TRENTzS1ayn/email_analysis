 ('us-ascii' encoding is not supported, stored as-is)
Attached is a draft version of the DOM3 LS test suite.

Why a draft:
------------
- to give you an idea something is happening with the test suite
- to allow you to comment these tests in an early phase
- the spec is still changing
- we need a couple of additions to the test suite stylesheets
- they haven't been tested yet against an implementation


The tests were build against the WD of 6 feb 2003 LS, 5 feb 2003 Core.

Coverage:
---------
I only briefly looked at a coverage of the suite against the spec.
What is *not* covered:

- MODE_ASYNCHRONOUS, all tests are SYNCHRONOUS tests
- DocumentLS.get/setAsync
- LSLoadEvent interface
- LSProgressEvent interface
- DOMBuilder.getFilter
- DOMWriter.get/setNewLine

Obviously interface coverage is only a piece of the cake.

Test we won't write:
--------------------
- ASYNCHRONOUS tests
- Event handling

What I will do next:
--------------------
- Run the tests against our implementation, we recently updated our LS
implementation against the latest draft.
- Add a couple of more tests
- Update the tests for spec changes
- fix errors in the tests


Known issues:
-------------
1. DocumentLSTest4 contains {
solution: fix test-to-java
2. DOMBuilderTest5, DOMEntityResolverTest0, DOMEntityResolverTest1,
   DOMInputSourceTest5 contain DOMUserData
solution: change test-to-java to convert DOMUserData to an Object
3. DOMEntityResolverTest1, static inner class
solution: change test-to-java so that inner classes aren't static
4. DOMInputSourceTest0 creation of inputstream
solution: add a way to create a DOMInputStream to the dtd generation
5. DOMInputSourceTest1, DOMInputSourceTest3 creation of DOMReader
solution: add a way to create a DOMReader to the dtd generation
6. DOMWriterTest1: inputstream/outputstream
solution: add a way to create an inputstream from an outputstream
7. DOMWriterTest2: Boolean.TRUE, Boolean.FALSE
solution: either DOMConfiguration will change or we need to support
Boolean object types.

A while ago Curt checked in a couple of ls tests. These 3 files should be
removed from cvs.
