* Beside the test development currently in progress it is useful to have
a test spec to give a quick overview of areas covered, allow the
participants to verify the reasoning behind the grouping of tests and to
expose possible holes in the coverage.

Yes - I agree - I'll get a complete list of our semantic requirements

In addition to the semantic requirements, I think that a list of test
