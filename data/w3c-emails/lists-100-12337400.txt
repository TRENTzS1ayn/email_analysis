Hopefully, this is what we will get once the technical architecture is up
and running (for more on this, see below) and when we have the DOM TS test
specification and tutorial on how to encode and submit tests in our
vocabulary.

This is the general idea behind the process outlined in the process document
(http://www.w3.org/DOM/DOMTS-Process). Once individual tests to indeed start
to be submitted, such a library will be provided online on the DOM TS page
(http://www.w3.org/DOM/Test). Also, an updated list of tests needed will be
provided in order to help developers submit tests that are relevant to the
DOM TS.
