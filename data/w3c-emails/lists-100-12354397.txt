We have indeed started with this. The idea is to construct a rich XML
vocabulary to allow for language-neutral descriptions of the test cases, and
the apply a transformation sheet to generate the desired particualr code. As
this is being done for the NIST test suite (which will be the backbone of
the DOM TS Level 1) we will have an updated version of this once the NIST
suite has been finalised.

The test case description format is being developed for the NIST test suite,
which in turn will form the back bone of the DOM TS Level 1 suite. Mary,
would you consider publishing what you have so far for public discussion, of
would you prefer postponing the discussion until later?
