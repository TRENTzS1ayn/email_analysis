I'd like to submit the attached test case descriptions on behalf of the
Microsoft Internet Explorer team.  This document represents a listing of
test cases that should be included in the DOM Level 1 Core section of
the test suite.

 

In the attached file, you'll find a list of test cases divided by
interface.  Each test case has a description, expected value, and
implementation specific information.  (An "X" in a column indicates that
the test case should be run in the implementation noted at the top of
the column.)

 

I hope this document will serve as a starting point for specific test
case discussion on this list.

 

Sincerely,

 

Jason Brittsan
