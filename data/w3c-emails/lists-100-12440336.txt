I've completed porting the NIST Java test suite to the JUnit framework and will be posting that to http://xmlconf.sourceforge.net later in the week.  Today, I have to dedicate my time to he demands of
another government agency, the IRS.

I will have a couple of errata that I'll need to confirm and document.  Of the top of my head, there were a couple of methods that depended on attributes appearing in a specific order in the
NamedNodeMap, there were a couple of methods that required entity references not to be coalesced and one method that looked like it intended to do a "for() { x = y.item(i) }" but forgot to call
y.item(i).

It does look extremely straightforward to convert the JUnit tests into JSUnit or CppUnit.
