Thanks for reminding us of these.


We're aware that some of the NIST tests, as they stand, are
implementation-dependent. Those tests will have to be rewritten during the
review process.


I wasn't aware of the bug in namednodemapChildNodeRange... others may have
been but it never hurts to point it out again.



>I will try to get the JUnit test suite up on SourceForge tonight.



Thanks again!
