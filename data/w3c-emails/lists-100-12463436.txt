I've made the source for my JUnit-hosted deriviatives of the NIST test suite available at
http://xmlconf.sourceforge.net.  You can either download the combined source and binary
zip file from http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=8114&release_id=31676
or you can access the source through the CVS (http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=8114)

The tests run using JUnit 3.5 and can test JAXP 1.0 or JAXP 1.1 compliant DOM parsers.

Xerces-J 1.3.1 does not report any test failures, crimson.jar and the other parser tested
had a moderate amount of test failures, but no investigation has been performed to 
determine if those failures were problems with the tests or actual non-conformances
with the spec.

A JBuilder 4 .jpx project and an Ant 1.2 build.xml file are provided.


------- readme.txt from domunit 0.0.1   ---------
domunit 0.0.1

domunit currently contains equivalents of the NIST DOM 1 test written for
the JUnit test framework (http://www.junit.org) and JAXP 1.1 or 1.0 compatible parsers.  

The tests were written to allow easy migration to JavaScript using JSUnit 
(http://www.jsunit.net) and CPPUnit (http://www.xprogramming.org/software)

To run the full set of tests, place domunit.jar, junit.jar and one of the following
combinations of jars in the same directory or on the class path.

xerces.jar
xml4j.jar
jaxp.jar and parser.jar (from Sun's JAXP 1.0 Reference Implementation)
jaxp.jar and crimson.jar (from Sun's JAXP 1.1 Reference Implementation)

and run:

java -jar domunit.jar


To test Oracle's XML Processor, place jaxp.jar from the JAXP 1.0 (not 1.1) Reference Implementation
and xmlparserv2.jar in the domunit.jar directory and run:

java -Djavax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory=oracle.xml.jaxp.JXDocumentBuilderFactory
    -jar domunit.jar

The following options can adjust the tests:

-Dnet.sourceforge.xmlconf.domunit.isExpandEntityReferences=true
-Dnet.sourceforge.xmlconf.domunit.isCoalescing=true
-Dnet.sourceforge.xmlconf.domunit.acceptXMLDeclPI=true

To build the project, use either the JBuilder 4 .jpx file or 
the Ant 1.2 build.xml file.
