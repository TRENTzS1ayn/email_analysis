My initial reaction is as I stated elsewhere: if the spec expects a certain
set of attributes, this is what the implementation should expose. I suppose
the min-bar would be this set.

I've now posed the question to the DOM WG. We would like to see a more
concrete example of what you mean, in order to be able to reach an answer.
Ambiguity in the spec, a test case, or more detailed desciption on what you
would expect from a certin test case would do.
