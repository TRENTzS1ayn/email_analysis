To:"Mary Brady"<mbrady@nist.gov>,<www-dom-ts@w3.org>

Mary,

 

The document that we submitted is a combination of tests that covers DOM
Core with all of its exceptions.  We have many of the test cases,
however, they are written to work in our own testing harness.  We would
be happy to answer questions and/or provide test coverage for tests that
are not currently represented in the NIST test suite.

 

Thanks,

Jason

Jason,

 

Thanks for the submission -- I'll compare the submitted list against our


list and post the results.  Do you actually have tests for all of these 

cases, or is this simply a list of tests that you would like to see.

Subject: [Test Case Submission] DOM Level 1 Core Test Cases

 

I'd like to submit the attached test case descriptions on behalf of the
Microsoft Internet Explorer team.  This document represents a listing of
test cases that should be included in the DOM Level 1 Core section of
the test suite.

 

In the attached file, you'll find a list of test cases divided by
interface.  Each test case has a description, expected value, and
implementation specific information.  (An "X" in a column indicates that
the test case should be run in the implementation noted at the top of
the column.)

 

I hope this document will serve as a starting point for specific test
case discussion on this list.

 

Sincerely,

 

Jason Brittsan
