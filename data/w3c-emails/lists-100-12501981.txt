I have completed converting the JUnit tests to JSUnit 1.1 (http://www.jsunit.net) and will be updating the xmlconf.sourceforge.net CVS tonight.  This has allowed me to run the NIST DOM 1 Java tests
against MSXML 3.

MSXML fails test document.testDocumentCreateProcessingInstruction, however I believe that the test's expected behavior is wrong and MSXML's behavior is correct.  Basically, MSXML fails the test
because the following line throws an exception:

   var newPINode = doc.createProcessingInstruction("XML","This is a new PI node");

complaining that "XML" is not a valid value for target.  http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#sec-pi specific prohibits the values "XML", "xml" or permutations from being the value of a PITarget.  It would
appear that raising an INVALID_CHAR_ERR would be appropriate response.

I would suggest modifying the test so that a legal value for target is used.  Adding additional tests to check whether exceptions are raised for illegal values may beneficial.
