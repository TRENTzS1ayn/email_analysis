We'll compare the tests in the NIST test suite and invite you to submit the
tests that do not already exist as soon as possible.

Thanks,

Dimitris,

Please let us know what tests are missing and we will try to provide
tests from our coverage, if possible.

Thanks,
Jason

Thanks very much, Jason

We will look into the particulars and compare the results. 

How would you like to proceed? Should we investigate what tests we have
already and incorporate those tests you have that do no exist already
and
incorporate those?

I'd like to submit the attached test case descriptions on behalf of the
Microsoft Internet Explorer team.  This document represents a listing of
test cases that should be included in the DOM Level 1 Core section of
the test suite.

 

In the attached file, you'll find a list of test cases divided by
interface.  Each test case has a description, expected value, and
implementation specific information.  (An "X" in a column indicates that
the test case should be run in the implementation noted at the top of
the column.)

I hope this document will serve as a starting point for specific test
case discussion on this list.

 

Sincerely,

 

Jason Brittsan
