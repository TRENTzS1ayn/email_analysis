As indicated in earlier mails, we have an ambition to provide a
language-neutral way to represent test cases, in order to be able to
generate specific language bindings. Could people on the list please convey
their beliefs about this? Previous experience? Rationale?

The reasons for are:

1. Uniform format for tests (regardless of whether the format allows for
auto-generation or not, we at least achieve simplified maintenance)
2. Provided that an agreed upon format exists, various communities can
submit XSLT sheets to allow for the generation to their preferred language.
3. Since this format would rely on similar activities within and outside of
the W3C, we would provide to the community a semi-standardized way to
express tests. It would almost certainly be reused.

The reasons against are:
1. Perhaps a uniform format implies too much overhead.
2. Given that a company (or a developer) has written a series of tests,
porting these to the format would require a lot of work.

Any other ideas?

Please comment on this.

Action items:
Mary, can you please send the latest version of the DTD you have for the
NIST tests to the list? Thanks.
Dimitris to investigate acceptance within the DOM WG


Kind regards,
