  Then that developer hasn't had sufficiently varied experiance!  The
DOM certainly isn't the only place this will bite them.

  They would have also failed for the old PyDOM implementation
(obsolete), and will also fail for my ParsedXML.DOM implementation
for use in the Zope application server.  Both use wrapper objects
around internal node data structures (eerily, they do so for the same
reason!  Bad Python 1.5.2, bad! ;).

  I don't recall seeing any statements about equality tests; the
definition of the semantics of a particular language's
equality-testing operator are defined by the language.  Java's "==" is
different from Python's "==" is different from Perl's "==".
  If anything, the DOM specifications should specifically state that
the relation of a language's native equality test to DOM object/node
identity is defined only by the bindings for the individual languages.
