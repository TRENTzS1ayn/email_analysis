My apologies for not attaching the file the first time.

Dimitris,

The attached file demonstrates the issue related to attributes.  When
the file is loaded in Internet Explorer 6 Beta 2, 98 attributes are
listed.  When the file is loaded into Netscape 6.01, 2 attributes are
listed.

Internet Explorer assigns a default value of an empty string to all
attributes for a variety of reasons.  Netscape does not do this.

The DOM Level 1 spec is ambiguous about what attributes would show up in
the attribute collection.  The min-bar in this case should be "id" and
"bgcolor" since they are specified on the tag; however a user agent
should not fail the test because extra attributes appear.

Thanks,
Jason

My initial reaction is as I stated elsewhere: if the spec expects a
certain
set of attributes, this is what the implementation should expose. I
suppose
the min-bar would be this set.

I've now posed the question to the DOM WG. We would like to see a more
concrete example of what you mean, in order to be able to reach an
answer.
Ambiguity in the spec, a test case, or more detailed desciption on what
you
would expect from a certin test case would do.
