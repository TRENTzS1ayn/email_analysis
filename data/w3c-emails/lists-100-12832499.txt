Jason,

I have brought this to the Working Group's attention. The issue has been
flagged as an open issue and is being discussed.

Thanks

Dimitris,

The attached file demonstrates the issue related to attributes.  When
the file is loaded in Internet Explorer 6 Beta 2, 98 attributes are
listed.  When the file is loaded into Netscape 6.01, 2 attributes are
listed.

Internet Explorer assigns a default value of an empty string to all
attributes for a variety of reasons.  Netscape does not do this.

The DOM Level 1 spec is ambiguous about what attributes would show up in
the attribute collection.  The min-bar in this case should be "id" and
"bgcolor" since they are specified on the tag; however a user agent
should not fail the test because extra attributes appear.

Thanks,
Jason

My initial reaction is as I stated elsewhere: if the spec expects a
certain
set of attributes, this is what the implementation should expose. I
suppose
the min-bar would be this set.

I've now posed the question to the DOM WG. We would like to see a more
concrete example of what you mean, in order to be able to reach an
answer.
Ambiguity in the spec, a test case, or more detailed desciption on what
you
would expect from a certin test case would do.
