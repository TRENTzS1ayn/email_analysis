The concept seems to be identical to JavaML which I've mentioned a few
times, a translator that takes Java source code and translates it to
an equivalent XML representation that could be processed by XSLT, etc,
to produce a language-independent representation of the tests.

All the recent discussions on round-tripping JUnit test code to the
language-independent representation would equally apply if java2xml
was used instead of JavaML.
