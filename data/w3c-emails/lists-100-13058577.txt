I don't expect the Java transform to be perfect, however I think that when
we start to walk through the NIST contributed tests, we will quickly
identify latent issues.

I have worked a little on a ECMAScript transform but haven't written enough
supporting code to run the few tests that I have generated.

Haven't done anything on Python.

I thought it was the most appropriate tool.  What alternatives would you
like to suggest?

The W3C CVS has anonymous read-access so unless we intentionally want to
prevent people from accessing the source, they are technically capable of
doing it.  Since the most significant audience for the test source and
harnesses are parser authors, I don't think that it is necessary to provide
an easier way to get at the source.

The standoff over using the W3C Software License was explicitly to allow
legitimate deriviative works.  I only made my contributions after I thought
this issue was resolved.  Reversing that decision and making the tests or
harness non-public would be detrimental to the effectiveness of the suite
and would do seriously bad things to my attitude.

I understand NIST's desire not to publish anything that isn't almost
perfect.  But it is impossible to determine any coverage issues and
discourages anyone else from trying to contribute tests until the NIST tests
are committed to the CVS (which will hopefully happen shortly).
