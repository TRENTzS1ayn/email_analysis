I don't expect the Java transform to be perfect, however I think that when
we start to walk through the NIST contributed tests, we will quickly
identify latent issues.

I have worked a little on a ECMAScript transform but haven't written enough
supporting code to run the few tests that I have generated.

Haven't done anything on Python.

[dd] We'll definitely allow some time to tweak the transforms if needed once
we have the test files ready.

I thought it was the most appropriate tool.  What alternatives would you
like to suggest?

[dd] none, it was merely a comment aimed at raising a discussion if anyone
feels we should have another tool. ANT works fine for me, besides we can
really use any tool we like for building the TS before packaging it.

The W3C CVS has anonymous read-access so unless we intentionally want to
prevent people from accessing the source, they are technically capable of
doing it.  Since the most significant audience for the test source and
harnesses are parser authors, I don't think that it is necessary to provide
an easier way to get at the source.

[dd] The DOM WG expressed the wish to 
1. have a simple harness around the tests, for example for on-line checking
using ECMA script
2. be able to write your own harness around the tests

I believed this is allowed by the license as it was finalized, correct me if
I'm wrong.

The standoff over using the W3C Software License was explicitly to allow
legitimate deriviative works.  I only made my contributions after I thought
this issue was resolved.  Reversing that decision and making the tests or
harness non-public would be detrimental to the effectiveness of the suite
and would do seriously bad things to my attitude.

[dd] Nothing in the development of the DOM TS will be non-public, so I don't
see there is any reason to worry. Given that people will be able to download
the tests from the CVS, they may also want to write the harness around it.
One way of going about is to just inform on what files are definitely
needed, then let people do what they want.

> 4. Release of NIST tests, sanity check, editing, being done.

I understand NIST's desire not to publish anything that isn't almost
perfect.  But it is impossible to determine any coverage issues and
discourages anyone else from trying to contribute tests until the NIST tests
are committed to the CVS (which will hopefully happen shortly).

[dd] I agree, I believe we will be able to go into sanity checking phase
quite soon.
