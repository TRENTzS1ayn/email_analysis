[mb] We have an ECMAScript transform from a derivative Schema -- some minor
mod's that were made to one of Curt's earlier versions -- I don't think it
will serve
as the transform, but it may be useful to see the less than polished code
that is
generated -- the tests seem to run in both IE and Mozilla using this
harness --
I'll have to look into making it available.  It may provide some starting
points.

[mb] Ant works for me, but it is not trivial to get ant, cvs, the
appropriate parsers,
xslt processor, etc working together.  Some documentation would sure help!

[mb] Not sure what you mean here -- our less than perfect tests are and
have been available for some time.  The tests have been modified, but have
not all been translated and compiled.  I would expect that any contribution
would
not be accepted until it met this minimum requirement.
