[mb] Ant works for me, but it is not trivial to get ant, cvs, the
appropriate parsers,
xslt processor, etc working together.  Some documentation would sure help!

[dd] I just published the DOM TS FAQ and will work some more on the
technical documentation during the weekend. If anyone has anything handy,
please mail it to me so that I can include it.

[mb] Not sure what you mean here -- our less than perfect tests are and
have been available for some time.  The tests have been modified, but have
not all been translated and compiled.  I would expect that any contribution
would
not be accepted until it met this minimum requirement.

[dd] I actually had some problems reaching your test matrix page, and thus
the tests themselves. I would have liked to see the test files when sanity
checking transforms (both for schema and code generation) using them as
samples, which I take can be done now.
