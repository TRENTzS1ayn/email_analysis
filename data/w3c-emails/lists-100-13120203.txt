I've used the tests that I scraped from the test matrix to test the transforms and build processes, however it is not worthwhile trying to analyze those tests and correct or improve them since there
is no mechanism to get any changes incorporated and the files may be undergoing independent changes within NIST.

Until the tests are put in the CVS, it isn't worthwhile for anyone else to spend any time on them.  In an earlier message, I thought that you were hesitant to put the tests in the CVS until they were
near perfect.

I think that we have the freedom to accept contributions in any condition that we choose.  Ideally, a contributor would have tests that would transform, compile and run before they submitted the tests
and we would double check that before committing the tests to the CVS to avoid breaking the build process (in rare cases, we could have a whiteboard area for tests under construction).

However, since we don't have a buildable product at this time and having the initial test load in any form is valuable, I'd be in favor of your committing the tests in their current condition and we
as a team can make the necessary changes to the test cases or transforms.

Some minor notes:

I think the package attribute on the <test> and <suite> elements is extraneous and expect to remove it from the generated schemas and DTD's and ignore it in the transforms.  If you are going to commit
tests, you may go ahead and strip it out now.  The package name will be based on the location of the test.

DOM Level 1 tests definitions should be added to 2001/DOM-Test-Suite/tests/level1/core, corresponding test files should added to 2001/DOM-Test-Suite/files/level1/core.

If we create a <log> element that is used like the following:

<test>
   <metadata>
<log>
$Log$
      </log>
   </metadata>
   <var...>
</test>

The CVS will insert the update log within the element.  This could also be copied to the generated tests.  This would require that you avoid using &, > or <'s in the update comments.
