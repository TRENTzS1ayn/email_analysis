They could be in the same directory as long as we use a distinct extension for test definitions.  If they are all .xml files, then ANT can't determine which files are test definitions and should be
validated or transformed and which are test resources.  

How about .tst for test definitions?

If we decide otherwise, we can add the log elements at any time.   I'll put that one on hold.  However, leveraging the CVS log is definitely a better approach than trying to put the equivalent log
explicitly in the test.
