  I was hoping that Ant would give us something smarter, at least for
XML.  One of the advantages of using different DTDs/schema for
different documents is that you can determine what sort of thing each
represents.  I'd like to see a way to match based on publicId/systemId
and the root element, and dispatch on that.
  Perhaps I should refresh my Java skills by writing an xmldispatch
"action" for Ant:

<target name="process-xml" depends="*.xml">
  <xmldispatch>
    <case rootelement="testcase">
      <!-- convert to xUnit tests -->
      </case>
    <otherwise>
      <!-- copy to some other location -->
      </otherwise>
  </xmldispatch>
</target>

  Yes, that can a real problem for maintainability!

  Yes, but the advantage here is that the data remains "close" to the
test itself, and the shape of the tree does not need to be duplicated
(another maintenance task).

  Now just where do you think I'm going to keep those coffee grounds I
was saving???
