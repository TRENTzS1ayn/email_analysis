One reason to avoid 8.3 is the test's names as they currently stand, take a
look at the NIST matrix...

Perhaps x.3 is a better way to go if we want to avoid long suffixes.

.domtest would also work, so that's mainly a design issue. I'd go for .tst
personally.

  I'm not sure I understand just what the limitation is.  I'll have to
dig into Ant a little more to figure it out.

  Ugh.

  Fine.  Agreed that the log should be maintained in CVS rather than
doing it manually.

  Could, but there's probably no specific reason to avoid 8.3, either.
