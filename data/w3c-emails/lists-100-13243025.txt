I've used the tests that I scraped from the test matrix to test the
transforms and build processes, however it is not worthwhile trying to
analyze those tests and correct or improve them since there
is no mechanism to get any changes incorporated and the files may be
undergoing independent changes within NIST.

Until the tests are put in the CVS, it isn't worthwhile for anyone else to
spend any time on them.  In an earlier message, I thought that you were
hesitant to put the tests in the CVS until they were
near perfect.

I think that we have the freedom to accept contributions in any condition
that we choose.  Ideally, a contributor would have tests that would
transform, compile and run before they submitted the tests
and we would double check that before committing the tests to the CVS to
avoid breaking the build process (in rare cases, we could have a whiteboard
area for tests under construction).

However, since we don't have a buildable product at this time and having the
initial test load in any form is valuable, I'd be in favor of your
committing the tests in their current condition and we
as a team can make the necessary changes to the test cases or transforms.

[dd] I agree, as I expect it to take less time if there are more of us
involved in the process of cleaning up tests, much as people have been able
to comment on Curt's tranforms. 

Also, comminting files to the CVS in no way implies that they are the final
constituents of the test suite, so they can be far from perfect as far as
the final test suite is concerned.


Some minor notes:

I think the package attribute on the <test> and <suite> elements is
extraneous and expect to remove it from the generated schemas and DTD's and
ignore it in the transforms.  If you are going to commit
tests, you may go ahead and strip it out now.  The package name will be
based on the location of the test.

[dd] The location of the test once we've decided it's ready to form part of
the suite, I presume?
 
DOM Level 1 tests definitions should be added to
2001/DOM-Test-Suite/tests/level1/core, corresponding test files should added
to 2001/DOM-Test-Suite/files/level1/core.

If we create a <log> element that is used like the following:

<test>
   <metadata>
<log>
$Log$
      </log>
   </metadata>
   <var...>
</test>

The CVS will insert the update log within the element.  This could also be
copied to the generated tests.  This would require that you avoid using &, >
or <'s in the update comments.

[dd] Do we solce this if we wrap it in a CDATA section like Fred indicated?
