I've updated the general page at http://www.w3.org/DOM/Test and added an FAQ
at http://www.w3.org/DOM/Test/Documents/DOMTSFAQ.html.

Please look through and comment so that I can update it further.

PS Philippe, for simplicity's sake I've put the faq.xml, .xsl and .dtd in
the Test directory as well not to break too many links. If this is contrary
to practice, please indicate.
