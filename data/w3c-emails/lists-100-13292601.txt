[dd] voted as below (changed my mind on the extension, .domtest is
preferrable)

There needs to be some mechanism to distinguish test cases from test
resources (like staff.xml in the NIST tests) from the test definitions.  The
alternatives in place or discussed are:

a) parallel directory tree for resource files.  For example,
files/level1/core/staff.xml.  Tests also use .xml extension.
b) child directory for resource files.  For example,
tests/level1/core/files/staff.xml.  Tests also use .xml extension.
c) tests and resources in same directory, tests use .domtest extension, all
other files (except .bak) are resource files.
d) tests and resources in same directory, tests use .tst extension, all
other files (except .bak) are resource files.
e) Resource files are explicitly excluded by individual file name in
build.xml

Discussion:

a is the approach in the current build.xml, but there is not a significant
cost to change.  Option d has a moderate chance of conflicting with file
extensions of other testing software.  c and d has the advantage of keeping
the resource files in the same directory which would consistent with the use
of relative URL's.
