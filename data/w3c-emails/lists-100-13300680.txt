  Using CDATA changes the details of the restriction, but there's
still a restriction:  we can't use ]]> in the checkin comments.  Since
that's a restriction less likely to be violated, we can probably live
with it.
  It's also possible to write a tool to scan the CVS logs to detect
violations in the comments, and correct them (or tell a human to do
so).  It probably makes the most sense to write that only if we
actually observe ourselves violating the requirement
