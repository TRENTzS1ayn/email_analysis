No.  The current build.xml copies the resource files into the same directory as the generated .class files and the implementation of DOMTestCase.load() resolves URI relative to the location of the
.class file in domunit.jar.  Keeping the resource and test definitions files in the same directory would make the relative URI's valid in the source.

If the tests were already in the CVS, I would agree that this was too much of a disruptive change, hence the desire to resolve it before you add your tests.  The mechanism of changing the extensions
on a file system before committing to the CVS should be trivial (rename *.xml *.domtest and then copy in the resource files for Win32).

I now believe the targetURI attribute is redundant since we can determine the value from the context and additionally the current values can be readily changed (either before or after initial commit)
using a multifile regexp replacement, so I would not let concern about those being out-of-synch hold things up.  If it is trivial (less than 5 minutes) for you to remove both the targetURI and package
attributes before committing, you can do so or you leave them both in and we can ignore them and remove them up later.
