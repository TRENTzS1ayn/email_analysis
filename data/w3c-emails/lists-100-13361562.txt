Dimitris and I would prefer using *.domtest, Fred would prefer a /files subdirectory and neither group would veto the other.  At this point, it is basically Mary's call.

I think that we are all anxious to have at least some tests in the CVS so we can move forward.  

If there is some technical problem, like you can't access the CVS, then if you could provide the tests to one of us and we can put it in the CVS on your behalf.  If the current files are in the test
matrix or otherwise accessible on the NIST site, then I'd be willing to do something like my previous scraping to get the files into the CVS.

Mary, are there any other issues that need to be resolved before we are able to add the tests to the CVS and is there anything we can do to speed the process?
