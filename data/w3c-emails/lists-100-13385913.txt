I made a series of small changes to the transforms and build files in the CVS to account for the change of resource file locations, to remove unnecessarily required ID's in the DTD and to remove the package and targetURI attributes.

A zip file with a sample test and the current DTD's and schema are at http://home.houston.rr.com/curta/sampleTest.zip

I intentionally used all the metadata elements (well except for relation) for demonstration purposes.
