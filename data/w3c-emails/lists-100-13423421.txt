It was a tossup and since Mary has the tests, I'm willing to go with her preference which was to maintain the .xml extension and to isolate resource files in a files subdirectory.

The metadata elements are in the test definition namespace (for ease of test authoring) but patterned after Dublin Core expressed in RDF/XML (for interoperability with RDF).  An RDF representation of
the inline metadata could readily be generated by an XSLT transform.  

The in-line metadata only tries to capture information that is relatively constant about the test itself (its description, what it tests, who wrote it) and not opinions about the tests as expressed in
emails or in DOM WG deliberations,  judgements on its correctness, or its inclusion in test suites.  That type of information would probably initial be in the SourceForge tracker, but could be in
external metadata files and my preference would be that these files be RDF.
