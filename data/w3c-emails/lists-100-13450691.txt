No that was just a possibility, not something that I ever wrote.  Probably easier just to convert the files manually from the Java source, but would have to really look at the source documents to see
what the best approach would be.  Given the esoteric nature of our little domtest language, I think we should be open, at least in this phase, to submissions in other languages since we can probably
convert the tests into domtest pretty quickly.
