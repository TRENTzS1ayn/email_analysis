I submitted a bug (http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=3132) on the problem that required us to replace the parser distributed with Ant with the Xerces parser.  It will apparently be fixed in the Ant 1.4 Beta 2 that is due out shortly.  At least with formal betas, we don't have to tell people to get nightly builds.
