Sorry, I inadvertantly replied off list.  Dimitris's off-list reply to my off-list reply appears later to provide context for the following comment.

Option a explicitly states that if we accept tests written in a general purpose programming language we would only use it as a pattern for creating an equivalent DOMTSML test.  However, we wouldn't be
obligated to accept such tests and would only do so if we thought the tests were a valuable resource and it would be better to take them how they are than to not have them.

This far in, I'm definitely committed to the XML based representation.  At the start my preference was test development in general purpose languages first, language independent infrastructure second,
but now that the infrastructure is mostly in place, it makes no sense to try to integrate tests in general purpose languages.

While we are on this subject, haven't heard from the Microsoft guys for a long time.  I assume that they are not the party that you are talking about, but they might have a similar situation, a
substantial body of tests in a general purpose language where requiring the contributor to make the conversion to DOMTSML might be a barrier.
