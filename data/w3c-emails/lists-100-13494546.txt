I've uploaded a variant of the earlier copy.xsl to http://home.houston.rr.com/curta/copy.xsl that now adds <subject> metadata elements for the last method or attribute invoked (assuming that it is the best subject for the test) or any method wrapped in an <assertDOMException>.  For exceptions, it also adds a <subject> for the exception code and for the code within the description of the method. 

The transform requires that dom1-interfaces.xml be in the same directory.
