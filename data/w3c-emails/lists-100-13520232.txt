Great, thanks!  I've got a copy -- I'll run it
through the tests and should be ready to
commit them today.

The timing would be great since I could spend some time with them over the
weekend.

In attribute values that have single quotes surrounding double quotes, the
double quotes
are transformed to &quot; -- do you think
that this will cause any problems in the end?

I had noticed that earlier.  Only the aestetics are different, any XML
processor should see them as equivalent.  If you think
"&quot;whatever&quot;" is ugly, you could do a global search and replace to
change them back to '".  However, I wouldn't bother.
