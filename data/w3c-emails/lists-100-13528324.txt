Okay -- I'm a little further -- all the tests
seem to translate, but any test that has
a <member> subelement as part of a
<var> declaration does not carry it's
attributes through the translation.  I've
attached an example, the translated file,
and the transformation.  I've changed the
transformation slightly -- added
<contributor> and <date>.
