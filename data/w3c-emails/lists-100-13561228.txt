Sorry, I inadvertantly replied off list.  Dimitris's off-list reply to my
off-list reply appears later to provide context for the following comment.

Option a explicitly states that if we accept tests written in a general
purpose programming language we would only use it as a pattern for creating
an equivalent DOMTSML test.  However, we wouldn't be
obligated to accept such tests and would only do so if we thought the tests
were a valuable resource and it would be better to take them how they are
than to not have them.

This far in, I'm definitely committed to the XML based representation.  At
the start my preference was test development in general purpose languages
first, language independent infrastructure second,
but now that the infrastructure is mostly in place, it makes no sense to try
to integrate tests in general purpose languages.

While we are on this subject, haven't heard from the Microsoft guys for a
long time.  I assume that they are not the party that you are talking about,
but they might have a similar situation, a
substantial body of tests in a general purpose language where requiring the
contributor to make the conversion to DOMTSML might be a barrier.

[dd] As far as i remember, Microsoft stated that they do not have anything
significantly different to contribute than the tests that were pointed to
from NIST's first test matrix. Since this was published some time ago, maybe
the situation has changed. If so, please feel free to donate tests.

As far as I rememer, the Microsoft tests were written in Javascript.
