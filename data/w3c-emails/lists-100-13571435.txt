FYI, Mary sent a zipped file containing 268 tests Friday evening:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom-ts-submission/2001Aug/0000.html

I also have a few problems with the W3C CVS, could there be a mixup with the
logon accounts? I've been assigned dom-ts-4, I think Curt has dom-ts-1, what
about Mary and Fred?

Best,
