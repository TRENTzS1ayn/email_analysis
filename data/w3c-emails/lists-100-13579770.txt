Sorry, it was the other way around. Curt has 4, I have 1. Still doesn't
work, though, I'll have to check with the W3C system team.

FYI, Mary sent a zipped file containing 268 tests Friday evening:

I also have a few problems with the W3C CVS, could there be a mixup with the
logon accounts? I've been assigned dom-ts-4, I think Curt has dom-ts-1, what
about Mary and Fred?

Best,
