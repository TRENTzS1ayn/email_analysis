Thanks for commiting the tests, Curt. I'll send you an off-list message
describing my problems so far.
 
Best,

?mne: Tests committed


Well, I realized that I was going to be too late for church and might as
well do it now.  I've just committed the NIST tests to the CVS.  The
supporting files (staff.xml, staff.dtd) were not included, so I'll provide
commit copies from the NIST Java suite.
 
There did seem to be one test (at least) that locked up the current
test-to-java transform.  I'll try to work through the issues to get this
runnable for Java this afternoon.
 
Dimitris, if you can explain what problems you are having with the CVS
off-list maybe I can help.  I'm not an expert but have been down that path
before.
