?mne: Full compile, almost ready to run


I got a lot done today (and tonight and early the next morning).  As I have
a conference call in less than 6 hours, I have to crash.
 
The source in the CVS will DTD validate, schema validate, generate java
code, compile and jar.  The only things missing to run is the definition of
a test suite (which should take all of a few minutes by capturing the output
of a dir or ls depending on OS preference).
 
The "junit-run" target which produces the JUnit adapter jar apparently has
some problem.  Probably induced by the "avalon-run" target which still
works.
 
I did the build with a CVS build of Ant and Xalan 2.1.  Two test files would
cause Xalan 2.1 to lock up (look in build.xml for excludes to see the
particular names).  These files could be transformed using Xalan 2.2 D9 or
Saxon, however Xalan 2.2 had many problems with Ant, so it was easier just
to exclude them for the time being.
 
I used Sun's MSV (multischema validator,
http://www.sun.com/software/xml/developers/multischema/;$sessionid$OHJQSFIAA
CAN3AMTA1FU5YQ
<http://www.sun.com/software/xml/developers/multischema/;$sessionid$OHJQSFIA
ACAN3AMTA1FU5YQ> ) to check the tests against the schemas which will
identify underdeclared variables and bad literals before starting the
generation and compile steps.  To run MSV:
 
java -jar \msv-20010719\msv.jar build\dom1.xsd tests\level1\cases\*.xml
