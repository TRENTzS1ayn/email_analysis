I didn't try to modularize the DOM 2 DTD and Schema, basically they should be buildable (targets dom2-dtd and dom2-schema) now but they include all subspecs of Level 2.  I think it would be difficult
to modularize with XML Schema and near impossible with DTD's.

In case nobody has noticed (and it is not something that I'm particularly proud of), I had to change all the test names to all lower case to be consistent with the file names in the .ZIP file.  Once
the files went into the repository with all lower case names, it was much easier to change the test names to be consistent with the file names.  I've had CVS nightmare scenarios trying to change the
filename capitalization in the past and I didn't want to relive that.

That said, if you want to use mixed case test names in the DOM level 2 submission, try to maintain a mixed case file name in the ZIP archive.
