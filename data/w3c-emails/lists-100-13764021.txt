To be able to run a suite of tests, I've created the SuiteDOMLevel1.xml file
attached to this e-mail. (Something does not seem to work for tests
documentcreatecdatasection and textsplittextnomodificationallowederr, so
those are commented out at this moment.)

Another small issue: in quite a few tests the comment /* undeclared */ is
present instead of a type cast (for example, the
attrcreatedocumentfragment.java test contains the following statement,
although the newOne variable is declared:
appendedChild = docFragment.appendChild(/* undeclared */newOne);)
