That's  Level 1 behavior if the node is read-only. See
http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-DOM-Level-1-20000929/level-one-core.html#ID-F68D080

(I seem to remember that there may have been an erratum in earlier versions
of the DOM which failed to define this behavior, whcih might explain the
confusion...?)
