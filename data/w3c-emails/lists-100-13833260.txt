Documentation
I've updated the main DOM TS page with pointers to the latest material as
well as acknowledgments to Curt and Fred especially. We still have the
architectural document, which will be some kind of cut & paste from us all.
I expect it to cover everything from submitting tests to how these are
built, packaged and made downloadable. So, anyone who has anything on this,
mail me so that I can make a document out of it. Also, we have the FAQ that
could easily be updated in parallel. Finally, an on-line tutorial would be
good, to simplify for people want to run the current TS and submit tests for
the next levels.

CVS cleanup
As I haven't been able to commit anything (given my problems with WinCVS)
this is just a reminder to look over what we have.

File transfering to domconftest
I suppose this will start taking place over the next few days. As we've
noted before, it is not highly probable that more than one person will deal
with issues concerning tests. Still, I propose that we send a mail to this
list before starting to move tests around, in case there is a simple answer.
