Announcement
I suppose xml-dev is the most natural place to start. Any other ideas? I
should start doing this when the TS is indeed downloadable.

Test Matrix
We could have one on the W3C machines, simply looking through what tests we
have. Also, I will include information for easy access on the main DOM TS
page on what tests we have and what tests we need so that people will knwo
what to submit (I take thsi to be particularly relevant for levels 2 &3)

Any other issues that need to be put in the issues list?
