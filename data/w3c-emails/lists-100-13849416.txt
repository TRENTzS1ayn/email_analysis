We did add two more test cases as a result
of DOM Level 1, Second Edition:

    documentCreateElementDefaultAttr
    documentCreateEntityReferenceKnown

There were other changes, but just in wording for
the test purposes -- we already had tests that covered
these conditions.

I too would think that we would want the DOM Level 1
Test Suite to support Second Edition -- Is it really still
a Working Draft, as it states on the Technical Reports
Web Page?
