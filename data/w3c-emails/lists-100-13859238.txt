Definitely the test suite should verify the behavior as described in the recommendation and errata which also should be equivalent to DOM Level 1 Second Edition.  I believe that my statement about
working draft was that DOM Level 1 SE was still at Working Draft.  Definitely, the test suite is the most malleable component.

The only errata that appears to effect the markup language (as opposed to errata that would effect only the tests) is the addition of throws clause for Attr.value and the only place that this comes
into play is when DTD or Schema validating tests, roughly equivalent to using Lint on a program to check for warnings.  Since there is only one test that it affects, my suggestion was just to turn
lint off for this test.

I'll investigate building DTD's and Schema's from the DOM 1 SE tonight and report to the list.
