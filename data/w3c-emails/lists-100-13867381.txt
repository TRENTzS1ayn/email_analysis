Sorry; I misread.

You're right, the second edition does still show as a Working Draft. Minor
errata are still trickling in, which is probably why it hasn't been
officially promoted... but it might indeed be time to nail it down and then
bring out a third edition if/when anything needs further work. Or maybe
just advance it to CR, as a promise that we won't change it unless we must.

Meanwhile... You're probably right; the conservative solution is to tell
folks not to validate that one test until this goes golden.
