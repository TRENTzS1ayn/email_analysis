At least a few more days off.

A test matrix should be fairly easily built from the in-line metadata in the tests.  

The most obvious problem is that the <subject>'s that were automatically generated assumed that the final method that was called was the subject of the test.  That might be the case sometimes, but
sometimes the last method was a <nodeType> or similar when the real subject of the test was a previous <createAttribute> or the like.

I guess that I could extend the transform that I did for Mary, so that it would add subjects for the last four or so methods (with comments that identify what the URL's point to) and somebody could
manually go through and remove those that were not appropriate.
