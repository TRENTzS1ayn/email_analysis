There are a couple of small things that could help out.  If anyone wants to take a shot of these, I would appreciate it.

1. A Javascript routine that creates a duplicate of a document.  Should work with both Netscape/Mozilla 6 and MSXML 2+.

2. JavaDoc targets in build.xml for the generated tests and the support classes.  Suggestions on changes to generated documentation comments in tests.  Occassional reminders that I need to add more extensive comments to adapter classes and abstract classes.

3. Either an example of how to kludge synchronous XML parsing in Netscape (sleeping until the load event if dispatched or some other type of stall) or a pretty definitive statement that it can't be done right now.  

Using asychronous parsing for each load() statement would probably prevent compatibility with JsUnit since it would expect the test to be over when control is returned from runTest.  However, if the implementation of load performs a clone of a previous (asychronously) loaded document (See 1 above), then end of the test and the return to the caller would be coincidental.
