MSV apparently gets confused with dom2.xsd.  If someone could provide another command line alternative for validating multiple files that do not have xsi:schemaLocation attributes against dom2.xsd, it would be useful since schema validation picks up a lot more errors.  Possibly MSXML 4 with Windows Scripting Host?   You can test it by changing "Level-2" to "Level-1" in the namespaces in dom2.xsd and try to validate tests/level1/core/*.xml
