The javadoc target for build.xml could look something like this:

<target name="run-javadoc" depends="init">
        <mkdir dir="${build.dir}/javadoc"/>
        <javadoc packagenames="org.w3c.domts.*"
                 sourcepath="java;java/junit;${java.build.dir}"
                 destdir="${build.dir}/javadoc"
                 author="true"
                 version="true"
                 use="true"
                 windowtitle="DOM Test Suite"
                 bottom="Copyright &#169; 2001 World Wide Web Consortium.

There are a couple of small things that could help out.  If anyone wants to
take a shot of these, I would appreciate it.

1. A Javascript routine that creates a duplicate of a document.  Should work
with both Netscape/Mozilla 6 and MSXML 2+.

2. JavaDoc targets in build.xml for the generated tests and the support
classes.  Suggestions on changes to generated documentation comments in
tests.  Occassional reminders that I need to add more extensive comments to
adapter classes and abstract classes.

3. Either an example of how to kludge synchronous XML parsing in Netscape
(sleeping until the load event if dispatched or some other type of stall) or
a pretty definitive statement that it can't be done right now.

Using asychronous parsing for each load() statement would probably prevent
compatibility with JsUnit since it would expect the test to be over when
control is returned from runTest.  However, if the implementation of load
performs a clone of a previous (asychronously) loaded document (See 1
above), then end of the test and the return to the caller would be
coincidental.
