This was presumably meant to be sent to the list.

There is a test-to-ecmascript.xsl in the CVS right now that creates
Javascript that is obviously strongly reminsent of the Java generated from
test-to-java.xsl.

The major issue is the apparent lack of a method to synchronously load an
XML document in Netscape 6/Mozilla.  Much earlier (and more na?ve) attempts
to run DOM tests asychronously have exhausted the
call stack crashed.  I've posted a query on the Netscape DOM newsgroups and
have some of my own ideas to address the problem, but have, for obvious
reasons, not spent any time on it yet.

I believe there are issues that we will have to get some resolution from the
DOM WG in regard to the ECMAScript binding.  Specifically, the null string
behavior that was originally mentioned in the
hasFeature thread on the www-dom earlier this summer.  This also affects
Entity.systemId, Entity.publicId, Notation.systemId, Notation.publicId and
an HTML related method that I can't remember off the
top of my head.  Basically, all these properties state that null should be
returned under certain circumstances.  MSXML, and I believe,
Netscape/Mozilla return a zero-length string which is consistent
with ECMAScript's string type not having null in its value space.

The major problem with running the suite (naively again) from a remote site
is the number of loads of the support files (staff.xml, staff.dtd).  If it
is possible to load the resource files once and
then provide clones in response to the load() calls, then the suite should
perform adequately.

That is what is in the DTD and used in previous personal iterations.  I just
didn't have the chance to build one before crashing.

I think the inline metadata has been adequately resolved.
