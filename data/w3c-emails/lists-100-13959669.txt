I think that we want to maintain the definition of one test == one XML
document since that gives us a revision history of each test instead of a
revision history of all tests for a particular interface.  In addition,
hopefully we will have tests from different sources and trying to have
different authors working in the same file is just not a pleasant thing.

The one test == one Java file/class flows out of that since it is most
natural to do a case by case conversion using XSLT.  If it class bloat is
really a significant issue, we could address it.  But I can't see
performance being a crucial factor in running the suite as long as a run is
less than a few seconds.

Did a global change of "geneder" to "gender"

I held off on this one till we can get a clarification about the resource
files from NIST.

Changed those you mentioned plus one more (nodeclonenodefalse).

I did take some editoral liberty with documentcreateprocessinginstruction.
There was a discussion on the www-dom-ts mailing list much earlier
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom-ts/2001Apr/0020.html about the
inappropriateness of testing createProcessingInstruction with a target
("XML") that is an illegal value per the XML spec.  I have changed the
target to an innocuous value "TESTPI".

Most DOM implementations will create a PI with an "XML" target, but MSXML
will reasonably raise an exception.  Joe Kesselman's suggestion
(http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom-ts/2001Apr/0020.html ) was to
change the target and but not to add a negative test for an "XML" target
until the Level 3 effort where the appropriate behavior will be prescribed.
