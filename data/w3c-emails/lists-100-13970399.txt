Many-to-one isn't all that much harder, using XSLT's document() function.
You'd want a top-level document which said which tests were to be built
into each class, but that's easy enough.

I have no opinion right now re which approach is better. This may depend on
what the surrounding test framework looks like, and what your plans are for
releasing deltas as the tests improve.

Some compilers, in some languages, have trouble with long symbol names,
even when the language permits them. I've seen some which simply ignore any
characters beyond the first  (or last) 32.  We may want to consider
adopting a set of standard abbreviations to avoid that risk.  "
chardataappendnomoderr" would cut the length by about 50%, though I grant
that it's less readable for a novice.

(Of course, readability of those names is rather marginal anyway. I presume
people have already considered camelCasedNames...?)
