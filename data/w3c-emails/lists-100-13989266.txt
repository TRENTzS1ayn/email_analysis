Actually wouldn't we prefer UpperCasedNames instead of camelCasesNames?

If a CVS god can repair the file names  (I can produce a list of the
original intended names from the NIST zip file), I could readily get the
content back in synch with the new file names.  However, from my limited
experience with CVS, trying to work with files that only differ in case is
prone to catastrophy.  I think the only approach that would work is renaming
the repository files.

I would recommend that Mary try to preserve the capitalization on their DOM
L2 submission or we can fix it up before committing it to the CVS.  I only
realized the problem once I got to the java compile process which occurred
after the files were in the CVS and a substantial amount of changes to the
test sources had occurred.
