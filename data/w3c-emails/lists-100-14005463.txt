I'd like to take a survey on renaming the test cases currently in the repository.  Anything other than A, E or G would probably require intervention by someone well versed in CVS and with file system
access.

The NIST submitted Level 1 test cases are currently in the repository with all lower case names that provide a summary of the tests (for example, textsplittextnomodificationallowederr.xml).  Should
we:

A) Do nothing
B) Rename the repository files to MixedCaseNames.xml preserving their current history.
C) Rename the repository files to camelCaseNames.xml preserving their current history.
D) Rename them to InterfaceNameDD (for example, Node01.xml) preserving their current history.
E) Rename them to InterfaceNameDD by committing new files and deleting the current files hiding the revision history since Sunday.
F) Rename them to InterfaceName_FeatureDD (for example, Node_nodeValue01.xml) preserving their current history.
G) Rename them to InterfaceName_FeatureDD by committing new files and deleting the current files hiding the revision history.

If we want to do anything, we should do it now before the tests get out.

Again, Vote +1 for something that you would prefer, +0 for something that you'd go along with, -0 for something that you'd prefer didn't happen but would tolerate, and -1 for something that you are
against.

Any other options?

My votes:

A) +0
B) +0
C) -0
D) +0
E) +0
F) +0.5
G) +0.5

Reasoning: Okay, I didn't follow the rules, I'm only half-hearted on this.  I think that the shorter names would be more pleasing on test matrixes and other reports.
