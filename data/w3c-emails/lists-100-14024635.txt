I do think shorter names would be good. I'd prefer a compromise between
short and mnemonic but I'm slightly concerned that F/G might start to
become rather verbose again ("Element_getAttributesByTagName27" is exactly
32 characters.)

I'm not really concerned about preserving the history right now, since
there isn't much history yet to be preserved...


I haven't looked at the testcase DTD recently, so this may be a dumb
question -- Does it allow sufficiently structured internal documentation to
build an index of the testcases sorted by interface, feature, and brief
description? If not, should it?
