Was about half way through a commit, when something snapped.  It seems to be something broken with the CVS client for Windows that just kills any interaction with the repository either as a known user or anonymous.  The repository looks fine from cvsweb and from Linux, but I get this message (which I think Mary was getting earlier in the week) even from a machine that I just put cvs on.  Trying to check out 2001/XSL-Test-Suite seems to work just fine.

C:\domts>cvs checkout 2001/DOM-Test-Suite
cvs server: Updating 2001/DOM-Test-Suite
U 2001/DOM-Test-Suite/README.cvs
U 2001/DOM-Test-Suite/build.xml
U 2001/DOM-Test-Suite/level-1-element.patch
U 2001/DOM-Test-Suite/svgfix.sed
U 2001/DOM-Test-Suite/wd-dom.patch
cvs server: Updating 2001/DOM-Test-Suite/
cvs [checkout aborted]: cannot make directory 2001/DOM-Test-Suite/ /CVSROOT: No
such file or directory


Actually with some more investigation, it seems that

cvs checkout 2001/DOM-Test-Suite/tests
cvs checkout 2001/DOM-Test-Suite/java
cvs checkout 2001/DOM-Test-Suite/transforms

all work fine (and that if you combine that with the checkout 2001/DOM-Test-Suite you get the full project).  You can actually commit changes as long as your working directory is deeper that DOM-Test-Suite.

Looking at that level in CVS web (http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/2001/DOM-Test-Suite/) there is a mysterious entry for a / (unnamed)directory.  Don't know how that got there, but could see how it could confuse a CVS client.  The checkout on Linux also had an unnamed directory.  

Mary and Dimitris, see if these tricks allow you to access with CVS.

Phillipe, could you have someone kill that unnamed directory (if that is the right thing to do.)
