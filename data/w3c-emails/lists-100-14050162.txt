  This seems to be a pretty serious problem; it's making life pretty
miserable for the Windows users out there.  ;-(
  For the command-line-savvy, it may be worthwhile to try the classic
command-line interface.  Links to the implementation and instructions
for setting up command-line SSH and CVS clients are at:

http://python.sourceforge.net/winssh.txt

  Everyone using Windows at PythonLabs uses the installation procedure
described there with good success.  (Enough that we haven't had to
modify the instructions in over a year!)
