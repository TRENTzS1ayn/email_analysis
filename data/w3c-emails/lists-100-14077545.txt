The unnamed directory causes the command line CVS to fail.  I didn't try any
of the multi-check out combinations under WinCVS.  Don't know what put that
phantom directory there, my guess is that WinCVS had something to do with
it.   Hopefully, someone with file system rights can delete that thing and
we will be golden.

So, what do you suggest as the plan of attack for Python?  Do you want to
hack test-to-java.xsl yourself or manually transliterate some of the
generated Java source to Python and let me see how close I can get the
transform to produce the same code.
