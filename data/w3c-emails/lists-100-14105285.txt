  Sigh.
  Or rename it, if there's anything in it (though I don't *think*
there's any reason to expect that).
  Were the CVS hosted at SourceForge, we could file a service request,
but it shouldn't be too hard for this.  (Philippe, can you email the
right sys admin?)

  I'd like to try my hand at the XSL myself, but be prepared for
questions.  ;-)  I don't think there's any way for me to get to it
this week at all; I'm falling behind in a major documentation project
as we type.
