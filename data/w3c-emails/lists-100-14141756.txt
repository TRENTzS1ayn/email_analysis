Yes, there were a couple of updates to staff.xml that were necessary for the 
addition of the NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR set of tests.  I'm 
looking a little deeper -- I believe that staff.dtd was also updated.  I'll post 
the updated files in about 15 minutes.

  The narratives on a few cases strongly suggest that the test files used are slightly different from those used in the previous NIST test suites.  Until we get those files, working through the test failures is not a good use of time.

  Mary, could you provide those files as soon as possible.
