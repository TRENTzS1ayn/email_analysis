Are there any issues you want me to take up with the DOM WG during the
weekly telephone conference? If so, please advise as quickly as possible (so
far, there's only Curt's comments on ECMA in
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom-ts/2001Aug/0105.html).
Unfortunately this is only 2 hours away, sorry for that.

The status report I'll give is:

1. We've the source files submitted by NIST
2. We've a week-10 day period for revision (one DOM TS Group member
expressed the view that this revision period should start when the harness
for both Java and ECMA is finalized to allow equal opportunity to evaluate.
Good point. If possible, please help for the ECMA harness)
3. We've started working on the ECMA transform
4. We've started looking at the harness

Open Issues:
1. One class per test
2. Asynchronous loading, duplication of files in ECMA (Mary, do you have any
input on this gievn your previous experience with the harness you built in
the past)?
3. Test naming convention
4. CVS trouble (nameless directory, I've alerted systeam@W3C)
