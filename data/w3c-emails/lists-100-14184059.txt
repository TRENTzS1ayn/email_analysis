Subject: Tests appear to use updated NIST test files

The narratives on a few cases strongly suggest that the test files used are
slightly different from those used in the previous NIST test suites.  Until
we get those files, working through the test failures is not a good use of
time.
 
Mary, could you provide those files as soon as possible.
