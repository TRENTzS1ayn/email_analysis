Great. Could you just do a checkup on the links, as some are dead? (eg.
domimplementationPositiveCreateDocXMLNS and
domimplementationCreateDocXMLNSIllegalName)

Thanks

I also have a list of test purposes, with a mapping available tests,
in the NIST test matrix:

            http://xw2k.sdct.itl.nist.gov/brady/w3c-dom/test-matrix.html

The source for this file is in XML, so it would be easy enough to
add this info to the metadata, so that it could be used together with the
subject url's to describe each test.
