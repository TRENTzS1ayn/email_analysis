This test matrix is generated using a transformation -- I'll make it smarter
to
only generate links if the files exist -- other just put out the test name.
We
have all of the tests indicated -- some have not yet been converted to xml
(html tests), others are for level 2 (all of the namespace tests -- those
containing XMLNS).  I'll only generate links for those files that exist.
