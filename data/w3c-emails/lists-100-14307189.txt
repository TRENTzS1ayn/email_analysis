Given the opportunity:
 
To simplify administration and reporting to the WG, could all mails that
pertain to ambiguities in the spec be prefixed with [Spec ambiguity] in the
header?
 
Thanks

?mne: Multiple potential exceptions: nodereplacechildnewchilddiffdocument


nodereplacechildnewchilddiffdocument.xml is a strange case.  
 
It calls Node.replaceChild with a old node that is not a child of the target
node and attempts to replace it with a node that isn't part of this
document.  So it could conceivable throw either NOT_FOUND_ERR or
WRONG_DOCUMENT_ERR depending on which condition it tested first.  I don't
believe there is anything in the DOM spec that would prescribe which
exception code should take precedence and DOMTSML doesn't have a construct
to support an ambiguous exception code.
 
The test is internally inconsistant since the description says
The "replaceChild(newChild,oldChild)" method raises a 
WRONG_DOCUMENT_ERR DOMException if the "newChild" was
created from a different document than the one that 
created this node.

But the test checks for NOT_FOUND_ERR.  I'm going to make the body
consistent with the description.
