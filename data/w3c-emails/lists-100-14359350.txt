Since expanding entities on load is an acceptible behavior, I've added siblings of all the *NoModificationAllowedErr tests with an EE suffix (for entity expansion) which tests the same behavior using created entity references instead of loaded entity references.

I've made most of the tests safe for different parser settings.  Tests are most commonly affected by expandEntityReferences and ignoringElementContentWhitespace.  Some DOM are hardwired to a particular setting (Xerces-C always expands entity references, Batik ignores element content whitespace).  The harness runs the test suite twice, once with the default settings and then once with complementary settings.

Tests that declare <implementationAttribute> immediately after the metadata element will modify the default DocumentBuilderFactory for the test pass to their needs.  So in the second pass when most tests are expanding entity references, ...NoModificationAllowedErr tests will not expand entity references but will keep all the other settings.
