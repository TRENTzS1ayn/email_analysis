We had some problems with Crimson with the original tests -- I've included a run 
using jaxp1.1 crimson.jar -- not sure how class this maps to the current release --
the results were for both level1 and level2, but might be useful to double check 
your results --

I've got ant, etc running on my system -- seems as though the problem I was having 
was the same that you ran into with xalan, so I am getting ready to run the tests 
as well.  I've also generated the dom2.dtd without any errors.  I'll modify copy.xsl 
and generate the dom2 tests and run them through msv.

  Subject: Now passing all tests with "normal" settings with Xerces and close with Crimson


  I've just committed changes to the tests, supporting Java sources, transforms and a minor change to the DTD and schema (ignoringElementContentWhitespace instead of ignoreElementContentWhitespace).   Currently, Xerces-J 1  is passing all tests and Crimson (CVS version) is passing all but three when runnng with default parser settings.

  The tests that Crimson is failing are:

  documentCreateElementDefaultAttr: Calls document.createAttribute("address") and expects the default attribute from the DTD to be automatically added

  documentCreateEntityReferenceKnown: calls document.createEntityReference("ent3") and expects the content model of the entity to be available.

  notationGetSystemId: Crimson returns an absolute URL (jar:file://...../notation2File instead of notation2File)

  Roughly 45 tests are failing when running with a complementary set of parser settings, I assume primarily due to entity reference expansion.  Since expanding entity references on loading is an acceptible behavior (and the only behavior that some parsers such as Xerces-C support), tests that depend on the presence of entity references must either be declared to be only valid when entity expansion is off or the test must be rewritten to adapt to the settings.
