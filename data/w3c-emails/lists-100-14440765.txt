I guess there are two distinct issues:
 
a) should we do anything with the current Level 1 tests in the CVS
 
b) what would be best with Level 2 and other cases
 
Since NIST's environment likes to lowercase all the filenames, it could be dangerous to use mixed case names.  
 
For NIST's Level 2 submission, I'd suggest that case names be just interfacemethod00.xml instead of interfacemethoddoctorithurtswhenidothis.xml.  That should minimize the legibility issues with the
really long all lower case names.
 
For the Level 1 stuff, I'd shorten the names down to interfacemethod00.XML and insert new tests and hide the old tests instead of trying to do anything funky like renaming the CVS files.
 
Do lets actually push this up to a vote and will we actually do something or nothing based on the results (and no fractionals this time).
 
------------------
 
Issue 1:
 
Rename the current tests files in tests/level1/core, tests/level1/html and tests/level2/core, add to the repository as interfacemethod00.xml and hide the previous files.
 
Issue 2:
 
Use the interfacemethod00.xml as the pattern for the NIST 2 submission.
 
 
My votes are +1 and +1
