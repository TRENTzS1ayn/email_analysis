I was thinking of the case where the tests were in the CVS repository with MixedCaseNames and were coerced to lowercase within NIST resulting in intended modifications never committed or tests
differing only by capitalization got into the repository.

Having the filenames and the case names out of synch even by case would complicate the build since the Ant <style> task would create .java files with the same capitalization as the test and if the
/test/@name was not consistent the javac step would fail.

If the NIST infrastructure is prone to force file names to lower case, it just seems more expedient to preempt it.  I prefer not to cope, but we won't get into that.

After the little " " directory debacle and previous capitalization nightmares with CVS, I'm just a little paranoid.
