I've added a few transforms and a new target, "dom1-core-matrix" which will create a rudimentary HTML text matrix that displays methods and attributes that do not appear to be tested, will list all tests associated with each method and attribute in the DOM 1 core and all methods and attributes associated with each test.  All this info is based (and only as good as) the <subjects> elements in the tests.

If somebody wants to right some easy tests, there did not seem to be any (now there are two) tests that set Node.value.  For Node types that are defined as having a null value, setting Node.value is supposed to have no effect (in DOM L1 Second Edition), however I have seen implementations throw exceptions on the attempt.  Look at nodedocumentsetnodevalue.xml for an example of setting.

If someone wants to beatify the test matrix or start cleaning up the subjects, please speak up.
