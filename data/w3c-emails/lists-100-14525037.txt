I would prefer this decision to be based on technical
reasons rather than the NIST environment.  We can
handle either -- it wasn't until now that we had a reason
to figure out why filenames were converted to lowercase.
It seems that SAMBA, which we use extensively defaults
to this -- we have since fixed it on our end, so the NIST
environment should have no bearing on this ...
