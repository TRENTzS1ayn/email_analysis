I've made some minor enhancements to the test-matrix.xsl, cleaned out some spurious test subjects and manually added subjects to tests that had metadata but no explicit subject.  I also restored the Software License on the tests which had inadvertantly been stripped in earlier processing.

I'll try to get the ECMAScript harness up and working over the weekend.
