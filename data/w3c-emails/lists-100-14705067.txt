A few quick observations:

Xalan loads its parser via JAXP. It normally ships with, and defaults to
using, Xerces, but should be able to work with others.

Xalan requires that xml-apis.jar be on the classpath. This is a first step
toward factoring DOM, SAX, JAXP, TRAX, and related standardized code out of
the individual Apache projects and into a shared library. See also the
XML-COMMONS project at Apache for more information.
