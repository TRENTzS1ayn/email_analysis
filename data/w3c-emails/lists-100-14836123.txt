Thanks for the update Curt, you put me at shame as I should have done 
the update.

Since you are going to update build.xml, please take the following into 
account (we can move the discussion offline if you prefer):

1. Point to patch files  as if they were in a separate directory, it's a 
cosmetic but irritating point that they are the only ones floating 
around in the top-level directory
2. Could we kame use of the descritpion attribute on the top-level tasks 
instead of creting out own usage targets? ant -projecthelp lists them 
and you get relevant statement directly from the tasks (got this tip in 
an email about the Ant/xalan problems we've had)

Please let me know if I can help
