That the patch files are needed at all is also irritating, I'll move them.

The description attribute is helpful, unfortunately there are a lot of
targets that are not intended for external use (they'd make good "private"
tasks if there were such a concept) and the resulting output of projecthelp
won't distinguish between the useful targets and the not so useful ones.

I've also done some piecemeal changes to eliminate the <get>'ing of static
content (the specs, jsunit, junit) when they are available locally.  I'll
finish that up and they will make running the build while offline painless.
