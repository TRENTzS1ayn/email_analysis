Yesterday I took part in the first W3C Quality Assurance WG telcon, 
where a series of issues that we've trying to deal with or have dealt 
with already were brought up.

The framework we've produced has served as a source of inspiration to 
some of the documents that have been procuded or are in the pipeline of 
the QA activity.

As a group, we got very positive feedback, thanks to all for all the 
good work, and I look forward to the experiences we've made here being 
made available to the W3C in general.

As soon as the minutes from the telcon are available, I'll post a 
pointer.

In the meanwhile, you may want to look at http://www.w3.org/QA
