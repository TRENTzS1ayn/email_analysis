To give Philippe a few more things to think about, you'd also want to the
loading framework to also support HTML and WAP processors that obviously
won't implement JAXP.

The Java implementation of <load> should support:

1. Any XML Processor that support DOM 3 LS working draft.  Are there any
yet?

2. Any XML processor that implements JAXP.  Xerces, Crimson, Oracle XML
Parser, obviously.  Any others?

3. Significant XML DOM implementations that do not implement JAXP, but do
implement W3C DOM.  DOM4J, Xalan (read-only) any others?

4. SVG implementations.  Batik.

5. HTML DOM implementations.  Any suggestions?

6. (Debatable) WAP DOM implementations.  I believe Xerces supports WAP.
However, since WAP suppresses the DTD, any test that depended on defaults
from the DTD would need to be suppressed.
