I just ran dom1-core-jar yesterday without
any problems -- well, that is, after I modified
the xsl file -- in my version, which was just
updated from the server yesterday, there was
a problem with mismatched <xs:documentation>
tags -- there is one <xs:documentation> that is closed
by </xsl:documentation> -- I just changed it to
</xs:documentation> and everything ran after that.

I have the following installed:

Ant 1.4alpha  -- guess I should upgrade...

I'll have to look closer at what else I have --
I thought I had xerces.jar and xalan.jar, but it
seems that recently I was doing some xml
test suite work and have some additional items
earlier in my path.
