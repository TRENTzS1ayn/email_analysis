Hmmm - seems to work fine for me now.  Not sure why.  Of course this is
just one target so far, but it does run the style task.

Win2K SP 2
Ant 1.4.1b installed
ANT_HOME/lib has xalan.jar, xerces.jar from xalan D11.  It also works with
the appropriate files from D14 (xerces.jar, xalan.jar, plus new
xml-apis.jar)

Hi Shane

Thanks for your reply.

To begin with, you can direct most of your questions to the www-dom-
ts@w3.org mailing list, as these are questions of general interest.

The setup I've referred to is Ant 1.4 with the corresponding optional
jar file, Xerces and Xalan from the xalan2.2D11 distribution, I have sed
and patch since I run a Unix system.

I'll take the note on the build file up with the person who's been the
primary author.

Thanks
