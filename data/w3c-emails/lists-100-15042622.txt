To be precise: the current DOM Level 1 Core test suite only tests the DOM
XML implementation in Mozilla and IE. It doesn't test their DOM HTML
implementation. Curt tested the DOM SVG implementation of Adobe/Batik
against the DOM Level 1 Core Test Suite. We should be able to do the
same to test the DOM HTML implementation. After all, a DOM HTML implementation
must support the Core at the same time.
