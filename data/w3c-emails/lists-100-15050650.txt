Hmmm.  We have a couple of options.

1) Try to take the same type of scenario that we applied to Level 1
Core XML and adapt it to HTML.

2) Try to get those who have HTML tests already to contribute to the
effort.  I know that there are already tests listed for the Mozilla effort
that would be candidates, and I'm sure that Microsoft has some tests
that might be candidates.

3) Start from scratch and try to develop CORE html-only tests.

Any other ideas/suggestions.
