I think we had comments from Microsoft some time ago that their tests 
did not greatly enhance the tests NIST had at the time and that MS would 
therefore not contribute. I need to check the archives to make sure.

I'm also convinced that Netscape have some tests, I'll ask off-list for 
contributions.

In any case, I'd personally (for temporal reasons, mainly) go for your 
first option (in addition to trying to get existing tests commited, of 
course).
