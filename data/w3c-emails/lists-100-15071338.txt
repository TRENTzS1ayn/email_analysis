In building the HTML Module tests, we've found 
several HTML DOM attributes/methods that have been deprecated. 
We had originally thought that we could use STRICT HTML 4.0 
to create our test input files, but have realized that all of the 
deprecated items require the use of TRANSITIONAL instead.  
Anyone have a problem with just using TRANSITIONAL?
