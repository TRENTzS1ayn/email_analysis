[dd] Do you mean the Level 1 or Level 2 tests?

[dd] I'd like to wait and see what chances we have of getting Level 1 
HTML tests before holding back the release. In any case, there's been 
plenty of time to sumbit tests, and since this is a publically developed 
framework, perhaps there is not enough interest in Level 1 HTML for 
tests to be submitted.
