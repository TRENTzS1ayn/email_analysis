[mb] I'm not sure that I agree with your suspicion.  The HTML tests are for
the HTML
module itself.  It is true that in order to get to the module specific
interfaces, you
need to use some of the core interfaces.  I would not necessarily presuppose
that
all of the core interfaces are fully exercised.

[mb]  The NIST HTML submission is for Level 2 HTML -- HTML Module
only.  As it turns out, many of these tests could also be for Level 1 HTML
as
well.  I expect that there probably is interest in having Core tests for
HTML-only
implementations -- the biggest problem is the resources to actually write
the
tests.  We will submit some the the HTML Module tests later today, but will
not
be able to look at Core HTML until after the holidays.
