Phillipe has requested that my public key added to the CVS server, but am
not sure if that
has been done and I have not attempted to access the CVS server.  So I'm not
sure that
I could add those files if I desired and I'll not be able to test that for
about 20 hours.

I'd like to feel like there was some consensus on the CVS directory
structure before
committing anything.

Putting them in the xmlconf CVS was strictly a matter of convienience.
