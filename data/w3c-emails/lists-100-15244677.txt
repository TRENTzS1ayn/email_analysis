I agree with Fred, the expectation of a CVS download is the
code will build, but may contain stuff not ready for primetime.

If we are going to be able to effectively judge a test, then
we have to be able to run it.  Having every submitted test 
in the CVS and in the development builds is a necessity.
However, we could tweak the build so that only approved tests
go in the release builds.

[dd] Good, we could use a flag on the test itself indicating the current
status of it. The build should include only tests that are stable (according
to http://www.w3.org/2001/06/DOMConformanceTS-Process-20010627#procedural).

There are a couple of identifiers it would be nice to get nailed down:

1. Namespaces for test definition:

I've been building these by appending #test-definition to the full URL
for the spec.  It will probably get sloppy for DOM Level 2 and beyond in
that you don't want different namespaces for each subset (Events,
Range/Traversal).

Could use:

http://www.w3.org/2001/DOMTS/Level-One/Test-Definition
http://www.w3.org/2001/DOMTS/Level-Two/Test-Definition
http://www.w3.org/2001/DOMTS/Level-Three/Test-Definition

(I still haven't comprehended how the trailing # does helps)

2. Java package names for tests

org.w3c.DOMTS ?

I don't think package names can contain numerics like 2001.

3. target URI's for tests

http://www.w3.org/2001/DOMTS/tests/... 


4. URI's for XML test files (like staff.xml)

http://www.w3.org/2001/DOMTS/files/staff.xml

(I forgot to put a files directory in my CVS tree discussion earlier
today).

[dd] Sounds OK with me.
