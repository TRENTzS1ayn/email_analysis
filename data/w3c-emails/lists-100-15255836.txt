?mne: Re: [General] domconftest now a project at SourceForge


Sure, I'll help -- I should have the rest of
the fundamental and extended tests ready
by tomorrow.  After the core tests work,
we'll have to add metadata info -- but I
think I can write a transform to put our
original work into the rdf framework --
is this what we want to do?  How do we
envision the metadata info being used?  Can
we write a transform that will allow it to
be displayed in a web browser, or will we
have to transform off-line and make a html
version available?

[dd] I think we agreed on using as simple a metadata architecture as
possible. Using RDF may be too heavy for this purpose.

I can't see that many uses of metadata that we haven't covered already, ie.
test category, author information, some help in packaging, and so forth.

We could definitely write a transform, since all test files will be in XML.
On the opther hand, once we've released a version of the test suite
publishing a (generated) metadata file with links to the tests seems more
appropriate.
