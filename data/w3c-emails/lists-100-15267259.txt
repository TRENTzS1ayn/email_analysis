I presume that most people, like myself, will have some weeks off this
month, so it seems to be a good idea to get a picture of the current status.

Below you'll find a list of action items with status indicators. Please
remind me if I have forgotten anything.

(W3C) CVS rights to DOM TS Group. Have all who should received information?

(Dimitris) I have the update on the process document [done, published at
http://www.w3.org/DOM/DOMTS-Process]

(Dimitris/All) also I'm looking over both the
schema and XSL to generate it to sanity check and document further. In
addition, I want to start putting material on the DOM TS page at W3C, so
please have one final go at Curt's and Mary's submitted material before I do
so. [Unfortunately my timeframe has been a bit limited due to finishing off
before the summer. I should be able to send some comments soon, however]

(Dimitris/Mary) From the DOM WG meeting, we have a wish for a simple harness
to generate
straightforward results of at least the ECMA tests. Mary, could we look at
your older solution? [Mary? Could I have your input on this?]

(Mary) Given that we do indeed finalize this fairly soon, how long will it
take
us to translate the existing tests? Mary? [Being done, do we have a date on
this?]

(Dimitris/Fred) We have Fred who's volounteered to write the documentation
together with
me. I look forward to start doing this once we've finalized the schema.
[Should we coordinate work on a tutorial, Fred?]

(Dimitris/Curt) We need to look into the resolution/status options for the
submitted
tests, eg. by adding a pending option while a test is being investigated by
the DOM WG. Also we should decide on whether we submit through a mailig list
or SF. [Have we dropped the idea to use SourceForge for _issue tracking_? If
not, I should include this to the domconftest. It would also simplify
packaging, building only with stable tests]

(Philippe) to create a www-dom-ts-submissions@w3.org mailing list. [done]

(Curt/Mary/Dimitris) Rewrite styelsheets for code generation (Java and ECMA
primarily, others
welcome) (NIST for the Java one, ECMA open) [Java published, has anyone
started work on the ECMA one?]

(Curt, Dimitris?) Work on the details for test suite packaging  [do we have
more input that what has been on the list already?]

(Mary/Dimitris) Produce a test matrix [Pending on my comments on HTML]

(Mary) Produce a list of semantic requirements (Mary, is connected to the
test
matrix) [ready by now?]

Kind regards,

/Dimitris
