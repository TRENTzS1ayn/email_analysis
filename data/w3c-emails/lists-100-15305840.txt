Yes, I will be out for a week towards the end of the month.  I've
inlined comments below.

[mb] I'm looking at it as well as we go through the translation of the NIST
tests.

I agree that it would be more straightforward to do this after we are sure
that
the Java translator is done.  The older NIST ECMAScript harness presupposes
the ability to synchronously load an xml file -- something that Mozilla did
not
support last time I looked.  As a result, all tests will have to be
rewritten to
make use an asynchronous load -- that is, load the file first, and then run
the test.
I suggest that instead of rewriting the tests for this purpose that we just
rewrite
them for the xml-ized version, and translate using a stylesheet.  There are
about
800 html tests, of which about 200 overlapped with the java tests, so they
are just
about ready to go.  The others will have to be rewritten -- hard to say how
long
that will take, but we will start next week -- I would say no longer than 1
month,
maybe as little as two weeks.

[mb] The fundamental/extended tests are just about ready -- almost all of
the fundamental
tests were already posted on our web site, available from the test matrix.
I have
to rerun them against the new java translator, with if support.  The
remaining ones
have been translated, but need some minor editing -- should be ready in 2
days time.
All of the tests will have to be modified slightly to incorporate namespace
info and
metadata as soon as it is decided on...

[mb] Did I miss something -- I thought we were using CVS from W3C and issue

[mb] Curt, are you doing the ECMA one -- it kind of sounded like you were
interested from your last message.

[mb] The semantic requirements have been incorporated into the test matrix
as the
test purpose.  This is no longer a separate issue.  I think I have to go
back over a
couple more fundamental interfaces, all of the extended, and of course,
html. The
already identified test purposes are probably close, but there may be a
couple of
items that were overlooked.
