Mary, if you could make this file available, I could turn around and
transform
it to an external RDF representation of the internal metadata element that
I described earlier:

<rdf:RDF>
<rdf:Description about="uri for test">
    <!--   text of purpose could go here in case you want to use it to add a
new subject  -->
    <dc:subject resource="uri for method/attribute"/>
</rdf:Description>
</rdf:RDF>

This could be combined with an RDF representation of the metadata extracted
from
tests to produce the test matrix.
