The information in the test-matrix.html file
only captures info regarding the test
purposes (or semantic requirements), not
necessarily all of the metadata for a particular test.
There is an additional description for a test
that more fully describes what happens in the
test itself, and should be used to supplement the
test purpose.  It is this information that resides
in an older rendition that needs to be brought into
the metadata file.  I would also suggest that it, along
with author, possibly creation date, revision date info
be carried along with each test, and translated into
prologue documentation -- probably javadoc for the
java transformation.

I noticed that you are still using rdf.  Why?
