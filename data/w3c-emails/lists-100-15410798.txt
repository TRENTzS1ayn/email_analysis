level-both is simply a mechanism on this side for me to keep things
straight.
Although it is true that 99% of these tests were introduced in level-one,
I left room for the possibility that there may be a couple of tests that are
level-one,
but not level-two -- if I remember correctly, there is at least one test
where a
method moved from one interface to a different interface in level two...
