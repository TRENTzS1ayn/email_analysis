nistmeta.xsl was primarily a demonstration of the viability of
determining subject URI's from the description of the test.

It should be possible to extend the concepts in nistmeta.xsl
to put the metadata from the "older" representation
into the body of each test.  Generating Java documentation comments
from inline metadata should be trivial.

I think revision date could be automatically inserted into a comment by CVS.
Not sure if it could be controlled enough to put just the revision date into
the existing format.

At the time I was doing it, it was easier just to convert one
external metadata source into one external RDF document.

Simplifying the metadata in the test definitions help authors, but
there isn't a good reason why external compilations of metadata
extracted from those tests aren't valid RDF.
