[mb] Not a criticism, I'm just trying to understand where you are going
with this...I missed this point entirely, and I see that you can generate
these, but I don't know how you think they should be used -- I thought the
primary
reason was to finish up the metadata portion of this work -- which
I believe nistmeta.xsl could easily do by including the additional
descriptions.

[mb] Other than confusing me, and possibly others, about what you
are proposing...if you have compelling reasons for using rdf, please
tell us, so we don't have to guess.  I'm not against it -- I just don't have
the time to track down rdf and figure out how to fit it into our
revolving framework.  If you do, please share how you envision
using it.  That way, we can discuss the technical merits, and finish
up this portion of the framework.
