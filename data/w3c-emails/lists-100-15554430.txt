The following web link is the Press Release for our new product, PF-Printmerge:

http://www.pureforms.com/Company/news/prelease.doc


What it does? Quick Insights:
PF-Printmerge merges your databases' data directly into Acrobat-based forms, without programming. You can complete the process in under a minute, click merge, and just wait for the resultant pdf file to open. Nothing can be simpler and productive. It is the only product in the market with this capability.
