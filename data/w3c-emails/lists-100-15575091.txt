I've put some minor changes to the CVS.

In honor of SVG's promotion to Proposed Recommendation, I've updated build.xml so that it can generate a test definition DTD and Schema from the SVG source.

The only conflict with SVG was between the <multiply> element with the element generated for SVGMatrix.multiply, I addressed this by changing <multiply> with <mult>.

The other change in the schema was combining the implementation conditions elements (<expandEntityReferences>, <ignoreElementContentWhitespace>, etc) with a single <implementationAttribute> element.

Over the weekend, I hope to have tests runnable.
