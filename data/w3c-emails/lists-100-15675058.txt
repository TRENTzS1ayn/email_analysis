  Thanks for summarizing!  Perhaps the complete minutes will answer my
questions; I'll look there next.

  Will this include DTD/Schema documentation?

[dd] Yes, documentation (which is an action item on me) will also contain
documentation of the schema/dtd.

  Are you saying that a test can be imported from code?  

[dd] Sorry, I wasn't clear. It would support, were the tests XMLified, not
directly from code.

  Are there reasons this couldn't be a SourceForge project?

[dd] W3C license

  Once I have time to understand the test schema, I'll try writing the
stylesheet for Python generation.

[dd] brilliant. The DOM TS will consists of the tests, documentation, tests
is Java and ECMA as well as the stylesheets used to procude Java/ECMA, but
any additional XSLT goes to show that we can support many other bindings.
