Your help and contribution will be highly appreciated. Besides that, you can
add a lots of experience sine you've documented already. Can I put you on
the Documentation action item?

  Sounds good; once the schema/DTD has settled down, I'll be glad to
help with this.  I'm presuming this will be done using the same DTD as
the W3C XML specifications use, but have no particular preference
myself as long as we're using a non-propriety text-based format.  I
have written DTD documentation before:

http://pyxml.sourceforge.net/topics/xbel/

  I've also been heavily active as a proofreader, editor, and
technical reviewer for the standard Python documentation and a number
of the Python books.

  Either brilliant or complete folly -- I expect this to be a serious
test of my XSLT abilities!  But hey, at least I'll learn something,
and hopefully there will be a useful result.
