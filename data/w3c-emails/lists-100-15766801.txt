In general, it looks as if we need to differentiate the site for
developing/issue tracking, from the site where resources will finally
reside, which is (primarily) www.w3.org/DOM/Test. Mirrors can be put
anywhere, which is good since we enhance visibility.

Curt, if you think I can contribute, could you add me to the admin list?
Thanks.

The first thing to do is to define the distinction between "Category"
and "Group" -- the last time I looked, SF did not provide any guidance
on this, but it makes a difference.  For Python, we use "Category" to
describe components/aspect of the software (documentation, build
system, parser/compiler, library modules, etc.), and "Group" to
describe the bug (irreproducable, not a bug, third-party bug,
platform-specific, etc.).  It's not clear that the bug, feature
request, or patch trackers should be separated -- I have a *strong*
suspicion that that adds navigational complexity without adding value.
I would suggest enabling only one of those three & calling it a "bug
tracker".

"Documentation" is always a good category.  Note that comments on
project Web pages may also end up here.  For this project, perhaps
we should also consider "xUnit Conversion" (with *which* xUnit being
largely indicated by who it's assigned to) or have a "fooUnit
Conversion" for each "foo" that's covered.  Another category could be
"Schema/DTD", covering the schema/DTD and their generation.
Additional categories should be added for other "subprojects".

  It looks like you've figured this out already, so I'll replace the
text I started to write with this sentence.  ;-)
