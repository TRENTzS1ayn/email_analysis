  This is good news.  Given that using SF means that there's no need
for the W3C to allocation additional resources to setting up issue
trackers or other services, or spend time configuring them, I'll
suggest that using SF is inherantly better than inventing everything
all over again.  For Python, we've had a very good experience using
SF, and strongly encourage use of their facilities.  They may not be
perfect, but they sure seem to handle it well and are actively
improving the service.

  Sigh.  Ok, I'll fire off one email to someone I know...
