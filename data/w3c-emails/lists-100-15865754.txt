This looks very good. Thanks, Curt.
 
However, didn't we speak about using an extra mailing list to submit tests?
Something like www-dom-ts-submissions@w3.org
<mailto:www-dom-ts-submissions@w3.org> ? It doesn't really matter to me,
let's just take the decision.
 
Another thing we need to think about is how we categorize interdependencies
that both Curt and the DOM WG have pointed out.

?mne: Prototype test tracker on xmlconf


I've set up a prototype test submission using SourceForge's tracker
mechanism.  Dimitris, Mary and Fred have tech and admin rights (that is when
they are logged on).  I've set it up where the public can submit and that
all transactions email me (eventually it would go to a mailing list).  This
is strictly to see if this is an adequate approach, not for real submissions
which would go on a potential www-dom-ts SourceForge project.
 
I used Category to identify the Recommendation (Level 1 Core, etc) and Group
to identify the interface.  Admins have the ability to set a resolution and
status from fixed lists(Fixed, Invalid, Won't Fix, Duplicate, Accepted,
Rejected...)  (Open, Closed, Pending, Deleted), respectively, that stretch
to fit to most of our needs and then we can defined "canned responses" for
anything that doesn't fit.
