    3) Write equivalent transform to produce DTD

    [dd] to simplify things, we could run the schema through a schema editod and look through it and make any changes by hand

    [mb] Are we doing this to meet NIST's concerns, or are there others who are looking for a DTD?  As it turns out, we are just 
    about over our learning curve, and we will use the schema.
