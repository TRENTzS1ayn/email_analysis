We're doing this for two reasons as I see it:
 
1. Widespread use of DTD support in tools (also, I suppose that learning
schema just to develop tests can be a burden, whereas DTD:s are more well
known)
 
2. We decided to mainly develop the schema and then export to DTD, to have
both.
 
I can take care of the DTD transformation.

3) Write equivalent transform to produce DTD
 
[dd] to simplify things, we could run the schema through a schema editod and
look through it and make any changes by hand
 
[mb] Are we doing this to meet NIST's concerns, or are there others who are
looking for a DTD?  As it turns out, we are just 
about over our learning curve, and we will use the schema.
