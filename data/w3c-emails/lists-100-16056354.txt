[mb] We have already converted Node, Document, NamedNodeMap, CharacterData
without any problems, so I don't expect that we will have any additional
problems.

[mb] No problem with these categories, although I agree that we should have
the ability to distinguish between Received and "Pending on clarification
from WG"

[mb] Another solution may be to run SharePoint here at NIST.  I haven't
used either solution, so I don't have strong feelings either way -- we just
need to be sure that all who want to participate can, and I think that can
happen with either solution.

[mb] It seems to me that since this is an official W3C activity, that at
least the
submittal of tests should be via a w3c.org address.  Is there any way that
W3C could run a copy of SharePoint as well?
