I'd really prefer required but null as a prohibited value (at least for
now).
Since passing null into a DOM method is a fairly rare occurrance,
I don't think the slight increase in the test complexity in those
rare instances is worth a substantial increase in the complexity
of the transform.

Status Pending is used for items that need feedback from the submitter.  I
misused
it earlier.  Any item that was made "Pending" would revert to "Open" if the
submitter
made a comment.

One way would be to create distinct SourceForge accounts for the TS
moderator
and/or for the WG.  If the test is assigned to the TS moderator, then the
test
has passed any preparation and is pending discussion within the TS group.
If the test is assigned to the WG id, then the test has been referred to the
DOM workgroup.
