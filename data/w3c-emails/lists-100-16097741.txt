  Perhaps someone interested in original submissions via email could
volunteer to migrate such submissions into the SF tracker?
  The advantage of direct-to-SF submission is mostly evident for
submitters with SF logins, as it is easier for them to track issues
they submit, so that should be encouraged.  Whoever migrates an issue
into the tracker ends up either doing it anonmously or tracking
migrated issues/tests as well as issues/tests they submit themselves.
