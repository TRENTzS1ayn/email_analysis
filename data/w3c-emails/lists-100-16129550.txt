Sounds okay to me -- I think you're right -- we're better off leaving things
on SourceForge.  As a note, some of the XML tests
did come in with copyrights attached to them.  Most organizations are
looking to get credit for their contributions.

[dd] Of course everybody wants credit. That's why we'll include the author
name and organisation. After submission, however, the tests will belong to
the DOM TS framework.
