[ca] Only granting tracker admin rights to the TS moderator, would ensure
that only the TS moderator could mark a test as "rejected", "accepted", etc.
Anyone could still add comments on the test
which would present a record of the TS group's discussion on the issue.

[dd] OK

[mb] It seems to me that since this is an official W3C activity, that at
least the
submittal of tests should be via a w3c.org address.  Is there any way
that
W3C could run a copy of SharePoint as well?

[ca] The SourceForge Project page will only say that the license is "Other".
On the test submittal mockup, I used a placeholder for a statement of the
test process IPR.  That text could be anything
that you want it to be.  Any download (.zip, etc) should have the full
statement of IPR.  Should each test have a "Copyright (c) 2001, MIT..."
boilerplate?

If you wanted to use a w3 address, you could just put a frameset on the W3C
site that enclosed the sourceforge implementation.  The SourceForge tracker
is actually more closely aligned to what we want
to do and is open source, so it could be run on W3C hardware, but I think
the framing approach is a lot more expedient.

[dd] Very good idea. Let me investigate and report to the list
