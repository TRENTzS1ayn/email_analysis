[mb] Okay -- what happens when tests are submitted with a copyright?  Or,
do we not accept them unless we have free access to modify them?  I am
particularly concerned about a test that is submitted, accepted, and then
someone later believes that there is a problem with the test -- modifies it,
and resubmits it -- are we set up to track modifications?

[dd] Very good point. resubmitted with a pointer to the old submission would
be ebough, I think, as long as we, as Mary points out, track the submission
steps. It's a service, if you will, we should provide.

In any case, I think the process implies that the tests cannot contain
copyright statements if they are to form part of the DOM TS. I suppose one
way of going about would be to speak to the submitting party at that time.
