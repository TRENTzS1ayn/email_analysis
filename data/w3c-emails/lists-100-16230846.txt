If you are actually going to run them, you first have 
to create a file "compact.xml" by running extract.xsl 
against wd-dom.xml and have it in the same directory 
as the transform (I think).  

It should only create the variable definitions 
(and doesn't translate DOMString to Stringas I intended), 
property accessors and mutators, and <load> and <assertDOMException>
elements.
