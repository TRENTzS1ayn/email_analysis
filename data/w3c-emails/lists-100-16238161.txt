I've updated http://home.houston.rr.com/curta/domtest/test2java.xsl.  Now it produces attributes and method calls, but very few framework constructs (which should be pretty trivial).  Most of the logic in the code is determining when explicit casting is required.  I'm sure there is some additional tweaking needed, but it is a lot closer than last night.
