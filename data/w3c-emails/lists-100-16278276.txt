Thanks for your points, Curt

I'll take these questions to the DOM WG for discussion. 

I'm quite happy with using SF as the tracking framework, but it needs to be
in synch with the views of the DOM WG. And it's actually come alive really
quickly, thanks to your efforts.

I'll report to the list as fast as possible.

I think http://home.houston.rr.com/curta/domtest/domtest.zip is my latest
schema and http://home.houston.rr.com/curta/domtest/test2java.xsl is my
latest transform.

Definitely if the DOM TS provides something like the test2java.xsl
transform, 
that must be under the Software notice so that people can modify it to other
languages and other frameworks.

I'm thinking that the tests might be more appropriate 
under the software notice also.  The Document license goes into
a lot of detail on the process to translate a Document into another human
language (prior approval, etc) which would be conceptually similar to
translating tests into a specific computer language.  Maybe the
document license with a specific grant of rights to generate code
from the tests would both preserve the sanctity of the "official"
test suite and still let people run the tests on arbitrary
languages and frameworks.

I think the test "repository" needs to be in CVS and the W3C
CVS server seems more "official" than a non-W3C CVS server would.

Any bug tracking system that allows attachments would be adequate 
for the test submission process.  Options are:

Bugzilla/Jitterbug/SF Tracker or other hosted by W3C, NIST, Apache, Mozilla
or other.

SourceForge Tracker within the xmlconf project or within a DOM TS related
project.

Though the bug tracking system isn't the meat of the test suite.
It would be a useful thing to have fairly long lived, but it needs
to come alive quickly.
