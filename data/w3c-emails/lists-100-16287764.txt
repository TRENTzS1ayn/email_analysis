Yes, they should.

No. The tests will be endorsed by the W3C and therefore, you won't be allowed
to modify them and still claim conformance with the test suites. NIST and W3C
agreed that the W3C Document Notice and License is the appropriate one. Note
that I said the tests, not the framework used to produce them. The
user/developer must be able to download the tests from the W3C web site
http://www.w3.org/DOM/Test and check his implementation for DOM conformance.

I sent a note to our copyright expert asking to consider the proposal.

This service is already online: http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/

Just had a discussion with our System manager. It is possible to install and
setup a SF server in the w3.org domain. There is a Bugzilla system in the W3C
but we're still testing it so it is not ready yet.

Depending on how hard it is to setup the SF system, I could do it at the end of
next week after the DOM face-to-face if I get the formal approval from Tim. I
just need the go-ahead from th TS
