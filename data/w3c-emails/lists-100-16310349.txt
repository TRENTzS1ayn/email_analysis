After a discussion with Joseph Reagle, we agreed that the submitter
can still hold the copyright on the submitted test but he needs to
grant the W3C the license to use them:
[[
   Declaration of [Submitter]

   [Submitter] hereby grants to the W3C, a perpetual,
   nonexclusive, royalty-free, world-wide right and license under any
   [Submitter] copyrights in this contribution to copy, publish and
   distribute the contribution, as well as a right and license of the
   same scope to any derivative works prepared by the W3C and based on,
   or incorporating all or part of the contribution. [Submitter]
   further agrees that any derivative works of this contribution prepared
   by the W3C shall be solely owned by the W3C.
]]

Of course, it presumes that the submitter really holds the copyright
on the submitted tests but this can be sorted out during the acknowledgment
period.

Good points. Let me work on that and see if we are able to come up
with a license that follows the requirements and is easy to implement.

Again, the service is not available yet and don't have a release date. Since I
don't have the possibility to speed up our systeam resources, I'm proposing
the SF solution based on my own time resources.
