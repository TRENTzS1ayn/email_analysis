The Apache Batik project has already expressed interest
in running DOM tests as part of their development process using their
own test framework.  The best path for them would be to take the
transform that produces Java code for the JUnit framework and
make slight modifications to produce code that works with their
internal framework.

In addition, I see most of the logic and structure of the transform
being similar between the various target languages and test frameworks.
For example, I would expect that the JavaScript or Python transform
would be developed by modifying the Java transform.  If someone
wanted to port the code generation transform to a unanticipated
language, the best approach would be to start with the closest
W3C transform and to modify it.

Having the code generation transforms under the Software license
would allow these types of uses.  Having the code under the 
Document license would appear to require a clean-room
implementation of the transform which could result in
people just not using the tests due to potential legal liability.
