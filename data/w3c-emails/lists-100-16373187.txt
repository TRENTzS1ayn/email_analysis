Okay -- I've made the test matrix available at 
http://xw2k.sdct.itl.nist.gov/brady/w3c-dom/test-matrix.html

It's a first pass -- takes all of what used to be our 
semantic requirements, categorized by interface, 
attribute / method, level (one, two, both), and what 
tests we currently have.  We started to step through the 
level 2 spec and fill in the blanks -- we know so much more 
now than we did when this work was originally done (2 years ago).
I think we got as far as the CharacterData interface.  We'll 
continue through the fundamental/extended interfaces, and then 
move on to html.  We could use some help if there are any 
volunteers...
