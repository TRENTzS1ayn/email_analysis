[mb]  Your suspicion is correct -- for the moment, I translated all of the
sr's, which were in html,
to xml, and the file looks like the following:

        <category name="core">
        <idl type="method | attribute" name="idl_name">
        <purpose> text of purpose goes here
            <spec level="one | two | both" />
            <test name="test_name/>
                    ... maybe more than one test -- that's what we have
now -- I
                        expect that we will create additional purposes for
the
                        currently defined multiple test cases ...
        </purpose>

            ... maybe additional purposes ...
    </idl>
            ... additional idl def's
    </category>

For the moment, I created a stylesheet that generates the html table that
you see.  When
we determine the final format, we can write another stylesheet to transform
this, and
possibly combine it with additional info from the tests.  At this point, we
have created
our xml and java renditions with the same test_name as above, so we should
be able
to bring them all together when we are ready.

Any ideas on how to package everything?
