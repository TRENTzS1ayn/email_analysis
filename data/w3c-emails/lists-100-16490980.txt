I meant to outline an metadata driven approach to 
maintaining the test matrix a few days ago, but 
got distracted.

First, we already have URI's for the interface, methods and properties
from the DOM spec.  The base part is debatable, but you could
refer to the hasFeature() method as defined by DOM Level 1 as:

http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-DOM-Level-1-19981001/level-one-core#ID-5CED94D7

or as defined in DOM Level 2 Core as

http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Core/core#ID-5CED94D7


or createDocument() as defined by DOM Level 2 as:

http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Core/core#Level-2-Core-DOM-createDocument


Then you need to define a URL to correspond to the "Purpose" column in
your matrix.  If this is a specific passage to the text of the spec,
this could be represented by a XPointer type URI:

http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Core/core#xpointer(id('Level-2-Core-DOM-createDocument')/raises/exception[1])

If it was some outside of the spec comment, then you'd be on your own.

It should be fairly straight forward to generate RDF with at least 
minimal information to describe the URI's associated with methods,
interfaces, exceptions, parameters, etc using an XSLT transform
on the XML version of the spec.

Then what is needed is to incorporate in the test metadata,
the fact that a specific test refers to particular URI's.

<test>
   <metadata>
      <rdf:about>
    <somens:someproperty rdf:reference="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Core/core#xpointer(id('Level-2-Core-DOM-createDocument')/raises/exception[1])"/>
</rdf:about>
   </metadata>
   <!--  body of test goes here  -->
</test>

Or do it externally

<rdf:RDF>
    <rdf:about rdf:reference="http://www.example.com/domtest/myfirsttest.xml">
    <somens:someproperty rdf:reference="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Core/core#xpointer(id('Level-2-Core-DOM-createDocument')/raises/exception[1])"/>
    </rdf:about>
    <rdf:about rdf:reference="http://www.example.com/domtest/mysecondtest.xml">
    <somens:someproperty rdf:reference="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Core/core#xpointer(id('Level-2-Core-DOM-createDocument')/raises/exception[1])"/>
    </rdf:about>
</rdf:RDF>
