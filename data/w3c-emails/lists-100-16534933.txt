replaced [Submitter] appropriately and then send the paragraph back to the

Yes, this is perfect.

As I said in my previous message, the Java and ECMAScript sources in the
W3C DOM Conformance Test Suites will have a slightly different license
but it doesn't prevent anybody to generate their own Java or ECMAScript
tests from the framework as long as they stay outside the org.w3c package.
As a fact, we are using almost the same copyright license for the DOM
Bindings [1]. Each Java files contains the comment above and the complete
package contains a file COPYRIGHT.html [1] (in our case, the Document license
section will be removed). As far as I know, we never had any trouble in the
past for the Java DOM bindings.

IBM might want to grant to the W3C the rights to use it in the W3C DOM
Conformance Test Suites. I need to check with our IBM contact if it is
possible. Also Dimitris and Mary need to decide if JUnit is suitable for the
Conformance Test Suites.

I would suggest to have two versions, one for JUnit and one for the W3C. The
W3C version is not necessary for the moment given that our harness is not
ready.

I'm very glad to see that things are moving again on the right track,
