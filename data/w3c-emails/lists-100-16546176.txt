After a short discussion, the DOM WG acknowledged the use of sourceforge.net for
the bug tracking system. A backup system will need to activate just-in-case. If
it is possible and not so much time consuming, we might want to try to switch
back to the future W3C bugzilla system but this is not a requirement. I'm going
to setup a separate mailing list on the W3C list server to receive the test
submissions: www-dom-ts-submission.
