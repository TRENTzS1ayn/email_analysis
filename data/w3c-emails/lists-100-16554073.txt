It appears that all of our ideas for DOM Level 1 have already been
incorporated.

 

The only problems I see (so far) with the current matrix is the
classification of attributes and methods in the Attr interface.  Many of
the items listed are not included in DOM Level 1.

Thanks Mary

 

We should try to map Microsoft's tests into the gaps in the matrix.
Jason, do you have an idea of what you could contribute with?

Okay -- I've made the test matrix available at 

http://xw2k.sdct.itl.nist.gov/brady/w3c-dom/test-matrix.html

 

It's a first pass -- takes all of what used to be our 

semantic requirements, categorized by interface, 

attribute / method, level (one, two, both), and what 

tests we currently have.  We started to step through the 

level 2 spec and fill in the blanks -- we know so much more 

now than we did when this work was originally done (2 years ago).

I think we got as far as the CharacterData interface.  We'll 

continue through the fundamental/extended interfaces, and then 

move on to html.  We could use some help if there are any 

volunteers...
