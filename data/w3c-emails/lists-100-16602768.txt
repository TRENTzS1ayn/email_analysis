[[[
A recent discussion on www-dom-ts@w3.org highlights ways in which
the W3C's model of collaborative development is quite different
from some popular open source models.

-- xmlhack: Is W3C work incompatible with the GPL?

For the record, here is the relevant part in the FAQ regarding the
difference between the GPL and the W3C Software copyright license:

[[[
6.4 Is code released under the W3C license compatible with the GNU General
Public License (GPL)?

Software which is free from any claims beyond W3C terms and conditions are
compatible with the GPL and may be redistributed under the GPL. The GPL ensures
users always have the ability to run, change, or redistribute software with or
without changes; it also prevents such software from being bundled with
closed/proprietary software such that users lose their rights to that free code
in the new product. The W3C license allows the latter to happen, for W3C code
to be used in proprietary software, but it can also be used with GPL software
and redistributed under those terms.
