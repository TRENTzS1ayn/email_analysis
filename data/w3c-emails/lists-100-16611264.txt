Yes, but the understanding reflected in this FAQ is incorrect, as far
as I know. Nothing prevents GPL'd software from being "bundled" with
any other software, and such bundling does not affect the proprietary
software at all[1]. In the case where actual code is compiled and
linked into a proprietary software package, and is not licensed under
the more lenient Lesser General Public License (LGPL)[2], then that
proprietary software must release its own code as well. However, if a
library is under the LGPL, it may be compiled into software whose
source remains closed.

And in any case, I fail to see how a test suite of any kind would put
the fear of GNU into anyone writing proprietary software, as I am not
aware of any arguments to be made in favor of building the test cases
- and code to run them - directly into the proprietary software
packages in question.

Can Philippe shed some light on how a DOM test suite released under
the GPL could possibly cause any problems with proprietary software?
I'm sure I'm just being thick here and missing the obvious.

Thanks,
Steve
