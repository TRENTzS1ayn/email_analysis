I'm missing some of the context of this discussion, but I can speak to the 
FAQ [1]. As stated, software released under the W3C software license can be 
used with GPL software or proprietary software. Very straightforward.

If the question is how the W3C license differs from copyleft, like many open 
source licenses, the critical difference is with respect to GPL 2b: "b) You 
must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part 
contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed 
as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this 
License." [2] The GPL is more restrictive than the W3C license with this 
"viral" item. The W3C is no more restrictive than GPL (you don't have to do 
anything that the GPL also doesn't make you do), and that's why it's 
compatible: derivative works can be redistributed under GPL or other (even 
proprietary) licenses as long as the original W3C license is followed.

Yes, there are questions of what "can be reasonably considered independent 
and separate works in themselves" [2] under GPL, and options for choosing 
LGPL, but I'm not sure how that's relevant.

The W3C chose to have a non-copyleft type open source license, like many 
others, and that's what we release software and test suites under, and what 
we'd require submissions to permit, so perhaps someone could restate the 
problem/question for me? (I'm not interested in copyleft versus open/free 
licenses debates if that's the question! <smile/>)
