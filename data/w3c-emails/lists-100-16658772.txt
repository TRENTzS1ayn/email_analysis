Dimitris has troubles in generating the XML schemas using
XML spy. The software returns an error on xlink:form.
The xlink:form attribute is defined in the spec.dtd file and the
prefix is in fact not mapped. I guess the reason is the date of
the document (1998) and it was based on a early version of Xlink.
The namespace name in the March 1998 draft of XLink wasn't defined
yet (and the namespace spec wasn't a recommendation at that time).

I recommend to not activate the namespace resolution when you try
to read the DOM Level 1 XML sources. If you cannot desactivate
namespaces support in your software, the better work around is to
add a fake namespace in the DTD such as:

<!ENTITY % fake-xlink.att
        'xmlns:xlink            CDATA   #FIXED
                                        "http://www.example.org/1998/xlink" '>
        
<!ENTITY % href.att
        '%fake-xlink.att;
        xlink:form             CDATA           #IMPLIED
        href                    CDATA           #IMPLIED
        show                    CDATA           #FIXED "embed"
        actuate                 CDATA           #FIXED "auto" '>

<!ENTITY % href-req.att
        '%fake-xlink.att;
        xlink:form             CDATA           #FIXED "simple"
        href                    CDATA           #REQUIRED
        show                    CDATA           #FIXED "embed"
        actuate                 CDATA           #FIXED "auto" '>

<!ENTITY % source-req.att
        '%fake-xlink.att;
        xlink:form             CDATA           #FIXED "simple"
        xml:attributes          NMTOKENS        #FIXED "href source"
        source                  CDATA           #REQUIRED
        show                    CDATA           #FIXED "embed"
        actuate                 CDATA           #FIXED "auto" '>
