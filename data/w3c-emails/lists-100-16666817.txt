The problem a tension between using GPL or using the W3C Software license.  The problem was that there were very software like things (XSLT transforms, test cases) that there were legimate reasons to
be able to modify (for example, to support other languages, platforms and test frameworks) that were being considered to be issued under the document license.  While we were still trying to resolve
the licensing issue, we were also trying to develop software which I really didn't feel comfortable putting out without any copyright notice or liability disclaimer.  I didn't want to put the W3C
Document Notice on a contribution that I made since that might potentially lock me out from using code that I might want to use in other contexts.  While we were still in this limbo, I basically
expressed that I was getting nervious without the DON'T SUE ME clauses and that I could publish my personal contributions initially with the GPL and its disclaimers which would have provided something
that people who wanted to port to other platforms and languages could have used as a starting point.

However, the entire discussion is now moot since the DOM WG has decided to use Software License (with some small additional terms to protect the sanctity of the test suite) which addresses my initial
concerns.
