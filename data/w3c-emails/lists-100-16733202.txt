... except that it doesn't specify a particular version (such as that one),
so again, there's a loophole.  It shouldn't be mandatory to permit W3C
to relicense other peoples' contributions at will, as I commented before.

I'm curious though what level of change distinguishes a "derivative work"
as opposed to two versions of a single work.  There are Japanese temples
that have been carefully maintained, and look largely the same today as they
did hundreds of years ago -- even though no single board is the same.  Is
today's version the same one?  Is it a derivative?  If such issues truly matter,
I'd hope to see better answers than "litigate it to get the answer".   If they
don't matter, I'm not sure why such language is desirable.

Introducing such new issues -- beyond issues of "who holds the copyrights"
and "what license applies" seems to create even more problems.  What
exactly is "ownership", as distinct from "copyright"??

Hmm, that presumes the original licence grant was in fact revocable.

If it weren't revocable, "yanking" (of that type :) would not be possible.
The essence of an Open Source license is that such revocation is not
possible:  everyone has the right to get, run, modify (etc) in perpetuity.

I guess I still don't see why that'd be perceived as an issue.  When the
original non-revocable license was granted, W3C (like every other
source licensee) received sufficient rights to evolve the software as it
sees fit, in perpetuity.  Why does W3C want to be "more equal"?

That's a reasonable question, and things would have to be defined so that
could have an answer before LGPL could reasonably be applied.  Such
issues are one reason to avoid, in general, the "Lesser" GPL.  Though I
suppose a reasonable definitiion of a test suite is as a "library of test cases".

All the more reason to prefer GPL ... despite the current Microsoft offensive
against licenses which don't facilitate such subversion!  :)
