No problem, up and running now.

To recap then: how are we doing on our action items?

I have the update on the process document, also I'm looking over both the
schema and XSL to generate it to sanity check and document further. In
addition, I want to start putting material on the DOM TS page at W3C, so
please have one final go at Curt's and Mary's submitted material before I do
so.

>From the DOM WG meeting, we have a wish for a simple harness to generate
straightforward results of at least the ECMA tests. Mary, could we look at
your older solution?

Old Action Items

2. Given that we do indeed finalize this fairly soon, how long will it take
us to translate the existing tests? Mary? [Being done, do we have a date on
this?]

3. We have Fred who's volounteered to write the documentation together with
me. I look forward to start doing this once we've finalized the schema.
[Pending]

5. We need to look into the resolution/status options for the submitted
tests, eg. by adding a pending option while a test is being investigated by
the DOM WG. Also we should decide on whether we submit through a mailig list
or SF. [Philippe to create a www-dom-ts-submissions@w3.org mailing list.
Also, has the SF framework been updated to contain categories as indicated
(investigated by DOM WG)? Finally, is it possible to have backup on the DOM
TS project at regular intervals at SF?]


[Older still]
1. Supply the schema with the construct parts (Curt/Mary/Dimitris) [Done]
2. Write the XSL for generating the Schema from the DOM XML specifications
(Curt has alreaddy done this, needs final polishing) [Done]
5. Rewrite styelsheets for code generation (Java and ECMA primarily, others
welcome) (NIST for the Java one, ECMA open) [will be written as soon as the
schema is finalized, Mary, are you looking at the Java one? I could start
the ECMA XSLT]
6. Work on the details for test suite packaging (Curt, Dimitris?) [Pending,
let's spend some time on this. I'll have a proposal building on previosu
discussions by tomorrow.]
7. Produce documentation (faq, help documentation, test production
descriptions) (Dimitris) [plus Fred, pending]
8. Produce a test matrix (Mary/Dimitris) [Done]
9. Produce a list of semantic requirements (Mary, is connected to the test
matrix) [Pointers to the spec, done, separate document, pending]

Have I missed anything?

Kind regards,

/Dimitris

Sorry about that.  I forgot to mention that I needed
to add an xmlns:xlink attribute to the <spec> element
in wd-dom.xml to get it to run using SAXON.
