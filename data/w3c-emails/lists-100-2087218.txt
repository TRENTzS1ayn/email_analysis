Announcing: www-annotation@w3.org and www-collaboration@w3.org

In September 1995, the W3C sponsored a Workshop on WWW and
Collaboration (http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Collaboration/Workshop/) to
identify extensions to web technology which would facilitate wide-area
asynchronous collaboration.  Four working groups sprang from this
workshop in order to continue work in specific areas: Annotation,
Knowledge Representation, Notification, and Links as First Class
Objects.  

These working groups have now been merged into two public discussion
groups: www-collaboration and www-annotation.  Specifically, the
w3c-collab-annotation mailing list has been transformed into
www-annotation@w3.org, and the mailing lists w3c-collab-notification,
w3c-collab-kr, and w3c-collab-links have been merged into
www-collaboration@w3.org.

All are welcome to read the archives and participate in development
and discussion.  To subscribe or unsubscribe, please send an email to
www-collaboration-request@w3.org or www-annotation-request@w3.org with
the "subscribe" or "unsubscribe" as appropriate.  Archives are kept at
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-collaboration and
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-annotation.

Further information will be sent to the appropriate mailing lists.

Sincerely,
  
  Karen MacArthur
