Are really WWW collaboration and WWW annotation two different
work items?

The natural way to add annotations to a web page seems to me to
be to add a discussion to the web page (or to a place inside
the web page). In that way, other people can comment on your
annotation. Thus, annotations should use WWW collaboration
tools, and one important application of WWW collaboration
tolls is annotations!
