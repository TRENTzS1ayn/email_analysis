Hello Jacob,

In this case, annotation refers to a more specific type of
collaboration.  The annotation working group has been discussing
annotations as documents or objects which reference or annotate
other documents or objects (including other annotations).
You can learn more about annotations in this context
through the annotation working group web page at
http://www.sunlabs.com/people/wayne.gramlich/work/w3c/annote

The www-annotation mailing list is intended for the discussion
of annotations as originally put forth by the annotation working group,
while the www-collaboration mailing list is intended as a more general
discussion to cover all other kinds of collaboration technology and tools.
