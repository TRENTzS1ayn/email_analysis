There are personal annotations and group annotations. In general there
are several types of annotations. During the life cycle of an information
resource, the type of an annotation will likely change. You can adopt
the content model (if you feel comfortable with it) where every piece
of displayable, consumable media is a form of annotation. Then you've
got atomic anotations (eg HTML pages) and composite annotation sets.

Either way, the topic of annotation and collaboration are bound together,
yet are independant of each other in several important ways. There is 
no more inherant a binding between annotations and collaboration
then there is between collaboration and images. Some times the
collaborative work group may want to discuss either.

There may be a collaborative annotation type as the interface between
the models.
