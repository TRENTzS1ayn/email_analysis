Suggest you search for papers by S R Hiltz, M Turoff, P Johnson-lentz 
(I hope I got that spelling correct) and T Johnson-lentz.  They (and
of course others) have been doing research involving evaluation of
Computer-mediated Communication for years.

Also, there is a major WWW 'site' dedicated to Computer-mediated
Communication.

Take a look at the following URLs:
