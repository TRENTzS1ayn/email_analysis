For your info:

I am with Experts Exchange and we have developed and implemented a new
collaborative model on the WWW.  It is similar to news and discussion
groups except for:

1. Questions are regulated and limited using a point system.
2. Answers are graded and scored.

We believe the results have been dramatic. The WWW site now attracts
1500 visitors and 500 posts each day (all without formal marketing).  We
intend to move the model to the enterprize using their intranets.

If anyone is interested in researching, writing, and submitting a
scholarly paper on the Experts Exchange model, please let me know.

Dan
