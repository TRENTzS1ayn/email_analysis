Dear sir/madam:

Hola

I am Saqib Nazar Abbas, student of Ph.D computer sciences at CINVESTAN-IPN.
Now a days, I am trying to investigate amaya's existing facilities in the
field of annotaions. I am very encouraged if you kindly answer my questions
because i am not clear about them.
I just want to know that as amaya is claimed to be a collaborative tool for
annotations,
 1. What about storage of the annotated document as annotations lost when
document is copied to the other directory or send through other resources?
2. What about author identification as an author can provide wrong    
informations?
3. Is there any method to notify the authors that any annotation has been
currently made by any author?
With regards
Saqib Nazar Abbas
Mexico City
