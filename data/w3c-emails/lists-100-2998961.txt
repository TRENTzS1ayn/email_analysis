I have just begun to look at the 11th December Note and would suggest that 
further editing of the document is necessary.

For example, there are several corrections needed in the Abstract.

Line 1: Replace "had" with "have"
Line 1: Replace "contents" with "content"
Line 2: Do you mean "development of XML" or "developments related to XML"?
Line 2: Replace "mupltiple" with "multiple"
Line 3: Replace "relaying" with "relying"
Line 5: Either "mechanisms that allow" or "mechanism that allows"
Line 6: Replace "handled" with "handle"

Perhaps the Note would benefit from a further release when it has been more 
fully edited?

Did all eight editors miss these? :)
