I have a plan to make another browser engine, http://gybe.sf.net/
that apply much modules of gnome desktop environment;
gnome-vfs for network transfer.
libxml and other markup library for parsing.
SAC implementation for CSS parsing.
libgdome for DOM manipulation.
and so on.

with oversight on ToC of CX note,
this note seems to describe all the requirement for a browser engine.
so I have interested in, and wanna read on print.
(I have a little painful eyesight with CRT.
 so don't like to read long text on screen)

but I couldn't find PDF build of the note.
may I have a PDF for this note, like some other W3C TRs?

thx
