Hi,

two things:
- The [Butler] reference (
http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/2001/HPL-2001-83.html) in the Device
Independence Principles WD document is not accessible. Is there another
place where the document can be found?

-  In my opinion, many corporate user categories are dependant on the
ability to work under offline circumstances.
Is there an ambition from the DIP Working Group to cover issues related to
offline capable solutions? My vision is that the user shouldn't have to
know whether he is working online or offline, i.e. the entire framework has
to handle these circumstances transparently to the user.
For W3C XForms there will probably be a Suspend/Resume possibility but the
XForms work group has stated that this XForms capability does not have the
ambition to provide a complete framework for offline capable solutions. I
don't know of any other working groups that could cover these circumstances
so the question is: will DIP cover it?

Regards
/Micke
