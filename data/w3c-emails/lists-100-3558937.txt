You should be able to access this document, which is on an external HP 
site. The link currently works for me, but as I am inside the HP firewall 
my access route may differ. There is also a raw HTML version available at:

Transparency will not be achievable in many circumstances - for example,
when clicking a link to some static content that has not been cached in 
the device (due perhaps to storage limitations), or when accessing real-
time information.

Given that offline browsing is already implemented in many devices, I
would be interested to hear what additional requirements you believe are
necessary that the DI Working Group might need to consider.
