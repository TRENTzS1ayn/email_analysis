Hello

In Goals, the vision statement is ".... to allow the Web to be
accessible by anyone, anywhere, anytime, anyhow". Should not "anything"
be added to the list to accommodate, for example, giving an instruction
to a robot, or the passage of an encrypted "electronic ticket" to a PDA
and simultaneously a one-time decryption key only to the appropriate
"gate reader" at an airport check-in, then using a self-discovery
wireless link to achieve admission, thereby making forgery or mis-use
virtually impossible.  Machine-to-machine communication is after all one
of the attributes of XML.
