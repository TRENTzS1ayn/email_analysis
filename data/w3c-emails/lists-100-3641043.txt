Hello everyone, 

The Device Independence Working Group (DIWG) has been working on
comments associated with the first informal public draft of the document
"Authoring Scenarios for Device Independence". This document was
published on July 31st 2002. 

This posting has two files attached. The first is an annotated update to
the initial public draft containing comments from DIWG members. The
second is an administrative list of outstanding changes including their
state. The two documents can be cross referenced using the unique
numbers applied to each comment.

The DIWG is continuing to review and modify the Authoring Scenarios
document. We also welcome comments on the document and suggestions for
further improvements.

Best wishes 

Rhys Lewis (Editor)
