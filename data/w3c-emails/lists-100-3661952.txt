I assume you mean work on the proposed MPEG-21 standard?

Let me suggest some differences and similarities.

There is a difference of focus. The W3C Device Independence activity is 
based on the desire to present web content across all web-connected 
devices. It does this primarily through the evolution of web markup 
standards. My understanding of the goals of the MPEG-21 work is to 
provide a framework for describing and manipulating digital media in 
general, not necessarily related to the web.

On the other hand, there are a range of common technologies both could 
use, such as the choice of metadata to describe content and delivery 
context, and the use of adaptation to produce appropriate versions of 
content for some purpose.

At a detailed level, there are likely to be some topics that overlap 
both groups, such as the definition of device capabilities. The W3C DI 
Working Group will consult with other groups to try and achieve a common 
approach whenever possible. One of the reasons for giving early 
visibility of our work is to help identify such areas of common interest.
