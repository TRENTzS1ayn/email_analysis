The W3C Device Independence Working Group has just published a W3C
Working Draft of a document titled "Delivery Context Overview for Device
Independence":

    http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-di-dco-20021213/

Abstract:
This document provides an overview of the role of delivery context in 
assisting device independent presentation for the Web. It surveys 
current techniques for conveying delivery context information, and 
identifies further developments that would enhance the ability to adapt 
content for different access mechanisms.

An early informal draft of the document was distributed to this list on 
16 September. When completed, this document is expected to be published 
as a W3C Note.

Comments on the Working Draft are welcome on this (www-di@w3.org) public 
list.
