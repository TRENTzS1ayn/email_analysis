Hi Taka, 

I'm going to be away from the office for the next couple of weeks, and so
won't be able to make the next teleconference I'm afraid.

In addition, commercial demands mean that I'm not going to be able to get to
the Face to Face meeting or the Delivery Context Workshop in person either.
However, Volantis will be represented at the Delivery Context workshop by
Martin Jones, our head of device research. Martin has lots of experience in
the use and support of a wide variety of different kinds of device on the
web, and has been following the relevent standards, such as CC/PP, closely.
He will submit our position paper very soon.

Once again, let me apologise for not being able to attend the face to face
meeting. I'm sure it will be a successful event. I hope everyone has the
opportunity to sample at least some of the pleasures of that part of France.

Best wishes
