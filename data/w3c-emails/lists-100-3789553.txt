The W3C is hosting an open workshop on Delivery Context to be held on
4-5 March at INRIA, Sophia-Antipolis, France.

Delivery Context refers to information about device capabilities, user
preferences or other aspects of the context of web access. The
information may be transferred with, or referenced by, a request for
some web content. Using this information, origin servers can provide
content or presentations more suited to the user or their access
mechanism.

CC/PP already provides a framework for expressing delivery context
information. The workshop will consider what additional work is needed
in this area.

For further details, see the Call for Participation:
