I don't accept that this is a "fact". Also even if that were the "start 
point" it is no longer the woof/warp of the fabric of Device Independence.

Generalism, IMO, prevails in all the proceedings herein. We merely use 
devices as examples/use-cases/techniques that illustrate general 
"principles". We aren't talking just about having tolerance for and 
awareness of all present and projected devices but also about independence 
from the very idea of "devices" as being the nexus of the goals of 
"everyone, everything connected".

The more important shortfall is the mind-set that has attempted to divide 
us into "providers" and "users" as if this system were an elaborate form of 
broadcasting ("top-down") information rather than facilitation of the 
creation/enhancement/sharing of information.

The mantra is "web, not tree". The goal of Device Independence is to have 
our information ambient/efficient and independent of the very notion of 
devices, not just adapted to particular ones.

Establishing further hierarchies of "content" and "delivery" is retrogressive.
