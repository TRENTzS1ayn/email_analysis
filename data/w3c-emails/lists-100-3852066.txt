One of the current work items of the W3C Device Independence Working 
Group is to produce a document setting out the issues facing web site 
authors when making content and applications available to users with 
devices of various capabilities.

To solicit early feedback and discussion within the web community, we 
plan to make early drafts of the document public. The first informal 
public draft is now available:
   http://www.w3.org/2001/di/public/as/as-draft-20020729.html

We would welcome comments on the document, and suggestions for further 
improvements.

This public mailing list (www-di@w3.org) can be used to provide feedback 
and for general discussion on the document.

Roger Gimson (DI WG chair)
