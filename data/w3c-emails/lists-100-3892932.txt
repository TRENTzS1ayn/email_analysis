The W3C Device Independence Working Group (DIWG) is planning a range of 
work items under its new charter. These include, among other items, work 
on Core Device Attributes and on Authoring Techniques.

For full details see the charter document at:

This public mailing list will be used by the DIWG to provide early 
drafts of working documents for general feedback and comment from the 
Web community.
