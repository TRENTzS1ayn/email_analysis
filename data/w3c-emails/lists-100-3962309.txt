POSTERS

Posters provide a forum for late-breaking research, and facilitate
feedback in an informal setting. Posters are peer-reviewed. The poster
area provides an opportunity for researchers and practitioners to
present and demonstrate their recent web-related research, and to
obtain feedback from their peers in an informal setting. It gives
conference attendees a way to learn about innovative works in progress
in a timely and informal manner. Formatting and submission
requirements are available at http://www2003.org/cfp.htm. Inquiries

TUTORIALS AND WORKSHOPS

A program of tutorials will cover topics of current interest to web
design, development, services, operation, use, and evaluation. These
half and full-day sessions will be led by internationally recognized
experts and experienced instructors using prepared content.

Workshops provide an opportunity for researchers, designers, leaders,
and practitioners to explore current web R&D issues through a more
focused and in-depth manner than is possible in a traditional
conference session. Participants typically present position statements
and hold in-depth discussions with their peers within the workshop
setting.
