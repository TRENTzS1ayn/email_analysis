A current work item of the W3C Device Independence Working Group is to 
produce a document that provides an overview and positions the different 
technologies that are involved in the description, transport and use of 
device capabilities.

To solicit early feedback and discussion within the web community, we
plan to make early drafts of the Delivery Context Overview document 
public. The first informal public draft is now available:
    http://www.w3.org/2001/di/public/dco/

We would welcome comments on the document, and suggestions for further
improvements.

This public mailing list (www-di@w3.org) can be used to provide feedback
and for general discussion on the document.

Roger Gimson (DI WG chair)
