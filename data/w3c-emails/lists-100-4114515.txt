>  modeling, analysis and simulation of mobile computing and
>  wireless networks.
>
>  Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
>   * Performance evaluation and modeling of mobile and
>      wireless communication networks
>   * Simulation and analysis of wireless protocols and mobile
>      computing systems
>   * Integrated simulation and measurement based evaluation
>      of mobile and wireless systems
>   * Survivability and reliability evaluation and modeling
>   * RF channel capacity modeling and analysis
>   * Design methodologies for wireless systems
>   * Network support for QoS provisioning in wireless and
>      mobile networks
>   * Modeling and analysis of wireless Internet access
>   * Traffic measurements and models for audio, video,
>      multimedia, and WWW services
>   * New simulation languages and tools for wireless systems
>   * Database management systems and mobile computing
