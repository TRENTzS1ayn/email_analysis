DI working group, Roger,
 
The Trace Center is organizing a Special Interest Group meeting together
with 6 other organizations on Thursday, April 10, 9-10:30am, at the CHI
2003  <http://www.chi2003.org/> conference on Human Factors in Computing
Systems, taking place in Fort Lauderdale, FL.  The purpose of this
meeting is to gather people from industry and academia who are
interested in a "Unified Universal Remote Console Standard", in order to
harmonize the V2 effort  <http://www.incits.org/tc_home/v2.htm> with
related activities, and ultimately work towards a unified URC standard
that meets the requirements of users and industry.  Please see
http://trace.wisc.edu/docs/2003-CHI-Unified-Remote-Console-Standard/
<http://trace.wisc.edu/docs/2003-CHI-Unified-Remote-Console-Standard/>
for more information.
 
The organizers of this meeting (Trace, IBM, Sun Microsystems, Microsoft,
Panasonic, NIST, and the US Census Bureau) are actively seeking the
participation of and dialog with people from the W3C DI working group.
Obviously there is a common interest in developing a standard for user
interface specification that is practical for industry and works
cross-platform.
 
Hope to see you at CHI,
Gottfried Zimmermann
