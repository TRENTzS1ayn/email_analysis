last call working draft - acouple of questions/issues from Claudia




Hi Luu,

many thanks for your reply and for the additional information that you
have provided me.

As I said to Mark, I would like very much to join and help the group but
unfortunately, I have a couple of months to complete my master thesis
which is now my highest priority. Anyway, I will follow the group work
on CC/PP and maybe in the future, be in a situation where I can offer
myself to make contributions to the group.

Best Regards,

CR
