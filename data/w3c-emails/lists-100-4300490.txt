Hi,

If CC/PP does not permit an Attribute (e.g. ExpirationDate) to
be in different Components (i.e. CreditCard and Session) then
it seems to me that CC/PP is broken.  (RDF itself certainly does not
care.)

So the answer to your question is "yes, just do it".

BTW, when your schema is publicly avialable, please post the URI 
to this list

Regards,

Art Barstow

Subject: CC/PP Components


Hello everyone,
I am considering the possibility to extend the CC/PP framework by defining a new vocabulary for describing data not covered by UAProf, as personal information and interests. 
Given the wide range of features covered by this new vocabulary, different attributes with the same name (i.e. "rdf:ID" attribute value) may occur. 
For example, I could declare two "expirationDate" attributes, one belonging to the "CreditCard" Component and one belonging to the "Session" Component. 
I think that such an RDF Schema wouldn't be valid, as I would redefine the same resource. 
Is there a way for defining two attributes with the same name in two different Components of the same vocabulary? If not, what's the utility of Components?
Please forgive me if my question is a trivial one, but I'm not an RDF expert!
Thank you in advance,
Daniele.
