Hello RDF-interest

I have a question about the best way to model properties in RDF.

In CC/PP, an application of RDF, there is the concept of components. CC/PP
properties are grouped into these components e.g. hardware component,
software component etc. For more details of this see
http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-CCPP-struct-vocab-20030325/

However this leads us to a question about best practice when modelling data
with RDF:
1. Is it better to have properties change their meaning dependent on where
they are in a profile structure 
2. or is it better for properties to have a single unambiguous meaning?

Daniele Riboni is proposing a vocabulary with a property called
"ExpirationDate". This property would change in meaning depending on whether
it is in the CreditCard or Session component i.e. adopt approach 1. However
Daniele is not sure if this is legal in CC/PP (see forwarded email below).
Currently it is legal, but not recommended. The alternative would be to have
two separate properties e.g. CreditCardExpirationDate and
SessionExpirationDate. 

Art Barstow has suggested that if CC/PP should allow approach 1 and if it
does not then it is broken.

Please can you advise us on the best way to model this i.e. whether approach
1 or 2 is preferable? If you send your emails to me as well as rdf-interest,
I will summarise them and send the summary to the DI working group?

thanks in advance
