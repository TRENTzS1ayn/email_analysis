Folks, here is some advice on CC/PP components from Graham Klyne and Patrick
Stickler who are both RDF-Core WG members.

=======================================

My take would be that, while allowed, CC/PP "chameleon" attributes should 
be deployed only with great care.  Whether a property is usefully re-used 
over different component types is, I think, a function of how you expect 
the property to be treated.

(I noted the following in the CC/PP change log.  I couldn't find any text 
recommending that properties on different components be distinct, though I 
thought that had been left in:

20010510  [...] Remove requirement for an attribute to be unique across all 
components of a profile. [...]   ).

For example, your example of "CreditCardExpirationDate" and 
"SessionExpirationDate" sound to me like rather different properties with 
possibly different treatment, and would probably better be given separate 
attribute URIs.  But I can also imagine properties that mean pretty much 
the same thing wherever they appear (e.g., a component definition 
expiration date) where the same property might usefully be applied to 
different components with broadly the same meaning.

 From a theoretical point of view, RDF can support either approach -- the 
property defines a relation over subject/object pairs -- though in some 
circumstances I think there may occasionally be some unexpected conclusions 
if the same property is used to have different meanings with 
different   subjects.  For example, suppose we have an ExpirationDate 
property used to the end of a credit arrangement, and also the time by 
which a transaction using a given session must be completed;  what is the 
meaning of this property if applied to something that is both a credit 
arrangement and a session?  In this case, using a single property, one 
cannot assert one meaning without also asserting the other.

If in doubt, my recommendation would be to use different property URIs, 
noting that they can be declared to be subproperties of a common property 
if there is subsequently a desire to reflect any common features.   (Though 
this latter option presumes some level of RDF schema processing.)

Very good comments, Graham. 

I myself think that having "chameleon" properties would negatively
impact interoperability between CC/PP specific applications and
other RDF applications operating on knowledge expressed using the
CC/PP vocabulary. 

I do not believe that in RDF such "chameleon" properties where their
semantics changes contextually are kosher, and that in non-CC/PP
specific applications, ambiguity will arise if they are used.

I would then strongly reiterate Grahams suggestion that you use 
different properties which each reflect the specific semantics
needed in each case, and optionally relate them with a superordinate
property that reflects the intersection of their semantics.

In any case, the semantics of a property should IMO be globally
consistent.

Cheers,

Patrick
