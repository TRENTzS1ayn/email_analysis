I'm not sure exactly what you mean by chameleon properties not being kosher.
If you mean that they will break RDF machinery, then that would be a bad
thing. But if you mean it is problematic to model because it is ambiguous to
humans, I disagree. I would claim that the semantics of ExpirationDate means
"a date after which the resource is no longer valid". I'm not talking about
logically valid so maybe this is a case where Valid needs to have two
different URIs. By Valid, I simply mean it is no longer acceptable, trusted,
kosher,... In other words, this key no longer works.  Now one might argue
that my response (or may application's response) to a Session with an
ExpirationDate which has passed is different from that of a CreditCard which
has an ExpirationDate which has passed. But this is behavior, not semantics.
To me this would be like saying we need two different URIs for the color
green because I know to go at a green light, but my green lawn doesn't have
the same meaning to me. The color green hasn't changed, just the context.


Cheers,

James

Very good comments, Graham. 

I myself think that having "chameleon" properties would negatively
impact interoperability between CC/PP specific applications and
other RDF applications operating on knowledge expressed using the
CC/PP vocabulary. 

I do not believe that in RDF such "chameleon" properties where their
semantics changes contextually are kosher, and that in non-CC/PP
specific applications, ambiguity will arise if they are used.

I would then strongly reiterate Grahams suggestion that you use 
different properties which each reflect the specific semantics
needed in each case, and optionally relate them with a superordinate
property that reflects the intersection of their semantics.

In any case, the semantics of a property should IMO be globally
consistent.

Cheers,

Patrick
