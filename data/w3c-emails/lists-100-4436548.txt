Dear subscribers of www-di and www-mobile,

Last few days you probably experienced some troubles with these two
mailing-list and the cross-posting policy we setup. That was a nightmare
for everybody.
Following the merge of cc/pp working group and device independence
working group, we wanted to be sure that discussion on www-mobile can be
followed by people on www-di. That was not the right thing to do.
To fix further problems, we decided to keep the lists separate, with a
specific scope.
www-di
------
Public mailing list for discussion of general issues relating to Device 
Independence, and in particular device independent markup and authoring.
This 
list will also be used by the Device Independence Working Group to ask
for 
comments on its public documents relating to DI principles, authoring
challenges 
and techniques and device characteristics.

www-mobile
----------
Public mailing list for discussion of general issues of accessing the
Web from 
mobile devices. This list will also be used by the Device Independence
Working 
Group to ask for comments on its public documents relating to CC/PP.

As of today, we stopped the cross-posting, and we didn't change any
subscription. If you want to be subscribed or unsubscribed to any of
these lists please send (un)subscribe command to www-di-request and/or
www-mobile-request

Please accept our apologize for all the trouble
Stephane Boyera
