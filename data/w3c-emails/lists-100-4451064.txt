"Break" may be too strong a word, but RDF does not provide
a way to assign contextual meaning to URIs (that I'm aware
of) and IMO there is a strong built-in presumption that
URIs have globally consistent meaning, such that they always
mean the same thing wherever they are encountered.

If a CC/PP application is going to make a distinction between
the meaning of a property based on context and an RDF-only
application will not make such a distinction (since it can't)
then confusion could arise.

That's not what I mean.

I agree. You're definition of the meaning of ExpirationDate does
not seem to vary contextually. But the original question suggested
it would (not that it was fully clear to me how).

Again, no disagreement here.

The question was whether the meaning of a property could be different
depending on its context. My opinion is that it should not.

Of course, that's not to say that what a given application does based
on a given property and value will not be contextual, as your "green
light"/"green lawn" example shows.
