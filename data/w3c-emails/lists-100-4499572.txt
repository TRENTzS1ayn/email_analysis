I suspect there's often going to be an element of judgement about 
this.  The case outlined here suggests to me that different properties 
would be appropriate, so that processing can easily be directed based on 
the property alone.  In other cases, where a property may be used in 
different contexts but processed similarly, I think a common property may 
be easier.
