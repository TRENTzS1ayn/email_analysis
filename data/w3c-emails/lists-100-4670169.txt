The W3C Device Independence Working Group is chartered to produce a 
recommendation on Core Presentation Attributes (core attributes of a 
device that are important when adapting presentations for the device). 
Our first step is to define requirements and use cases.

To solicit early feedback and discussion within the web community, we
are making an early draft of the "Core Presentation Attributes: 
Requirements and Use Cases" document public. The first informal public 
draft is now available:

     http://www.w3.org/2001/di/public/cpa-req/

We would welcome comments on the document, and suggestions for further
improvements.

This public mailing list (www-di@w3.org) can be used to provide feedback
and for general discussion on the document.

Roger Gimson (DI WG chair)
