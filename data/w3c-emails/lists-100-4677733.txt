At the 2003 World Wide Web Conference (http://www2003.org) the final day 
is dedicated to developer-oriented meetings on different topics.

This year, there are two topics that may be of special interest to 
people on this www-di@w3.org list:

[D6] Mobile Web and
[D7] Authoring Techniques for Accessibility and Device Independence

For full descriptions please see: http://www2003.org/dd/

As co-organiser of the [D7] topic, I would welcome proposals for 
presentations relating to Device Independent Authoring tools and 
techniques.

** The deadline for proposals is 14 February 2003 **

Please feel free to contact me beforehand if you are unsure whether your 
idea might fit with the topics of interest.
