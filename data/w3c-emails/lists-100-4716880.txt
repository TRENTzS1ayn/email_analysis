I have just read the document 'http://www.w3.org/TR/cpc-req/' @ w3.org
hopping to discover if there are any formal standards protocols for device
manufactures and web server developers to adhere to regarding the
names/attributes for devise capabilities. If a phone requested a screen size
of 800 x 600 what would you place in the http request? How is this done on
the phone? And how would a server no how to interpret this in order to
facilitate the devices request? "Screen-size" and "size-of-screen" are
completely different to a computer! (we need a standard or protocol I guess!
).

 

Thank you for your time
