The W3C Device Independence Working Group has just started work on a
proposed standard for Core Presentation Characteristics that will satisfy
the requirements for unambiguous attributes we identified in the document
you cited.

For existing examples of device vocabularies, have a look at the OMA's
UAProf (User Agent Profile), the IETF's Media Feature Sets, W3C's CSS Media
Queries or W3C's SMIL System Test Attributes. The first two of these also
have associated protocols for conveying device profiles as part of an HTTP
request, but neither are widely supported on servers to date. All are
referenced in our CPC Requirements document http://www.w3.org/TR/cpc-req/
or in our earlier Delivery Context Overview document
http://www.w3.org/TR/di-dco/ .

You have correctly spotted an area that is ripe for further development.

Roger Gimson
