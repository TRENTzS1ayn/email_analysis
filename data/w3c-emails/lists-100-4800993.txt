WWW2003 Developer Day on 24 May 2003 included a track on "Authoring 
Techniques for Accessibility and Device Independence".

All the presentations (or links to them) from this track (and another 
relevant to DI from another track) have been collected together, indexed, 
and put into a zip file for those who might be interested. See:

    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2003Jun/0036.html

Unfortunately, several of the submitted presentations are not in HTML, or
an equivalently accessible format. It is therefore not intended to made the
files available except in this archive form.
