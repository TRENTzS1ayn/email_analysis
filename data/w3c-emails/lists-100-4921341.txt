The W3C Device Independence Working Group has just published a W3C
Working Draft of a document titled "Core Presentation Characteristics: 
Requirements and Use Cases":

    http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-cpc-req-20030510/

Abstract:
This document sets out the Requirements for defining a set of Core Presentation 
Characteristics. The purpose of defining these Core Presentation Characteristics 
is to provide a common set of property or attribute definitions that can be 
reused in many contexts in which the presentation capabilities of a presentation 
device need to be considered. The use of well-defined Core Presentation 
Characteristics will simplify the task of adapting content to a specific 
presentation delivery context. The document sets out what is meant by 'core' and 
'presentation,' what should be included in the definition of each 
characteristic, what should be defined when grouped characteristics into 
collections, and what kind of characteristics should be included in the core. It 
also suggests some use cases.

Comments on the Working Draft are welcome on this (www-di@w3.org) list.

It is intended to proceed to develop a Recommendation based on these 
requirements, as outlined in the DIWG charter:
