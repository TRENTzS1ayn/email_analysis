Folks,

Our UCP website http://www.zurich.ibm.com/ucp is now publicly available! 
UCP is a CCPP/UAProf processing engine developed at the IBM Zurich 
Research Laboratory for provisioning of profile information to 
applications and Web servers through the standard JSR-188 API. The UCP 
processor supports the aggregation of capability and preference 
information from a variety of input sources including, for instance, 
CCPP/UAProf-compatible delivery context information as transported in an 
HTTP request from the client device to the server or quasi-static profile 
and preference information as configured by the user during Web portal 
enrollment.

Via the link Demos > Profile Validator, the website also provides a 
profile validation service for CCPP profiles in XML RDF serialization 
format. The UCP Validator takes as input a CC/PP profile and validates the 
syntax of the profile w.r.t. the profile vocabularies. The user can submit 
the profile document to be checked in (a) via a file selection dialog, (b) 
by specifying the URL of the profile resource, (c) by cut and paste of the 
contents of the profile document, or (d) by selecting a predefined profile 
from the UAProf repository on w3development.de. The submitted profiles may 
use multiple vocabularies. The set of vocabularies configured for the 
validator can be viewed via the link Demos > Profile Vocabularies. The 
validator generates a detailed list of reports about the profile examined, 
highlights all detected problems, and categorizes them as errors and 
warnings. For certain error types the UCP processor applies some 
correction heuristics that may fix the error. This is also reported. The 
profile information that is extracted as a result of the profile parsing 
and error correction may also be viewed.

We have made the observation that a number of CCPP/UAProf profiles 
available on the internet are syntactically or semantically incorrect. We 
hope that the UCP validation service helps improve the quality of 
published profile information. Any feedback, comments or critics, is 
appreciated.

With kind regards,
