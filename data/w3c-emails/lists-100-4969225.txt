Hi,

some comments on the "Authoring Techniques for Device Independence" WD.


1:
In the introductory paragraphs the word "Note" appears several times. 
It's confusing to use "Note" when the document is not a "Note" but a 
"Working Draft".


2.2.2:
   In CSS Media Queries, the author defines rules based on contextual
   information. These rules are captured as a class and XHTML tags in a
   document may be assigned a class via the class attribute. The rules
   then affect the presentation of content associated with the class.

CSS in general does not only use class selectors. You can style an XHTML 
document without using a single class attribute in the XHTML.


7.2.2 Sample 5:

   @media screen and (max-device-width: 300pix) {
                                           ^^^
Should be 'px'.


8.2.1:
   A solution is to permit the author to make references such as "see X",
   (X being a named anchor) which may subsequently be rendered as "see
   Page 5" in pagination contexts, or perhaps "see Section 4.2" in a
   section-based decomposition context or "see here" where the "here" is
   rendered as a hyperlink in non-decomposition contexts.

According to the WAI guidelines, you should not use "click here" links. 
So please remove this example or use another phrase.


9.2:
   Hyperlinks (navigable anchors within content)
     A hyperlink is an embedded reference to a resource, or a part
     thereof, that is followed in response to an event (typically
     user-initiated). The problems of link maintenance are well
     understood but device independent authoring of links is less
     understood. Consider the simple choice of authoring a link to a help
     resource: one may write "For assistance please click here" where the
     here is the link.

For the same reason, please use another link phrase example.


9.4:
   The original linking mechanism has its deficiencies. For example, the
   link does not indicate the relationship between the linked content.

There are the rel and rev attributes for the HTML a element:
<a href="linked_resource" rel="relation">


   The type of the referenced target cannot be identified.

There is the type attribute for the HTML a element:
<a href="linked_resource" type="type_of_linked_resource">
