Hi everyone,

As a contribution to the work on Authoring Techniques, recently published as a working draft by the W3C Device 
Independence Working Group, Volantis Systems Ltd. (http://www.volantis.com) is pleased to contribute a short 
paper outlining some of the techniques used within its products to support web sites and applications that can
be accessed from a wide variety of different kinds of device with different characteristics.
