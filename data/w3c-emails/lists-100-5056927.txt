Subject: Consensus Contribution to authoring techniques and interaction
ma rkup



Dear Members of the DI working group,

as a contribution to the DI group's work on authoring techniques and interaction markup, the Consensus Consortium hereby submits a document about layout specification 
in renderer-independent markup language. The document is publicly accessible 
at the Consortium homepage 
https://www.consensus-online.org/publicdocs/20031021-RIML-layout.pdf 

The submitted layout module is part of a larger language profile called RIML. 

RIML is based on XHTML 2.0 WD and XFORMS 1.0 and was defined by the Consortium  to assist single-authoring of web content. The Consortium created a reference implementation of an adaptation proxy which interprets RIML and produces browser-specific markup. 

It is hoped that the availability of both specification and implementation 
helps to accelerate the provision of single-authoring environments based on W3C standards. 

On behalf of the Consensus Consortium,
Thomas Ziegert
