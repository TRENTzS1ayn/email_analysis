Call for Papers:
WWW2004 Workshop on Content Labeling
 - Technical and Socio-Cultural Challenges and Solutions

May 18, 2004, Sheraton Hotel, New-York, NY USA


Content Labels might indicate the presence of nudity or
representations of violence on a site and are intended 
to empower users to filter unwanted content. Value Assessment
is a third party content labeling system, whereby Internet
Service Providers and search engine administrators could label
sites for the convenience of their customers. In order for
these labels to serve their intended function, it is important
that assessment criteria be articulated and public awareness of
filtering be raised. As this method of content-labeling is
voluntary and largely self-regulated, user demands that content
providers accurately convey the nature of Web sites will be
critical to the widespread application of this technology.

Content labeling mechanisms have been working quite well
for users and content providers who access the World Wide Web
using a personal computer. However, users who access the Web
from mobile devices do not yet have access to content labeling 
technology to assist them in filtering unwanted content.

Current content labeling specifications and related processing
architectures face serious limitations in terms of device 
independence and internationalization. The need to deploy
content labeling tools for mobile devices is an issue of
both technical and social significance.


Topics of interest for technical papers include,
but are not limited to the following:

* Value Assessment techniques and the Semantic Web
* Content rating using semantic annotation
* New architecture for mobile device-enabled value assessment
* Value assessment of non-textual information
* Automatic content assessment information from Web contents
* Novel techniques for content selection and filtering
* Internationalization of value assessment mechanisms
* Privacy issues associated with value assessments


Paper Submission and Review:

Papers should be submitted via email to the workshop chair
at kaz@sfc.keio.ac.jp. Papers submitted to the workshop 
will undergo a peer review process overseen by the workshop
co-chairs. Each paper will be reviewed by at least two program
committee members. Accepted papers will appear in informal
electronic and printed proceedings that will be made available
after (or before) the workshop.

Papers should not exceed 5000 words (approximately 12 pages)
in length and must be submitted in PDF. Short papers (up to 6 pages)
describing early research results are also welcome.
