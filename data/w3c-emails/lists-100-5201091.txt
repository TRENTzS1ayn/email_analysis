I partially agree.
 
A well designed document should be accessible by anyone on any device.
 
Where this falls apart is in assuming that XHTML in its current incarnation is sufficient to represent a document that can be accessible by anyone on any device.
 
The DIWG has explored the challenges, deficiencies, requirements and current techniques relating to this issue. I urge you to read this material. Perhaps, eventually (with some guidance from our Group and related Groups) we will achieve a document representation and adaptation strategy/mechanism that will achieve the goal of "write once, read anywhere". I personally doubt this will happen any time soon, and I encourage you to research the gap between what we have today (e.g. XHTML, CSSMQ, XForms, SMIL) and what we (probably) need in the future.
 
As for CC/PP, the need for CC/PP (or some technology that satisfies the goals of CC/PP) will become obvious as your research matures. But I hasten to point out that describing CC/PP as a "waste of time" is hardly a good way to engage with a group of highly dedicated people from around the world who have expended so much effort in creating CC/PP...

Subject: Multi-channel content




I am in the process of writing a masters paper [1] on the topic of
device independence.

I thought I should write to this list, to see if anyone shares my belief
that we do NOT have to have :

"multi-channel content, i.e. services available for various groups with
various browsing equipment"

I feel a little on my own here compared to fairly large amount of
research on the opposite end. I wonder if someone can give me some words
of encouragement, or tell me where I have gone wrong.

Right now, I believe a well designed XHTML document should be accessible
by anyone on any device. I also think CC/PP is a waste of time.
