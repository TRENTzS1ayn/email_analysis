Hi

My opinion on this issue complies with what Julian wrote:

Front-end web standards (like XHTML and CSS) allow people to create a more universal design.  However, a lot of web companies do not focus on this quality but rather care about if the interface looks great in IE5+ browsers.

The increased amount of web-enabled devices make companies aware of new business models.  Since there current interfaces are not standard compliant, they need to create additional channels to publish to other devices.  This is very expensive from a TCO perspective.

Designers should first of all focus on universal front-end design to make one interface as accessible as possible to as many people and devices as possible.  However, from a more functional point of view, it is not always the best idea to publish the same content or use the same applications on different devices.  For certain target-groups, business-models or applications a company can decide to do some fine-tuning and generate the front-end dynamically through back-end logic (like CC/PP) in order to create a mobile killer-app.

Best regards
