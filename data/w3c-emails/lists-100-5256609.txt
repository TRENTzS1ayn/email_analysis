Hi folks,

I agree that the it is better to have content that is accessible on most
devices, rather than styling for particular devices where possible. Why make
a problem complex when you can make it simple?

However even if you have a good XHTML mobile browser, standards like CC/PP
are still potential useful. For example:

- mobile data costs are still quite high. So use CC/PP either at the server
or at an intelligent proxy to reduce image sizes (the user can't see them in
as much detail on a mobile device anyway) to save the user money and time.

- if you are downloading media objects (ringtones, audio, images, software
etc) have a single way of checking the device has the required capabilities
to use the object - often the user is paying so this is important!

- there are overlaps between CC/PP and HTTP content negotiation. However
CC/PP has the advantage that data is sent by reference, which allows the
client to send more information while using less bandwidth.

In my view, the current version of CC/PP is more complicated than it needs
to be. But having a single, widely used standard for capability negotiation
would be an excellent idea as its such a pervasive problem - see [1] for
more discussion about this.
