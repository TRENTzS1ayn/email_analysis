You believe the XHTML spec is too weak ? Perhaps I don't have high
expectations of a "document".

I have poked around, but I have not found anything besides the "fails to
meet the content providers needs with respect to end-users"
argumentation. Are these the same content providers that gave us Flash,
cluttered table layouts, walled gardens, poor accessibility and other
such nonsense?

What is CSSMQ? I am quite familiar with XHTML, CSS, XForms, and if we
can just encourage good implementations of those, I think we can reach
tangible goals.

I am sorry about that. It was a Freudian slip. I just think its a step
backwards. It is like setting a standard, for non-standardness. I have
very little faith in content adaption.

Kind regards,
