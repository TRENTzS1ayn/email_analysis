What applications ? Is at it as easy as writing XHTML? And I hope they
are as affordable as in free.

I agree. But is CC/PP the right direction?

I have never seen a HTML device having problems rendering XHTML. CSS is
another matter. 

As for WML. Well, that's a complete failure imo! It's not such a big
concern, as you must remember these WML devices are consumer devices
which can't upgrade and get thrown away when their battery dies after
3-4 years.

What can we do about poor user agents? Give the author more challenges?
It was hard enough with Netscape and IE a couple of years back. :/

If I can read my XHTML homepage in any device on a Nokia 6600, Palm III,
webTV and of course a workstation. That's accessibility and at least for
me, that is a pleasing user experience.

I think the web medium for interactive pages should be small. Filling in
forms extend down the page is turn off for me on a workstation.

For longer pages, well hopefully RSS can perhaps fill in there. I look
to blogs and such things as examples of bite sized quality information.

We all know how badly bitmaps scale, so I don't see the big deal in
leaving them out (the mobile domain) until we get SVG support.

If you pick up a newspaper or a magazine, you will observe similarities
between the medium. The web I hope will one day settle down on simple
and accessible, CSS formatted, concise content conventions.

Could I get access to this information for study? I must say the
manufacturers including Nokia could do a much better job of discerning
information about their devices. For Nokia, they have details in a
inaccessible PDF matrix. :/

I would love to see a decent voice-enabled browser or implementation.
Right now I think there are bigger fish to fry. Getting the right text
everywhere is much more important. A killer app would be one that
transcribes voice to text !

I really disagree here. I maintain lots of webpages. Maybe I am too
grass roots, but CC/PP sounds like a huge challenge not support for what
I want to accomplish. The whole reason why the web is so fascinating to
me and others, is that it (was) so easy to publish.

I hope they're also affordable for the likes of the current mobile
market leader Nokia to implement, considering they are only right now
pulling off subsets of XHTML and CSS1 on their "next generation"
platform.

I will hope to write about my 60 page thesis in bite size entries on my
blog [1]. Different mediums. ;)

All printers generally do postscript. :) Since you are probably running
proprietary software, here is a link to the larger PDF version [2].
