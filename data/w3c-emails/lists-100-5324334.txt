Hi Kai, Johannes

The latest version of DELI has the information on Johannes' page as RDF
(well I generate it from XML to make it easier to edit) which allows DELI to
retrieve all the profiles and validate them -  see
http://delicon.sourceforge.net/. When you've installed DELI, type java
com.hp.hpl.deliTest.UAProfValidator (you may need to set the HTTP proxy if
behind a firewall) to run the bulk test. 

Unfortunately there are quite a few errors.

Johannes, perhaps we ought to collaborate on maintaining the profile list?

cheers

Thanks.

I just had a look at a couple of these UAprofs, and they seem to miss out on
some sort of temporal value. Therefore I can't plot mobile trends over time!


There aren't cool URIs. :)
