I have chosen the word "scale" to describe how content is proportionally
defined to be able to be device independent.

So if text is sized at 100% it should be very readable / legible default setting
on a desktop browser, as well as a XHTML micro browser on a mobile. Hence
it scales across devices...

Am I correct for using the word "scale"? It seems to be an overloaded
term. http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=scale

It's often referred on the web to whether hardware or software can meet
large amounts of users.

Here I am asserting that it's the devices browsers responsibility to
resize the text accordingly, not the content authors:

W3 resources such as:

Certainly doesn't make it any clearer. :/



Kind regards,




p.s. Btw http://www.consensus-online.org/ is still not working ...
