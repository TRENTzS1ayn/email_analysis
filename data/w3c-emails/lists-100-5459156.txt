If my 100% sized text is not legible it's a UA bug, aka a "serious
deficiency".

The UA or rather device vendor should define this base.

Me too. But their defaults better be good at least.

It doesn't have to be so specific. Couldn't I just plug in a value like
"Text zoom" in Mozilla (how comparable is "zoom" and "scale" ?) as 110%.
So once the style sheet definition has influenced the base
representation, my setting simply modifies it again.

I am concerned about the "intermediate" adaption doing more harm than
good. 

 * The author could just define base adjustments that suit his
   design. 

 * The device vendor *should* choose a base that best suites the
   device. 

 * The user could choose a modifier to best suite their eyesight.


Of course the UA should remember my setting if I changed it. It also
should be as easy to do on a mobile device as changing the volume. :)
