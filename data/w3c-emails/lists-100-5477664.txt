Hi,

I am also new to WAP, and CC/PP, and I am looking at the same problem. 

In the Java/XML world, the java DELI application can be used to extract information from profiles, and this has been integrated into COCOON, an XSLT architecture for transforming XML from one form to another. 

 XML->PROFILE->XSLT->WML/HTML/...

Personally, I am prejudiced against cocoon. It seems peverse to me to use XML as a processing language or storage language, when other much better tools (like java and RDBMS) exist. And...I could go on. But this may be just prejudice!

DELI is also used in DICE, which is a java architecture for pipelining processors. 

DATA+PROFILE->Process1->Process2...->WML/HTML/...

I like this, but it relies on passing data as a simple string between processors, which seems a bit crude...

Another soution might be the W3C's CSS Media Queries specification, which allows parts of an HTML (WML?) file to be made conditional on the Profile attributes. This looks good - but seems to have little software support at present, even for HTML. Also, it means that all the data for all devices is transmitted to the client, which then selects the bits it needs - costly in bandwidth and difficult to read and debug. 

I am experimenting with a "template" system I have lashed up using DELI, based on a sort of cross between DICE, cocoon and media queries. For each html page (wml deck)  there are a number of templates giving the gross features of language, data selection and layout. The choice of template is based on the Profile. Within each template, the content and layout can be "fine tuned" with a syntax similar to media queries. But I am still in the early stages. 

I would welcome any other ideas.

Hi,
 I am new to the WAP development.I was looking into
the CC/PP,RDF formats for Useragent profiles.
My question is how is the origin server going to
format the WML pages using these RDF information -
screen size,pixels etc.
As a developer how will we incorporate the display of
a text box(to show it small in size) in a mobile
through our wml code?How does these information in RDF
files help the developer and how is it sent out to the
wap gateway?
could any of you explain?
Thanks
Deepa Srikanth
