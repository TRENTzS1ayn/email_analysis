Hi Tim

Good to hear that DELI is useful to you, unfortuantely I am working on
something quite different now so DELI hasn't progressed in a while.

Some other possibilities, which have been mentioned here on this list
before, are

- Use a tool that makes RDF processable in XSLT such as TreeHugger or
RDFTwig
http://rdfweb.org/people/damian/treehugger/
http://rdftwig.sourceforge.net/

- Use a tool for querying RDF such as RDQL, RxPath or Versa
http://www.hpl.hp.com/semweb/doc/tutorial/RDQL/
http://rx4rdf.liminalzone.org/RxPath
http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-think10/index.html

(BTW, for others not familiar with DELI, more information on the DELI work
can be found on my webpage below)

Hi,

I am also new to WAP, and CC/PP, and I am looking at the same problem. 

In the Java/XML world, the java DELI application can be used to extract
information from profiles, and this has been integrated into COCOON, an XSLT
architecture for transforming XML from one form to another. 

 XML->PROFILE->XSLT->WML/HTML/...

Personally, I am prejudiced against cocoon. It seems peverse to me to use
XML as a processing language or storage language, when other much better
tools (like java and RDBMS) exist. And...I could go on. But this may be just
prejudice!

DELI is also used in DICE, which is a java architecture for pipelining
processors. 

DATA+PROFILE->Process1->Process2...->WML/HTML/...

I like this, but it relies on passing data as a simple string between
processors, which seems a bit crude...

Another soution might be the W3C's CSS Media Queries specification, which
allows parts of an HTML (WML?) file to be made conditional on the Profile
attributes. This looks good - but seems to have little software support at
present, even for HTML. Also, it means that all the data for all devices is
transmitted to the client, which then selects the bits it needs - costly in
bandwidth and difficult to read and debug. 

I am experimenting with a "template" system I have lashed up using DELI,
based on a sort of cross between DICE, cocoon and media queries. For each
html page (wml deck)  there are a number of templates giving the gross
features of language, data selection and layout. The choice of template is
based on the Profile. Within each template, the content and layout can be
"fine tuned" with a syntax similar to media queries. But I am still in the
early stages. 

I would welcome any other ideas.

Hi,
 I am new to the WAP development.I was looking into
the CC/PP,RDF formats for Useragent profiles.
My question is how is the origin server going to
format the WML pages using these RDF information -
screen size,pixels etc.
As a developer how will we incorporate the display of
a text box(to show it small in size) in a mobile
through our wml code?How does these information in RDF
files help the developer and how is it sent out to the
wap gateway?
could any of you explain?
Thanks
Deepa Srikanth
