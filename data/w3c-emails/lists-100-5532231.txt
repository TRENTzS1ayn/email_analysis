Ok, that CNET page is a bad example as its complex multi-columned design
isn't good practice IMO. It's emulating a magazine, when it's the web.
There is big difference in the medium. Ok, that's debatable... lets move
on.

What about a page like my homepage:
http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/hendry/

Text is allowed to flow, so there should be no need for panning
horizontally (to a degree).

Has my XHTML web page scaled? 
Has the UA scaled the web page correctly?
Or should I ask if the device has correctly scaled it?

If people made webpages like mine, would it need adaption? =)

I've noticed this actually. :/

If we have problems scaling text (seemingly), isn't that worrying for
device independence? Should we not be really getting text right before
moving on?

Otherwise can I reasonably suggest that people do not touch their font
size settings in pursuit of device independence? Or tell UA vendors to
ignore CSS with font-size definitions?
