Scaling, as described in recent discussions, is probably safe to be
described as part of the field of accessibility, insofar as it can
enable otherwise inaccessible content to be accessible. I would also
put it into the field of usability, since further scaling (under the
control of the end user) can convert a merely accessible form of
content into something that the user would actually use. If you take
usability to the extreme, as would be the case when faced with a
user who has specific extraordinary needs, then it falls under the
umbrella of accessiblity as defined by WAI.

I don't think a hierarchy is plausable. I prefer to use Venn Diagrams
when describing DI, accessibility, usability and malleability. The
last one shouldn't be overlooked, as this characteristic determines
the success of adaptation, including at the client-side (which it
would seem would be the preferred place for adaptation, were it not
for other issues such as bandwidth wastage, client processing
requirements etc.)

Keep posting to the list, as the material here is guaranteed to persist
(in accordance with W3C philosophy), whereas your blog is neither
guaranteed to be fixed nor persistent.

And feel free to cross-post to WAI, as this discussion has now drifted
into the realm of human accessibiliy and worthy of mutual consideration.

Is transcoding the same as re-adaption?
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/DIAWorkshop/dia-realistic.html

And is it safe to safe scaling is part of the field of accessibility?

And is it to safe "device independence" is part of the field of
accessibility?

Is there a difference between "universal" accessibility (crops up a lot
in academic literature), and vanilla "accessibility"?

I am trying desperately to apply logic to this all. :)

Does this little bit of UTF-8 art look plausible:


                    [universal] accessibility
                          |
      ----------------------------------------
     |            |                          |
Usability       Device independence       Special needs
                  |         |                * Visual
                  |       Scaling            * Hearing
            Multi-Modality                   * Cognitive


Perhaps someone could point me out to some "authoritative sources". :)



I wrote a bit of piece on text width I would appreciate comments on:
http://natalian.org/archives/2004/06/09/text-width/

It's quite frustrating how I go back and forth between this email list
and the web blog. The two should converge...

I wonder if I should I should start (cross-)posting to w3c-wai-ig!?
