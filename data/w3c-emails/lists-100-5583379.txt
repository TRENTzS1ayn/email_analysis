Can you give me an example here? How can an accessible piece of text
say, become usable?

Could you resize/scale an accessible piece of text to compensate for an
adjustment in say reading distance, and call it usability? I would like
to think resizing text is an accessibility feature that should have been
there in the first place.

Usability to the extreme. Hehe.

Malleability is more of implementation thing. For example malleability
is provided by valid XML right? We can now transform, although we really
do have to know our inputs and outputs very well. malleability would be
the flexibility that most authors would not like to touch though... 

I don't want to go to mystical semantic land, if that's what you mean by
Malleability. ;)

I am working on a dia figure:

But I am having trouble intersecting some topics there. I feel I should
just use this diagram to put some of the numerous topics I raise in my
thesis under the field of accessibility.

I will post them a message about the definition and see what happens.
