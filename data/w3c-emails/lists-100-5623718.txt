I think it largely depends on the availability of good tools, and will
probably be taken up initially by organizations with significant
technical resources. I can also envisage the emergence of third-party
annotation services creating metadata to explain or provide additional
semantics for Web content, with device independence applications in mind.

Why not? If your delivery context requires that you use a speech
interface, for example, surely it doesn't matter so far as the
technical solution is concerned whether this is because you are
driving a car or have a disability. The technical requirements may be
the same in both scenarios; unless a speech interface is available,
the content is inaccessible to you.

Of course there is a policy difference in that the person with a
disability, unlike the person who is driving a car, can't simply
change the context (e.g., by moving to a graphical workstation in the
driver's case) and
thereby gain access to content which, in the car, would be
inaccessible. Rather, lack of support for a speech interface, in the
above example, may effectively deprive the person with a disability of
any access to the content; and hence it is an issue with which public
policy is legitimately concerned on human rights grounds. However,
from a functional standpoint, as mentioned earlier, the person with the
disability and the driver are in delivery contexts that, again in the
example proposed, are satisfied by identical technical means. I would
rather say that it is a question of accessibility in both cases, but
for the driver it is obviously not a question of "accessibility to
people with disabilities", which is a subset of "accessibility" tout court.

To the contrary, I think the current wording is much clearer and I
prefer it to any of the alternatives proposed.

On this and the remaining points I agree with Roger's comments.
