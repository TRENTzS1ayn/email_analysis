Dear Members of the DI working group,

the CONSENSUS-project website is now back online, sorry for the long delay, we suffered from a DNS issue our provider had.
The documents section does now include a specification of the Renderer Independent Markup Language (RIML) and a manual on how to operate the open source implementation of the Adaptation Engine, which can be found here:

Best regards,
Thomas Ziegert

>
>Dear Members of the DI working group,
>

>availability of the Open Source Implementation of its 
>Adaptation Engine supporting the Renderer-Independent Markup 
>Language (RIML) 2.0.

>---------------------------------------------------------------
>-----------------
>
>CONSENSUS project announces open source software for 
>device-independent authoring
>
>The European Commission-funded CONSENSUS project has reached a 
>successful conclusion, producing a specification for a 
>Renderer-Independent Markup Language (RIML) for third 
>generation (3G) mobile communications applications. The 
>CONSENSUS project was initiated to address the multiple 
>efforts associated with adapting user-interfaces of a given 
>application to be operated on a variety of (mobile) devices. 
>RIML allows an author to write content only once in a 
>standardised format based on the Extensible Hypertext Markup 
>Language (XHTML) and XFORMS. The content is then automatically 
>adapted for different end-user terminals including voice.
>
>CONSENSUS has implemented a prototype application platform, 
>which supports mobile devices such as personal digital 
>assistants (PDAs), phones with wireless application protocol 
>(WAP) and XHTML-Mobile Profile (MP) browsers, and pure 
>voice-operated devices. The prototype has now been released as 
>Open Source under the Common Public License, and it is 
>available via the CONSENSUS website http://www.consensus-online.org
>
>The objective of the CONSENSUS project was to enable the 
>efficient development of corporate web applications in 3G 
>mobile networks by removing the need to adapt applications 
>manually for different device types. The first step was to 
>create a device-independent authoring language that would be 
>acceptable to developers but still contains sufficient 
>functionality to support adaptation. The result was RIML, 
>familiar-looking for web authors since it is based on XHTML2.0 
>and XFORMS, but with additional features such as content 
>selection and alternative layouts to support single authoring. 
>The second step was the implementation of a reverse proxy 
>prototype that supported the use of RIML with no installation 
>required on the client (user) side. Finally, CONSENSUS 
>validated RIML and the prototype architecture in a field trial 
>with real users using a real corporate application.
>
>The CONSENSUS Open Source Software is hosted here:
