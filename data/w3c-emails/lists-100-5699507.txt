Greetings, you might like to take a look at the Consensus project, it 
includes some open source code that may be of interest. It doesn't include 
CC/PP support but it could be plugged in.

        Subject:        Adaptation of webcontent

 


Hello List,

me and a fellow student (TU Ilmenau, Germany) are about to begin a student 
research project about adaptation of webcontent for mobile devices (PDA an 
WebPad) - especially, concerning the needs of (visually) handicapped 
people. We planned to use CC/PP.

Within the framework of our inquiry we are now looking for existing 
projects or articles about implementations dealing with the adaptation of 
webcontent. 

I would be pleased about every hint, link or whatever. :) We need some 
inspiration.

Thank you for your help, Lars Wulfken.
