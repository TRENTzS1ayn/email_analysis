For my personal interest (and the projects I work on daily) I am collecting UAProfiles 
from the HTTP headers sent by the devices. The scripts to import the headers into the 
database are not yet complete, but at a good point (about 80-90%). As soon as it'll be 
complete I'll offer a small web interface to run some predefined queries such as 
searching a UAProfiles and more.

I'll post the URL here if anyone really minds about it.
