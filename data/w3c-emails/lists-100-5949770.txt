Many of us already know of (and sometimes use) WURFL. It's not exactly what
we need, but still useful. However, it raises an interesting point. There are
several resource "out there" that we know of, but no single place where we
can get a list (of links) to them. I will suggest to W3C DIWG that we create
a page on our public site to list such resources, and invite contributions to
the list. (I am wary of such a list becoming a commercial marketing zone, so
I will further suggest that such a list be restricted to freely available
resources.)

My colleagues in DIWG are probably watching this mailing list, so consider
the suggestion made.

Do I have support for this proposal?

I already posted this on the list, anyway I'll take this chance to do it again.
You might want to take a look at WURFL: http://wurfl.sf.net/
The project is not EXACTLY about device independence, but rather about collecting 
info about many mobile devices to help developers offer a better device recognition 
and markup generation.
