The "fancy interface" will simply be a set of links/buttons to guide you. But yes, I might 
provide a direct link.

What do you mean by "to associate time"? Do you want to know when was the UAProf 
URL registered? If so, my database already has this. The timestap I store is not 
actually the date in which I registered (on the site) the header, but the date when the 
reference was added to the database. There will be a difference of a few days, I think. 
In some cases might be up to a month because some of the developers that send me 
the logs do it monthly. I might consider adding the "first seen date" taken from the 
headers.
