Dear Christian,
The link to the DIA requirements document on that page is broken.

Dear Rotan, all,

[Christian Timmerer (ITEC)] I'd like to take the opportunity to refer to MPEG-21 Digital Item Adaptation (DIA) which has been
recently standardized (Dec 2003). This includes a rich vocabulary to describe the usage environment, i.e., user characteristics,
terminal capabilities, network characteristics, and natural environment characteristics. The FCD (Final Committee Draft) is still
available under http://www.chiariglione.org/mpeg/working_documents.htm#MPEG-21.

Hope this helps, especially for producing solutions for Device Independence :-)

However, if you have any further questions, comments, ... please let me know.

Best regards,
 -Christian

(Editor of MPEG-21 DIA)
