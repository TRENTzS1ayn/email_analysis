The hypertext version links to the dated version, I've added /+(19980720)+/ 
next to the text to make this clear.

In that scenario there was unfortunately not a sufficiently explicit 
understanding of the ownership or license of work done of the 
public/individuals at the IETF. For much of W3C work this has not been a 
problem since the work is done under the umbrella of the W3C membership 
agreements. In my public WGs, I make sure this understanding is explicit [1] 
and the IETF subsequently made it explicit in RFC2026 in 10.3.1.1 and 10.4.c 
[2]. When the W3C accepts public contributions I think it's important that 
we are clear of that status of contributory or derived works.

The W3C wants to protect the investment of a whole community that 
contributes to a shared work. However, this has nothing to do with W3C 
intent, instead the sentence on ownership communicates what happens via law. 
17 U.S.C. ? 103 [3] means that the creator of the derivative work owns the 
copyright on the derivative and compilation of original works, but gains no 
extra rights over the original not provided by the contributing license.

Recently on the open source license list the question of the necessity of 
such text was mentioned [4] with differing opinions. Most open sources 
licenses don't speak on the ownership issue themselves (nor does the W3C's 
licences), but when it comes to the contributing license (I have the right, 
there's no trademark, there's no patent, etc.) I've found the explicitness 
to be very useful, as demonstrated by this thread itself!
