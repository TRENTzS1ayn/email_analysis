Thanks, Philippe

On my emails from this morning on the open issues: I just saw they were sent
this morning due to a problem with our mailserver. Has anyone had time to
think over their action items?

Also, do we have a finalized version of the copyright statement I can put in
the DOM TS Process Document?
