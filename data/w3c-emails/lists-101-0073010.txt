I've updated the test to Java transform.  The files are available at
http://xmlconf.sourceforge.net/www-dom-ts/test-to-java.ZIP and in the www-dom-ts 
module in the CVS.

I've tested the transform with one simple test and was able to generated code.
However, I suspect that there are at least some production bugs.
