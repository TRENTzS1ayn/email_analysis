To:"'Curt Arnold'"<carnold@houston.rr.com>,www-dom-ts@w3.org

Thanks, Curt
 
I've updated the DOM TS page ( http://www.w3.org/DOM/Test
<http://www.w3.org/DOM/Test> ) with pointers to most of what we've
accomplished so far, especially Curt's proposals.
 
Also, I've sent an updated DOM TS Process document to the DOM WG for review.

 
I'm currently helping Mary with the test matrix (sorry for the delay, Mary,
I haven't had the chance to steal away time until now) and reviewing the
schemas and transforms.
 
In addition, I've started writing the FAQ, instruction on how to write and
submit tests as well as technical documentation about the DOM TS. Here it
would be good if we could make a review of material we have so far to be
able to release the DOM TS fairly soon.
 
Am I right in supposing that the schema version used by NIST in recoding the
tests is Curt's latest iteration?
 
Also, FYI, I'll be on vacation from Monday July 9, and will only be able to
work 1 day per week (each week Wednesday) for 3 weeks. I'll be back on
regular schedule beginning of August.
 
Please respond as to the status of your action items so that I can calculate
time to release (now I sound like a marketing guy).
 
Best,
 
/Dimitris

?mne: Test to java transform


I've updated the test to Java transform.  The files are available at
http://xmlconf.sourceforge.net/www-dom-ts/test-to-java.ZIP
<http://xmlconf.sourceforge.net/www-dom-ts/test-to-java.ZIP>  and in the
www-dom-ts 
module in the CVS.
 
I've tested the transform with one simple test and was able to generated
code.
However, I suspect that there are at least some production bugs.
