[mb] Yes, you are right -- we are translating to what I hope is the latest iteration.  I'll post what I have so far at the end 
of the day.  Curt, could you forward an example of how to implement an <if> with an <equals>???  Thanks!

  Thanks, Curt

  I've updated the DOM TS page (http://www.w3.org/DOM/Test) with pointers to most of what we've accomplished so far, especially Curt's proposals.

  Also, I've sent an updated DOM TS Process document to the DOM WG for review. 

  I'm currently helping Mary with the test matrix (sorry for the delay, Mary, I haven't had the chance to steal away time until now) and reviewing the schemas and transforms.

  In addition, I've started writing the FAQ, instruction on how to write and submit tests as well as technical documentation about the DOM TS. Here it would be good if we could make a review of material we have so far to be able to release the DOM TS fairly soon.

  Am I right in supposing that the schema version used by NIST in recoding the tests is Curt's latest iteration?


  Also, FYI, I'll be on vacation from Monday July 9, and will only be able to work 1 day per week (each week Wednesday) for 3 weeks. I'll be back on regular schedule beginning of August.

  Please respond as to the status of your action items so that I can calculate time to release (now I sound like a marketing guy).

  Best,

  /Dimitris

    ?mne: Test to java transform


    I've updated the test to Java transform.  The files are available at
    http://xmlconf.sourceforge.net/www-dom-ts/test-to-java.ZIP and in the www-dom-ts 
    module in the CVS.

    I've tested the transform with one simple test and was able to generated code.
    However, I suspect that there are at least some production bugs.
