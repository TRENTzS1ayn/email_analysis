Should the license found for the DOM Test project at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/xmlconf/ be changed to the W3C license (for
work done in connection to the DOM TS, obviously)? Or do we just flip the
copyright statement on issue tracked tests once they get submitted to the
W3C DOM TS?

I don?t want to start a flood of mails, but I would like to know how this
will work.
