How do we put tests in to the Issue tracking framework at SourceForge? Do we
check them in manually? 

I suppose this will be done only by the DOM TS moderators (myself, Mary,
Curt, anyone else?).

Do we then resubmit the to the www-dom-ts-submission@w3.org mailing list? Or
just put them on the W3C site for publication?

Also, would you like to have an additional list, www-dom-ts-issues@w3.org
for reporting issues regarding DOM TS? Or would this mailing list be fine?
To separate things, I'd personally prefer the former.
