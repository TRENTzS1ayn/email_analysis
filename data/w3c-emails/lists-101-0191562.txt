I agree, keeping it as a separate project seems to be the easiest and
cleanest way to go about. 

Please give me some pointers and I'll send the appropriate requests right
away.

Do we have any news on whether it's possible to do backups on the www-dom-ts
project?

Thanks,

/Dimitris

xmlconf consists of a lot of subprojects, XML 1.0 conformance, etc, that are
intentionally under the GNU license.

If we want it clean, we should either request a separate project on
SourceForge under the W3C Software license and/or create a module on the
W3C's CVS server.  Probably just cleaner to create a
www-dom-ts project at SourceForge since that would allow you to grant CVS
commit rights on just the www-dom-ts work instead of opening up all of the
W3C CVS server.

Once that CVS is up, then I'll migrate the stuff that I've been keeping in
the xmlconf CVS over there.

Since Dimitris and Mary represent the organizational backers, it would be
best for one of you to request the project and for both of you to be
coordinators and grant me whatever rights are
appropriate.
