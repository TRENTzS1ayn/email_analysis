  This is definately the best way to go.

  The front page at http://sourceforge.net/ includes links labelled
"Register as a site user" and "Register Your Project" in the
introductory text; those are what you want.

  SourceForge makes available nightly tarballs of the project's CVS
repository; you can just fetch those in a cron job every day.  Since
each project gets a complete repository (including admin files), it's
easy enough to set that up in a new location if necessary.
  Getting information out of the trackers may be another matter, but
should be possible.  Failing all else, screen-scraping can be used to
collect the information and dump it into a database -- we used this
approach with the older bug & patch managers to load a PostgresSQL
database for ad hoc queries.  Our code was never updated to the newer
trackers SourceForge is using.
