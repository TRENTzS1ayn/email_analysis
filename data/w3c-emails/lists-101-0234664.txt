That was quick :)

Thanks to anyone who helped out in clearing the request, I'm now setting up
the details. 

I'll add all who were added by Curt earlier on the DOM Conformance project,
except if anyone strongly disagrees. Also, I'll give myself, Mary and Curt
administrative rights.

I'll be the one who takes questions and tests to the DOM WG for
clarification, but I'd like to have more people aboard since we all can
contribute to this. If anyone else feels like being a member of the DOM
Conformance moderator group, please say so.

How har would it be to get all tests submitted to the
www-dom-ts-submission@w3.org to appear in the domconftest project? Something
the W3C system team could look into?
