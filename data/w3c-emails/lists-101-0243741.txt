Sure, I'll help -- I should have the rest of
the fundamental and extended tests ready
by tomorrow.  After the core tests work,
we'll have to add metadata info -- but I
think I can write a transform to put our
original work into the rdf framework --
is this what we want to do?  How do we
envision the metadata info being used?  Can
we write a transform that will allow it to
be displayed in a web browser, or will we
have to transform off-line and make a html
version available?
