My primary interest in getting the SourceForge project going was getting the tests, transforms and supporting resources in a common CVS, so we could automate the transform/compile/run cycle and
collaborate on fixing either the tests or the transforms.  

The initial hurdles for test correctness are schema/DTD validity and whether the generated code successfully compiles.  If the tests and the transforms are all in one CVS, then it should be fairly
simple to automate the process and iteratively fix problems.  Having the tests and transforms in distinct locations definitely complicates matters, especially since both are evolving.
