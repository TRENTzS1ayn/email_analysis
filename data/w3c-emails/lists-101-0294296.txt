I definitely agree. However, we've known for some time that the primary
place for browsing and downloading tests, transforms and schems would be the
W3C site. SF came into the question as an alternative to W3C as far as
bug/issue tracking was concerned.

I realise that keeping tests and other resources on two different locations
can be tedious, but it may be a price that we have to pay (especially
myself, since I'm going to manually check in tests to SF if there are issues
about them).

My primary interest in getting the SourceForge project going was getting the
tests, transforms and supporting resources in a common CVS, so we could
automate the transform/compile/run cycle and
collaborate on fixing either the tests or the transforms.  

The initial hurdles for test correctness are schema/DTD validity and whether
the generated code successfully compiles.  If the tests and the transforms
are all in one CVS, then it should be fairly
simple to automate the process and iteratively fix problems.  Having the
tests and transforms in distinct locations definitely complicates matters,
especially since both are evolving.
