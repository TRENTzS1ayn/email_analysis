I would think that most of these would be generated, like the schemas and the generated source code, and would not appear in the CVS.

I did have ecmascript is my tree, but it was less noticable since it didn't have, and didn't need, the deep hierarchy that the java node did.  I guess it should have been capitalized differently.

I would expect eventually there would be CLR, Python, and other siblings to the java and ecmascript directories.

Will probably have a better idea on what it needed to adapt the generic tests to specific frameworks once we have built the generic tests.  I was trying to represent these by the adapters project.
However, wouldn't actually try to create that part of the tree until we had something to put in there.
