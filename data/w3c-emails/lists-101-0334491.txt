  I'm not sure how the documentation could be generated, but we can
add it at an appropriate time if needed.

  OK, I see it now; no need to capitalize it differently.  I should
have been less hasty.

  Sounds good; these don't actually need to be added until there is
content for them.

  Agreed.  We just need a basic idea of where they should go.  It's
not entirely clear to me that there must be both "generic" and
"framework-based" tests.  For Python, it's certainly not clear that we
need both, since PyUnit became part of Python's standard library as of
Python 2.1 (released last April); it can simply be supplied for older
versions of Python, or we can recommend that it be installed first,
with a link to the PyUnit site.
