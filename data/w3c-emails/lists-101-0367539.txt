In order to speed up the process, I propose the following (much in line with
what was previously proposed):

1. Submissions of tests are done using the www-dom-ts-sumbission@w3.org
mailing list
2. The tests are checked for correctness, validity and so forth, as they
will be viewable on the W3C CVS. Control is done by the DOM TS moderators
(as per the DOM TS process doc)
3. Tests that are not ready to form part of a suite and need work, are
checked into the SF CVS and we work on them in the domconftest project
4. Once finalized, the test goes back to the W3C machinery, where it joins
the rest of the tests and makes up a test suite.
5. Documentation, compression, generation of code and so forth can be done
in either case and in tierh place, we just need to take a decision.

(If I've forgotten something, please add to the list)

I think we should spend as little time as possible on this matter to start
working. I realise we need to decide on where development will take place,
but I also point out that SF was primarily thought of as a bug tracking
system. Mwe should spend some postings on this topic to reach a conclusion?
