Wasn't intended to be off-list.  Sorry.

The current set should be fine.  I think most of the others were more
involved in XML conformance testing and it would not be difficult to 
add them if they express an interest.

I think that is probably the best approach.

I thought it was since it might be difficult to add non-W3C members
as committers since it might open up the entire W3C CVS system.
I has assumed the primary reason HTML Tidy moved to 
SourceForge was to allow non-W3C members to participate without
compromising the W3C CVS.
