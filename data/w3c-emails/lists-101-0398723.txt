  I'd like to be on the domconftest project.  Now that a separate
project has been established, I think I can be removed from the
xmlconf project, as my addition there was to participate in what is
(now) in the new project.

  As far as I'm concerned, either is fine.  The SF advantage is that I
already have an establised identity there.  If the W3C admins don't
mind adding me to their CVS, I can work with that one.  (I *do* hope
remote access requires SSH authentication!)  I'll promise not to much
with portions of the W3C repository I shouldn't.  ;-)
