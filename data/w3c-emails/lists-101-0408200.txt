Alright, current status: 

Curt, Mary and myself are all-hands persons, which I thought was the most
appropriate decision.

Fred? David? Is there any specific field you want me to set in your user
permissions?

I think that is probably the best approach.

[dd] OK, unless anyone has anything against this, that's what we do. We
simply gather submissions from that mailing list, lit them over to SF, work
there and publish on the W3C machines. 

We do, however, need to provide up to date information on the official DOM
TS page, eg. manuals, snapshots of code, latest schema and so forth (I've
done some updates, you may want to look at http://www.w3.org/DOM/Test)

I thought it was since it might be difficult to add non-W3C members
as committers since it might open up the entire W3C CVS system.
I has assumed the primary reason HTML Tidy moved to 
SourceForge was to allow non-W3C members to participate without
compromising the W3C CVS.

[dd] Philippe, can you please clarify?
