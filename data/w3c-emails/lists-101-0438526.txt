We'll give as many access as necessary on the public CVS server [1].
write access uses ssh, so I'll need the ssh public keys of the
committers.

Regarding the branch, I propose /2001/DOMTS to start with but I'm open
to other proposals. Unfortunately, /DOM is an error on the public
CVS server, so we can't reuse /DOM/Test.
