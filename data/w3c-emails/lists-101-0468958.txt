OK, updated in accordance with points below. Anuthing else we don't need?
Bring yuor collective experience together and tell me, to me everything
looks new and shiny.

I beleive we can start checking in the transforms and schemata? (please note
the correct use of the plural form of the greek word schema; you may want to
check out a thread rollling right now on xml-dev on schemas/schemata which
is very amusing).

  Don't worry, I'll scream if I need more.  ;-)
  I would suggest that you "turn off" facilities we're not using from
the general admin page ("Edit Public Info", or something like that).
In particular:  Forums, DocManager, Mailing Lists, Task Manager, and
Surveys.
  What to do about the trackers, I'm not sure.  Based on using SF for
about 14 months for Python, I think the distinction between the Bug
and Patch facilities is bogus:  It's quite common for a bug to be
filed, and then someone wants to provide a patch.  I'd like to see a
tracker labeled "Issue Tracker" (if we can rename an existing
tracker), and turn off the others.  The only one that's really
different is the Support tracker, and I don't think we need that.  (We
can't get rid of trackers, but you can set them to be "hidden" or
"private".)
  You can also set the "Project Home Page" to
http://www.w3.org/DOM/Test so the summary page doesn't provide a
useless link.
