Descendents of EntityReference and Entity nodes are automatically marked
read-only.  The latter may or may not be revised when DOM Level 3 addresses
DTDs in more detail.

You can't currently ask a node if it's readonly except by trying to modify
it. That query, and ways to selectively make nodes read-only or read-write
by user request, are known wishlist items.
