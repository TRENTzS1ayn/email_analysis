Dear all

The Process document is now finally ready and should soon be circulating for
comments and approval. After comments and feedback has been gathered, we'll
move on to working on the technical document that deasl with scope of the
test suite as well as technical issues. This mailing list seems to be the
right place for the details for such a document to be discussed by invited
and interested parties.

Work on the conversion of the NIST test suite is under way. At the same time
I'm looking at the various other test suites available in order to get a
clearer picture.

Please also remember to tell people within your organisation to get in touch
with me and learn how they could contribute by donating code to the DOM TS.
There was talk on this on the DOM F2F two weeks ago, and if I remember
correctly some people indicated that they would check this.
