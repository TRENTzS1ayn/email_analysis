Well, my experience is that test suites are valuable at any step of the 
specification. As an example, the SVG working group started to develop 
hopefully the test suite in working draft and that was really valuable for 
implementors.

In working draft, test suites help the working group (to define how the 
features work or to be sure that everybody is talking of the same thing :)

In CR, test suites help implementors to report problems to the WG or to ask 
the WG to improve the wording of a particular section...

Finally, in Rec, test suites help users by providing example that may help to 
understand the various features.

Anyway, that was just feedback from an implementors...
Hope you will start working on the test suite as soon as possible :)  

Regards,
Thierry.
