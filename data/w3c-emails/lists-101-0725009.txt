Hi Stanley

We've been thinking along these lines, but the test suite that will be the
base for the DOM Level 1 TS is written in Java/ECMA Script.

However, I'm very keen on seeing a thread on common interfaces here on this
list as it is an activity that is going on within the W3C and I, among other
people are quite interested. There are some difficulties, but I think once
written, reusability is greatly enhanced. 

What do others think?

Dimitris,

Maybe a function table (or callback structure) can be used to map
proprietary interface to a common interface and the test suite can be
written in this common interface.

To enable the mapping, maybe a wrapper is needed for a proprietary
interface.  Alas, this is a conformance test, not a benchmark.  So, one
extra layer doesn't hurt.

But, to come up with a common interface could be a big effort.

Thx,

-Stanley
