Hello all and welcome to the DOM TS mailing list

I represent the DOM WG in this effort, and hereby invite you to feel free to
contact me on any matter concerning the Test Suite.

For those of you who have not done so, please read through the DOM
Conformance TS document: 

http://www.w3.org/DOM/DOMConformanceTS-Process-20010316

This mailing list is archived, link to:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom-ts/

To subscribe, send an email to www-dom-ts-request@w3.org with "subscribe" as
subject.

Agenda:
This spring holds a long series of events related to the development of the
DOM TS.

First of all, the NIST Test Suite is being rewritten to support the DOM
Level 1 specification. Documents related to this will be published in this
mailing list. 

This will also form the base for the DOM Level 2 TS, which will be
publically developed. This mailing list will form the main basis for
communication concerning the development. 
Finally, a feature TS for DOM Level 3 will be written, which will be
extended to full conformance test suite once the specification reaches
proposed recommendation status.

Other points:
As indicated in the Process Document, various technical issues (hosting,
mirroring, specifics on scenario documentation, language-neutral
representation and so forth) remain to be solved, and it is intended that
this mailing list be the ground for discussion on these topics.

Cc:ed are some of the people who have developed DOM-related resources on the
web, and I sincerely hope they will find taking part in this worthwhile. If
you know of more people and/or organisations who have produced similar
things, please forward them this email. Also, please let it be known within
your organisation that all help is appreciated.

All the best,

/Dimitris Dimitriadis, W3C rep to the DOM TS
