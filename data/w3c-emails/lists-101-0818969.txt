As indicated in a previous mail, we have indeed thought about this. If would
be a great thing if we could describe the tests in a language-neutral way
and automatically generate tests for a particular language.

However, as we've ancountered some difficulties, I'd personally like to see
a thread on this mailing list to discuss this. 

The objectives are:
1. Describe tests in IDL terms
2. Generate tests for particular languages
3. Point to relevant part of the specification

Has this point of view been taken into consideration?
