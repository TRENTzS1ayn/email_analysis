Hello all

To simplify readability and categorizing, I propose that we stick to the
following conventions:

Use [xxx] in your email's subject line to describe the content and topic of
the mail. For example, an email dealing with process issues, should be
written [DOM TS Process: particular issue]

Possible values are then

[DOM TS Process]
[DOM TS Design]
[DOM TS Scope]
[DOM TS Documentation]
[DOM TS General]

within which you can give the particular before closing and separate it with
a ':'.

Have I forgotten anything?

/D
