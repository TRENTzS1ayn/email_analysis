In Perl there could be two levels of conformance testing, one at the
"full DOM API" level using an OMG IDL wrapper and the standard tests,
but also a level that tests what Perl considers the "lite DOM API"[1],

thinking behind the original question.  We should be able to work out
what the crossover is.
