The W3C point of view is that the DOM test suite will be a conformance Test
Suite, that is, not a subset test suite of any kind. It may consist of tests
that could be successfully (but partially) taken by an implementation,
however passing the test suite implies passing all tests, another way of
saying including tests that go beyond the "lite DOM API" and adhere to the
full DOM spec.

Of course, the crossover should be looked into and documented, but I suppose
this would only be relevant for the smaller subsets, and not for the DOM TS.

Is this W3C's point of view?  Is this applied only to Perl's implementation?
