Please feel free to subscribe to the DOM Test Suite mailing list, where we
are currently developing a conformance test suite for DOM level 1 and will
in the near future develop a conformance test suite for DOM level 2. This
fits in well with what you seem to be after.

You will fond some useful information on the current status as well as the
agenda in our Process document: http://www.w3.org/DOM/DOMTS-Process.

/Dimitris Dimitriadis, W3C representative to the DOM TS Framework.

You'll find some of the DOM Test Suites here:

FYI, the W3C and NIST are now working together to improve the situation.

As far as I remember, this is no such document.
