Very good point. We do want to model dependencies, without implying
difference in relevance. If for example 3 breaks if 2 breaks if 1 breaks and
1 is a "central" feature (defined in core) whereas 3 is style, this by no
means implies that 3 is less important than 1.

?mne: Test dependencies


I've been walking through the Hacked NIST conformance suite today making
sure that the most significant items get into the Adobe SVG bug database
which brought the following thought to mind: it would
be useful if the test definitions could express any known dependencies
between tests.  For example, if test B, C, D, E, F, G, H, etc will always
fail if test A fails, having that info in the test
description will make it easier for a developer to focus in on the problem.

Another thing that we will have to address is conformant variations, the
most obvious instance is whether entity references are expanded.
