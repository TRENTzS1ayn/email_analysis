I assume this was meant for the list as well?

xhtml simply because I had validity problems (I was working on local files
that used http_mode relative URIs)... Anyway, the output of the stylesheet
(html) is what you are after; It was just convinient for me to use an xml
file instead while using the xsl to inspect the htm result without typing
the DOCTYPE declarations manually. But that xsl may proove usefull to your
framework after all, since you guys will be working both with xml and htm
files for some time.

> Yes, when you update staff.xml you will have to also update staff.xsd (if
it does not cover your model or entities). Then you can use the xsl to build
the target htm file (that behaves better in browsers; they like .htm
although xhtml is essentially xml).

mor easy if the directory I've sent you becomes available on-line. That way
my editors or whatever will not complain for validity (otherwise I have to
go through workarounds as above or sit and edit those relative URIs
manually).
