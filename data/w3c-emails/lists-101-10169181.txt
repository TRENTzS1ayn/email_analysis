On the first quick read-through, you may want to add author and 
organization data in the test's metadata element, as well as a prose 
description of the behaviour the test expect(not vital to test 
functionality, but it is good to have for displaying in the test 
matrix). Lastly, if you can, also add a pointer to the relevant part of 
the specification (this is used to point the relevant part of the spec 
from the text matrix to serve as reference for particular tests).

See the example below with inlined comments.

<metadata>
<title>textSplitTextFour</title>
<creator>NIST</creator>
<!-- Could be Netscape -->
<description>
     The "splitText(offset)" method returns the new Text node.

     Retrieve the textual data from the last child of the
     first employee and invoke the "splitText(offset)" method.
     The method should return the new Text node.   The offset
     value used for this test is 30.   The "getNodeValue()"
     method is called to check that the new node now contains
     the characters at and after position 30.
     (Starting count at 0)

<!-- Point to the relevant part of the spec, in this example (L1 Core, 
textsplittextfour.xml) it is the Text.splitText method, similar for your 
tests. -->

Again, thanks, it's very good to see that we have a major submission 
from Netscape.
