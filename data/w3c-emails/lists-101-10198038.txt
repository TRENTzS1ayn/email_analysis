That would be ignoreCase="true".

ignoreCase="auto" is for
(http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-HTML/html.html#ID-5353782642)

The HTML case insensitivity is also reflected in the DOM HTML API's in some
ways, for instance, element and attribute names are exposed as all upper
case (for consistency) when used on an HTML document, regardless of the
character case used in the markup.

ignoreCase="false" --> assertTrue(expected.equals(actual))
ignoreCase="true" --> assertTrue(expected.equalsIgnoreCase(actual))
ignoreCase="auto" (for HTML) -->
assertTrue(expected.toUpperCase().equals(actual))
                             (for everything else) -->
assertTrue(expected.equals(actual))

I'd be in favor of having you granted commit rights to the CVS repository.
However, Dimitridas would have to request that of the W3C support staff.
You might want to email Dimitriadis a RSA public key.
