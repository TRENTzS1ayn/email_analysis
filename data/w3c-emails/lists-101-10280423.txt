Hi,

I have tried the DOM test suite and found that no matter if errors 
occured or not the exit code of the testsuit is always 0. Since I 
planned to make it part of out test enviroment it is hard to make it in 
a platform independent way to stop the make if there were fauilures (it 
stops if the exit code is other than 0).

br,
Laszlo
