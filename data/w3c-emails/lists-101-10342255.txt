Try removing xalan.jar from your Ant directory and replacing it with
saxon.jar from Saxon 6.5.1 from http://saxon.sourceforge.net.  Xalan-J is a
little fussy when you load a huge number of documents in one transform.
Maybe we added a few more tests and made it mad.  I'm long overdue on
checking out whether the later versions of Xalan-J work any better.

If you can post a few hand-ported C versions of Java tests, we can probably
knock it out in a couple of iterations.

One step at a time then.
