See attached. Notice that the Check library's START_TEST macros make
the individual test case functions static so they cannot be compiled in
separate files. So I think I want to just genereate .h files and generate
a master .h that #includes them all. That should make the stylesheet
easier too.

I'm running through the stylesheet right now and I have added my Ant
target but of course this is going to fail big-time when I try to run
it. Let's see....

Thanks for the great instructions,
Mike
