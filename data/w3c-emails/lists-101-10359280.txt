Well, I think I've done the easy stuff. Please find the attached
test-to-domc.xsl. The not-so-easy stuff appears to be:

o The assertions assume certain type evaluations can be made like
  assertEquals might warrant == or strcmp.
o The for-each loop is not right but largely because ...
o I need a List type
o Memory management is not considered at all and would probably require
  modification of the templates.

BTW: Saxon failed miserably with the Java suite. Are you sure
the problem is with the parsers? It's not entirely clear to me how to
specify a larger heap size a la -Xmx with Ant's style task but that
would be something to look at. My stylesheet doesn't appear to trigger
the issue at all for some reason (less output generated maybe).

Mike
