Not going to be able to work on this today.  Pretty beat from a couple of
marathon nights on the <cc> task for ant.

Do you want to do this as a part of the W3C effort?  If you'd like to do
this as part of the W3C effort, email the transform to
www-dom-ts-submission@w3.org which will make sure that all the IPR issues
are dotted and crossed.

Since the transform is aware of the types of the arguments, it is pretty
easy for the transform to produce assertEqualsString, assertEqualInt, etc.
I'd prefer that over trying to inline the comparison with an strcmp.

Doesn't need to be a very sophisticated, full featured list type.

Nope.  It was just similar symptoms to stuff I've experienced before.  I
just rebuilt the suite using Saxon without incident.  Could you give me the
specifics of your build configuration, O/S, Java vendor and version,
anything else pertinent.  Definitely the test suite generation makes a good
stress test of an XSLT processor.
