Err, are we both talking about the Check library from
check.sourceforge.net?  If so, then yes.

The bugs database and discussion lists are available for you to review
from the SourceForge project page:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/check/

My own conclusion is that while there are some good ideas in the
library, it is too young and insufficiently stable to rely on it.
