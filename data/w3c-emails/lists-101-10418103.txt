This is a distinct possibility. It's definately farther along but
doesn't look like there's much more code behind it. I can think of other
advantages to using C++. One thing I like about Check is that it forks a
process for the test so a segfault doesn't bring down the whole test. It
took me all of about 15 minutes to get Check going so I might as well
just go with that until I run into these problems Fred's talking about.

Right now I'm off learning about XSLT and getting a little side tracked
(stk.push(domts)).
