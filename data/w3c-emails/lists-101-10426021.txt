Hi,

I'm currently investigating the effort for converting our existing DOM
Level 3 L&S tests to the framework.

I'm only scratching the surface here, I has been a while since I've
looked into the testsuite in detail, so forgive me if questions have be
asked before.

Issues:

1. The current frameworks relies on a load methods in the framework that
loads a document. Based on that parsed documents tests are written.
With Load and Save this is not very usefull because you need to test the
load.

2. The schema for DOM L3 and the stylesheets to produce the tests aren't
available as far as I can see, writing a first test is therefore pretty
tough because there is no way you can get an DOMImplementationLS.

3. Testing serialization is difficult as well in the current framework
because there are no tools to test the serialized form. Sure you could
reparse it but that is not a good basis to test the serialized form
since the document may/will change during parsing. Examples here are
pretty-print, discard-default-content etc.

4. DOMInputSource, DOMEntityResolver, DOMBuilderFilter, DOMWriterFilter
and DOMErrorHandler don't have a factory method. The test needs to
provide an implementation that implements the interface. Any ideas on
how to solve this in the framework.
