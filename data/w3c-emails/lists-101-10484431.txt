As it stands now, the framework generates the schema for the tests from 
the source of the specifications themselves. However, these are the 
published specs, not drafts.

Technically it would be possible to generate the level 3 schema 
languages too, if the xml sources for the specs are publically 
available, but as the specs change, so would the tests.

On the other hand, there's an intention to tie the test production 
closer to specification authoring, so maybe it's not a bad idea.

Let's have a discussion here to hear people's views, and I'll take it up 
with the DOM WG as well.
