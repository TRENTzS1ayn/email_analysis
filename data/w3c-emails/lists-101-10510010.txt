The issue was raised in http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom-
ts/2002Feb/0139.html

No erratum for DOM level 1 will be issued.

The resolution is:

setNodeValue has no effect, and entity nodes are readonly, therefore no 
effect on setting value takes precedence,

which would maintain backward compatibility with DOM Level 1 SE

Other readonly nodes will be looked into for consistency.
