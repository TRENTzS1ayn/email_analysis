I must have missed the first message about this.  As Expat's
(somewhat) active maintainer, I feel compelled to chime in.

The basic Expat parser does not provide a DOM implementation at all,
so I think identifying problems with it is difficult.  Expat is much
closer to a SAX parser than anything else and should be thought of in
those terms.

There are several DOM implementations which have been built on top of
Expat for various languages; I've built one in Python, and have built
a builder for another (also in Python).  Both of these have provided
normallized text nodes.  The only reason I can think of which would
prevent this would be if the text nodes are exposed to client code
before being finished; in that case it makes more sense to start a new
node to avoid surprising the client code by modifying an
already-exposed node.  For synchronous-loading DOM implementations
(such as mine), this should not be an issue.

The Expat-based DOM-builders for Python (I know of three) are all open
source, so anyone writing an Expat-based DOM builder is free to look
at them for techniques if they like.  I'd also be willing to
correspond with anyone to help out if I can, though my availability to
write code would be minimal at best.
