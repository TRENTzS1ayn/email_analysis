Agreed; from your description, it sounds like the problem isn't Expat, and
the answer is to plug in a smarter DOM-builder which either
buffers/accumulates contiguous text and normalizes during construction, or
which calls normalize() before handing the document off to the users (and
the testcase). The former is the traditional solution for SAX-driven DOM
builders.
