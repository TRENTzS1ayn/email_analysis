Sorry for the delay, I've been heavily swamped lately.

I've created a directory called "submittedtests" in the "tests" 
directory to put submitted tests. The netscape tests are in the 
"netscapetests" directory.

I didn't bother creating a levelx structure in teh submitteed tests 
directory as it is primarily a temporary storage beofre the tests go in 
the right directory.

Is the nameing scheme compatible with the NIST one?

I believe all issues raied on the list a few weeks ago have been 
adressed before submission.
