All,

I've updated the documentation at the www.w3.org/DOM/Test area, 
including an addition of a document that points to implementations that 
have been tested using the DOM TS.

So far, only X-Hive are there as they are the only company that has 
communicated interest and also have a page which Jeroen pointed to in an 
eariler email.
