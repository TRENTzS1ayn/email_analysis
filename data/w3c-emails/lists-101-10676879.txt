I think his issue was the observed variability in the Netscape results where
one or so of the test failures was not repeatable.  That should be addressed
by the browser based runner which will not need to resort to an alert() to
allow the document to complete loading.

Mary was proceding with recasting the existing L1 Core tests based on my
transliteration approach.  Manos's work was not directly applicable to
providing HTML (not X) tests that were equivalent to the existing XML tests.

DOM L2 schemas have been available for quite some time.

I've committed changes to build.xml, dom-to-xsd.xsl and corresponding
patches that allow building a DOM L3 schema.  There are still some rough
edges, I've posted a hand finished copy of a dom3.xsd and a modified version
of Jeroen's sample L/S test to http://home.houston.rr.com/curta/dom3.ZIP

There are still a few issues, I haven't reworked the keys and keyrefs to
account for anonymous inner classes, so you will get spurious keyref
constraint validations when accessing variables defined in anonymous inner
classes.  There are several interfaces missing, CDATASection and Entity, for
example, not sure why they disappeared.  Text is still DOM L2 since the XML
sources omitted it and TextEvent.  Would be really nice if the next round of
DOM specs were validated.
