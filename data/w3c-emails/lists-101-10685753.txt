[mb] Yes -- I'm still working on this -- got sidetracked by a broken network
interface
on my laptop.  My intent is to use Curt's files, and I've converted a
handful
of tests already.  We may at a later date be able to switch to the Manos
approach for xhtml and xml, but as Curt points out, it was not applicable
to HTML.

[mb] And in fact, Rick has been using them quite successfully.  Maybe
we should make it clear that they are available -- I'd hate to think
that folks are willing to write tests for L2 and this is stopping them!
