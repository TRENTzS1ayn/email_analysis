I don't anticipate any significant changes for the dom2 schema and dtd,
other than to bring the DTD into line with the schema changes from last
night.  However, I expect that there will be changes to dom-to-xsd.xsl and
dom-to-dtd.xsl to resolve the production issues with the DOM3 schema.  Feel
free to update dom-to-dtd.xsl if you'd like, otherwise I'll do it tonight.

Haven't had any direct response, however producing an initial dom3 schema
was intended to support his development of Load/Save tests.  As long as it
is clearly stated that the schema is experimental with known issues and
subject to frequent change, I think it would be good to have it available on
the web page.
