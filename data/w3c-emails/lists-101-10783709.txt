I would suggest the DOM Level 2 Events specification. During the DOM WG
teleconference yesterday, Dimitris asked each member to commit to a
particular module of the DOM. We had 1 for DOM3 Core, 3 for DOM3 LS, 1
for DOM3 XPath. One of them said that he will look into MutationEvents.
Given that DOM Level 3 Events will need to move on, it would be good to
have one for DOM Level 2 Events that the WG can complete for DOM Level 3
Events.
Now, an other approach would be to do the modules that the WG is not
willing to do at all, such as Traversal and Range or CSS...
