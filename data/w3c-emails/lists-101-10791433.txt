Yesterday I did a CVS "GET" of the full 
DOM-Test-Suite and am now having
problems running the DOM Level2 HTML tests.
IE6 now reports 363 failures.  I looked at some
of the errors and there seemed to be a fair amount
that were reporting incorrect values for the "ASIZE".
Most were returning an ASIZE value of 0 when 1,2 etc.
was expected.
 
Anyone else have a similar problem or suggestion?
