I've been laying the groundwork to move over the DOM L2 Events tests that I
wrote as part of the xmlconf effort.  Actually, testing an events
implementation is what drew me into this to start with.

I should be able to transliterate the xmlconf events tests shortly (both
from Java and from staff.xml to hc_staff.xml) and was intending to use that
as to test the enhancements to the code generation templates that will be
needed for any of the specs that have user supplied interfaces, such as
load/save or traversal/range.

Is anyone in the work group committing to Abstract Schema?
