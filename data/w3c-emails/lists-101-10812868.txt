Don't recall any recent activity that would have caused anything to change.
However, I pretty sure that the HTML tests (like the XML tests under
Mozilla) precariously depend on faking a synchronous load and would be
subject to massive failure if the test file load didn't complete when
expected.  You might check the readyState property on the test document to
see if it is possible that the test document is not fully loaded.
