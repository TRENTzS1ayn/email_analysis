Hello all

In a few hours I should be able to post an example of the XML framework
that's been used in the NIST tests with some additions that I'd like to
encourage people to discuss at length, especially as far as the following
are concerned:

1. Compatibility with JavaML and the various xUnits (ability to export to
these, primarily)
2. Overhead that could be minimized
3. Functionality in terms of multiple assertions, loading, and so forth
4. Any other point you find relevant

Kind regards,

/Dimitris
