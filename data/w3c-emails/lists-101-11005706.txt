First, sorry for the duplicate message. I *thought* I sent this mail
message but I didn't see it after almost a day. I think my ISP is
having issues.

Regarding this problem, I don't have any hard evidence that it's Ant
but when I ran into this problem I built each domts case independently
with a simple shell script for j in loop. It took 15 minutes but it
worked. So there's nothing particularly twisted about any one xml
test case. It's just when Ant is brought into the fray that there
are problems.  At the very least there would probably be a way to free
resources more agressively.  The Ant task could totally reinitialize
the XSLT processor at every opportunity. If that worked without seeing
anything obviously wrong with that task that's pretty good evidence to
take to the Xalan people.

Mike
