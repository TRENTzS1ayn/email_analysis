Sorry about falling off the face of the earth.  My company is in the process of being divested (http://www.hyprotech.com/news/story.asp?ID=157) and I've been on the road.

It will take me longer to fully research these issues but:

Build errors:  The ...validate-test targets depend on the corresponding DTD's having been generated but did not have the ...dtd targets as dependencies.  So they would work if you ran validate-tests after generating java or jsunit, but wouldn't work if they were the very first thing you did.  I just changed the depends clause in build.xml in the CVS.

The "could not load document" errors are the longstanding resource exhaustion problem observed with Xalan.  I did review the Ant liason and did not see any obvious problem.  Since Saxon seems to avoid the problem, it is a problem with Ant, it is a subtle one.  I had hoped to run a diagnostic program on the build task, but my only available tool is fairly antiquated.  Joseph Kesselman had suggested a Xalan-specific extension that might be able to work around the issue (by telling Xalan that a specific document would no longer be needed, however I am reluctant to add a workaround for a specific processor).

Haven't had any chance to look at the new tests.

The DOM L2 Events and Load and Save tests will generally use anonymous inner classes or their equivalents for the listeners, filters, etc that are defined in the tests.  The transforms do not yet generate the corresponding code.  A couple of weeks ago, I started migrate L2 Event tests from domunit to get some tests in the CVS that used these features so that I could fill in the missing pieces of the transforms.  There do not need to be distinct transforms for the level 3 tests.  The default package name can be overriden by specifying the "package" parameter (see dom2-core-gen-java for an example).
