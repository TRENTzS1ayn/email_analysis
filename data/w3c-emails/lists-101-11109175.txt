     Maybe I'm not running the tests properly on jsUnit 1.3.0.
     Can you give me some guidance?


     The HTML tests are in the CVS repository under
     2001/DOM-Test-Suite/tests/level2/html

      The files that the test loads are in 
      2001/DOM-Test-Suite/tests/level2/html/files

      In the current test framework there are two test files for each interface, one an html file and the
      other an xml file depending on what browser is used.
