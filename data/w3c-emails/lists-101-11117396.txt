          I downloaded the current source and tried to run one of the
          level2 HTML tests and got the following error 
          with Mozilla 1.0 Release Candidate 1:

          TypeError:this.containerTestFrame.tearDown is not a function.

          Has anybody else had any success running the HTML tests?
