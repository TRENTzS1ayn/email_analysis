I'll be happy to help as far as I can.  I wrote the initial
document loading schemes for DOM, which I think
were mimicked in the DOM TS.  As far as mod's to the
transformations go, that's easy enough -- I'll defer to
Curt, who authored them.  If Curt doesn't have the
time, then I'll be willing to change them appropriately.
Just start the discussions, and let us know what you
need.  I'll try to put together an overview of the ways
we have loaded the tests in the past, and what our
current needs are, and post to the list.
