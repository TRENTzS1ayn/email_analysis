You could add:

<var name="MODE_SYNCHRONOUS" type="int" value="2"/>

into the declarations part of your test, but that could result in a
duplicate definition error depending on the binding.  Entity references
could be used, but I think the current approach of just using the defined
integer value is probably the least trouble.
