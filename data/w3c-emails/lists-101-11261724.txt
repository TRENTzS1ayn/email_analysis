I'm all for a solution like that. In this way, we ensure that each 
implementation is tested on its own merits, which has been discussed 
earlier.

On the other hand, we'd need to steer clear of having to rewrite too 
much of the existing test chain (the stylesheets and build.xml, 
basically) and try to make the latest version of JsUnit as compatible as 
possible with what we've done so far.
