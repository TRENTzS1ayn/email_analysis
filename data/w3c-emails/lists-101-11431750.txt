Thanks Rick

Looking through the DOM L2 Core branch, I realized my commit has some 
problems; instead of the IBM tests I updated existing tests that 
obviously had the same name. Trying to add the IBM tests to the L2/core 
directory fails on my local setup and hence on the CVS repository as 
well.

I need to freshen up my CVS skills, obviously.
