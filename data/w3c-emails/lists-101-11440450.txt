Comment: The value attribute specifies the current control value. Retrieve the
value attribute and examine it's value.

Johnny: The tests has a <button value="foo">bar</button> and it expects .value
to be "foo" even if the button is displayed with the text "bar" in
it. Mozilla returns "foo" and IE returns "bar".

Rob: the initial value of the button should be the content of the button
element. you first set the value and then you use the content.

Glenn: so if you change the value, do you change the text node?

Rob: don't know.

Glenn: I view this as setting the display of the button, no the value.

Glenn: the value of the name returned should be original

Johnny: if you submit, you submit what's visible.

Philippe: sounds like to be more an HTML problem than a DOM problem.

Johnny: we can say that we won't define which value will be sent.

Mary: should we remove the test?

Johnny: no, it should accept both value as ok.

ACTION Johnny: to clarify HTMLButtonElement.value in the specification.

Brad: You can probably reference the value. it doesn't say what happen.

Johnny: we can try to make it consistency with how we deal with
options value.

*****   HTMLIsIndexElement03 test changed below is the telecon minutes from 09/20/02  supporting the change

ment03 failed

Comment: The prompt attribute specifies the prompt message. Retrieve the
prompt attribute of the 1st isindex element and examine its value.

Johnny: IE fails this due to the bug in IE explained in test
HTMLIsIndexElement01. IE would pass this test if there was only one
isindex element in this test.

"Asize"
Expected 2 (number) but was 1 (number)

ACTION: Rick will rewrite the test to avoid problem from test
HTMLIsIndexElement01.
