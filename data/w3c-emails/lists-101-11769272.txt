Looking at [1], it appeared that this issue was closed at:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom/2002OctDec/0044.html
It seemed like Mozilla and IE are following the same behavior here.
(In case this issue needs a follow-up, I set the reply-to www-dom@w3.org
given that this is an issue on the draft, and not the test suite).

Yep, this is a bug. I fixed the CVS version. Konqueror is down to 20 now
:) I'll regenerate and run again the entire test suite once Dimitris is
done with the IBM tests.
