This sounds like a different issue to me.
The above is only about the rowIndex property, whereas the concern I'm
raising here (and in [1]) is the fact that the testsuite uses constructs like
document.getElementsByTagName("tr").item(4).

I believe it's an issue with the test suite only.

... and more precisely, that rows should be found by ID, or by actually using rowIndex,
but NOT using document.getElementsByTagName("tr").item(4),
which is rather fragile IMHO.
