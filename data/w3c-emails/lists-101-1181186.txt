I've posted a half-finished, inprogress initial pass at a schema 
for DOM testing based on my personal XML design biases
and my experience with the NIST DOM tests in the xmlconf CVS.  

It can be browsed at 
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/xmlconf/domunit/domtest.xsd?rev=1.1&content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup

It is seriously (I was going to say radically, but maybe
that is an overstatement) different than the DTD
used by NIST, primarily the use of declared elements corresponding
to DOM properties and methods instead of using a generic CALL.

I think my approach would allow a more concise test definition and
would allow effective use of schema aware editors in the development
of the tests.  

Nothing would mandate the use of Schema in any tools 
and I could after initial development is over generate a comparable
DTD.

I'll try to fill in some samples and the like later, but I thought I'd let you see what I'm thinking.  Making sense of it in its current state does require being able to comprehend schema.
