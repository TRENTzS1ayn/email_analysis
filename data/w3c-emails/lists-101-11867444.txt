Given that we currently have tested 4 implementations on 4 different 
platforms (IE/Mozilla/Opera/Konqueror on Windows/OSX/Linux/LinuxPPC) I 
think we have a good argument to kickstart the discussion on the 
framework. It would be especially good to have a discussion on what 
features of each forked version of JsUNIT we want to keep.

The results posted to this list over the past week have all been based 
on Curt's version of JsUnit, it would be good to see the results using 
Bob/Edward's version as well.

I'll continue testing my platform with the version that Bob has made 
available on his website.

So far, however, it seems we have a very good coverage of 
implementations/platforms.

Best,

/Dimitris
