All,

Yesterday IBM submitted a number of Level 2 Core tests, for which we 
thank them. It's good that we have yet another major actor (and DOM WG 
member) submit tests to the DOM TS framework.

I will check the tests into tests/level2/core as soon as some rsa issues 
are resolved.

Neil, as you submitted the tests, could you tell us what files in the 
core/files directory you have changed and that need to be checked in the 
CVS repository?

Thanks,

/Dimitris
