Hello all,

During the last DOM WG f2f the DOM WG started going through the results 
of running the DOM Level 2 HTML TS in Mozilla and IE. At the time the 
DOM WG didn't have enough time nor information to go through and 
identify the reason for all the failures that were reported when running 
the tests in MS IE and Mozilla. To continue this work the DOM WG decided 
to schedule a telecon once more information about the failures had been 
gatherd. This information is now available (see attachment) and it's 
time to schedule this telecon.

I'm proposing to hold this telecon on either Thursday 9/12/2002 at 2pm 
PDT, or on Tuesday 9/17/2002 at 2pm PDT. Let me know if either or both 
of those times works for you (I hope everyone directly receiveing this 
email can attend).
