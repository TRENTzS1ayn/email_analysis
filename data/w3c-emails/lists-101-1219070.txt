I think it's good to keep the test cases and the metadata (what's tested,
is it a positive test, negative, xref to spec, etc) distinct.  Among other
things, the test cases shouldn't really change when interpretations get
updated ... and since DOM hasn't really had a test suite before, then
it seems likely to me that interpretations will be in flux for some time.
