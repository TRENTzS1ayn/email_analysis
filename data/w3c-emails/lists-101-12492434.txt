All,

It's been quiet for quite some time, and I have a few 
observations/proposals. It may be that we need to reallocate/change some 
of the things each of us does, or is supposed to do, and in order to 
clarify this, I'd like each person involved to give a short recap of 
what they are currently or have been previously up to in relation to the 
DOM TS.

I have myself had to decrease the work I've allocated on the DOM TS due 
to a change in my regular job situation. I coordinate between this group 
and the W3C DOM WG, I am still in charge of the documentation on 
http://www.w3.org/Test (which needs updating) and finally I am still 
trying to increase interest for the DOM TS among vendors and 
implementors of the DOM specification.

The proposals:

1. Start using the Issue Tracker we have set up on Sourceforge. There's 
been parallel development, primarily on the ECMA framework, which needs 
to be brought in synch. Also, it seems that not all are frequent readers 
of the mailing list, so listing changes/additions/proposals to any part 
of the DOM TS on the issue tracker simplifies for all group members to 
keep in track
2. Move as quickly as possible to publishing the ODM Level 2 HTML and 
Core TS. Questions relating to some of the tests are hopefully going to 
be solved in the telephone conference that is being set up for Sept. 20 
(more information to follow).
3. In connection to 2, we should republish DOM L1 TS, using the new 
framework and also including the changes that have been made to some of 
the tests.
