David,

The only downloadable version of the DOM TS for Level 1 is the one on 
the main DOM TS page which we released a while ago. It could be of help 
as the tests are basically the same; however, you'd need to change the 
JsUnit version to see if it runs in Konqueror.

Later during the day I'll diug throuhg the archives to find latest 
activities and bottlenecks and will ask that people submit their issues 
either to the list or the issue tracker (which is preferrable) so that 
we all can have a fairly goodpicture of where we stand (I've has some 
problems to give a fair report to the DOM WG as not all issues have been 
reported to this list, for example.)
