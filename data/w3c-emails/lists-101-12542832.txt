As I mentioned in an earlier email I am
starting to write tests for DOM Level 2
Traversal and Range.

I am starting to set up the directories and
currently I have one directory called traversal-range
and will put all tests in this directory.

Is that OK or should I create two directories 
one called traversal and the other range 
and put the respective tests in the proper directory?

Suggestions/Comments?
