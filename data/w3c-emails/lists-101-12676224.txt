Yep that one is touchy and approaches the default maximum heap size.  I could run it with Ant 1.5, but not with Ant 1.4.  If you are running a Sun JVM, you should be able to control the maximum heap size by setting environment variable ANT_OPTS to -Xmx100m.  (60m or less on my machine will cause the build to fail).
