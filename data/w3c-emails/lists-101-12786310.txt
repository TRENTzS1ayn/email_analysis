Hello,

thanks for the minutes of the telephone conference.
I didn't know it would include specific discussion on specific tests...
If possible I'd like to be part of the next telephone conference then.

For now I would like to comment on the following issue:

Does this mean you are going to change the test to match IE's broken
behaviour?
Both Mozilla and Konqueror return it as a number, as the spec says.
Shouldn't this be flagged as an IE bug instead?
[I don't understand the comment about NS3...]

For the rest I'm happy to see that IE has more failures on the test
than the current Konqueror (down to 31 failures right now, and still
working on it) :-)

Thanks,
David.
