If it's a display problem, then it falls outside the scope of the DOM
imho. seems more an HTML issue.

I tend to agree with you that it seems a bug in the HTML spec rather a
pb in the DOM module.

except for mathematical operations of course.

As I replied to Glenn, DOM0 defined height and width as numbers and the
spec is committed to be backward compatible with DOM0. Regarding future
versions of HTML, ie XHTML, we only support XHTML 1.0, others are not
supported by the DOM HTML module. The remaining question is: should we
synchronize all vspace/hspace/height/width/border for
images/applets/objects? The conclusion from the call suggested that we
probably should for consistency.
