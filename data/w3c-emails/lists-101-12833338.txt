No, it also affects the result of myOption.text, and that's why the test
fails. Konq returns the value of the label attribute ("l1"), since that's
the text it displays, but the test expects text="EMP10002" instead.

Does it sound correct to say that a browser should ignore the label
attribute for <option> if the option isn't inside an <optgroup>? I'm not
very familiar with optgroup...

Is there any way to get this corrected in the HTML spec?

Hmm, indeed. So returning a number does make things easier.
And the DOM0 compat is another reason to do so.
Future extensions will have to use another attribute then ;)

That sounds great to me. Feel free to send me updated tests when this
change is done (I guess it must be changed in the HTML spec too...).
