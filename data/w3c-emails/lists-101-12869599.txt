The DOM specifies that this exception should be thrown, doesn't it?
Why change the test, when it's in fact IE that isn't compliant?
Or is this about changing the actual DOM spec? The sentence isn't very
clear.

[I just implemented this exception throwing in Konqueror BTW].

This is a bug in this test!
It says it will "invoke the insertRow() method with an index of two"
but it does        newRow = testNode.insertRow(3);

Thanks for fixing the test.

David.
