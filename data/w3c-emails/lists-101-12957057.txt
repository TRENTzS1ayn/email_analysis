In order to better drive the work done on the DOM Test Suite and ensure 
basic coverage of new DOM Specifications, the DOM Working Group has 
formed a new Test Suite Task Force, which Bob Clary of Netscape has 
agreed to chair.  Anyone who would like to participate should contact 
Bob Clary directly or reply to this message with information on the 
details of the desired participation and contributions.

Thanks,

Ray Whitmer
W3C DOM WG Chair
