I just added support for the value parameter for DOMInputStream 
definitions to the Java framework.  The value is expanded to a URL using 
the same logic as the <load> method and then the URL's openStream method 
is called.

For example,

   <var name="staffStream" type="DOMInputStream" value='"staff"'/>

would expand to:

InputStream staffStream = openStream("staff");

Where DOMTestCase.openStream(String baseURL) would append the 
appropriate suffix and attempt to find the resource within the .jar file 
(unless the value contains a protocol).
