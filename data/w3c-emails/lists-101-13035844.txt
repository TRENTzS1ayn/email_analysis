I believe a preferrable alternative to creating patch files and 
attaching to the Bugzilla issues would be to create a archived mailing 
list for CVS changes (www-dom-ts-cvs@w3.org) and to add the URL for the 
archived CVS change message when disposing the bug.  This would 
eliminate a couple of manual steps that could introduce discrepancies 
between the patch in Bugzilla and the actual changes to the CVS.

I haven't checked Bugzilla yet, but issue status should have a value to 
indicate an issue is waiting for WG resolution.
