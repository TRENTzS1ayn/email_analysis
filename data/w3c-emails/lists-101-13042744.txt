I fixed up a few problems with the schema validity of the initial XPath 
submission.  See http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=186 or 
attachment for details.

           Summary: Initial XPath submission not schema valid
           Product: DOM TS
           Version: unspecified
          Platform: All
        OS/Version: All
            Status: NEW
          Severity: normal
          Priority: P2
         Component: DOM Level 3
        AssignedTo: bclary@netscape.com
        ReportedBy: carnold@houston.rr.com


The initial submission of XPath tests had a few issues against the DOM 3 schema.  

alltests.xml and metadata.xml did not reference dom3.dtd which causes (probably
improperly) MSV to complain.

dom3xpathelements.ent called getFeature (which appears in multiple interfaces)
but didn't specify the required interface attribute.

evaluate01.xml and evaluate02.xml declared variables of type "Object" which
isn't a supported type and used evaluate (again on multiple interfaces) without
specifying interface.

The scheme did not allow the type attribute of the XPathEvaluator.evaluate
method to be an integer literal.
