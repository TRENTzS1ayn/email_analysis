Count me in.

Neither do I -- I can go either way -- as long as the test itself has enough
information so that proper transformations can be performed.

You have to be careful here -- if the intelligence isn't in the DTD/Schema,
it
has to be somewhere -- as Curt implies, the transformation.

2-3 days.

I have to admit that I do prefer the IDL definitions to any
language-specific def's.
This keeps the tests language neutral, and differences could be handled in
individual transformations.

Curt, are you thinking of making this work availabe under the GNU license,
or
as contributing it as part of the W3C test suite effort, which is destined
to be
under a W3C license?
