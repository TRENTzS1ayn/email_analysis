I've committed to the CVS fixes for bugs 190 
(http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=190) and 205 
(http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=205).

I've tested the SVG Plugin support with IE 6 on Win XP with the Adobe 
SVG plugin, other combinations and platforms have not been tested.

The external entity used by the XPath tests was modified to use 
createXPathEvaluator and the tests were run on Mozilla 1.3.  I have not 
yet added support for Xalan-J's implementation (Bug 191), so not able to 
run the XPath tests for Java just yet.
