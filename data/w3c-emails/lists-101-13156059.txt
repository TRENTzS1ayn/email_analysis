I've been working on getting distributions built for all the various 
flavors of the DOM test suites.  I've placed "snapshot" distributions of 
the test suites at 
http://homepage.mac.com/curt.arnold/FileSharing1.html.  These are 
unofficial work-in-progress builds and changes are expected.  I'll 
update these periodically and they may be removed at any time.

dom3-core.zip and dom3-events.zip are skeletal distributions since no 
significant tests have been committed for those modules.

coverage_report.zip is a Clover generated coverage report of Xerces-J 
and Xalan-J being exercised by all the DOM test suites with the 
exception of the HTML modules.  The significant packages are the 
org.apache.xerces.dom, org.apache.xerces.dom3 and org.apache.xpath.domapi.

I've also substantially reorganized build.xml.  Targets are now 
organized by level and module and parameterized targets are used to 
implement most targets.

Tomorrow, I'll analyze the L/S test failures for Xerces-J.
