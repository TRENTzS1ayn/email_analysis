I've been running the L/S test suite against the Xerces-J CVS 
implementation.  Xerces-J currently fails the following tests:

DOMBuilderTest1-4:  These tests execute LSParser.parseWithContext which 
is not currently implemented.

HasFeature01-02: These tests fail when expecting a true value from 
DOMImplementation.hasFeature("LS",  "3.0") and 
DOMImplementation.hasFeature("LS", null).

DOMInputSourceTest3:  This test calls Document.getInputEncoding.  The 
Document implementation in Xerces-J has not been updated to the latest 
DOM L3 Core.

DOMWriterFilterTest2: A filter is applied that should block all Text 
nodes.  The test expects all attribute values to have a zero-length 
value, however the value is not being filtered.

The following tests were modified:

DOMBuilderTest5:  Used supported-mediatypes instead of supported-media-types

DOMEntityResolverTest1: used entity-resolver instead of resource-resolver

DOMEntityResolverTest0: Expected baseURI on call to resource resolver to 
be "base".  There was a base (but not XML Base) attribute with the value 
"base" in the source document.  The appropriate value is an absolute URI 
for the test6 document.  Changed assertEquals to an assertURIEquals.

DOMImplementationLSTest:  This test checked multiple scenarios for 
DOMImplementation.createParser, some of which (asych mode) are option.  
Split into DOMImplementationLSTest0-5.

I ran a coverage analysis and reported the results as bug 401 
(http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=401) and will be working 
to fill in the gaps.

Oracle's 10g Java parser  apparently implements an earlier version of 
the L&S spec.  I will attempt to hack copy of the generated test suite 
to compensate so that I have two implementations to compare.
