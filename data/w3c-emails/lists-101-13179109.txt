I added a substantial number of Load and Save tests to increase coverage 
(bug 401).  The additional tests primarily involve the setting and 
retrieving configuration parameters, but do not test their effectiveness.

dom3-ls.zip, dom3-ls-xdk.jar and dom3-ls-results.html at 
http://homepage.mac.com/curt.arnold/FileSharing1.html. have been 
updated.  The results matrix is also available at 
http://home.houston.rr.com/curta/dom3-ls-results.html.
