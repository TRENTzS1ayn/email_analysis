I've committed the files the Neil submitted.  As submitted all tests 
successfully compiled and there were no build problems.

Running the tests as submitted against the Xerces head and Oracle's last 
XDK 10 beta resulted in almost all tests failing.  I'm working through 
the issues to try to get a reasonable set of errors.

A pervasive cause of failures when using XDK is the parser not allowing 
whitespace between the ] and > of a document type declaration while 
appears in most of the newly introduced test files.  The production in 
the XML rec indicates that whilespace is allowable there and the failure 
to accept it should be an XML conformance issue.  However, it isn't a 
big enough issue to warrant all the tests failing.  I'm planning on 
modifying the test files to eliminate the whitespace.

staffNSStandalone.xml fails validation with Xerces-J (not sure what 
version) with a message "White space must not occur between elements 
declared in an external parsed entity with element context in a 
standalone document."

Many of the other tests fail do to recent spec additions or renaming and 
I will take an approach similar to the adaption of the ls tests to XDK 
by creating variant jars to work around these problems.
