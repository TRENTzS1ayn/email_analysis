I've placed a DOM L3 Core distribution (dom3-core.zip) containing the 
IBM submissions on http://homepage.mac.com/curt.arnold/FileSharing1.html

A results matrix is available at 
http://home.houston.rr.com/curta/dom3-core-results.html

Running the L3 Core tests on JDK 1.4 and later will result in method not 
found exceptions since the L2 DOM is part of the VM's default 
classpath.  I avoided the problem by dropping back to JDK 1.3, but it 
would be nice to know a good solution to the problem.

Once the suite settles down, I would suggest that the many of the URL's 
in the tests and test files (http://www.usa.com, for example) be 
replaced with URL's in the .example top-level domain.
