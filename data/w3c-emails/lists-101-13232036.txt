Dear Curt & others,

I now finally ran the LS tests (from CVS) against our implementation.
The preliminary results are below. I will only have some time this
weekend to try and resolve some of the errors still in our
implementation. Probably I won't be able to fix them all. The status of
our implementation is that I recently started converting our
implementation that is based on the 26 February 2003 spec to the latest
release, that can explain some of the errors (e.g. in the missing
parameter department), but not all...

I had to remove the GetFeature1 and GetFeature2 tests, as they use a
CORE3 method we do not support (don't get me wrong, I don't mind there
are some DOM3 API calls in those tests but I had to remove them to be
able to compile), and changed DOMInputSourceTest3 to use our getEncoding
method instead of the CORE3 one.

I already did a quickscan of the test-results to fix some simple
problems, I noticed the following things in the tests (from looking at
the generated Java):
 - LSParserConfig7 
    setTrueIsEffective should be an assertTrue
 - LSSerializerConfig8 and LSSerializerConfig9:
    canSetFalse at the end, should that not be an assertTrue?
 - DOMEntityResolverTest0
    The generated entity resolver does some checks, 
    but then returns null. This means default behavior
    kicks in for the parser and it looks for a 'system' file to
    resolve the entity reference.
 - CharacterStream1
    Creates an LSParser with an illegal mode.

Kind regards,

--Sander.
