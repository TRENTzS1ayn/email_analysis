Several tests (including some L&S tests not mentioned in the bug) 
perform case-sensitive comparisions when testing encoding values.  The 
IANA reference indicates that there should be no distinction between 
upper and lower case letters which would suggest that a case-insensitive 
comparision is appropriate.

I would appreciate any comments.
