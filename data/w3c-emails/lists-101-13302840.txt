Several XPath tests (for example, 
XPathExpression_evaluate_NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR) used the string literal 
"dummy" as a namespace resolver.  I believe all of these tests expected 
an exception for other reasons and the type mismatch would have 
satisified the expectation of an exception.  If Mozilla actually takes a 
string literal as an namespace resolver, we should add a test that 
asserts that an implementation specific exception be thrown.

Most if not all <load> statements were missing willBeModified 
attributes.  The DTD can't distinguish between the inner class load  
method definition element and the framework load statement element, so 
willBeModified is optional in the DTD.  However, it is required for the 
framework load statement element in the schema.

Conformance_Expressions used a lot of <append> statements to add items 
to a list of statements.  These were change per the previous message.
