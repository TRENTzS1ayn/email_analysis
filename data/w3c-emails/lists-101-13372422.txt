Yes, because the next-sibling-of-next-sibling tested is whitespace. (Similarly
another test uses a previous-sibling test to check INSERT_BEFORE.)

Ouch. Yeah, that seems a bit excessive!

I don't think an external resource is necessarily such a bad thing, if made
available on a known server and optional (so one could still use localhost
instead if the external server were not contactable).

Heh. (No, I haven't got a proper HTTP PUT server hanging around, so I just
hacked up a trivial CGI to respond 201 to any request.)

I think this is more than reasonable, yes.

It could perhaps be the test runtime's responsibility to check that
a createTempSomethingURI refers to a resource that can successfully be
written to before calling the tested implementation.

Me too. I guess no project in the world other than TS actually depends on
the exact argument names given in the spec, but this is still desirable
from a consistency point of view.

(Currently I've had to special-case the TSML interpreter for acceptNode,
as well as XPath's evaluate.)
