An updated coverage report of Xerces-J while running dom1-core, 
dom2-core, dom2-events, dom3-core, dom3-ls and dom3-xpath is available 
at http://homepage.mac.com/curt.arnold/FileSharing1.html   The 
significant packages are org.apache.xerces.dom and 
org.apache.xpath.domapi.  If anyone wants to create tests to fill in the 
gaps, please let the list known your intentions so we don't duplicate 
effort.  I'm hoping to continue to flesh out L&S.
