The design actually anticipates this:

If we were to end up in a situation where there are different
interpretations of the specification, the DOM WG representative will be the
person to either discuss this with the submitting party, or take it to the
WG for clarification. The test is in the meanwhile frozen while being
considered by either the DOM WG rep. or the DOM WG. 

In either case the test remins as is, so there seems to be no need to
separate documentation from the actual test.

Please tell me if I haven't convinced you. Could you perhaps provide the
olist with an example?

I think it's good to keep the test cases and the metadata (what's tested,
is it a positive test, negative, xref to spec, etc) distinct.  Among other
things, the test cases shouldn't really change when interpretations get
updated ... and since DOM hasn't really had a test suite before, then
it seems likely to me that interpretations will be in flux for some time.
