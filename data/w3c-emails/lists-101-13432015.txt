My bad, I meant DOMInputSourceTest5.

What does that mean, I did not implement this for nothing did I?

For those who want such a server but do not have much experience with
such things, let me share my quick recipe for a domts-ls compatible
server:
 - Download and unpack a recent Tomcat version (I use 4.1.x).
 - Copy the directory (including content) tomcatDir/webapps/webdav to
tomcatDir/webapps/domts
 - Edit tomcatDir/webapps/domts/WEB-INF/web.xml to ensure all references
to servlet name webdav are replaced with domts, and uncomment the part
indicated as needed to be uncommented for readwrite access (needed for
SystemId2).
 - Create the dir tomcatDir/webapps/domts/temp
 - Copy a (random) file to tomcatDir/webapps/domts/testpdf.pdf
 - Start Tomcat with e.g. 'catalina.bat run' or 'sh catalina.sh run'
from tomcatDir/bin.

Kind regards,

--Sander.
