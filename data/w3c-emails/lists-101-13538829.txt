Dear Curt,

Oh darn it, it was *I* who is doing all the sleeping.
We run the tests within our own framework. I made a few 'minor' changes
to the stylesheet to run make it produce code that runs within it (just
4 lines really). Turns out I ripped out the entire constructor building
process...
Unfortunately this new development causes a problem for me and the way I
run the tests, but I'll just have to look into that. Thanks for your
help.

Kind regards,

--Sander.
