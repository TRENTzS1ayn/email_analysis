I've just committed changes to build.xml, test-to-ecmascript.xsl and 
test-to-jsunit.xsl which generate tests that are designed to be run with 
JSUnit 1.3.3.  The generated tests will not run with the JSUnit that was 
previously distributed.

In its current state, the framework only supports loading HTML documents 
from an embedded <iframe> element (or loading XML documents using 
Mozilla if you change the "var builder = ..." line in DOMTestCase.js).

Test deactivation based on parser attributes or content type is not 
supported, so only run html_alltests in the Core test suites if you are 
using the iframe loader.

Internet Explorer 6.0 and Mozilla 1.3a appeared to work from the local 
filesystem, but the results were not verified against the results from 
the previous framework.

Any feedback is appreciated.
