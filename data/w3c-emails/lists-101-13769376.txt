It appears that they Internet Explorer and Mozilla return lowercase 
attribute and element names for HTML documents regardless of the case of 
the provided document.  The provided hc_staff.html is lowercase, but 
switching the test file to upper case did not change the results.

Sombody else will have to explain how to interpret section 1.3 and 
whether IE and Mozilla are exhibiting conformant behavior.
