Thanks. All Builds complete now however I am getting a message in the 
DOM 2 HTML tests that I was receiving from before the transition to 
JsUnit 1.3.3

file:///C:/w3-cvs/2001/DOM-Test-Suite/transforms/test-to-ecmascript.xsl; 
Line 865; Column 19; Unrecognized element foo

where foo is the name of the property being tested on each of the tests. 
The constructed test files all appear to lack the initialization of the 
variable containing the value being tested.
