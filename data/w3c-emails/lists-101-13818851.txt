A nightly build of xalan can be downloaded from 
http://gump.covalent.net/jars/latest/xml-xalan/.

I did not realize that the build errors were occurring only for the 
dom2-html-gen-jsunit.  The problem appears to be related 
xmlspec-v22-dom.dtd that is expected in the lib/specs/pubtext 
directory.  My initial attempt to fix the problem did not work, but you 
can work around it by running the "dom3-interfaces" target which will 
properly set up that file.  The specs aren't affected by clean, so 
running dom3-interfaces once will hide the problem until you manually 
clean the specs directory.
