Thanks for the update Curt. I updated the page following your
instructions:
http://www.w3.org/DOM/Test/Documents/DOMTSBuild.html

I'm in the process of testing the build process. I got the following
error for the moment:

BUILD FAILED

I'll keep testing the build process and trying to fix it as well. I'd
like to add the tests submitted by IBM asap.
I also need to check with Dimitris regarding the JSUnit framework. We
did discuss the framework at the face-to-face meeting and we concluded
that the framework from Bob is probably the best to follow. Not sure how
this fits with JSUnit 1.3.3 though.
