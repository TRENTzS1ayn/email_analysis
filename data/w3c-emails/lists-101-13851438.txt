I realized that there is a mistake in the ant targets:
[[
     [echo] dom1-core-jar        builds DOM Level 1 Core tests for Java
     [echo] dom1-schema          builds W3C XML Schema for DOM 1 tests
     [echo] dom1-core-matrix     builds test matrix for DOM Level 1 Core
     [echo] dom1-core-validate-tests
     [echo]                      validates DOM Level 1 Core tests

     [echo] dom2-html-*          Same as above but for DOM Level 2 Core
]]

There is no dom1-core, it's either dom1-xml or dom1-html. We should also
have dom2-core, dom2-xml and dom2-html.
