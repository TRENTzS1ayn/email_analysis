I assume the tests are private.  I didn't see any tests by those names  
in the CVS and the current CVS builds without complaint.

I've committed a change to test-to-java that will fix the cast to  
HTMLDocument issues on load.  The other issues are due to not  
specifying the interface attribute when there is an ambiguity.  Running  
dom2-html-validate-tests should have identified the tests are invalid.   
I also try to Sun's Multi-schema Validator for to schema validate.

Are there any feelings about inquiring about being included in Gump's  
(http://jakarta.apache.org/gump/) massive automated build?
