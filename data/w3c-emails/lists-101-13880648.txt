Many thanks to X-Hive Corporation for submitted their tests to the W3C!

I fixed two errors in the test DOMInputSourceTest3.xml:
  <var name="iso"            type="DOMString" value="&quot;ISO-8859-1&quot;"/>
  <var name="utf"            type="DOMString" value="&quot;UTF-8&quot;"/>
(replaced simple quotes with &quot; in value strings)

I did not manage to build them correctly yet but I presume this is due
to my build.xml which probably does not reference the internal drafts. 
Hopefully, we will update the public versions asap.

I left the files around for the moment even if there are no longer in
use.
