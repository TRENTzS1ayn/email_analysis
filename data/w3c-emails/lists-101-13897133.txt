Is this test supposed to have deep="false"? In the description it
says it should be true but the xml file has:

<cloneNode obj="addressNode" deep="false" var="clonedNode"/>

PS: Also the order of the expectedResult members is foiling my
assertEqualsList function. Not sure if those are supposed to
appear in order but it would be nice if you could flip them if it
doesn't make any other difference.

Thanks,
Mike
