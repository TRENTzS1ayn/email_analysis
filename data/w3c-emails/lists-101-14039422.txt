Curt,

I think we may be encountering some new
issues.  These are level 3 tests -- the level
3 test suite language and the transforms
have not really been exercised all that
heavily.  Do you think that maybe this
problem and the whatToShow problem
might be result of problems with the
generated language or the transform?
