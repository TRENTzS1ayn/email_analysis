aloha, john!

while i appreciate your having forwarding your paper to the list, i would
have rather you forwarded it in an interoperable, and not a proprietary
format, especially since the paper makes use of graphics, which--while
captioned--aren't fully explained (and one of which i am aware of only
because i asked a sighted colleague to gloss the non-textual elements on
the page for me)...  could you not have sent the document to the list in a
non-proprietary (preferably non-binary) format?  something that can be
re-styled to better suit the user's needs, and which has a mechanism for
providing a rich description of each graphic used in the document to
convey content?  it would benefit us all if participants on this list "ate
the W3C's dog food", by which i mean, distributed documents, drafts,
position papers, and the like in non-proprietary formats--preferably those
which, if used correctly, promote accessibility (such as HTML4 or
XHTML or XML)

thank you,
gregory j. rosmaita
