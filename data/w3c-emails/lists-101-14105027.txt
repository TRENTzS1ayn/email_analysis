Could you clarify?

If "unevenly" means "bug", it needs to be fixed. Has this been reported to 
the developers of the various XSLT processors? 

If "unevenly" means "spec has a bug", that needs to be fixed. Has it been 
reported to the XSLT WG?

If "unevenly" means "spec allows more variation than we'd prefer"... then 
this might be a portabilty issue in the stylesheet....
