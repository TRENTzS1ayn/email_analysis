2002/10 is not a public draft. As said at the f2f, our current set of
changes to do on Core and LS is too important so it's better to wait to
update the public version instead of updating them now and republishing
in less than a month.

I changed the generation process 5 months ago. You'll find a file called
xml-source.xml now, instead of xml-source.zip. It (almost) guarantees
that I don't forget a file when generating the public version.

Is "as soon as possible" acceptable? :)
More seriously, the editors (including myself) are late on their action
items but we'll do our best to be as much up-to-date as possible before
the technical plenary (beginning of March).
