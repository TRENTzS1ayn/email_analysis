Ok,

I've changed my build.xml as follows to handle this:

change:

<unzip src="${specs.dir}/Level-3/LS/xml-source.zip"
dest="${specs.dir}/Level-3/xml/ls"/>

into:

<copy file="${specs.dir}/Level-3/LS/xml-source.xml"
tofile="${specs.dir}/Level-3/xml/ls/dom-spec.xml"/>

which works ok. This needs to be changed to the build.xml of the test
suite after the next public release.

The same thing counts for Core.
With Core there used to be a patchfile that replaced element.xml
which is no longer available. I'n not sure whether the patchfile is still
needed ...
