I've eliminated the use of <patch> tasks in build.xml (except when 
producing SVG 1.0 DOM tests) by moving the changes to 
Element.getElementsByTagName into existing XSLT transforms such as 
dom2-combine.xsl.

I've also added a dom1-errata.xsl that produces a dom1-interfaces.xml 
file that contains the additional NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR exceptions 
and removed the HTMLBlockquoteElement.  I believe that should allow 
resurrecting a few tests that were removed since they didn't validate.
