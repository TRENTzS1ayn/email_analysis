Using a distinct file for each test does seem to be a better 
approach that inlining tests into suites since there are
distinct sources for the tests and you want independent
revision histories, etc.

Do you have a particular pattern that you would like to use
for the definition of a suite?  My current schema reflected
the earlier efforts and only supported in-lining of tests in
suites and references to externally defined suites.
