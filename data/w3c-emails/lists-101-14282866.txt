Is Xalan-J really was folks are using right now? I checked out the latest everything and it's just not building. I ran into an error building the DTD where $exceptions was in scope but Xalan-J
apprently didn't know about it yet because it threw a NullPointerException. Strangely adding a value-of to the dom-to-dtd.xsl provoked it to get over that hump.

     90     <xsl:variable name="exceptions" select="//exception[@id]"/>
     91     <xsl:if test="$exceptions">
     92 <xsl:value-of select="count($exceptions)"/>
     93         <xsl:text>| assert</xsl:text>
     94         <xsl:value-of select="$exceptions[1]/@name"/>
     95         <xsl:for-each select="$exceptions[position() &gt; 1]">

But still I'm gettin the old:

after 200 or so tests. I only need to create the Java tests once for comparison to my C tests (for DOMC) but this non-deterministic XLST processing must drive you guys up a wall. Has anyone nailed
this process down yet?

How do you pass Java options to ant so that I can try the ol' -Xmx512m?
