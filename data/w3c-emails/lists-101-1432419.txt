We were thinking in terms of having one source file per test description and
using an outer tag basically to define a suite. This allows us to build
different suites that consist of the same tests, if that were needed, as
well as supply the test suite with information on how to treat the tests it
consists of. 

I think your proposal as well as the NIST DTD could be used in this way

Using a distinct file for each test does seem to be a better 
approach that inlining tests into suites since there are
distinct sources for the tests and you want independent
revision histories, etc.

Do you have a particular pattern that you would like to use
for the definition of a suite?  My current schema reflected
the earlier efforts and only supported in-lining of tests in
suites and references to externally defined suites.
