Hi,

The LS DOMWriter interface has a method writeNode which takes a
DOMOutputStream as a parameter to serialize a node to.


DOMOutputStream has a language specific binding which is an OutputStream
in java.

At the moment the stylesheet can't handle DOMOutputStream which is
transformed as is.

I also need a way to instantiate this object.

The same counts for DOMInputStream, DOMReader
