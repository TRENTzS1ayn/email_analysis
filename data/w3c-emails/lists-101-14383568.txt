In relation to this: the DOM WG would like to see that the official 
JsUnit be the base for the DOM TS framework in the future, therefore, 
your working on 1.3.3 is a very good thing. If we have to make changes 
to be able to run existing tests in the new framework, so be it. For 
already released versions of the DOM TS, it is not necessary to be able 
to port it to a newer version of JsUnit. It's not a priority to be able 
to run those tests in the new framework.
