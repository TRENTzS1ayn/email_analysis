Ok, browsing through the spec I believe that the following methods are
required to write certain LS tests:


- a method to create a new File OutputStream a.k.a. in java new
FileOutputStream(String fileName)
- a method to close a DOMOutputStream
- a method to create a new File object a.k.a in java: new File(String
filename)
- a method to test the existence of a file
- a method to test whether a substring appears in a file
- a method to get the size of a file
- a method to create a new FileReader from a File object
- a method to create a new byte array output stream
- a method to create a new input stream from a URL
- the ability to create a new input stream from an output stream
- a method to get a substring of DOMString



- A method to create a new input stream from a string variable

I guess we don't need that. DOMInputSource.stringData is meant for that one.

Best regards,
