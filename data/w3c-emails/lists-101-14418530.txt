test-to-java.xsl has now been updated to cast numeric literals passed to 
inner class constructor short parameters.  Also, the inner class method 
and attribute production now recurses into the supertype if the 
definition is not found in the derived type which should enable 
DOMWriterFilter.acceptNode to be correctly produced.
