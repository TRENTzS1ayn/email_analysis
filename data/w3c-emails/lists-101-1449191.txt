Dear all

Below please find my proposal for immediate action. Issues raised in the
discussions we have had so far should be raised in the telephone conference
we should be able to schedule for next week (I'm still waiting for technical
details)

1. We should consider migrating toward declaring the IDL interfaces and
methods in our schema in accordance with Curt's proposal. Also we will get
rid of entities. Language-specific issues on bindings should be resolved in
teh transformation layer. I think we've solved the issues that were raised
about the loading.

2. We should try to work with one common schema as this greatly enhances the
chances for people submitting more tests, as they will not lose time
developing for two distinct frameworks.

3. Finalize the schema within the next few days.

4. Rewrite the XSLT for Java and write another one for ECMA (these are the
minimal requirements for the DOM TS, naturally more stylesheets for other
bindings are more than welcome)

5. Set up details for submitting on the W3C site (i'm already looking into
this). We also need to look at issue tracking (Bugzilla has been proposed).

6. Produce reference documents to simplify test authoring.

Have I missed something?
