Calling getChildNodes on a DOM Attr node does return the children of the
Attr, which are the text and EntityReference nodes that make up the Attr's
content.

Calling getChildNodes on an element does *NOT* return the Attr nodes or
their descendents. Attributes are not children in the DOM, and do not have
parents (though they may have an Owner Element).
