I committed the tests from Oracle for DOM Level 3 Validation. I applied
the fix reported by Kongyi reading test-to-java.xsl. I did change the
test regarding allowedFirstChildElement since the method is now called
allowedFirstChildren. As soon as the CR draft for Validation is
published (end of July), I'll update the links. The issue regarding the
contentType still needs to be addressed.

[[
This .zip file contains the W3C-structured test suite that Oracle would
like to contribute for DOM Level 3 Validation.  The ownership issues are
covered in Section 6 of
http://www.w3.org/2002/06/DOMConformanceTS-Process-20020627

allvaltests.xml lists all the tests; the test coverage is only entry
point.
The tests are based on the 2/26/2003 DOM L3 Core spec and the 5/7/2003
DOM L3 Validation spec.  The following support files are also included:
dom3.xml, dom3.dtd, dom3.xsd, and test-to-java.xsl.

They are generated with the W3C DOM test suite tools with two changes:

1. The Core and Validation specs both have a contentType attribute. This
results in duplicate definitions in dom3.xsd. This issue needs to be
fixed either in the spec to avoid a possible conflict or dom-to-xsd.xsl
needs to be modified.  For now, we've manually modified the dom3.xsd as
a temporary fix.

2. The test-to-java.xsl incorrectly transformed DOMStringList to Java
String.
The stylesheet has been modified to address this issue.
