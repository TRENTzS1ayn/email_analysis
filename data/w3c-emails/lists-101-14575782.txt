I still haven't found anything wrong with contentType in either dom3.dtd 
or dom3.xsd.  However, I did fixup a series of picky problems in the L3 
Validation tests such as using "null" as a variable name, omitting 
ignoreCase on assertEquals or interface="Node" on firstChild, and a 
stray backslash as bug 277.
