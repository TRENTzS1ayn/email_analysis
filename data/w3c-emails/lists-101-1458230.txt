Make that "when" not "if"; it happens for every specification.
All you need is two different implementations, and you're
pretty much guaranteed different interpretations somewhere.

I don't much care about the details of the procedure, though having
resolutions that are prompt, responsive, and stable is an important
part of the process.  (The XML WG didn't deliver on those points;
some resolutions took over a year to deliver, others didn't address
the issue, and in at least one case there was a significant reversal.)

Well, if the test remains as-is, then what changed as the result of
that procedure you're outlining?  Clearly, it's the test metadata,
affecting outputs or their interpretation ... and likely descriptions
explaining some of the inevitable strange consequences.
