I've updated build.xml and dom3-combine.xsl for the new L3 Core working 
draft.   For more details, see 
http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=221.

The changes in the Core working draft invalidated one of the Load/Save 
tests, DOMInputSourceTest3 that depended on Document.encodingString 
which was apparently removed 
(http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=222).  If you have a 
recommendation for resolving the issue, please reply or add a comment to 
the bug.

I had fairly good luck using Clover (http://www.thecortex.net/clover, 
commercial but offers free licenses for open-source work) to generate an 
HTML report showing the test coverage of Xerces-J's DOM implementation.  
If anyone is interested, I'll do a refresh and post a coverage map.  If 
there are other suggestion for coverage tools, please let me know.

If you are working on any L3 tests, please give the list a heads up.
