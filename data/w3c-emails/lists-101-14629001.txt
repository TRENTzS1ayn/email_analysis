Gump (http://jakarta.apache.org/gump) continuously builds a couple 
hundred open source projects (http://cvs.apache.org/builds/gump/latest/) 
from scratch.  There have been several occassions where our build 
process was broken and it was not notices for a substantial period of 
time.  I believe the Gump team would be receptive to adding the test 
suite to their build list.  Any thougths?
