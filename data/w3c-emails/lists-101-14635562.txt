I attempted to run three of JSUnit 1.3.3 self tests on recent or new 
versions of 8 different browsers.  The tests run were:

jsUnitTestSuite.html, a basic check out of JSUnit
jsUnitTestLoadData.html, attempts to load a html document by generating 
an <iframe>
jsUnitTestLoadStaff.html, same but an XML document

The testRunner and tests were loaded from the file system and using http.

Windows 2000 browser:

IE 6: Passed Suite and LoadData from both file system and http.  Failed 
Staff since <iframe> does not support arbitrary XML documents.

Mozilla 1.4 RC1 (2003052908): Passed all tests from both file system and 
http.

Opera 7.1.1: Suite passes, LoadData and LoadStaff fail from both file 
system and http.

Mac OS/X 10.2.6:

IE 5.2: File system loading would result in device not ready warning and 
script warnings.  Possibly due to 4th leading / in file: URL.  Loading 
using http: will stall while trying to load Suite.

Safari 1.0 Beta 2 (v74): Stalls on attempts to run Suite.

Mozilla 1.4b: Suite passes on both local file system and http.  LoadData 
and Staff stall.  Changing uri within LoadData to an absolute URI 
(http://.../tests/data/data.html) causes permission denied on 
HTMLDocument.location exception to be logged to JavaScript console.  
Page setup and loadComplete were called but the test body was never 
executed.

Konqueror 3.1.1 (via Fink): Does not run from local file system.  On 
http, passes Suite, stalls on LoadData and LoadStaff.  Clunky rendering 
of testRunner.html, immediately goes to 99% and then stalls for 10 secs 
(while nothing displayed).

Palm Web Browser 2.0 (using Palm 5.2 simulator):

testRunner layout is not friendly to low res device.  Attempts to run 
Suite using http stalled.



Any browser that passes suite and LoadData should be able to run the DOM 
TS suite.  If it fails LoadData, then the IFrame loader would be 
expected to fail, but possibly other loaders would succeed.  Based on 
these tests, only the Windows Mozilla and IE browsers would be expected 
to run using the IFrame loader.
