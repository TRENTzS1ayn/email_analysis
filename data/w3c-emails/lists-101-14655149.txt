I've spent the last few days trying to find a way to run the DOM test 
suites on Konqueror, Safari and Opera.  I've summarized the issues and 
committed changes against 
http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=228 that should allow 
those browsers to run the test suites.  I tested all the browsers 
accessing the test suites using http, I have not had any success running 
from the file system with Safari and Konqueror.

At least one of the characterdata*negative tests in the L1 Core test 
suite will cause  my version of Konqueror 3.1.1 (on Mac OS/X via Fink) 
to crash.  If those tests are commented out from 
build/ecmascript/level1/core/alltests.html, the remaining tests will 
complete and you are able to see all results with the "Show All" button, 
but I could not figure out how to copy that from the browser.

Safari and Opera would run the tests without crashing, but did not 
display the details of the test errors and failures in either the main 
form or when using the "Show All" button.  This appears to be a problem 
with JSUnit on those browsers since the same behavior can be seen when 
trying to run the JSUnit self-test jsUnitTestFailures.html.
