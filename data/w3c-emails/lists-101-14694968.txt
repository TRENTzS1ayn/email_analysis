Hello,

Many tests fail in Konqueror (and almost certainly Safari, maybe other 
browsers too) due to a capitalization issue.
For instance hc_attrname.html expects "class" but since the document
is HTML, we return "CLASS", as per the HTML specification.

According to Curt Arnold this would be (from memory) because the
spec says uppercase, but since Mozilla and IE return lowercase,
the tests were changed to expect lowercase.

But this completely screws up any browser that attempts to actually comply
to the DOM spec, which is what this is all about, isn't it?
If the tests accept that Mozilla and IE return lowercase, why not simply
accept both (the "Mozilla and IE" way, and the "compliant" way, i.e. uppercase)?


PS: congratulations for the improvements to the test suite. It looks much
more complete now, it catches many little unimplemented things - which
I'm fixing one by one :)
