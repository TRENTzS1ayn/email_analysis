I'm digging into this right now, my recollection is fuzzy and I've not 
been able to find the "spec doesn't say what it appears to say" message 
that I recalled.

David's observation is about test failures with Level 1 Core hc_* tests. 

hc_attrname is an example of one of the tests that is failing on 
Konqueror where it checks the nodeName of a "class" attribute.  The 
original version of hc_attrname.xml 
(http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/2001/DOM-Test-Suite/tests/level1/core/hc_attrname.xml) 
which was checked in by dom_ts_2 (Rick Rivello?) on 8 March 2002 
specified ignoreCase="auto" which would have required an HTML 
implementation to return "CLASS" (as Konqueror is now doing).   On 10 
June 2002 (as part of a massive update to the HTML compatible Core 
tests), I checked in a modified version that specified 
ignoreCase="false" that would require an HTML implementation to return 
"class" (which is the case of the attribute in the source document). 

By my reading of 
http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-HTML/html.html#ID-535378264, 
ignoreCase="auto" (upper case for HTML implementations, lower case for 
XHTML) would be correct.

I have recollections of ignoreCase being misused 
(http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom-ts/2002Mar/0020.html point 
5) in the initial L1 Core HTML compatible tests.  So the change from 
ignoreCase="auto" to ignoreCase="false" might be a side-effect of a 
global change to reset everything to the most restrictive setting with 
the intention of later restoring those that should have had other settings.

Here is a listing of previous messages that touched on the subject of 
case in HTML DOM's:

I'm continuing to explore this issue.
