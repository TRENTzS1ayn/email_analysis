I've entered the following bugs for the captialization and debug issues:

http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=236
http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=237

In the message Mary quoted, I said that ignoreCase="auto" performs 
case-insensitive comparisions.  That is incorrect, ignoreCase="true" 
performs case-insensitive comparisions.  ignoreCase="auto" performs 
case-sensitive comparisions and the expected value is uppercased for 
HTML implementations.

On the debugging issue, is there a preference for a link instead of a 
button? 

Also, I had previous considered generating an HTML representation of the 
test (ala test-to-html.xsl, basically what you would see if you looked 
at the test .xml file in Mozilla) into the JSUnit test file.  Unless 
there is any objections, I can add that while adding the link or button 
to run the test.

I'm also going to revisit bug #228 which enabled support for Opera, 
Konqueror and Safari.  That change removed support for loading XHTML 
documents using an iframe element on Mozilla.  I should be able to 
restore that capability while continuing to support the three new browsers.
