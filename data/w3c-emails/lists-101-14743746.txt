I am concerned about the following DOM2 core tests which appear to require
that the implementation use a validating parser since the tests assume that
the reading of external DTDs are supported:

 getAttributeNS01.html
 getElementByID01.html
 hasAttribute02.html
 hasAttributeNS04.html
 namespaceURI01.html
 removeAttributeNS02.html

In my opinion these tests should be made optional and marked as such, since
they effectively require a validating parser as described above.  Even if
some implementations have hacked default attribute values without a
validating parser, that is no reason to require such hacks of other
implementations.


I tried searching the www-dom-ts archives regarding the issue of requiring a
validating parser and/or default attribute values from external DTDs, and
this message (that I am replying to) appeared to be the latest on the
subject.

 http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom-ts/2002Feb/0170.html

Was the issue brought up during the 2002 DOM WG Meeting in Cannes as [dd]
indicates, and if so, what was the resolution?

Or has this been discussed in a more recent thread?

Thanks,

Tantek
