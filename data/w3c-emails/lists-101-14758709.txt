Redirecting a reply to www-dom-ts since I am raising a DOM 2 Core Test Suite
issue (in response to a message over two years old!).

I tried searching the archives, and this is the most recent relevant
reference I could find to the question of whether it is correct for the test
suite to test hasFeature("Core","1.0").

I don't think the DOM 2 Core Test Suite should be performing that check,
since no DOM 1 Core implementation could be required to return true for that
since "Core" wasn't added as a feature flag until DOM 2.

The following tests in the DOM 2 Core Test Suite appear to make that
assumption however, and thus should be fixed to not expect
hasFeature("Core","1.0") to return a meaningful value.
