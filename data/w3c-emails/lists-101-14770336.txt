I logged bug http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=238 in 
response to your message.

The resolution was communicated in
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom-ts/2002Mar/0002.html and several DOM
L1 Core tests were marked as only appropriate for validating parsers.  Since the
resolution came as part of the release cycle for the DOM L1 test suite, it is
very likely that the corresponding fixes were not done for the L2 Core tests.

My response to the WG resolution was
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom-ts/2002Mar/0021.html which did not
mention any L2 tests.  That thread started a lengthy discussion, but I don't
believe it changed anything.

I would suggest a similar approach to that undertaken with the L1 tests.  Find a
processor that passes all the tests as currently written (probably Xerces-J),
(temporarily) remove the default attribute values from the DTD's and mark the tests that fail
are requiring validation.
