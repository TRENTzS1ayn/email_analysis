http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Core/*Core.html#*ID-5CED94D7 has:


|version| of type |DOMString| 
<http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Core/core.html#DOMString>
    This is the version number of the feature to test. In Level 2, the
    string can be either "2.0" or "1.0". If the version is not
    specified, supporting any version of the feature causes the method
    to return |true|.

    This was apparently interpreted by NIST and the Xerces-J team (maybe
    in response to a NIST test) that "2.0" and "1.0" should be
    equivalent.  I do not know of any definitive WG decision on this issue.

    I logged this as http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=239
