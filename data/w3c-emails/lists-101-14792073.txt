IE 6 and Mozilla return lower-case tag and attribute names for HTML 
documents.  It appears that they intentionally convert to lower-case 
since changing the source document had no effect.  Konqueror returns 
upper-case tag and attribute names.  Opera fails hc_attrname which 
suggests that it returns upper-case, but since it is not yet possible to 
see the failure message it is hard to be sure.  Safari passes 
hc_attrname, so it appears to have deviated from the Konqueror code base.

It appears in this case, the L2 HTML specification appears to be in 
conflict with the dominant browsers and an implementor has to make a 
decision to adhere to the spec or to maximize compatibility with 
existing scripts.

I think the most satisifactory solution would be to issue an errata for 
L2 HTML specifying that tag and attribute names should be returned as 
lower-case for HTML documents and change hc_staff.html to use upper-case 
tag and attribute names (to make sure that the implementation forces 
them to lower-case and not just preserve the source case).
