In this case there will be no test that attribute defaulting/normalisation
works at all; it is my understanding that a non-validating parser should
still respect attribute declarations given in the internal subset.

Why not simply copy the significant <!ATTLIST>s from the DTD into the
internal subset of staff[NS].xml? This is how I persuaded my non-validating
implementation to pass L1/L2 Core.
