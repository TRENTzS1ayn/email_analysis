hc_staff.html isn't an XHTML document.  The  document type declaration 
it references is an HTML DTD not an XHTML DTD, however it does XML 
compatible things like quoting attributes, closing tags and using 
lower-case tag names.

I tested adding a little link to hc_staff.html that displayed the 
document element tag name and the result was consistently HTML for IE 
even though hc_attrname and similar tests passed which suggests that it 
is something after document loading that triggers the switch to "compat" 
mode.

Why shouldn't you return uppercase when the doctype is HTML 4 strict?
