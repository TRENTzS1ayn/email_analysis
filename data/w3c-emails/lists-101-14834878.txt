Thanks for the background.   I hadn't picked up on the differing 
behavior of attributes and tag names.

If attribute casing in HTML documents was not specified in Level 1 or 
added by an errata, then the L1 tests checking attribute names should 
use ignoreCase="true".  The same tests should then be reiterated in the 
L2 Core suite with ignoreCase="auto".

I'll try to review the case expectations in the L1 Core hc_ tests and 
report back on the www-dom-ts list.  The thread has (or at least some of 
my postings have) been speculative.  Once we think we have a good 
understanding of the tests and implementations, we can post an invite to 
the www-dom mailing list to review the thread on www-dom-ts.  We've 
cross-posted issues in the past and it makes it difficult to reconstruct 
things later.
