I've spent a pretty significant time over the last few days on the L1 
Core test suite particularly the HTML compatible tests.  I've logged all 
the issues addressed in Bugzilla (http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public) with 
patches and have committed the changes to the CVS. 

I've run these tests with Internet Explorer 6, MSXML 3, Mozilla 1.4rc3 
(HTML, XHTML and XML, IFrame and MozillaXML loader), Opera 7 (requires 
JSUnit hack, see bug 228), Konqueror 3.1.1, Adobe SVG viewer and 
Xerces-J.   I analyzed any test that more than one implementation failed 
and many that only one implementation failed.  I've also cleaned up the 
assertion names and made other changes to make the observed test 
failures easier to interpret.

The current state of the CVS is a substantial improvement to the quality 
of the tests and that any implementor using the tests should update if 
possible.
