Mozilla and IE both fail that one.  Mozilla omits the comment node, IE 
reports the processing instruction and document type declaration as 
comments.  The <!DOCTYPE gets reported as if it were <!--CTYPE.  I can't 
see arguing that the IE behavior is conformant, but you could argue that 
dropping comments is an acceptible for HTML processors.

IE fails this one in the same way.  These tests are based on the 
explicit XML whitespace processing rules and are passed by XML 
processors and Mozilla.  The current expected behavior must remain 
acceptible, however you could argue that IE and Konq current behavior is 
also acceptible since I don't think HTML specified as clearly how 
whitespace should be handled.

Most likely.  I'll fix these as a continuation of the existing bug.
