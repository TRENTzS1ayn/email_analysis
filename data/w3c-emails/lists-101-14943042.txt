Didn't know you were such an expert on the Mac platform, Curt. Good 
thing, now there's two of us.

I haven't had a chance to run the protoype yet, but there is one 
outstanding issue:

The DOM WG decided that the DOM TS should be based on the official 
version (at least some official version) of JsUnit. So it would be good 
if the patches could be incorporated into the next version, so that it 
can form part of the DOM TS.

If not possible, then we at least need to have a comprehensive list of 
things that JsUnit as it stands now does not do.

Best,
