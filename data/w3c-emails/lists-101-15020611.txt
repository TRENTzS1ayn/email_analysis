Rick,

Here are the results I see using the patched version of JsUnit which 
includes the fix for the bug where SETUPPAGE_INTERVAL is misspelled:

HTML 2

Mozilla 1.3b 2003022516 build on Win2k
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.3b) Gecko/20030225

Internet Explorer 6.0.2800.1106 on Win2k with SP1; Q324929, Q810847, Q813951
Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0)

Both have check cache each time set.
All tests uses default settings except for Content Type

Browser | Protocol | Mime Type | Runs | Errors | Failures
Mozilla | http     | xml       | 552  | 11     |  38
Mozilla | http     | xhtml     | 552  | 11     |  38
Mozilla | http     | html      | 552  |  2     |  28

Mozilla | file     | xml       | 552  | 11     |  38
Mozilla | file     | xhtml     | 552  | 11     |  38
Mozilla | file     | html      | 552  |  2     |  26

IE6     | http     | xml       | 552  |  5     | 544
IE6     | http     | xhtml     | **** can't run ****
IE6     | http     | html      | 552  |  4     |  63

IE6     | file     | xml       | 552  |  5     | 542
IE6     | file     | xhtml     | 552  |  5     | 542
IE6     | file     | html      | 552  |  4     |  60

Note the differences due to comparison of file based urls and http based 
urls and the differences due to case sensitivity between xml, xhtml and 
html in Mozilla.

Note that this is on the version of the tests I posted last evening
which includes a change to build.xml to place the xhtml dtds in the
files/ directory where they can be located by validating parsers.

See attached zip file for the error logs.
