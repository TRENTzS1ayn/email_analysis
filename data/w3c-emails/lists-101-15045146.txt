Rick,

Are you running the version from CVS?

I combined and compared our two different results and have attached as 
combined-results.txt.

I noticed that the signature of assertURIEquals in DOMTestCase.js is:

assertURIEquals(assertID,scheme,path,host,file,query,fragment,isAbsolute,actual)

and the call in my HTMLAnchorElement04.html is
 
assertURIEquals("hrefLink",null,null,null,"submit.gif",null,null,null,null,vhref);

which do not agree on the number of arguments and which explains a 
number of the errors that I am seeing such as

HTMLAnchorElement04 failed  "hrefLink" Expected not to be null

So, either my version of the transform to create the test is out of date 
or I broke it during editing.

Can someone who understands the transforms better look to see why mine 
has the extra parameter in the call to assertURIEquals?

Bob
