It should be possible to run the ECMAScript tests on a different or 
custom test framework with an adaption layer and little no changes to 
the generated tests.  The Java tests initially supported multiple test 
frameworks (JUnit and Avalon), but since Avalon was abandoned by ASF 
there hasn't been any continuing effort to support multiple test frameworks.

I haven't been able to run JSUnit on Palm's Web Browser 2.0 emulator on 
Windows and was thinking that might require doing a stripped down test 
runner.  The Internet Explorer 5.5 for Windows CE looked like it might 
be able to run JSUnit as is if you increased the timeouts substantially.

The layout of JSUnit on Palm's Web Browser 2.0 is pretty bad.  See 
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/jsunit/message/157 for setup instructions.

I believe both JSUnit 1.3.3 and Bob's version have a annoying problem 
around line 293 of JsUnitCore.js that raised an exception when 
displaying the test files in the browser.  The following change will 
avoid the problem.

-if (top.xbDEBUG.on && top.testManager)
+if (top.xbDEBUG != null && top.xbDEBUG.on && top.testManager)

Earlier adapters for MSXML did "adapt" for COM exceptions as did the 
original NIST JavaScript test suite.  Per discussions on the list from 
last year (or before), that adaptation was removed.

The only remaining "adaption" for MSXML is to remove the processing 
instruction used to represent the XML declaration.  Using PI's to 
represent the XML declaration was stated to be acceptible by the WG. 
However, since only MSXML displays the behavior to my knowledge and it 
would add a great deal of complexity to a lot of tests to adapt for this 
behavior, the simplest way to address the issue is just to have the 
loader remove it.

I'll double check, but I don't believe there any remaining sniffing.

Would be great to have JSUnit and DOM TS support the new PDA browsers. 
I've done a little exploration, but it might require some vendor support 
too.

I know that the Konqueror team has been able to run the test suite, but 
I haven't been able to get Konqueror 3.1 on SuSE 8.0 to run it.  It 
would be great if they could provide pointers to getting things set up.

I hope to have an iteration into the CVS in a few hours.
