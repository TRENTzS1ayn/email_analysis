I've updated test-to-jsunit.xsl, test-to-ecmascript.xsl and 
DOMTestCase.js.  At the current point, the alltests.html when loaded 
directly in the browser will give you a form for parser selection and 
settings, a combo box of the test suite or test to be run and a list of 
tests that are not compatible with the current settings.

I've only tested DOM L1 core and alltests.html as an overview page using 
Mozilla on Win XP.  I suspect that most tests will run individually and 
that other tests suites and browsers will probably work, I don't have 
any confidence that alltests.html will currently work as a JSUnit test 
suite definition, and I know that the overview page does not properly 
initialize JSUnit.
