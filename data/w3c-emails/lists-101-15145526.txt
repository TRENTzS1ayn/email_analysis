I've just committed changed to test-to-jsunit.xsl, DOMTestSuite.js and 
DOMTestCase.js that can now configure JSUnit to use either an IFrame, 
the Mozilla document.load() method or MSXML3 or 4.  Functional on 
Mozilla 1.3 and IE 6 on Windows using file system.  Opera on Windows 
fails (complains about loading "file:///file:///", might work from net 
server).

I tweaked a few of the hc_* tests that had been creating elements and 
attributes that were not valid HTML element names.
