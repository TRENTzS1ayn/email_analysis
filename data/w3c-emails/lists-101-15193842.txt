I've just created the infrastructure for a DOM L3 Core test suite and 
committed one trivial test (impl.hasFeature("XML", "3.0") == true).  If 
anyone has DOM L3 Core tests in progress or ready to submit, please let 
the list know.  Unless there is some significant contribution coming, 
I'll try to add a few tests every couple of days.
