I've made an update the JUnit part of the DOMUNIT subproject to enable testing of the Oracle XML Parser and the Batik DOM implementation.  This will probably be the final "release" based on my personal translation of the NIST tests to JUnit.  The files can be downloaded from http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=8114&release_id=36555

Xerces-J 1.4.0 and the CVS version of Crimson pass all the NIST tests.  Xerces fails my experimental events tests since the release version expects DocumentEvent.createEvent("Event") not ("Events").  You can run just the official NIST tests by using net.sourceforge.xmlconf.domunit.dom1.nist.NISTDOM1Test as the main class.

Batik still has a lot of test failures, primarily due to not maintaining DTD information.  I haven't confirmed that all the DOM issues that I reported before the Batik 1.0 release were fixed.

The tests are pretty easy to run.  If you have a JAXP compatible parser in your classpath or have Xerces, Crimson or XML4J in the same directory, you can just run 

java -jar domunit.jar

If you want to run the Oracle V2 parser, you need a JAXP implementation (either jaxp.jar or xerces.jar) in the classpath or current directory and then

java -Djavax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory=net.sourceforge.xmlconf.domunit.OracleDocumentBuilderFactory

To run Batik, you need some subset of the Batik jars (there are now like 10 of them and I'm not sure what subset is necessary) in the same directory and a JAXP compatible SAX parser (xerces.jar or jaxp.jar + crimson.jar)

java -Djavax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory=net.sourceforge.xmlconf.domunit.BatikDocumentBuilderFactory

The output will document 5 or so switches that allow you to test ignoring whitespace, validating, expanding enities, etc.
