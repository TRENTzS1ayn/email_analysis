I've added targets to build.xml which will allow schema validation of 
tests using Xerces-J, for example, dom3-ls-schema-validate-tests.  I had 
been using MSV to validate the tests.  I had to make changes to 
dom-to-xsd since MSV accepted schemas that Xerces-J flagged as violating 
schema constraints.

I also added targets (dom1-gump, dom2-gump, dom3-gump) that generate the 
DTD and schema for the corresponding level, validate the tests against 
both and generate the jars.  I'm following up with Stefan Bodewig to see 
if we can get added to Gump's (http://jakarta.apache.org/gump) automated 
build system, so that build breakages get flagged early.
