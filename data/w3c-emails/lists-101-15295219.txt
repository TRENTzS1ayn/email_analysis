No, but I knew that this would need to be added since this was a change 
to the production rules.   The plan was to add a test and then fix the 
production.

Boolean.TRUE is way too much of a Java-ism.  Write it as expected="true" 
and I'll make sure the transform and infrastructure do the right thing.

There is no construct currently to do this.  If really necessary, we can 
add one.  Maybe something like:

<assertDOMException>
     <AllowableCodes>
            <INDEX_SIZE_ERR/>
            <NO_MODIFICATION_ERR/>
     </AllowableCodes>
     <someStatement/>
</assertDOMException>


Do you have any plans to commit these tests?
