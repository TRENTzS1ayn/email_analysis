Attached is a sample test for isElementContentWhitespace.  Hope it helps.
(See attached file: textiselementcontentwhitespace02.xml)

Attached is a sample test case for getParameter.  A variable of type
DOMUserData
is being used to store and verify the returned value of this method.

(See attached file: domconfigurationgetparameter01.xml)

Would be nice to have a construct like this.  Attached is a test that can
result in different DOMExceptions.

(See attached file: nodereplacechild01.xml)

Yes I plan to commit these, hopefully in the next few weeks.


Thanks for your help,
Neil.

No, but I knew that this would need to be added since this was a change
to the production rules.   The plan was to add a test and then fix the
production.

Boolean.TRUE is way too much of a Java-ism.  Write it as expected="true"
and I'll make sure the transform and infrastructure do the right thing.

There is no construct currently to do this.  If really necessary, we can
add one.  Maybe something like:

<assertDOMException>
     <AllowableCodes>
            <INDEX_SIZE_ERR/>
            <NO_MODIFICATION_ERR/>
     </AllowableCodes>
     <someStatement/>
</assertDOMException>


Do you have any plans to commit these tests?
