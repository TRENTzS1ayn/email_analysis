I entered and resolved three bugs (bug 378-380) that should allow the 
tests in Neil's message of 11/13 to compile.  DOMUserData did not appear 
in the enumeration of known datatypes in the DTD and schema, 
test-to-java did not reflect the new production for attributes starting 
with 'is' and assertTrue could not accept variable of type Object.  I 
have not added a construct for exceptions where the code to be returned 
is ambiguous.
