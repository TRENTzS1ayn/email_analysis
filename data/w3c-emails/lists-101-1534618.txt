Thanks for pointing this out, Curt. I had no idea about Monday being a
holiday. 

Obviously the telcon will be scheduled sometime after that, then. Please let
me get back to the list with details as soon as I have a more definite grip
on how many people there will be. I do not expect us to be more than 10
people, since not that many have commucatied interest.

Just in case, please Be aware that Monday is a 
significant legal holiday in the US.

Here is are some of the issues that I know of:

1. Use of Java binding like accessors and mutators

I'll update the schema to use IDL like accessors and mutators.
There will be some loss of constraint checking but the number
of read-write properties is small.

2. No mechanism for in-line metadata

I would suggest either adding to the content model of <test>,
<suite> and the assertions either a <metadata> element with
a very permissive content model or a <rdf:RDF> element.
However, with the acknowledgement that external metadata
is expected and that in-line metadata should be reserved
for (relatively) fixed metadata (for example, author or source,
not test results for a particular processor)

3. Test packaging

Suite definition is currently supported by placing test
definitions within <suite> elements.  Preferable to 
have tests as independent XML documents.  I propose
defining <suite> with <test href=".."/> children as
an interim approach but think that we might eventually use EARL
to define test packaging.

4. Identifying test documents

I had defined a <document> element to provide some
mechanism for indirection, however that is definitely
inadequate.  I propose switching <load> back to using
a URI to identify the test document but
with the expectation that a mechanism
outside of the test definition (RDDL?) would be used to
resolve the test URI to an local resource.

5. Lack of usable XML schemas for DCMES and EARL

The XML schema for DCMES seems pretty strange on
a quick read and I'm pretty sure that it is not valid.
I don't know of an XML Schema for EARL.  There is
an (non-normative) XML Schema for RDF on the schema 
home page.

6. Lack of visibility (at least from outside the DOM WG)

I haven't seen the existing XSLT transform for
Java and ECMAScript.  I assume they are against the NIST
DTD and maybe against the NIST testing framework.

Since I'm spending a good deal of personal time on this,
it would be good to have some idea that I'm not replicating
work that is already going on.  It would be very helpful
if people could publicly state at least what they are
thinking about working on or need for their continued
progress.

7. Coordination with XML Schema test development

I've pinged the xmlschema-dev list to see if
they could share their approach to test metadata.
