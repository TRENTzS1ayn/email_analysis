If you have been developing tests for inclusion in the DOM L3 test suite 
that have not been added to the public CVS, could you please send a 
message to www-dom-ts (preferrably) or w3c-dom-ig indicating the nature 
of the tests and any issues that need to be resolved before they are 
committed.

Hopefully, we can get any existing private tests into the CVS in fairly 
short order and then start walking through the spec and filling in 
additional tests.  If there is anything that I can do to help, please 
let me know.
