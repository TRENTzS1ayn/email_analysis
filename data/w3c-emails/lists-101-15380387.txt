We have a couple of DOM L3 Core, test cases written to conform to the
DOMTSML for possible future inclusion in the DOM L3 test suite.  Some of
these have to be updated and some probably need to be added in order to be
in-sync with the latest L3 Core Working Draft.  Support to write tests for
new interfaces such as TypeInfo, DOMConfiguration, DOMErrorHandler, etc.,
and testing XML schema instances has probably been added, right?  Other
issues that might have to be addressed include selectively running tests
with XML1.1/Namespaces1.1 documents, testing optional DOMConfiguration
parameters, etc.

Thanks,
Neil Delima / IBM / Toronto

If you have been developing tests for inclusion in the DOM L3 test suite
that have not been added to the public CVS, could you please send a
message to www-dom-ts (preferrably) or w3c-dom-ig indicating the nature
of the tests and any issues that need to be resolved before they are
committed.

Hopefully, we can get any existing private tests into the CVS in fairly
short order and then start walking through the spec and filling in
additional tests.  If there is anything that I can do to help, please
let me know.
