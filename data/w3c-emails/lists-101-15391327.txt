If these could be added to the CVS in their present state in the near 
future, I would be happy to get and keep them in synch.  If they can't 
be added shortly, I will start developing tests and I might 
substantially duplicate one of your existing tests which wouldn't be the 
worst thing in the world.

I'd expect to that we would need to add DOMTS language elements for each 
caller supplied interface in the drafts (along the lines of EventMonitor 
in the DOM L2 events tests which implements EventListener).  However, 
these have not been added yet and I would assume they would be developed 
concurrently with the tests that would use them.

After the last teleconference, I'm pretty confident that there will be a 
mechanism to disable XML 1.1 specific tests for implementations that 
only support XML 1.0.  I'm not sure that there is a similar mechanism 
for Namespaces 1.1.
