I've closed all three bugs as fixed.  One was a stray attribute in the 
build.xml file, another was an description that was not consistent with 
the body of the the test.

The third bug, http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=261, 
involved hc_nodeinsertbefore.xml which was a transliteration of the 
XML-specific test nodeinsertnode.xml.  The setup of the test depended on 
the preservation of the whitespace between the p and em elements in the 
following fragment:

 <p>
  <em>EMP0002</em>

XML processors and Mozilla's HTML implementation would preserve the 
whitespace node, Konqueror and IE would eliminate the whitespace node.  
I've changed the test so it not affected by elimination of the 
whitespace node.

If eliminating the whitespace node should be considered non-conformant, 
then a distinct test should be written to check for the behavior.  
However, it would appear to be a reasonable application-specific 
optimization of the content.
