HTML does handle whitespaces differently though. Konqueror and IE might
use their HTML parser to load the XHTML. It might be a media type issue
actually: if the XHTML document is parsed as "application/xhtml+xml"
then the implementation must follow the rules of XML. If the document is
parsed as "text/html", then HTML must followed. If the document is
loaded from the disk, it does not have a media type, so Mozilla,
Konqueror and IE are not wrong.
