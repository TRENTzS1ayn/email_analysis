I updated the releases for the DOM Tests Suite before the publications
of the DOM Level 3 (Core and LS) Recommendations this week:
http://www.w3.org/DOM/Test/#releases

DOM Level 3 Core doesn't seem to run at all on IE or Mozilla. Mozilla
reports "Unrecognized schemaValidating attribute".

Please, report other troubles on this list,

Philippe
