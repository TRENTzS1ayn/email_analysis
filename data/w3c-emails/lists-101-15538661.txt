Yes, that's why 'expected' is of type Collection rather than List. When 
compared with a Collection, order is irrelevant.

(This was the assumption I made for the Python test runner, anyway - I 
haven't seen any definitive TSML docs on this.)

Attributes do not have a position (fixed ordering) in the DOM spec in 
any case, so it would be acceptable (if not generally likely) for an 
implementation to return different item(0) values for a NamedNodeMap and 
its clone.
