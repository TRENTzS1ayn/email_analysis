Curt,

In an attempt to determine which way to go, we 
are trying to use your schema to describe 
some of our tests -- could you post an example 
of how to describe a DOMException?  Are you 
currently doing any work on a transformation?

  Sorry -- I forgot the files -- here they are:

  node.xml  -- NIST Node tests
  generate.xsl -- transformation
  node.java -- generated tests
