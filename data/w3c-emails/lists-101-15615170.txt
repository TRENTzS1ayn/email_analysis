I'm in the process of attempting to harmonize the L1 and L2 HTML test 
suites.  Most of the tests in L2 HTML are functional duplicates of L1 
HTML tests.  However, a few are intentionally different to reflect 
changes from L1 to L2 and a few are unintentionally different where an 
issue was addressed in one of the other of the suites (usually L2) but 
not reflected in the other.

I'm currently removing any L2 test that is a functional duplicate and 
resolving any unintentional differences.  When finished (several days 
away), the tests/level2/html will only contain tests that test 
functionality specific to L2 HTML.  Since the L1 and L2 Java interfaces 
differ, I suspect that I will produce the tests/level1/html tests into 
the L2 test suite, but at least there won't be duplicate sources.

After that harmonization is complete, then I'll start working through 
the HTML issues.
