I have been working on a rewrite to the ECMAScript binding for the DOM 
TS. This rewrite changes the front-end test selection to provide finer 
control over parser configuration and test selection as well as improves 
the ability of Opera and Konqueror to run the test suites. Opera and 
Konqueror can now run tests using either HTML or XHTML content types. It 
should also be relatively easy to add new Loaders/Parsers.

Please visit <http://dom-ts.bclary.com/Read-Me-First.html> for more 
information in general and 
<http://dom-ts.bclary.com/ecmascript/js_docs_out/overview-tree.html> for 
JavaDocs on the new DocumentLoader implementations and related code.

General or specific feedback on this approach would be much appreciated 
as well as feedback on how well particular browsers are supported.

This has been tested using recent Mozilla builds(WinXP, SuSe9),MSIE6 
(WinXP), Opera 7.23 (WinXP/SuSe9) and Konqueror 3.1.4 (SuSe9).
