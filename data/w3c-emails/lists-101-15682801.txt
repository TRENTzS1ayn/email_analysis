Our first nag from Gump.  These will be sent with my return address but 
originate with one of the Gump build machines.  The first attempt at 
the automated build failed since dom3-events.jar was mispelled as 
dom3-evants.jar.  I've fixed that in the CVS but I do not know if that 
means that we have failed the publically available nightly build or if 
this nag was from one of the early warning machines.

When it does start to work nightly builds can be found at 
http://jakarta.apache.org/gump.
