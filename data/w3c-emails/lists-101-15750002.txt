I've added 23 tests for DOMImplementationRegistry under bug 463.  This 
required adding <DOMImplementationRegistry.newInstance/> to the 
framework to provide access to an instance DOMImplementationRegistry and 
some tweaking of the transforms.  I've run the tests under Xerces-J, but 
I would appreciate any feedback from other implementers on these tests 
and the previously mentioned TypeInfo tests.
