Hello,

I'm trying to understand how tests like entitygetentityname (L1 Core test)
are supposed to be run in browsers. By default they seem to be skipped
because
./DOMTestCase.js:       throw "Tests using staff or nodtdstaff are not supported by HTML processors";

However it seems that by selecting a specific implementation (apparently this is done
by adding e.g. '?implementation=mozilla' to the URL for testRunner.html), one can
use a proper XML-loader ("builder"). But when I do that, it fails because
MozillaXMLBuilder.prototype.hasFeature isn't implemented. This looks like a bug.

If I copy the hasFeature function from another builder (e.g. the MSXML one),
then I can use the mozilla builder, which works for Konqueror as well,
now that it implements document.load().

OK, so this could have been a bug report, but I also wanted to inform you
that the "mozilla" builder works for Konqueror/KHTML (after adding the
missing function).
