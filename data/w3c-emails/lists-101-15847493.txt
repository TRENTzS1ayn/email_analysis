I've just committed some substantial changes for the ECMAScript 
framework.  This is still a work-in-progress, but  I've tested these 
changes with Internet Explorer 6, MSXML 3 and Mozilla 1.6 for the L1 
Core test suite and it seems to work okay.  I will be checking other 
implementations after I synch my other machines.

I've added support for some of the new features in JSUnit 2.0, like 
autorun and test result submission.  I've also added an option to 
bypass precondition checking.  If you uncheck "Skip incompatible 
tests", tests that are expected to fail due to missing features or 
incompatible configuration parameters will be run anyway.

The "DOM 3 LS" option, unlike earlier versions, will follow the 
forthcoming rec.  At the current time, it is incomplete and I would 
expect it to fail.
