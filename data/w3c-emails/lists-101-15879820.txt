Both of the recent Gump messages are now fixed.  Two tests in the L1 
HTML suite (object08 and object13) failed Java compilation due to 
defining 'doc' as 'Node' instead of 'Document'.  It is a weakness of 
test-to-java which doesn't show up in the generated ECMAScript.  One 
test in L2 Core failed validation because it did not define a return 
variable to removeNamedItemNS, however code generation works fine 
without it.
