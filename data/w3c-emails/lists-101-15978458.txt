Triggered by Ian's message, I added JTidy validation to check that all 
generated HTML appears to be valid HTML.  I've also done spot checks of 
some of the generated documents with http://validator.w3c.org without 
issue.

There were a whole litany of little things that were tweaked.  The most 
obvious is that all the HTML producing XSL transforms now specify 
doctype-public, doctype-system and encoding and include a <meta> tag 
specifying the encoding.  The test matrix generation probably needed 
the most fixes.  There were a couple of LS tests that had example 
markup in the description that ended up looking like real-markup in the 
generated test and some of the LS tests that have markup in strings 
were serialized using "<"'s instead of &lt;'s.

I'll raise the issue of HTML compliance on the JSUnit mailing list to 
see if they can clean up some of the issues on the testRunner and 
supporting code.
