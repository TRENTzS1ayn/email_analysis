I've updated the DOM L1 Core, L2 Core, HTML and Events with a modified 
version of JSUnit that should valid HTML 4.01.  While making those 
fixes I stumbled across the reason why test documents were never 
reported as loaded when running the test suite from Opera and have 
changed the test suite to use a different mechanism to accomplish that 
goal.  See bug 600 for details.

p.s. Opera, like several of the Mac versions, does require running the 
tests from an HTTP server and not off the local file system due to some 
issue in JSUnit's handling of file URL's.
