I logged this on the Mozilla Bugzilla this morning, 
http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=238005 and it looks like 
they have a fix in process.   I was aware that it caused Mozilla to 
crash and should have mentioned it in message, but it was late.  
HTMLSelectElement20 was one of the new tests that I added in Bug 596 to 
hit all the untested methods and attributes in L2 HTML.
