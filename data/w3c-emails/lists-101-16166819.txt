I've updated the "nightlies" at 
http://homepage.mac.com/curt.arnold/FileSharing1.html.

The major new feature is are self-hosted HTML and XHTML versions of the 
a subset of the tests to go along with the earlier self-hosted SVG 
tests.  Self-hosting requires that the test either not load any files 
or only load the same HTML compatible test file.  The self-hosted tests 
run on several browsers that can't run the JSUnit hosted tests, 
particular IE:mac, Safari, Konqueror, and Palm Web Browser 2.0.  (The 
Palm web browser can only run individual tests, but will stall trying 
to load the test index.)

To run the self-hosted tests, open the alltests.[x]html in 
self-hosted/[x]html/level[n]/[module].  Clicking a link will load the 
test document in the second frame which will immediately run a script 
and replace its contents with a test report.  If you start logging, run 
some tests, and click end logging, the third frame will be filled with 
a test report that can be cut and pasted to produce an XML file 
compatible with the JUnit xml reports.

Here is a quick summary of my experience running the tests:

Galeon 1.2.8 runs JSUnit, Self-hosted HTML
Amaya 7.2: fails all
Opera 6.0.3 Linux: runs Self-hosted HTML
Konqueror 3.2.0: runs Self-hosted HTML
Firefox 0.8: Runs all
Mozilla 1.7b: Runs all (Windows will crash on L2 HTML suite, fix in 
progress)

IE 5.0 for MacOS 9: Runs Self-hosted HTML
IE 5.2.3 for Mac OS/X: Runs self-hosted HTML
Omniweb 5.0b: Runs JSUnit and self-hosted HTML
Opera 7.5 for mac: Runs self-hosted HTML and JSUnit, but JSUnit results 
do not successful post to server
Safari 1.2.1: Runs Self-hosted HTML

IE 6: Runs all three
Opera 7.2 for Windows: Runs JSUnit and self-hosted HTML

Palm Web Browser 2: Runs individual self-hosted HTML tests, but will 
stall loading alltests.html
