The self-hosted in SVG stuff is definitely experimental and I would 
appreciate problem reports.  I have been able to run individual tests 
in Batik but only able to run in Adobe SVG after manually hacking to 
add the test framework into the test document instead of using an 
entity reference.  Because of the manual nature of running the 
self-hosted tests, I have not attempted to run all the tests and expect 
that there are some failures due to framework or production problems.  
With KSVG's integration with Konqueror, I assume that you are able to 
browse to the test directory and see a whole bunch of green and red 
thumbnails.

Any test that depends on the total count of elements in the document 
has a high likelihood of problems since the self-hosted tests depend on 
inserting script elements into the document that don't appear in the 
documents for the additional test suite.

Tests that load more than one document (typically to try to induce 
WRONG_DOCUMENT_ERR's or the like) are problematic for the self-hosted 
tests.  If the document URL's were identical, the documents returned on 
the subsequent calls to load were clones of the initial document.  If 
the URL's don't match, then the tests should be skipped.

The Bugzilla for the DOM TS should be used to log problems with the 
test suite or the productions (http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public).  I 
haven't seen any traffic on the TS mailing list for quite a while, but 
I haven't send anything myself.  If this doesn't hit the mailing list, 
I'll follow up with the W3C staff.
