Adding XPath API to the DOM seems like a sensible way of offering querying 
facilities.

We've created a DOM and an XPath implementation and there seems to be a good 
fit.

There are however differences in the tree model which is used by XPath and DOM, 
f.i. concerning NamespaceNodes.

To get this thing going I would suggest that we first setup the requirements 
based on the dom issues and opportunties list. 

    http://www.w3.org/DOM/Group/level_3_issues.html

It would be interesting to know the granularity needs for an API like this.
We do f.i. store parsed and optimized queries which are accessable for 
execution, which gives performance advantages, although this can be left to the 
implementation without disturbing too much.

I will make an inventory on the differences we've encountered when we did the 
implementations. I would like to hear the same from others working on similar 
projects.

I'm definitely interested in bringing this api to DOM level 3.


Best regards,


Jeroen
