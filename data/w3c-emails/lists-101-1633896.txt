I'm really got to get to real work having been up way too late last night.

I guess part of the issue comes from the expectations that were raised by text in the invitation that said that the framework and tests were going to be publically developed. In my mind, that means there should be freedom to discuss shortcomings and alternative formulations before a particular path is locked in.

I mentioned some (but not all of the issues I had with the NIST DTD) of http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom-ts/2001May/0006.html.  The responses seemed like we were talking past each other, It didn't seem like others were getting my points and I wasn't getting theirs.  Building the schema was an attempt to help crystalize my thoughts on the issues and to try to more clearly communicate what I envisioned.

On visibility, I wasn't trying to throw stones at NIST or Dimitris, since they have been about the only other people discussing things on the mailing list.  However, some of Dimitris comments have hinted that there are others doing significant work and making significant decisions outside of public view.
