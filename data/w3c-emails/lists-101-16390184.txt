In case this is not generally known:

// get all records
var numbers =
data.queryNodes("//Record[Name='"+WScript.Arguments(1)+"']/Phone");

translates into:

// get all records
var numbers =
data.selectNodes("//Record[Name='"+WScript.Arguments(1)+"']/Phone");

in the current MSXML implementation.

The example also exposes another problem that has been discussed recently:
this code will fail if WScript.Arguments(1) contains an apostrophe. That's
why I think that a well-defined API should allow to bind values to
variables, and to reference these variables just like in XSLT.
