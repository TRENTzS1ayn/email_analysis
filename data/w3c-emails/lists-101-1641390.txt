Relationships with tests yet to be developed.  Results of
processors against the test.

I'm hopeful.  If there is not responce to the public query, I'll asj Henry Thompson, though I would prefer to avoid adding anything to his personal burden since I'm sure either he knows the answer or at least the right contact person.
