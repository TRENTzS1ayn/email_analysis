I guess what I was trying to say is, let's list any clear use cases,
both to give the idea of having xPath *officially* in DOM as much
support as possible, and also so we can see if any of the use cases make
any difference to any of the possible design decisions which would have
to be taken by an official W3C rec.

So am I right in saying that what you want to do is track your user's
navigation of some kind of tree-structured XML display, both to navigate
it as easily as possible at run-time, and also because you can build an
xPath expression that can be kept as a bookmark for later re-use. And
that without xPath you would have to do more work to track your user's
tree-navigation, and you would also have to design, implement and debug
a way of storing that string of DOM navigation steps in such a way that
it could be re-played later?

Sounds to me like a pretty compelling argument that not having xPath
available would require you to re-invent most of the xPath wheel.

I hadn't loaded it up - there is also (or was - no response right now)
XPathDOM from http://www.falconwing.com/~schen/, and, as Julian Reschke
points out, the selectNodes() method in MSXML. Oracle also appears to
have gone with selectNodes().

Which I think at least establish that XPath is going to get implemented
in or on DOM, in standard or non-standard ways.
