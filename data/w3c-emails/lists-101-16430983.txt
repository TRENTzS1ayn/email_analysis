I think the first order of bussiness might be to discuss whether or not
XPath should have an API at all.  XPath is meant to be a normative,
abstract, standard, above XPointer, XSLT, and XML Query (hopefully).  Maybe
what people really need is an XML Query API or an XPointer API.  If it's an
XML Query API, it's way early to be discussing this.  On the other hand,
XML Query and XPointer don't really return the result of a random
expression, like "2+2".  So I dunno.

I would really *not* like to see something like getNodes(XPath expression)
as a method on Node.  DOM2 is already way too bloated.
