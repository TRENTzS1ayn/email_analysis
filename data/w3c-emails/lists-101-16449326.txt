 Are there any other features from XSLT which are key to the
     successsful use of XPath?

Now that is a key question.
I've used xpath/xslt quite regardless of which I am using,
in an XSLT stylesheet.

I'm sure I'm going to come to a point where I want something
from XSLT... unless the editors have out-thought us all :-)
Which is quite possible!

Can anyone think of anything immediately?
Perhaps the mulberrytech quick reference card is a good
starting place. It does id the functions.
document() key format-number current generate-id (damn, I could
have used that) system-property (good candidate for use? Or not
necessary since we could operate from java with good access to
system properties anyway) element-available and function-available.

From a brief scan, all other stuff seems to be focussed on the
output side.

My only candidate then would be generate-id(), and this only
to provide an identifier for a particular node, which I'm sure
could be done some other way.
Is there anything in dom2 that does this sort of thing?
(From memory, there is a function which gets a hash code isn't there?
I don't have the DOM docs to hand)
