     I hadn't loaded it up - there is also (or was - no response right now)

I have code to make that perform from the command line, just wanted
something to get my head round. The author is moving towards the use
of dom2 as per apache, but I couldn't grock the compile to I reverted
to the older way.


     XPathDOM from http://www.falconwing.com/~schen/, and, as Julian Reschke
     points out, the selectNodes() method in MSXML. Oracle also appears to
     have gone with selectNodes().

url is familiar (who's the author?)


     Which I think at least establish that XPath is going to get implemented
     in or on DOM, in standard or non-standard ways.

Reasonable conclusion.

A minor concern. If I have a 'large' document, dom falls down on smaller
systems, but what happens with a large document on a mediocre system
in terms of performance? Is there any data on that? Is that where the
DB based document starts to take over, with the same interface, but a
different realisation. Can I search a 10Mb db using xpath quicker than
I can search an in-memory version of the same document?

Just curious (today :-)
