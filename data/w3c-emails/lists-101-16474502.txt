     So, what is wrong with the proposal
     
        NodeList getNodesByXPath(DOMString xpathExpression)
     
     as a standard DOM method?
     
     The objections I've heard are:
     
     - The result shouldn't be a NodeList
     - We should allow other query languages than XPath
     
     Discussion?

its inadequate in one sense, overkill in others.

Overkill insomuch as:
Any such function could return object, from which
its type could be determined. 
inadequate in that it may return any one of the xpath
object types (I think).

The boolean test is an obvious example.

Its this I'm pondering at the moment. 
And I can't see anything obvious.

But yes Scott, I do want 'an api' to 
either a query lang, xpointer or 'something'.
If it does what I want, fine.
DOM is questionably imperfect, but adequate today.

Part of the DOM? No need, if I can 'call on' the 
standard dom api as and when needed. I think java
permits that doesn't it?
