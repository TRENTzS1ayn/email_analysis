Adding an XPath API as another *optional* chapter of the DOM spec, similar
to the way the new DOM Level 2 chapters were handled (e.g., Traversal,
Range, etc.), seems like a good compromise. This way DOM implementations
that want to optimize the API internally can, while others are free to
ignore it. As with the others, hasFeature can be use to query for the API.

It seems like we need to decide on where it should go before discussing what
it looks like since it definitely has impact on the result.
