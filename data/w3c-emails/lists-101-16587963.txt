Aha! I think we all agree on this ... and the main reason the DOM WG had
little interest in the XPath extensions is because most think it really
should be someone else's baby.  BUT the Query WG is at least a year or so
away from a Recommendation, and no WG is currently working on XPath (that I
know of), so the choices now are a) nothing happens for a year and we all
hope that the Query WG does what we want; b) the DOM defines an XPath
extension; or c) some ad-hoc group proposes an interim "standard" (a la SAX,
perhaps) and encourages vendors to support it.  I think this mailing list is
considering b) vs c) ... and a) is the default, I guess.
