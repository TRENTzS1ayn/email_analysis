Links to pertinent archive email messages discussing the test.
Relationships with tests yet to be developed.  Results of
processors against the test.

No, but still hopeful.

I'm hopeful.  If there is not responce to the public query, I'll asj Henry
Thompson, though I would prefer to avoid adding anything to his personal
burden since I'm sure either he knows the answer or at least the right
contact person.  I think it is more likely that they haven't, but it might
be a good idea to use it or at least watch us try.
