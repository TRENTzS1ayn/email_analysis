c) is possible, if care is applied.  a) is preferable to b), in my opinion.
I would rather see "dozens of proprietary interfaces that all do the same
thing" for a year, than one "standard" interface on the DOM that we have to
live with forever and ever.  But I would rather see c).  The ad-hoc group
can be this mailing list, with members from XLink/XPointer, XML Query, DOM,
and XSL, keeping in mind that this is a stop-gap API, and it does not have
to be built into or directly part of the DOM API.  Perhaps we could think
of an limited XPath API in terms of base interfaces that will form the
foundation for a  XML Query API, and a XPointer API... in other words, in
the long run, the XPath API won't be meant to be used by itself.  Don't
know if this makes any sense... just thinking out loud.

I think I agree with your analysis.

And unfortunately, the default will result in dozens of proprietary
interfaces that all do the same thing.
