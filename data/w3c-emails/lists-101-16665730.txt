If you're running an XPath query 2000 times, the parsing time (and
potential static optimization) for the query can be significant.

You can resolve the prefix with the DOM.  But that's not the problem.  The
XPath could well come from a different XML file.  The namespaces need to be
resolved from that tree, not the context node of the tree being queried.
