Cool.  This isn't so far from my thoughts, and much closer than having
methods directly on the Node object.

What might you add if it was a "complete API"?  Interfaces for the
structure so that tools could manipulate it?

Should this include function extensions?  (I would think yes).

Yeah, I would think this should belong to a full query API.

I think Java is fine.  But we should make sure a C++ API of some sort is
defined before we freeze, IMHO.

+1, adding extension bindings.

Why org.w3c.dom.xpath and not org.w3c.xpath??  (as per my previous mails).

I don't think this object can be multi-threaded without locking, is that
correct?  Might it be better to have a simpler XPath object to which a
XPathContext is handed in?

I don't understand the "If" postfix in the names.  I assume it has some
significance?
