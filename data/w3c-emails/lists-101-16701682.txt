1. As far as I understood form Mike, XPath support would be an
   option DOM module. So any new XPath methods would actually
   live on something like a NodeXPath interface rather than
   Node itself (cp. the other option modules in Level 2).

   In any case, the mere number of methods on an interface
   isn't a particularly interesting software design metric.

2. Allowing a DOM implementation to _optionally_ implement
   XPath itself opens up the possiblity for _significant_
   optimizations over what can be achieved via the exisiting
   public API. (Mike, maybe you should chip on how that might 
   pan out in the case of a DOM API to an XML database).

Cheers,


Miles
