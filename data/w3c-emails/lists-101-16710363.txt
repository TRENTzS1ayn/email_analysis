Whoa!

Is this in scope for this list? I didn't think we were
discussing an XPath API, I thought we were discussing a DOM
API for XPath queries?

Not that I'm against an XPath API as such (we've got a Java
specific one of our own), but for any such thing to have any 
chance of a W3C seal of approval, it *must* take the same tack 
as the DOM: ie. it must be language *independent*.

Cheers,


Miles
