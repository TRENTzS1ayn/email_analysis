So whose implementation will you cast to to get hold of those
optimized query hooks? Yours, obviously. But what about ours?
Jonathan and Mikes?; Suns? etc. etc.

And do you expect me to support _your_ implementation when for 
all I know you'll be changing those non-public query hooks from 
week to week?

Adding an XPath query API to the DOM allows optimized XPath
queries to be _portable_. That might not matter to you, but it
does to quite a few of us.

Cheers,


Miles
