Dear all

NIST will host the telephone conference Tuesday May 29, 1 pm eastern time.
Below you will find the connection details.

We've limited the maximum number of participants to 10 as I have received
only 5 requests to participate. To my knowledge, there are only 2 European
participants, so only 2 international lines have been reserved.

If the numbers are not correct, please contact me or Mary immediately so
that we can fix this.

I will send an email with the agenda during the day.

/Dimitris
