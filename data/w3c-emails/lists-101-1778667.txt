I've attached the following dtd components:

    CharacterData, Attr, Element, Text, Comment

Dimitris, you might want to take a look at how I was
able to inherit Node and CharacterData attributes
and methods -- in particular,

    Character, Attr, and Element inherit from Node
    Text, Comment inherit from CharacterData, which inherits from Node

If I get a chance, I'll move on to the extended interfaces -- I have not
done the following from fundamental:

        * DOMImplementation, Document, DocumentFragment
