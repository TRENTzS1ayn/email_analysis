Hi Jeroen,

The TSML will also have the capability to use complex if's, whiles, for's etc -- all the 
language constructs that you would expect, so I think that we will be able to cover 
your example sufficiently.  At the moment, we are discussing the DOM constructs 
and the issues related to them -- so you see a stripped-down version of what will be 
available.

  Hi, 

  Just back from Berlin, trying to catch up with the TS.
  After a quick read I understand that we are moving into a direction where interface methods are defined as Elements within the TS dtd.
  After a series of method calls a set of assertions are issued.

  With the limited knowledge I've got now from the DTD I'm trying to image how a test for a DOM L3 LS call would look like.

  example:

  void       writeNode(in DOMOutputStream destination, in Node node) raises(DOMSystemException);

  Would probably something like <DOMWriter.writeNode var="........
   
  One of the options for this DOM L3 call is Namespace fixup:

  true: Check namespace declarations and prefixes for consistency, and fix them in the serialized data if they are inconsistent.
  false: Perform no special checks on name space declarations, prefixes or URIs.
  default: true;
  supported values: true: required; false: required. 
   
  It seems to me that it could be difficult to check the result of this method by a set of asserts.
  Do you think it would be doable to test these kind of methods ?

  Regards,


  Jeroen
