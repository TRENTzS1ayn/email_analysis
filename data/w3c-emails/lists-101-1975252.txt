I've just realized that the tool that I was using to generate DTD from XML Schema is not expanding substitution groups, basically meaning that the DTD's I provided don't allow DOM properties or methods to appear within tests or assertions.

The property and method elements in the DTD are fine.  Tests, if, asserts, and for-each's are missing the meat of their content models.

I have updated the three sample tests from my previous sample.xml, http://home.houston.rr.com/curta/domtest/parentNodeNull.xml ,
http://home.houston.rr.com/curta/domtest/nodeListTraverseList.xml and
http://home.houston.rr.com/curta/domtest/characterDataIndexSizeSubstringNegativeOffset.xml
