Done, and attached as <<DOM-TS.rdf>>. Also find attached the Notation3
version as <<DOM-TS.n3>>. What I did was take a snippet of Curt's
Dublin Core version, and converted it as best I can into EARL. Note
that the Dublin Core stuff was intended as a very general
*vocabulary*, but not as a model for expressing evaluations, so
although it is O.K. to use Dublin Core terms in EARL, you can't use
them to express things such as "this is a test suite" or "somebody
asserts X", or "this fails/passes this", which is what EARL allows you
to do (i.e. EARL provides an evaluation mechanism, and a few terms,
which can be supplemented by Dublin Core , RDFS, FOAF, or whatever).

In this case, I've put "Arnold Curt says that this test suite passes
this ID in the DOM specification". You could change that to say that
"the DOM WG says that (x)" or even "Arnold Curt says that (x), and the
DOM WG say that (x)" or "the DOM WG say that (y), developed by Arnold
Curt, (x)", or anything else along those lines.
