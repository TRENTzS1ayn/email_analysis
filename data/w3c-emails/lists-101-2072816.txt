Actually, there is another possibility.  About a year or so ago, I did an
XML Schema "compiler" in XSLT that did all the inclusions, resolved all the
links, built all the substitution groups and produced a "compiled"
representation from which would could build code, documentation, or
conversions to other schema representations such as DTDs.  I've been asked
to revive that from time to time, potentially as a path from XML Schema to
Schematron.  I'm pretty sure that I could tweak the DTD generation to
represent named groups and substitution groups as parameter entities.  An
significantly out of date version is at
