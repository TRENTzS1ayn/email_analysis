Agenda (continuing
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom-ts/2001May/0038.html). 
1. Decision to be taken on whether we move toward one schema or keep two
separate.
2. Schema design: IDL interfaces instead of entities. DONE, both in Curt's
schema proposal and the DOM TS ML originating in the NIST DTD, Inheritance
(http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom-ts/2001May/0090.html), Removal
of non-ambigous interface names
(http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom-ts/2001May/0087.html)
3. Finalize the construct part of the schema
4. Finalize the schema(s)
5. Start working on architecture for submitting (CVS? What kind of issue
tracking system? Bugzilla? Feedback from W3C needed)
6. (Re)write stylesheets for the two default bindings: ECMA and JAVA, others
are welcome (Pending on final version of DOM TSML)
7. Produce reference documents to simplify test authoring. (see action on DD
below)
8. Motivation and Visibility
(http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom-ts/2001May/0057.html). Have we
improved this?

Other issues that have been raised and need to be discussed:
9. Metadata (feedback from RDF/EARL)
(http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom-ts/2001Apr/0057.html,
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom-ts/2001May/0017.html,
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom-ts/2001May/0099.html)
10. Suite design (should it include the XML test description? Point to
files?)
11. Test dependencies
(http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom-ts/2001Mar/0039.html)
12. Compatibility with the various XUnit frameworks, including roundtripping
(http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom-ts/2001Apr/0029.html)
13. Coordination with XML Schema test development. I've mailed Henry
Thompson and have gotten no reply. 

Pending action items: 
Test Matrix [dd]
Documentation [dd]
List of Semantic requirements (and information to interested submitters on
what tests we need) [mb]

I would propose that the person who has initiated the above threads be
prepared to briefly explain to the rest of the group the position expressed
and proposed action. 

Does anyone have anything else? Have I forgotten something?
