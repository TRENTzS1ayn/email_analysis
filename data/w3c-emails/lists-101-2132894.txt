XSDComp is not an an immediate solution to producing a usable DTD from the
schema.  Would be most expedient to recode my schema using named groups
instead of substitution groups to produce an usable DTD equivalent and then
look at options to develop an optimal DTD.  I can keep the
substitutionGroup's in case we eventual revert.
