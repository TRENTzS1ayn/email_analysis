Now I see what you mean. Should have understood it from your email.

Reported problems fixed. Thanks again.

My comments were not very clear, time for a second attempt:
- node-attrs: previousSibling seems to be missing in the node-attrs entity
definition (the "<!ENTITY % node-attrs" part)?
- node-attrs: appendChild seems to be included in both the node-attrs and
node-methods entity definitions?
- node-methods: insertBefore seems to be missing in the node-methods entity
definition?
- (minor) node-attrs: nodeType and nodeValue could be swapped in the
node-attrs entity definition as well to restore alphabetical order?

Regards, Freek

I forgot to include the DTD

previousSibling is actually there, defined last among the attributes
appendChild is indeed given as a method
insertBefore is there, fifth definition in node-methods
nodeType and nodeValue swapped to keep alphabetical order

I include the updated file.

Thanks for the report.

Hello Dimitris,

Just some small comments on the last version of the DTD you sent to the DOM
TS mailing list:
- node-attrs: previousSibling is missing?
- node-attrs: appendChild is a method, not an attribute?
- (minor) node-attrs: nodeType and nodeValue could be swapped to restore
alphabetical order?
- node-methods: insertBefore is missing?

I hope to have some time to read more of it, but maybe you could already
solve these small issues.
