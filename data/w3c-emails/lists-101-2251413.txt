Quoting Steven Boies: "Make it work. Make it good. Make it great."
Implied subtext: "In that order."

I do like the idea of tying the test suite langauge into other evolving
standards. But I'm slightly concerned that the time invested in doing so
could be time stolen from the most essential step, that being to make the
test suite actually function usefully.

Simply pulling together a reasonable test suite is tough. Making it
language-independent is tougher. If we gain some real leverage out of RDF
etc. that _reduces_ the effort involved, great. If we can't establish that
fairly quickly, I'd suggest going with something that works for now, and
searching for something more elegant as a secondary effort. We can always
do a stylesheet-assisted cutover to the fancier language later...

Just an uninformed personal reaction. Your milage may vary.
