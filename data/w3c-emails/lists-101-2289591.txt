I've posted an XSLT transform and a generated XML Schema from the DOM 1 xml sources at http://home.houston.rr.com/curta/domtest/genschema.zip   It is really fresh and only superficially checked.  I executed the transform with SAXON 6.2.2.

It should be pretty easy to generate both XML Schema and DTD's from the DOM specs XML sources and so eliminate the need for XML Schema to DTD conversion.  However, I started with XML Schema first, as always.

The transform isn't smart enough yet to handle an read-write property name that has different types in different uses or methods with different calling signatures in different uses.

I've not tried the transform against the level 2 sources, but I did take a quick look at them.  There were a couple of issues, first the directory entries in the xml-sources.zip file contained "..", for example, one file was named "..\..\..\pubtext\xmlspec-v21-dom.dtd".   This requires you to unpack to a directory at least 3 levels deep.  It would also be helpful to know what parameters can accept a null string or node.
