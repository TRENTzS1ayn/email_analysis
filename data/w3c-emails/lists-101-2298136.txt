Thanks, Curt
 
It looks really good. 
 
The schema which is generated contains a few minor flaws (on first brief
reading) that I'll look into and post back.
 
So, action item 1 can be checked as soon as we santiycheck to XSL and
introduce a mechanism to run against all xml files: presently we get the
logic iterated with each interface.
 
Again, really good.

?mne: First pass at generated schema for DOM 1 + HTML


I've posted an XSLT transform and a generated XML Schema from the DOM 1 xml
sources at http://home.houston.rr.com/curta/domtest/genschema.zip   It is
really fresh and only superficially checked.  I executed the transform with
SAXON 6.2.2.
 
It should be pretty easy to generate both XML Schema and DTD's from the DOM
specs XML sources and so eliminate the need for XML Schema to DTD
conversion.  However, I started with XML Schema first, as always.
 
The transform isn't smart enough yet to handle an read-write property name
that has different types in different uses or methods with different calling
signatures in different uses.
 
I've not tried the transform against the level 2 sources, but I did take a
quick look at them.  There were a couple of issues, first the directory
entries in the xml-sources.zip file contained "..", for example, one file
was named "..\..\..\pubtext\xmlspec-v21-dom.dtd".   This requires you to
unpack to a directory at least 3 levels deep.  It would also be helpful to
know what parameters can accept a null string or node.
