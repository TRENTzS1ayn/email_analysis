The goal here is to permit people to submit test suite files to the
DOM TS group and avoid the cut/paste step. We do have an anonymous ftp
at the W3C but I would like to propose a different solution:

Our mailing list archive support mime encapsulation and is able to
put the files separately on the server. A good example would be the
minutes of the DOM TS teleconference (see my previous reference). It avoids
the step of having an extra layer in the submission process (the submitted are
sent directly in the mailing list) and everybody is able to access the submitted
tests. One disadvantage will be that everybody on this mailing list will receive
the submitted tests. If we think it is a real disadvantage, then we can always
setup
a mailing list for the submissions.

One other point for the record, Jason received an action item to look for a bug
tracking in his company and host it. It would be useful know if it is possible or
not as soon as possible in order to find an alternate system if necessary.
