[mb]  I agree that this overcomplicates the transformation -- it seems as

it would be easier to put them in.

[mb] methods such as importNode, cloneNode, normalize, etc make changes to
the dom tree and you already have a handle to it that can be used later.
Introducing a var where one is meaningless is confusing to the test writer.
I don't follow your point regarding assiging a call to var when nothing is
returned.  If the transformation were to do this, the generated code becomes
confusing as well.  If we are going to have a TSML that provides DOM
capabilities per the spec, then we should do it according to the constraints
therein.

[mb] I'd rather introduce supplementary information than provide another
solution that isn't straightforward and easy to use.  One of the advantages
in
defining a schema is that we can tighten up some of the constraints.  Why
would we move away from this -- I think generating from the spec is a
great idea, but I don't believe that it won't have to be augmented.

[mb] Could you explain what the assertInstance of would do after
transformation?

[mb] Overkill?  Have you seen the size of the schema recently?  Why would
we tighten up constraints everywhere else and not follow through here --
it seems that we are 90% there already -- why not finish the last 10%?
