MessageIt appears as though after a new attribute is 
created with the name "newAttribute", the 
setAttributeNode(newAttribute) should be on 
newElement, not testAddress.

  Hmmm.  Not sure -- I'll have to go  back and 
  look at what's there for the xml file.  I've attached 
  the original java source in case someone else 
  gets to this first.  The test was intended to throw 
  an INUSE_ATTRIBUTE_ERR -- errors may have 
  been introduced during translation to xml.

    Good catch.  I apparently bungled that one in fixing up undeclared variables where I changed "Element" to "testAttribute" instead of "newElement".

    I'll have to review the results of this test since I believe that some implementations are throwing an exception.  My reading is that the test as written should not throw an exception and the return value setAttr2 should be same as newAttribute.

      In the DOM level 1 test elementinuseattributeerr, the attribute seems to be added to the same element twice. This should not lead to an INUSE_ATTRIBUTE_ERR. We should probably create another new element and add the attribute to this second element.
