I'll demonstrate what we've come up with so far to the DOM WG during 
this week's Face to Face in San Franscisco as well as find out what else 
the WG would like to see in the DOM TS framework.

As I'm working in a slightly different environment than most on this 
list (Mac OSX) it would be even more fun if things worked out the way 
planned (I'm just compiling Doxygen and hope it will work). I'll use 
J/JSUnit to demo the TS and show how our DOM TS ML is engineered and how 
code is produced. (I hope that at least the Java implementation is OK, I 
wouldn't bet on the browsers being compliant, but you never know).

On a more general note: I still haven't produced the documentation I 
promised but hope to get some time during this week. However, I still 
haven't received feedback on a request I sent to this list that people 
send me a short description with relevant information on the parts 
they've been working on in order to facilitate writing the documentation 
(instead of having to dig through all emails). I will have this ready 
since we are very close to releasing the test suite soon. Also, help 
from Fred would be greatly appreciated given your previous experience 
with Python.

On harnesses: I'll speak to Philippe on the Java part of the harness 
during this week and try to get as much relevant information in order to 
coordinate this with the ECMA harness Mary is working on. Jason, please 
provide relevant feedback on MS-specific issues.

Since this is an offline meeting, though, I won't be able to respond to 
email regurarly. If there is anything urgent to tell the DOM WG, please 
call me on my mobile, +46 706 100 470.

4 o'clock, time to get to the airport.
