I was looking at this and I think either the test needs to change
or the specification does.  The relevant parts of the test (in Java):

    newList = doc.getElementsByTagNameNS ("*", "employee");
    newElement = (Element)newList.item (3);

The problem is that only two elements have a namespace URI,
and that "*" is supposed to match "all namespaces".  Those two
elements are:

    - <employee> ... EMP0001, Margaret Martin
    - <emp:employee> ... EMP0004, Jeny Oconnor

Now, either the spec should be changed so that "*" means to
ignore any namespaces (and thereby match elements that are
not in any namespace), or (preferably) the test should change
so that it accesses item 1, not item 3.
