Reactions were in fact more than general positive. The WG realized
the quantity of work done in the DOM Test Suite effort and was
impressed by the results showed during the meeting. It is likely
that WG members will install the tests to run them against their
implementations in order to fix bugs (or crashes...).

Thank you and well done everyone for your effort,

Philippe,
DOM WG Chair.
