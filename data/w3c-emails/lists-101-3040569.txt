Hi Jason

Thanks for the clarification. I think the general outline of your 
submitted example is quite good, please help those producing the 
particular framework.

However, I do have one concern; the DOM TS aims at testing 
imnplementations' support for the DOm specification, thus also 
exceptions. I don't know if leaving them out from the TS is compatible 
with the aims of it, I will however investigate this with the DOM WG and 
get back as soon as possible.
