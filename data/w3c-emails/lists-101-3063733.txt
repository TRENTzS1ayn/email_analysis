That's pretty much what I said ... either the spec has a bug, or some
implementations do.  I think it's the implementations, but the question
does need to get answered.  Ratifying random bugs is a dangerous route.

How does the DOM WG get involved when such issues get raised?

All I did was run ANT 1.4.1 (current) in an environment that's set up to default
to using the current GNUJAXP code (SAX and DOM) and Saxon 6.4.2; I've
no idea if more recent versions of Saxon would behave differently.

The build ran fine, modulo out-of-memory problems caused by having too
much other stuff going on at the same time.
