One comment on the JsUnit in our framework is the pointer included in 
alltests.html which points to a folder presupposed by the JsUnit 
application. We may want to look at this in order not to tie people to a 
particular setup once we release the suite.

Also, while running the tests in a particular browser, it reported no 
errors (which would be fantastic); this not being the case however, it 
turns out that Junit iterates over all functions in the test file and 
reports a pass rersult even if the tests are not properly executed. We 
may want to do something to safeguard against this. I'll look into this 
some more and generate a more informative report.

I'll try to take up testing error-raising ignorant implementations with 
the DOM WG this week's telephone conference.
