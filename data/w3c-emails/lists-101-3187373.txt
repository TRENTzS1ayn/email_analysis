Adobe SVG Viewer also interprets getElementByTagName("*",...) to match both namespace qualified and unqualified nodes (that is returns 5 elements, not 2)

Testing ASV is a bit of a kludge right now.  It uses the JSUnit harness, but you have to uncomment out a section of code in DOMTestCase.js.  It also uses variants of staff*.xml and staff*.dtd that have an <svg> element as the document element, else ASV refuses to load the document.

I've posted its test results at http://home.houston.rr.com/curta/asv3-l1.txt and http://home.houston.rr.com/curta/asv3-l2.txt 

Adobe does not pick up default values from the DTD and rarely throws DOMExceptions which results in a high number of test failures.
