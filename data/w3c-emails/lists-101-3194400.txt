I am aware of the strange include paths in the .html files.  I think I can get JSUnit to dynamically add its support libraries to the test files and eliminate the need for the tests to know the (relative) location of JSUnit.  I won't be able to do that until next week, so if somebody wants to work on that and submit a patch to the JSUnit maintainer in the interim, please feel free.

Thursday is Thanksgiving in the US.  Most offices will be closed both Thursday and Friday and I'm sure most US participants will not be checking the email at least not as often over the holiday.
