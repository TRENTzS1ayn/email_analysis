Maybe I'm missing something, but...

The DOM API assumes that exceptions or some equivalent calling protocol
will be supported. It's probably reasonable to say that if you've got a
binding which uses one of the equivalents, it's your responsibility as a
test harness developer to establish a variant of the code-gen stylesheets
which understands that equivalent and handles it appropriately, reporting
when it's triggered correctly versus inappropriately.

Shouldn't be noticably harder than any of the other
compilation-to-specific-binding work that's already required...
