As you mentioned, the <assertDOMException> construct and equivalents are
designed to support binding specific means of reporting failure and so, for
example, the code-gen for a COM binding would be responsible treating the
HRESULT return value appropriately.

A ECMAScript binding that did not use exceptions to report failure would
probably best be considered a distinct binding from the standard ECMAScript
binding.  Again, it would be good to know the specific implementation that
is the cause for the concern.
