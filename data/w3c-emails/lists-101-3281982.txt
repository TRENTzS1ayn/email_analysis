If a developer is testing their implementation, they will be required to
run every test every time.  Allowing developers to test small portions
of their implementation is a much more efficient use of time.

I took this up with the DOM WG on this week's telephone conference, and 
the proposed route is that the Test Suite stays intact, which means 
running all the tests, but the reporting layer is built to be able to 
report more detailed results, one such being that the implementation 
tested did pass these tests, but not those, tests that in turn do not 
support exceptions (or something else).

This way, we could have a keyword-driven run of the tests, and even 
though all the tests are run, the reporting layer sees to that the 
report clearly states which (virtual) subset of tests has been 
satisfactorily run and which one has not.

I think this is a good compromise between the current layout of the DOM 
TS and the need for being able to de-select tests that presuppose 
particular features of the DOM implementation. It would achieve the same

thing as modularizing the DOM TS on a low level while only requiring 
efforts to produce a better reporting layer.

Any comments on this?
