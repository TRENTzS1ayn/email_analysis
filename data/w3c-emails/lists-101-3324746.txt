Yes:  "In NO namespace" != "In ANY namespace".

Referring to the DOM-TS tests from CVS as of a couple days ago,
and just summarizing results with the current GNUJAXP release ...
everything passes EXCEPT:

  - Quite a number of the tests that try to verify behavior for
    readonly nodes produce errors because instead of using
    such nodes as found in the document, they try to create
    new entity refs ... such refs are created with no children.
    
    Seems to me a number of those tests would be better if
    they verified that behavior using the entity ref nodes in the
    document.  And those tests should likely not execute
    when the parser isn't populating entity refs.  (Lots of tests
    such as "unreadablenamenomodificationallowederr" fail,
    about a dozen total, this is the main L1 failure mode. :)

    (This is an area where IMO there are longstanding API
    deficiencies in DOM.  First, you can't mark subtrees as
    readonly.  Second, entities and entity refs, in their entirety.
    I recall discussions late in DOM L1 to ensure it was legal
    to never populate these nodes, yet these tests insist that they
    must always be populated.)

  - Some of the L2 importNode tests acted strange.  I need to
    look at them some more.  For example, one seems
    to expect that importing a no-namespace node will cause
    the imported node to acquire a namespace.
    (importNode{07,10,11,12} gave problems.)

  - Those L2 getElementsByTagNameNS tests, as mentioned,
    where I think the tests are wrong (since they treat the "no
    namespace" case like a "has a namespace" case).

In one parser mode, some more of the L2 tests failed,
such as some "prefix" tests.  Haven't had a look at any
of those to see what's up yet, could be a bug in tests or
in the implementation.  For L1 it was mostly those "create
another populated entity ref" tests that failed.
