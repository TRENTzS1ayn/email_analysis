I tested the document and it worked fine for me. Two small comments:
- we'd better put the documentation in HTML at some point.
- it doesn't seem to work with Xerces 2.x. Xerces 1.x is the appropriate
version for Xalan. Or better, download Xalan 2.1, and replace its crimson.jar
with the xerces.jar included in the Xalan distribution (no need to download
xerces separately).
