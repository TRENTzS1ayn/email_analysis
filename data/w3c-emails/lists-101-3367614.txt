One other drawback of option 3 is Entity nodes. Since you cannot create them,
your entity ref nodes will always be empty... There is no real way to solve this
problem unfortunately. The better thing is to always use the implementation
bootstrapping as much as possible and, if not available, try to test everything
except entities.
