No objections here.

It would be great to be able to use the test suite against Batik.  I had
done a minimal JAXP implementation for Batik in domunit, but had not
replicated the effort for this suite.

Unfortunately, it is not possible to run the suite from a JUnit GUI, don't
know if it is possible to run it from the <junit> task in Ant.  Running it
from a JUnit GUI would probably require creating junit.TestSuite derived
classes in junit-run that correspond to the major test suites and a
particular configuration.
