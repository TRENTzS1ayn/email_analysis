The current implementation of the browser specific classes in
DOMTestSuite.js have not been implemented to load non-XML documents.  In
particular, the IE browser specific class creates a new MSXML parser, which
of course will not load an HTML file.
 
Probably the quickest thing is to augment the load implementation so that if
it sees an ".html" extension that it loads the document with the HTML DOM
implementation.  Will need to refine that before we can test implementations
that support both XHTML and HTML.

Subject: HTMLAnchor href test



I've committed a DOM L2 HTML test, called HTMLAnchor04.xml, 
which loads anchor.html, and attempts to read the value of the 
href attribute.  It seems to transform ok, but I can't get it to run 
in jsunit -- I'm sure that I'm doing something silly, but I can't see 
it -- anyone else able to figure it out?
 
You'll have to build the ecmascript, and jsunit for level 2 html.  In 
order to do so, I added the following targets to build.xml.
 
    dom2-html-gen-ecmascript
    dom2-html-gen-jsunit
 
I'll commit build.xml as well.
