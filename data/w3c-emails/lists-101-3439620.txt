Actually, the tests were primarily created by NIST.  I created most of the
implementation.

I didn't write and haven't read the readme.txt (it is pretty new) and open
for comments.

There are distinct stylesheets for different bindings.  For example, there
are distinct stylesheets for Java and ECMAScript (and hopefully Python, C++,
C#, etc).  The Java tests are written to use an interface that abstracts the
functions required from the test framework.  The produced jar's can current
be run using either JUnit or Avalon testlet by matching the test jar with an
adapter jar (either junit-run.jar or avalon-run.jar).  Probably the most
appropriate approach would be to create a similar adapter for your regard
tool.  Look at the sources in either DOM-Test-Suite/java/junit or
DOM-Test/java/avalon and hopefully it will be moderately obvious.

Hopefully with an appropriate adapter classes you can use the standard
distribution .jars to test the Java implementation.

Philippe Le Hegaret was looking at testing Batik using the existing
JUnit/Avalon adapters by using the DOM 3 Load/Save interfaces.

I would also love to see a SVG/ECMAScript test suite.  I was thinking that
you could build a grid for a particular test suite and the squares would
turn green or red as the tests progress and hovering over a test would put
any messages in a text box at the bottom of the page.
