Batik doesn't support the JAXP API and this is currently required to run
the DOM Test Suite. I'm working on improving the bootstrapping problem
in the DOM Test Suite in order to support DOM Level 3 LS, JAXP, and do
the loading ourself. Batik doesn't support DOM Level 3 LS (yet?) so will
rely on the third solution in order to run the tests.
Loading the Document ourself requires to have a SAX2 parser but we can include
the xerces parser in the distribution. Once this loader is ok, I'll change
the DOMTestCase load method to remove its dependency with JAXP and will change
accordingly the framework bootstraps. Hopefully, I should have something stable
before the end of next week.
