Curt, Dimitri, Philippe,

Thanks for your answers. I think the situation is:

a. You do have a notion of test adapter for the java tests and this 
   should ease the integration into Batik's test infrastructure.

b. The tests currently rely on JAXP and Batik is not using JAXP.

We'll wait until Philippe has the two alternate methods in place
to do the integration into the Batik test suite. In the meanwhile,
we'll have a look at the adapters, as Curt suggested.

Cheers,
V.
