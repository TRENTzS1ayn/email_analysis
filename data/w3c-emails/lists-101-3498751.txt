I've updated http://www.w3.org/DOM/Test/Overview.html to point to the 
DOMTSBuild.html as well as take away the old activity matrix which was 
heavily out of date.

Also, I've updated http://www.w3.org/DOM/Test/Documents/DOMTSFAQ.html, 
-faq.xml to inculde a pointer to DOMTSBuild.html.

Finally, I've added http://www.w3.org/DOM/Test/Documents/DOMTSBuild.html 
which is an HTML version of the text file committed to the CVS a few 
days ago.

PLease sanity check and comment on content.
