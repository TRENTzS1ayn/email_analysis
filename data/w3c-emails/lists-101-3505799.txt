The need for SED and Patch might be eliminated in the forthcoming Ant 1.5.  There is a regexp replacement task that might be able to do what we are doing with SED and Patch.

I believe the Ant 1.4 optional.jar needs to be downloaded (and renamed)?

The discussion on removing Crimson and replacing with Xalan-J might be prefaced with an explanation that the transforms have been observed to break various XSLT processors and the following combination works well.

URL's should be provided for Ant, Xalan.  A URL for a Windows version of SED should be provided.

xerces and xalan do not need to be on the path or classpath to build.

Should mention the junit-run task that will download JUnit and build an adapter.

dom1-core-gen-jsunit should be mentioned instead of dom1-core-gen-ecmascript.  gen-jsunit generates tests that can be used from JSUnit, gen-ecmascript generates the raw .js files but there isn't a framework to run them from.  The generated .js files might be useful from a Javascript compiler, but we haven't done any work on that.

Doxygen will NOT be downloaded by Ant (unless there has been a change that I missed).  If you want to build the Doxygen documentation of the Java tests, you need to download Doxygen and place it on your path.

The discussion of an off-line mode is probably distracting.  We really won't need a different mode, we will just avoid making a network connection if the files are already available in a subsequent version of build.xml.

Running the JUnit test suite requires that you have a JAXP-compliant parser on the classpath or Xerces.jar, crimson.jar, or xmlparserv2.jar in the same directory.
