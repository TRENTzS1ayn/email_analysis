  Yes, I'm interested, but I've been incredibly swamped lately, and
expect this to continue at least through the end of the year.  I've
not forgotten that I volunteered, though, so there's a good chance
I'll contribute.
  If there's anything specific you'd like me to help out on (even if
high-level), perhaps the best thing to do is to create a bug/feature
report in the SF project and assign it to me.
