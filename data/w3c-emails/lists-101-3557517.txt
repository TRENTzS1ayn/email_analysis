I was trying to encourage someone else to play with ant's regexp task.

http://www.student.northpark.edu/pemente/sed/sed3028a.zip is the SED implementation that I have been using.

The SED task is used to fix up the generated schemas since the XSLT transform can't generate dynamic xmlns attributes so _xmlns attributes are generated instead and SED removes the underscore.  SED is also used to fix up some missing entity references in the SVG spec.

Patch is used to change the name param to tagname for Element.getElementsByTagName so the two forms are consistant and making other small changes to the spec sources.  The task is essential to produce the interface summary file which is used by everything else.

The earliest doxygen task did download it, but since the site wasn't always responsive and it would only get the Windows version.  It isn't essential, but it is helpful for browsing the tests.

  About Ant's possible forthcoming regexp capabilities, I won't incorporate any changes in the build helper until that issue gets resolved. Curt, since you seem to keep an eye on what gets added to Ant, once regexp is there, please advise the list.

      I believe the Ant 1.4 optional.jar needs to be downloaded (and renamed)?


    [dd] right, I forgot. Thanks.



      The discussion on removing Crimson and replacing with Xalan-J might be prefaced with an explanation that the transforms have been observed to break various XSLT processors and the following combination works well.


    [dd] Will do.



      URL's should be provided for Ant, Xalan.  A URL for a Windows version of SED should be provided.


    [dd] I'm using a Unix variant, so I have no idea where to find the Windows version (Mac OS X have them already). Do you have a relevant pointer?



      xerces and xalan do not need to be on the path or classpath to build.
       
      Should mention the junit-run task that will download JUnit and build an adapter.

       
      dom1-core-gen-jsunit should be mentioned instead of dom1-core-gen-ecmascript.  gen-jsunit generates tests that can be used from JSUnit, gen-ecmascript generates the raw .js files but there isn't a framework to run them from.  The generated .js files might be useful from a Javascript compiler, but we haven't done any work on that.


    [dd] Correct, I omitted the -gen-jsunit thinking that people may just want to look at the .js files. They will obviously want to run them as well.



      Doxygen will NOT be downloaded by Ant (unless there has been a change that I missed).  If you want to build the Doxygen documentation of the Java tests, you need to download Doxygen and place it on your path.


    [dd] I was actually under the impression that it did. OK, I'll check an update the document as necessary.



      The discussion of an off-line mode is probably distracting.  We really won't need a different mode, we will just avoid making a network connection if the files are already available in a subsequent version of build.xml.

       
      Running the JUnit test suite requires that you have a JAXP-compliant parser on the classpath or Xerces.jar, crimson.jar, or xmlparserv2.jar in the same directory.
