[mb] We've started work on translating the html files, but have run into
problems with running the tests -- we agreed per the telecon with Phillipe
that we would provide level 2 HTML tests only, not level 1.  Was this
your understanding as well?  This is essentially taking our current level 1
tests, translating them to xml, and updating to level 2, where appropriate.
We've just begun the translation -- there are over 600 tests -- it's hard to
say how long it will take, but we will update the CVS repository as we go,
rather than waiting for all the tests to be completed before we submit them.

As far as the harness goes, it appears as though we don't have a method for
loading xhtml and html files for the various implementations.  Curt figured
out something for xhtml (Mozilla), I believe.  It would be helpful if others
that had DOM HTML implementations could forward examples of how to load
these files.
