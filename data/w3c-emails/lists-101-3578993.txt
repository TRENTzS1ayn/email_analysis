[dd] OK, as I understood it, you meant that ANT will have those 
capabilities from 1.5 on, that's why I decied against taking it up in 
the build document.

[dd] This is the path I gave in the doc as well, letting people decide 
for themselves which binary they want to use as I have no previous 
experience. Do you think I should change it to the one you use, or are 
other SED binaries equally effective?

[dd] Does sed ONLY get called from build.xml? In that case, maybe the 
changes I want to make to put the patch files in a separate directory 
arent's so tough.

[dd] OK, I removed any info about Doxygen from the documentation. I 
think we should decide for one single documentation format to avoid 
confusion, so we should clean up the ant options available (the current 
build.xml still lists doxygen)
