[dd] Now that you say it, yes of course. I attended the telcon and 
should have known, it was just running very lat when I sent the email 
yesterday.

Taken from Philippe's Summary of DOM Test Suite status email, Oct 29:

We are still missing the DOM Level 1
HTML Test Suite. Given that DOM Level 2 HTML is not backward compatible, 
a DOM
Level 2 HTML test suite would be more appropriate. Mary will see what 
can be
done in NIST and will ask for help in the www-dom-ts mailing list to 
convert
the existing NIST DOM HTML test suite. Dimitris will help to unify the
harnesses and needs to take of the documentation.

[dd] I take it "the existing DOM HTML test suite" is for level 1, but 
will be converted to level 2?

[dd] This is a call for Jason from Microsoft and someone from Mozilla 
(Netscape) that I'll come in touch with.
