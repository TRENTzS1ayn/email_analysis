The comments on the regexp task in Ant 1.5 (that is, the current Ant nightly
builds) was more forward looking.  Hopefully that we could eliminate the
need for SED and Patch in the build process shortly.

Enhancing DOMTestSuite.js to load both HTML and XML files is not really
rocket science, it was just that I wasn't going to be able make those
changes on the night that Mary committed the first HTML test files.  Mozilla
XHTML worked without any mods.  There are other issues that need to be
addressed in DOMTestSuite.js, for example, it only caches staff.xml.

Any SED should do since the modifications being done are trivial, however if
your SED has a different file name (such as SSED), you would either need to
rename SSED.EXE to SED.EXE or change the <exec> task to run SSED.

SED and Patch are only used in the build process.  Probably should mention
that patch would typically be provided by WinCVS on Windows.

The Doxygen generated documentation is very useful for browsing the tests
since the JavaDoc equivalent does not include the test source.  The JavaDoc
generated documentation isn't particulary useful.


If you build "avalon-run" instead of "junit-run" (resulting in you having
avalon-run.jar and testlet.jar in the dist directory instead of
junit-run.jar and junit.jar) and do "java -jar dom1-core.jar", then the
tests will be run using the Avalon testlet framework.

Development of the testlet framework was discontinued by Avalon Development
Team on 1 Aug 2001 in favor of adopting JUnit.  Just about the same time I
developed the testlet adapter.  It does confirm that we were able to achieve
test framework independence and could be used by anyone who has problems
with the IBM Public License used by JUnit but can tolerate the Apache
Software License.
