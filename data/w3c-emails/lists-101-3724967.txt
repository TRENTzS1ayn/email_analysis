There's been less activity than normal during the past weeks, so I've 
decided to start writing the documentation as the review period we 
allowed for should be considered over (allowing for a bit of discussion 
on the harness and ECMA transform).

In order to do this, could we agree on what tools will be needed to 
build the suite and run it? So far we have

Build
1. Ant (1.4 OK?)
2. Xerces
3. Xalan
4. CVS

Run
1. Harness (for the script tests)
2. Junit for the Java tests

In order to allow for other implementations, we need to have a very 
clear account of what is needed to run the suite. We should for example 
not claim that files must be validated before run, as they will have 
been validated before generating the tests.

Fred, I've looked through your documentation for Python, which I'm 
learning, and it looks really good. I'll send you my draft for 
documentation as soon as possible for your comments, in the meanwhile 
mail me any relevant tips.

Status report:
The only thing in need of review as I see it is the ECMA transform and 
the harness for running tests. Mary has already created a test harness 
which Curt tweaked to allow for more software to run it; could you two 
start looking into a harnes for the DOM TS? Start a thread on the list 
so that as many people as possible could hook on (if I remember 
correctly, company reps to the DOM TS are interested in participating).
