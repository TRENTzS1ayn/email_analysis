I've just returned from a couple weeks on the road.  When I left off, the ECMAScript tests were generated from the DOM 1 Core test definitions and runnable using JSUnit for IE, Mozilla 0.9+ and Adobe
SVG Viewer.  However, that implementation did not use any code from the original NIST ECMAScript suite harness.  (See http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom-ts/2001Sep/0005.html,
http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=51247)

Running the tests using JSUnit is awkward, but does work.  If somebody wants to provide a harness with better usability, please do so.  I'm sure that there are plenty of people who are much better at
cross-browser scripting than I am.
