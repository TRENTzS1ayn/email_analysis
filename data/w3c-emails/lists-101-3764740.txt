I am a little bit confused here, but the page on http://www.w3.org/DOM/Test/
says that a sourceforge project has been made and can be found at
http://domconftest.sourceforge.net/.

Unfortunately, only an empty page can be found on that link.

Where I am working we are currently writing tests for DOM L1+L2, and we
consider to contribute if
the system you are using works ok.

I tried to access it by CVS, and I found that a project has been created,
but it seems that there are no 
modules created within that project. (By scanning CVSROOT/modules)

Where can I find these XML and XSLT scripts that are needed to generates the
tests?

Is this project independent of the xmlconf project on sourceforge 
(I noticed that they have a www-dom-ts folder, but I did not find the test
XML-document)


Best regards
