The tests are available from the W3C CVS server in module 2001/DOM-Test-Suite See http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/dev.w3.org for details on anonymous access.

The tests are built using Ant 1.4 (http://jakarta.apache.org).  Last time I checked, it was necessary to remove crimson and xalan from the Ant distribution with Xalan 2.1 due to a bug that caused
Xalan to fail, but I haven't confirmed that is still a problem.  You must have SED and PATCH on your path before invoking Ant.  Currently, we build tests for Java (using Junit http://www.junit.org)
and ECMAScript (using JSUnit, http://www.jsunit.net), support for other bindings is anticipated, but not currently available.

domconftest.sourceforge.net was set up so that we could use SourceForge's tracker bug database, but has been inactive.  

I personally was the primary developer of the xmlconf.sourceforge.net's DOM related tests (which were mostly derived from NIST's work) and have been very involved in the NIST/W3C effort, so though
they are organizationally independent, there is a lot of commonality.  The www-dom-ts stuff on xmlconf is out of date.

NIST is working on their DOM Level 2 submission currently and hopefully will commit them shortly.

Hope that is enough to get you started.  If not, let us know what operating system and binding you are working with.
