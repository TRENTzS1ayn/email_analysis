Any level 2 parser should call level 2 methods, hence it should call 
setNamedItemNS in preference to setNamedItem.  Otherwise, it would not 
properly detect namespace non-well-formedness problems that come from a 
document that cannot be represented in terms of level 2 DOM, i.e. where 
two attributes have the same prefix which map to the same namespaceURI, 
which can be detected by testing for a non-null return from setNamedItemNS.
