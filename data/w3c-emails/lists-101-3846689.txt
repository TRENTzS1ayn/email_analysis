All

I work with Mary Brady at NIST and have been 
running the NIST DOM Level 2 tests through
SUN's MSV tool and have some questions.

Several tests such as documentcreateattributexmlnsillegalname.xml
and documentcreateelementxmlnsillegalname.xml
have failed because a double quote is used as element content
for one of the member nodes. A "unexpected character literal"
error is returned. 

 I've tried several different ways
to escape the double quote and haven't had any luck.  Can
someone give me a suggestion.

Also the namednodemapsetnameditemxmlnsreplaceitem.xml test
uses an underscore in the values of attributes(ex. ret_node).  MSV returns
"attribute "name" has a bad value: the value does not match the 
regular expression "[A-Za-z] [A-Za-z0-9]*".

Since Java variable names are valid if they contain underscores shouldn't
they also be valid for the tests.
