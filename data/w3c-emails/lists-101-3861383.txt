I think that it was discussed with no real resolution -- quite 
honestly, it's a real hassle on our side, so if we are going to 
do it, we'd only want to go through the process once.  The 
last recollection I have is something on the order of 

    MethodNameXX.xml

This will require changes to both the filename and the id 
inside the xml file.  

I seem to recollect that one of the transformations for applying 
metadata info to the file, and in particular, the <subject> tag, 
depended upon the long filename.  If so, this should be applied 
prior to changing the filenames.  

Can anyone think of a way to automatically change the filenames?
I'm really not interested in hand editing all of these files -- it's 
prone to introducing errors (as well as time consuming).
