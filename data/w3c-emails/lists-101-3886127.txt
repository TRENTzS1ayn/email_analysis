It's easy enough for us to rename to variable -- in fact,
we already have -- but limitations such as this should
specifically be called out in documentation that is
prepared for others submitting tests or be fixed.  I
don't have strong feelings -- but I have seen alot of
code over the years in a variety of languages with
underscores used in variable names.
