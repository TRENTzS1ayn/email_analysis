Given Phillipe's response, it would appear that the tests as
originally written are valid.  These tests -- one from DOM
Level 1 and another in DOM L2, capture the system id as a
string -- look backwards in the string for the first occurrence
of "/", and then strip off what would be the system id without
the baseURI.  This is done using the java String lastIndexOf
method, followed by a subString method.  In order to add
these test cases, we either need to add these language constructs
to the schema and language specific transformations, or we
could possibly add another assert element,
<assertURIequals>, with corresponding language specific
code to do the comparison.

Any thoughts?
