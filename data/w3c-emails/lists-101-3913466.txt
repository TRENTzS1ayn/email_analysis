Hi Jan-Arve

Please provide your input on the framework that is described at 
http://www.w3.org/DOM/Test as well as by Curt in his reply to your 
original posting, as we want to make sure that anyone who so wishes can 
contribute to the DOM TS framework.

You are able to browse the CVS repository for individual files, such as 
the transforms you mention, and you are also able to anonymously check 
out the entire module anonymously in order to build the suite and look 
at the source code.

There will be a downloadable version of the DOM TS available at 
http://www.w3.org/DOM/Test as soon as we have finalized it, so you still 
have time to provide valuable feedback before we release the firt 
version.

/Dimitris
