Sorry for having been absent for a while.

When could we be safe in assuming the review period to have ended? I 
personally fell that we should start tying things up in order to have a 
release soon, especially as so much work on level 2 things is going on. 
I propose that we all, including the editors and members of the DOM WG, 
look at the tests for one more week and then proceed to evaluating 
correctness and so forth before packaging.

We have still to resolve, as a common action item, the question of the 
simplistic harness to run generated tests online, which would be 
different than using any of the xUnit frameworks as is being done now. 
This was a wish from the DOM WG and I think it would be good to have 
something runnable on the DOM/Test area.

As far as my action items are concerned, I still have to produce and 
updated documentation, as well as incorporate information about what 
tests we need on teh main page; this is particularly relevant for level 
2 and onwards since level 1 has been fairly complete from the start.

We also have an issue with transforming Junit tests to our DOM TS. Has 
anyoone looked into this? It would probably be a solution along the 
lines of Java2XML. Is it doable? Desirable? (The question originates 
from a comapny that has tests and wants to know if it is worth the 
effort to transform theses tests).
