[mb]  Is this wish for just the ECMAScript tests, or for all bindings?

[mb] Maybe the test matrix will do this -- I have not generated the one
included within build.xml, but I suspect that it will point to holes in
the test suite.  I'll generate it and see what it looks like.

[mb] I have not looked into this, but I would think that it would require a
transformation from whatever Java2XML produced into the DOM TSML.
From our experience in authoring tests in the DOM TSML, I would suspect
that there will be problems with language constructs that we do not
currently
support, such as the more recent discussions involving the Java String
methods.
