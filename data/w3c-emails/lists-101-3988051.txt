There are still about 10 tests or so that I was hoping that someone else would write, basically setting node.nodeValue for each of the distinct types of nodes and seeing if the right thing happens.
Only about 3-4 of the derived node types have corresponding tests and this particular test is contentious since the spec says that setting nodeValue when nodeValue is always null is supposed to have
"no effect" and several implementations will throw an exception.

All the tests ending with EE deserve review.  I wrote these to do the same test as same name minus the EE but without depending on entity references being preserved.  Xerces-J will pass all these
tests when expandEntityReference = false, but will fail them when expandEntityReference = true.  I think the tests are right, but I haven't isolated the bug in Xerces-J.

On the last item, it is probably easier to do the transformation on a case by case basis than trying to do a generic tool.

I will try to put together a matrix of tests vs processors by the start of next week.
