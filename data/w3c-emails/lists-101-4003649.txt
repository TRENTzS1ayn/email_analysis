FWIW, I read http://www.opera.com/opera4/specs.html#xml 
as saying that Opera has very limited HTML DOM support, but
never mentions XML DOM support.  In any event, they do say:

"We support the following attributes [sic, "methods" ???] in the document
object: 
     
getElementsByTagName() 
       
getElementById() 
       
getElementByName() "

That's pretty minimal!
