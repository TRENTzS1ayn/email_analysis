Looks like Amaya (no ECMAScript) and Opera (partial DOM support and questionable XML support) are non-starters.  

I couldn't find any "Using XML in Konqueror" type documents at http://www.konqueror.org however the press releases did indicate some support for XML and DOM 1 and part of DOM 2.  If someone is a
Konqueror whiz and could take a look at adapting DomTestCase.js (http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/2001/DOM-Test-Suite/ecmascript/DOMTestCase.js) to detect Konqueror and load an external XML document
(preferrably asynchronously) or point me to appropriate documentation, that would be great.  Also, seeing if JSUnit (http://www.jsunit.net) runs on Konqueror would be helpful.
