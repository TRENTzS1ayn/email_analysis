I've committed changes that add support for an <assertURIEquals> element.  The Java implemention runs the one test that uses it, but I haven't tested my URI cracking logic further than that.  I've copied the Java implementation over to JavaScript, but haven't walked through that code.

I've also added a public static void main() to all tests and suites that allow you to invoke the test class which will then try to find JUnitRunner.  So in addition to the previously available

java -jar junit-run.jar org.w3c.domts.level1.core.alltests

You could do

java -classpath dom1-core.jar org.w3c.domts.level1.core.alltests

or simply

java -jar dom1-core.jar

All these will try to find junit-jar and junit.jar in the same directory or on the classpath.

If you wanted to use a different testing framework, you would have to use the first form.
