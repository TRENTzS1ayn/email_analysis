The current test suite is by no means complete.  In previous discussions,
we have iterated the need for testing methods on interfaces that were
inherited -- I believe that the interfaces are for the most part tested on
the
top-level interface, but probably not any down the path.  If you have such
tests, please contribute to the effort.  We had envisioned from the start
that test contributions would come from a variety of folks working in this
area -- what you currently see is just the start.

At NIST, we have additional tests for DOM L2, which should be committed
soon -- we are down to just a couple of problems.  We also have about
600 DOM L1 HTML tests -- if you would like to see where we have tests,
we have an older test matrix available from our web site,

        http://xw2k.sdct.itl.nist.gov/brady/w3c-dom/test-matrix.html

Other than those mentioned, please feel free to fill in the holes!
