Sorry,  forgot to escape a backslash in the regular expression for
stringLiteral.  Fixed now in the CVS.

The current constraints on stringLiterals are they start and end with double
quotes (") and contain no embedded quotes unless escaped.  There are three
supported escape sequences \", \\ and \n.  Additional escape sequences can
be added if necessary, but keeping the set small will make it easier to
support languages with different escaping conventions.

I've added an explicit UTF-8 encoding to test-to-java.xsl and other
transforms and added a explicit UTF8 encoding to the <javac> tasks in
build.xml.  This should allow consistent processing for non-ASCII characters
in string literals.
