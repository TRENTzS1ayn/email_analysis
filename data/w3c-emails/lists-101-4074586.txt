I'll take a look at expanding the test-matrix.xsl so it will report tests against inherited methods.  The setNodeValue tests I mentioned yesterday are one example of this issue.

Some tests that use non-USASCII characters would be beneficial, for example, a test that calls createElement with a valid Japanese tagname and then compares the value from nodeName.
