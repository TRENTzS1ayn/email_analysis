The DOM L2 tests all validate against the dom2 schema.  In 
addition, all id's on assertDOMException have been changed 
to 

        throw_DOMException 

where DOMException is the exception that should be thrown.

Final steps prior to committing to CVS repository:

1) Change subjects based on filenames -- I think analyzefilenames.xsl 
will do this -- is that correct, Curt?

2) Change filenames and associated test id's inside the file.  We need 
to come to resolution on this issue.  I've seen the following suggestions:

* do nothing -- let the test matrix be smart enough to maintain an index.

* InterfaceMethodXX.xml  

* MethodXX.xml -->  here, you will not know what interface the test 
   corresponds to, and will have to rely on the subject metadata.

In both of the suggested serial naming conventions, I am concerned that 
multiple people creating tests for a given area might use the same name.
I guess CVS will probably catch this, but it could be quite confusing to 
test writers.

Any other thoughts?
