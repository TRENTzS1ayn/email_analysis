[mb]
The DOM L2 tests all validate against the dom2 schema.  In 
addition, all id's on assertDOMException have been changed 
to 

        throw_DOMException 

where DOMException is the exception that should be thrown.


[ca]
Hopefully using the DOMException code, like throw_INDEX_SIZE_ERR.  Using this convention simply makes the assertion failure more meaningful to the reader that doSomethingBadAssert1.

[mb]
Final steps prior to committing to CVS repository:

1) Change subjects based on filenames -- I think analyzefilenames.xsl 
will do this -- is that correct, Curt?

[ca]
I think it might need a little tweaking to produce DOM 2 subject URI's, could you email carnold@houston.rr.com a few files to test it with off-line?

[mb]
2) Change filenames and associated test id's inside the file.  We need 
to come to resolution on this issue.  I've seen the following suggestions:

* do nothing -- let the test matrix be smart enough to maintain an index.

* InterfaceMethodXX.xml  

* MethodXX.xml -->  here, you will not know what interface the test 
   corresponds to, and will have to rely on the subject metadata.

[ca]
I'd prefer MethodXX.xml.

There is always the possibility that multiple people would simulataneously decide to write createXPathExpression01.xml however the chance for collision would exist for any convention.

If you write a .bat file with:

Rename attrdosomething.xml DoSomething01.xml
Rename attrdosomethingbad.xml DoSomething02.xml
...

Then you could convert it to a .bat file like:

Sed /name="attrdosomething/name="dosomething01/ dosomething01.xml
Sed /name="attrdosomethingbad/name="dosomething02/ dosomething02.xml

To change the names internally (not sure of the SED syntax)
