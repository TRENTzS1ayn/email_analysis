[dd] Pretty early on, there was an implicit understanding that not all 
facets of a particular method could be tested as this introduces an 
ever-growing set of tests that would need to be written.

I'm not all too happy about this, so please provide any feedback/ideas 
on how we could solve this (for practical reasons, however, we are 
limiting the TS to testing the most basic functions of each method).
