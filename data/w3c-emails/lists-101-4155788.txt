I wouldn't have a problem with all lower case or camel case (methodName02.xml).  Camel case is what is in the spec for attributes and methods, so it is probably preferable to MixedCase.

Okay -- we only have to change the filenames. 
I know that Curt favors MethodNameXX.xml - 
should the MethodName be mixed-case, as it 
appears in the spec, or something else?
