That forum is the appropriate one for issues and ambiguities in the
specification.  The DOM WG is the ultimate arbiter of interpretation and the
test group defers any controversy to them.

There did not appear to be a response to your question on www-dom in the
archive.  So I'm not sure if you got a private response that you aren't
satisified with or you didn't get any response.

There aren't any tests in the current (unratified) test suite that address
your specific scenario.

Code observation suggests that Xerces-J, Crimson, Xerces-C, and DOM4J would
all throw a HIERARCHY_REQUEST_ERR.
