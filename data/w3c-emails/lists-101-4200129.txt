I'm having problems with several tests that
use firstChild.  The tests are schema valid and
no errors are thrown during transformation to java.
When I compile the generated code I get errors.
I've attached the xml file and the generated java code
from one of the tests.  All of the tests that use firstChild
have compilation errors.
