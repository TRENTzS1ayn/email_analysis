The three files were "DOM Level 1" tests that actually dependent on DOM Level 2 features.  If they are redundant with a newly committed test, I'll remove them, otherwise I'll change (actually remove
and add) their names to fit in with the newly committed tests.

If DOM Level 2 tests refer to "staff.xml" et al, then there should be copies in files/level2.

Increases usability, but isn't essential.

Will track this one down tonight

I'll look over them too.  I saw a few things in DOM Level 3 that will require some extensions to DOMTSML (specifically the NOT_IMPLEMENTED_ERR stuff, there is not a construct tests whether you threw a
particular exception code or fulfilled a set of assertions).  Possibly the import tests will suggest some other enhancements, however the idea is to keep the language as small as possible to do the
necessary tests.
