This test case currently runs through all the features documented in 
the Conformance section, first with version=1.0, and then with 
version=3.0.  The 3.0 is obviously a mistake and should be 2.0.

In the spec, it doesn't say anything regarding specifying 1.0 as the 
version for isSupported, but under hasFeature does indicate that 1.0 
is also valid.  I suspect that since isSupported was introduced in 
Level 2, version was only supposed to be 2.0?

The spec also indicates that no version may be specified, and that 
isSupported should return true if any version of the specified feature 
is supported.

This test is somewhat problematic in that both true and false are valid 
for each of these features.  Is there a way to specify an assertion 
that just checks that the method is available and returns either 
true or false?

If so, I would suspect that we should rewrite the test to check for 
case-insensitive features for version="" and version="2.0".
