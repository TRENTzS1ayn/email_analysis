The spec indicates only 2.0 and not specified --> which maybe should be
spelled out
as either "" or null, as was done for hasFeature.

The main thing we were checking was just the opposite -- that isSupported
doesn't throw an exception with the known
recognized features, as defined in the Conformance section of the
recommendation.  It is true that we need to stop somewhere,
in that we can't specify additional XML names that others might create, but
we can check for what the spec defines.
