[mb]  Yes, we are all putting in long hours getting this to work -- all the
more reason for giving each other better clues for picking up
where the other left off...

[mb] See additional e-mail for more details.

[mb] There shouldn't be any difference between now and after an initial
build succeeds.  There are good reasons for using CVS -- let's try to make
it work for us.
