  The problem with firstChild was due to firstChild being both a method (of TreeWalker) and an attribute (of Node), the transform didn't like that too much.  I've also cleaned up indenting and a long term problem with the spurious /* undefined */ comments.  Have not made the corresponding changes to test-to-ecmascript.xsl

  [mb] Noticed that the test-to-java has level1 specified for package and target-uri-base, but that the interfaces document was changed 
  to dom2-interfaces.xml.  It appears from build.xml that you defined parameters to be passed in, but then don't use them inside of the 
  transformation.  Did you have problems passing them in, or still to be done?
