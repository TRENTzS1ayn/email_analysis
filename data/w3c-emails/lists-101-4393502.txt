[mb] I disagree.  The spec clearly states that the extended interfaces are
optional --

The interfaces found within this section are not mandatory. A DOM
application may use the hasFeature(feature, version) method of the
DOMImplementation interface with parameter values "XML" and "2.0"
(respectively) to determine whether or not this module is supported by the
implementation.

It's misleading to include them as CORE tests, as CORE functionality must be
implemented by everyone, but these interfaces do not have to be.
