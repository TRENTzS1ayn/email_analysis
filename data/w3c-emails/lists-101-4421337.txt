No Exceptions means that the implementation should throw no exceptions, DOMException or other.  The caller depends that the only exceptions thrown are those that are declared.  If the implementation
throws an exception that was not declared (on platforms where that is possible, it is enforced by the language in Java), then the contract with the caller is violated.
