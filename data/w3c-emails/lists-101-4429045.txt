The distinction between fundamental and extended is less significant than the difference between tests that depend on parsing XML and those that depend on parsing HTML.

However, I think it is unlikely that we could write a significant body of tests for DOM core that would work on both an HTML and XML implementation.  So currently we have a body of tests for the DOM
L1 and L2 Core that pre-suppose the implementation can read XML.  So maybe we should have put the tests that depend on XML support in tests/level-1/core/xml and put html tests in
tests/level-1/core/html to avoid implying superiority over html.  And if we were able to write tests that could work on both we could put them in tests/level1/core.

However, I'd like to hold off discussing any directory structure change until we have had a chance to get the L2 stuff running.

Can you give us the status of the HTML DOM tests?
