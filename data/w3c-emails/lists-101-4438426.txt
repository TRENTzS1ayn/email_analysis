StaffNS.xml is shown as being updated by dom-ts-4 in the CVS web http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb//2001/DOM-Test-Suite/tests/level2/core/files/staffNS.xml

However, I didn't commit that file.  I assume that one of the two of you did.  Could be a bug in CVSweb or maybe they have wired one of your public keys with my account.  If you committed that file,
could you check any other commits and forward this to the admin that set up your account.
