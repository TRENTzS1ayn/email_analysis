[mb] This discussion has to do with what DOM modules should be defined, and
where, not XML vs HTML.  Right now, we have all of our tests under core.
Since core must be implemented by everyone, we are implying that all should
support all of the tests.  In fact, the extended interfaces are not part of
the
"Core Module", and do not have to be implemented by anyone who does not
support the "XML Module".  This is somewhat confusing, given that both
modules are defined in the DOM Level-2 Core spec.  I would expect that some
of the errors you are finding in the Mozilla implementation are really
failures to
support the extended interfaces (XML Module), and fall into this category.

[mb] It's not simply a discussion of directory structure, and has to do more
with analyzing the results of the tests you are currently running.

[mb] The HTML DOM tests are next in the queue after the DOM Level 2 tests
are running.  They will have to be rewritten, as they
presupposed the ability to load an XML file synchronously, and attempted to
make use of common functions to get at nodes, and
their children.  I also expect that we will break out the one large HTML
file into sections, and have a set of tests correspond to a
smaller HTML file created soley for that purpose.  They will be committed as
each section is completed.
