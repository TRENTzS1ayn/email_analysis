Good, it seems that we all agree on that we want to give implementors 
the option to run the same DOM TS in different harnesses, depending on 
their needs.

In order to intensiffy this last part of producing the suite, I would 
again like to ask everyone to do the following, which would facilitate 
bringing it all together:

1. Send me a short description of the partculars you've been working on 
(except for the tests themselves and the transforms). This could be 
building, harness, validating, and so forth.
2. Check through your own work before we start the review period that 
was postponed two weeks ago.

Send me any documentation, notes, or pointers so that I can start 
producing the final documentation without having to dig through the 
etnire mailing list archive.

What we want, and obviously can, is to produce one set of code per 
binding and then llet implementors use a harness that suits their needs. 
Since we want to be able to let people test theis browser using a page 
on the DOM TS hierarchy, we are thinking of changing the old NIST 
harness to do this. This harness will use the same code that any 
packaged DOM TS will, so the only difference is that in this case people 
run the TS online, whereas they download the DOM TS in the latter case.

As I have been asked to do a demo for the DOM WG during the 13-14 
November DOM WG F2F, I'll primarily be trying to get things up and 
running on my machine (I've changed to Mac OS X, so if any of you have 
experience either on this platform or Linux, please advise).

So let's start three threads:
1. Ecma harness (here I believe the people that will work are Mary, 
Dimitris and if I remember correctly Jason)
2. Java (all, Philippe)
3. Documentation (Dimitris, with the contribution from all, especially 
Fred)

Packaging is straightforward, as is building. This still needs to be 
documented, though.

Best,
