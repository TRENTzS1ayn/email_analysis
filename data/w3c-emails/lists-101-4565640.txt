In building the ECMA harness, I have started with the original harness 
that was provided from the NIST web site:

    http://xw2k.sdct.itl.nist.gov/dom/index.html

This harness uses whatever DOM implementation is running on the 
client side, attempts to run available tests, and reports the results.
Each of the tests expect to have access to common xml load routines
and common assertion routines.  I expect that we can use the same 
code that is currently being used by the jsunit harness. The following 
needs to be done:

1) Integrate current load/assertion routines -- Mary
2) Validate load routines
            -- IE (Jason)
            -- Mozilla (Do we have a Netscape volunteer?)
3) Validate DOMException codes 
            -- IE (Jason)
            -- Mozilla ?
4) Determine high level interface -- all
            -- Do we want to run all tests, or be able to 
                discriminately pick appropriate tests?
5) Determine reporting mechanism
            -- simply dump returns from tests?
            -- color-code results?
            -- display expected vs actual?
            -- possibly modify code to accomodate 
                what we want to display.
6) Access to other testing resources ?
            -- test assertions, <subjects>
            -- view source code
            -- view portion of spec being tested.

Anything else?
