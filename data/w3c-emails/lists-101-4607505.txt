  5) Break up the rather large HTML files, which are loaded,
  to exercise the HTML DOM calls, into smaller files, each of
  which will be used for a small set of tests.  It may also be
  possible that we decide in favor of initializing the DOM tree
  by creating these nodes rather than reading them in from
  a file.


  [dd] Except if I'm misreading, wouldn't this be a step away from one test - one file that we've used so far

  [mb] Each test reads in an input file.  Currently, all 600 of the HTML 
  tests read in the same input file -- which tries to cover many of the 
  facets of HTML -- ie, frames, tables, lists, etc.  If a particular 
  implementation does not provide all the capabilities of HTML, or 
  provides them in a slightly different way, it can be hard to determine 
  what's failing and why.  This would be much easier if we broke up 
  this huge html file into smaller chunks, and just had tags that were 
  pertinent to what we were testing in that file -- or alternately, not load 
  a file at all, but rather have an init routine that would construct the 
  proper DOM nodes that would correspond to this file -- lets say 
  construct a table with 5 rows and 5 columns -- also include table 
  header info, table data info, etc that is necessary to exhaustively 
  test the DOM HTML Table functionality.  Create another set for 
  frames, another for forms, etc.  The actual tests will still be one 
  per file.
