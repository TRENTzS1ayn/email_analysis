I guess that I'm realizing that many of the 
assert routines are provided by the jsunit, junit 
frameworks themselves, and the additional 
routines, such as assertSize, assertEqualsCollection, 
assertEqualsList actually call the ones provided 
by the jsunit, junit framework.  Ugghh -- this means 
that we cannot use the ones provided by the 
junit, jsunit framework due to licensing restrictions 
and they will have to be recoded for our own use. 
I am running into this problem with jsunit -- I expect 
that the java harness will have the same issue.

Is that your understanding as well, Curt?
