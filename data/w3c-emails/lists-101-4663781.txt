After some clarifications, it is in fact ok to use IBM Public License or GPL
softwares for the DOM Test Suites. As long as we only use them, there is no
issues. If we need to modify them, then neither the GPL or the IBM Public license
would do it. The Apache license is fine.
So we don't really need to develop special harness for the DOM
Conformance Test Suites in ECMAScript and Java if we don't modify the *Unit
harnesses. As Dimitris pointed out, we still need to be sure that the tests can
be reused with an other harness.
