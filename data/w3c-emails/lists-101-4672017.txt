We are not modifying JUnit, Testlet, JSUnit, Nunit et al and I do not anticipate that we will.  When we have identified problems with one of the frameworks, their maintainers have been willing to
address the issue in a timely manner.

The Java tests have run (and I'll double check the CVS to make sure that I have put the code out there) with both JUnit and Avalon Testlet, so I feel pretty confident that the test jar could be run
with any arbitrary test framework after somebody has modified the adapter classes.

Using JUnit would be the preferred approach for Java testing, since you would assume that the target audience would be parser developers who want to integrate DOM tests into their build process or
external developers who want to determine compliance of a particular parser.

JSUnit while usable, isn't ideal for a relative novice who wants to determine how well a browser adheres to the recommendations.  Ideally, they could point their browser at a URL and run the tests
without any setup.
