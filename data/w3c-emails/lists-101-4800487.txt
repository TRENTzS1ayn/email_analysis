I've got the test suite working tolerably with Internet Explorer 5, MSXML 3.0 and JSUnit.  I'll try Netscape Navigator 6.x next and then IE5 + Adobe SVG Viewer.

To run the suite:

1) ant dom1-core-gen-jsunit  ' this will build *.html files for JSUnit in build/ecmascript/level1/core

2) Load lib/jsunit/testRunner.html in IE 5

3) Select Browse and load build\ecmascript\level1\core\alltests.html

4) Press Run

Conformance issues with MSXML 3:

documenttypegetentities and documenttypegetentitieslength:

Not discarding duplicate entities.

Several issues involve null strings as previously discussed here and on the www-dom mailing list.

domimplementationfeaturenoversion fails since "" is not recognized as a "unspecified" version number.  (See http://www.w3.org/2000/11/DOM-Level-2-errata#core-14)

domimplementationfeaturenull attempts to pass null as a feature argument and results in a type mismatch error.  I believe NN will also fail this test.  I do not believe this test is appropriate for bindings where null is not in the value space of String (i.e. appropriate for Java not for JavaScript).

entitypublicidnull, notationpublicidnull and notationsystemidnull all fail since the implementation returns "" instead of null.  Again I believe that NN will also fail these tests.

Several other issues that need more research.
