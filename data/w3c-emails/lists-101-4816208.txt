Got Mozilla testing working.  Kinda kludgy, but it seems to work.

Mozilla doesn't support sychronous loading and would be pretty complicated to rework the tests to work asynchronously.  To work around this, a couple of test documents are loaded before the tests are initiated and test documents are loaded in anticipation of future use.  When there is not a test document already available, an message box is displayed to stall the tests until the test document is loaded.

Target dom1-core-gen-jsunit will build the tests, target dom1-core-jsunit-zip will build a zip file.  A copy of the zip file can be downloaded from http://home.houston.rr.com/curta/dom1-core-ecma.zip

To run the tests, load lib/jsunit/testRunner.html in either IE 5 or Mozilla 0.9.3.  Then select build/ecmascript/level1/core/alltests.html (will crash Mozilla) or mozsafe.html (eliminates 3 tests that crash Mozilla) and press run.

Quite a few tests will fail apparently since document.docType apparently returns null.  The tests will not work with Netscape 6.0 or Netscape 6.1.
