That is good news.

The general feeling was that over-descriptive test names are a nuisance and MixedCase file names and test names would be preferable.  MethodNameXX or PropertyNameXX should be sufficient.  If a test
can't be keyed to one specific property, then you could name it something like "EventPropagation01.xml".  The test matrix should provide much better organization than could be achieved by relying on
file names.

I would also suggest that assertion ids be made shorter, they only have to be unique within the test.  For <assertEquals> that the id of the assertion be either the variable checked or the property
that produced the value when possible.  Something like:

<assertEquals actual="value" expected="expectedValue" id="value"/>

For assertDOMException, I would recommend that the id be "throw_" + exception code:

<assertDOMException id="throw_INDEX_SIZE_ERR">
<INDEX_SIZE_ERR>
...
