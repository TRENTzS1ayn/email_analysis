Robert, Edward

I believe Robert's work is a significant step toward solving some of 
JsUnit's problems, allowing it to continue being a preferred testing 
framework for ECMA.

To increase supported platforms, I'd like to volounteer to help on the 
PPC platform. The products I could provide feedback on are:

Mac OS 9; Netscape, IE, Opera, Mozilla

Mac OS X; Netscape, IE, Mozilla, Opera, OmniWeb

Debian 3.0 for PPC (Linux flavour); Mozilla, Konqueror

I hope to be able to provide help so that JsUnit can be run on a larger 
number of platforms/implementations.

Perhaps others in the group can do the same for the platform they're 
working on?

Kind regards,

/Dimitris
