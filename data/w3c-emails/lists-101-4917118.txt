Earlier versions of JSUnit did use an array to determine the test functions.
The imitation "reflection" that was implemented since other xUnit
implementations (specifically JUnit) did not require explicit test
identification and the explicit test definition was dropped.

It might be useful to come up with a hybrid approach, allow the user to
provide an explicit test declaration to support more browsers, or use
implicit test discovery for existing tests or for ease of use.
