All,

In order to be able to release the full level 1 DOM TS, we need to look 
into the following issues:

1. Framework. A contact has been made between Bob and Edward on the 
JsUnit framework. People from this list have volounteered to help in the 
effort, so please feel free to tell us what you need help with.
2. HTML tests. We still need to sanitycheck the HTML tests, both the 
transcribed NIST ones and the submitted ones from Netscape. Has aynoen 
built/run those?
3. Grant of license wording. Philippe, do you have the final woringd yet?
