Though I have no problem with making JSUnit better, I'm not sure if it will
be satisifactory since there is a lot of configuration that you would like
to do in the test runner that can't be easily represented by selecting one
of a collection of suites.

I've compiled them for Java (to check for type mismatches), but haven't ran
them on anything.  Since the L1 suite contains a variant of all the L2 HTML
tests, it is probably best to finish the sanity check on L2 HTML then visit
the L1 HTML tests.
