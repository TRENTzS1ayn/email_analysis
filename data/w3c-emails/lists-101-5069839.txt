This error looks similar to what was happening with some of the tests in IE.
It fails the Asize check for HTMLAnchorElement01 and passes the Asize
check for HTMLAnchorElement02.  Both tests are using the same file so
I don't understand why one would pass and one would fail.

  The report shows the results from Mozilla 0.9.9. Notice that all the capitalization failures that were in the NN 6.2 report have been fixed. Almost all of these look like a single bug, perhaps the tag name in the implementation class is not all lower case and is failing on a case-sensitive comparison.
