This error looks similar to what was happening with some of the tests in IE.
It fails the Asize check for HTMLAnchorElement01 and passes the Asize
check for HTMLAnchorElement02.  Both tests are using the same file so
I don't understand why one would pass and one would fail.

Do they fail when run in isolation?  I don't have time to check right now.
If they work in isolation, but fail in when run in the suite, a test might
be lying about whether it modifies its test document and a subsequent test
gets a corrupted test document.
