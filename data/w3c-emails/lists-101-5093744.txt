I'll give it a try.

Just some more info that might shed some light 
on the problem.  I ran the Level 2 html test suite
on IE and received 126 failures.  I didn't close
the browser and re-ran the test suite and
had 140 failures.

Curt when you get a chance could you send
me the versions of the software you are using:
ant, saxon, etc.
