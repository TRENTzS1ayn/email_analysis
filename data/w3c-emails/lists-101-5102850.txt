Here's the results from running the tests
on Mozilla 0.9.9.
__________________________________________________________

I first ran  HTMLAnchorElement01 test by itself
and got the error: 

 "Asize"
Expected 1 (number) but was 0 (number)
___________________________________________________________

I then put two entries in the alltests.xml file
HTMLAnchorElement01 and HTMLAnchorElement02.

I still got the same error as above for HTMLAnchorElement01
and HTMLAnchorElement02 ran successfully.
____________________________________________________________
 
I then ran the same two tests again changing the order in the alltests.xml file.
HTMLAnchorElement02 first and
HTMLAnchorElement01 second.

This time HTMLAnchorElement02 received the Asize error and
HTMLAnchorElement01 ran successfully.
