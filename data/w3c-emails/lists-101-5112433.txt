Thanks Rick.  

That appears to mean that anchor.xml isn't loaded until after the first test
has completed.  This might be the same problem that causes Mozilla to have
slightly different results for the DOM L1 Core tests.  In that case, the
test failure count would only vary by +/- 1, but then the DOM L1 Core tests
only loaded one XML document and the HTML tests load 20 or so.

You might try editing alltests.html and take the first test of each "family"
and duplicating it and calling the first one something like,
"testHTMLAnchorElementXX" and run the test again and ignore any test
failures on the XX tests.  That should at least clarify which tests are
really failing and which ones might be being run before the document has
been completely loaded.

Fixing the problem will require taking advantage of the pretest hook that
Bob Clary was adding to JSUnit or finally getting the custom runner working.
