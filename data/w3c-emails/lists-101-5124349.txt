I ran the tests after editing alltests.html and am now only
getting 14 failures out of 427 tests.  I also had to comment
out the (2)HTMLOptGroupElement* and (13)HTMLSelectElement*
tests that currently have bug reports filed by Curt.

I am in the process of checking the tests to see if the problem is with
the test or the implementation.

Curt can I also take the same approach with the html_alltests.html file
so that I can run the tests on IE?

Here are the results
