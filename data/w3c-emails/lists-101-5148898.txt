Thank you very much for your email.  I will certainly be integrating your
changes into JsUnit.  If you like, I will work with you on the additional,
as yet not done, improvements that you list.

Concerning your point about perhaps using an array to list the test function
names instead of attempting to inspect the document: in fact that is how it
used to work until I found ways in all the browsers currently supported to
"reflect" against the Test Page.  It should be quite easy to add that
mechanism back in, ideally alongside the current one.  For example, if the
function "getTestFunctionNames()" existed, we would use that, and otherwise
use the existing way.

- Edward
