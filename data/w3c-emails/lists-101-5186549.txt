I'm not sure what is going on when you are running the tests on IE.

I believe both IE and Mozilla return absolute URI's for the
HTMLApplet.codebase attribute.  The text doesn't explicitly prohibit or
require returning an absolute URI.

I added an <assertURIEquals> element into the DOM TS language for such a
case, but I don't believe that is has been used yet and not sure if the
supporting code is implemented.

HTMLFormElement.name does not specify what connection this property accessor
has with the [X]HTML content.  <form> does not have a name attribute
defined.  The test expects that value of the id attribute to be returned.

All tests look like a problem with the class created for the <head> element
in the implementation.  Similar tests on other elements seem to work fine.

The content of the version attribute of the html element differ between
html.html and html.xml.  Would be better if html.html and html.xml both
contained the same version attribute.

Looks like an implementation bug.  "checked" is the only legal value for the
checked attribute in XHTML 1.0's DTD.  I assume that the implementation
didn't check for that value and just passed the attribute value to a boolean
conversion routine.

Looks like an implementation problem, but if fixed would run into the issue
from test #10.

The corresponding .xml document isn't valid XHTML as the bgcolor element has
been deprecated.  The HTML DOM spec isn't clear if the bgcolor should
reflect the color as implied by a stylesheet or only an explicit bgcolor
attribute.

It would be good if you could test the test documents against the W3C XHTML
and HTML validation service.  Got to run.
