dom1.dtd is generated by the dom1-dtd target.  Unfortunately, the
dom1-core-metadata target did not declare its dependency on the dom1-dtd
target.  I've updated build.xml to address resolve the issue.

I've also updated the URL for the DOM 3 XPath WD, but I'll still have to
manually prepare an updated dom3.dtd and dom3.xsd.
