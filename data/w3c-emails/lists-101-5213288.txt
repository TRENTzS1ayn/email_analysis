Sorry.  I hit the wrong button by mistake.
I wasn't finished with the message.


 A while back the question was sent to the list
asking if Strict or Transitional should be used for 
 validating documents.  
 
 Below is a link to the question.
 http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom-ts/2001Dec/0040.html
 
 The question was never answered.  It has come up again
due to failure of one of the tests documented below.
There are some attributes that have been deprecated and
will fail strict validation and pass transitional validation.

How should deprecated attributes be handled?
