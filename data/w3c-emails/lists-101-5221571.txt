My leaning would be that if it is possible to test the feature using a
STRICT document, then use a strict document.  Since there should come a day
when the transition is past, using strict should produce the most widely
applicable tests.

The tests that use HTMLFormElement.name to check that the appropriate form
was returned should be changed to use HTMLElement.id and/or assertSame()
instead of forcing the test document to be transitional just to put a name
attribute in.

I'm not sure if the spec provides any guidance to whether a strict (only)
implementation could throw an exception or map an deprecated attribute to
another attribute.
