We'll have to look at where this is occurring, and see if this is the only
reason the test input file is transitional.  I only see 8 tests that use
<name interface="HTMLFormElement" ...we'll take a look at them.

The bigger problem we are having at the moment is the number of
DOM constructs that refer to items that are deprecated in HTML 4.0.
Testing these forces the HTML documents to be transitional.  I would
think that since they are in the DOM spec, we would be interested in
having tests for them in the test suite.  If someone has an implemention
that doesn't support transitional HTML, these tests would be problematic
for them.  I'm not seeing anything in the spec that addresses what should
be done if a deprecated feature is not supported.
