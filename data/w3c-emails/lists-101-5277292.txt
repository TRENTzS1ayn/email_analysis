The caching of unmodified test documents seemed to me to introduce a 
great deal of complexity without necessarily adding a corresponding 
degree of benefit. However that is the subject of a different discussion 
I think.

It may be possible to do what you want by organizing the tests into 
suite of suites and having the final suite perform the cleanup.

This reminds me however that the Document Loader in jsUnit currently is 
limited to a single document at a time. This may be a limitation that 
needs to be addressed in the proposed jsUnit. How important is it to 
load multiple test documents at the same time in general and in the DOM 
TS in particular?
