To begin with, thanks Robert and Edward for the work. I will certainly 
try to provide as much feedback as possible.

[dd] I think the easiest approach would be that the previously released 
DOM TS is deprecated in view of the one we are going to release next, 
Level1 with HTML, where we can include the latest version of JsUnit. 
Documentation and so forth will of course be updated.

[dd] On this I have no obvious idea, but it will certainly be raised, so 
we had better deal with it. I think this list's authority on this issue 
is Curt.

[dd] Robert, first please report to the list how Mozilla behaves under 
the circustances you mention. Second, coudl the Microsoft representative 
please provide feedback here? That will bring us one step closer to 
support in both major browsers.

[dd] I'll run the DOM TS on my machine (OS X, OS 9, both Mac, and Linux 
for PPC, Debian distribution, where I hope to be able to run it on 
Konqueror and Mozilla 0.9.9, yesterday's nightly build).

Curt, I remember that you had cc:ed this list a message to the Konqueror 
community, are you still active there? Their feedback would also be 
meaningful.

In http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom-ts/2002Mar/0002.html I 
raised some of the issues you touch on here and cc:ed Microsoft's 
representative for the Mac platform. I haven't seen any feedback and 
kindly invite the rep. to try the modified JsUnit and report to this 
list or to Edward and Robert on how IE on Mac behaves.
