Whatever approach we take should provide support for more browsers than 
just Internet Explorer and Netscape 6/Mozilla.

Mozilla loads the XML Document as is and does not modify it. You can see 
the results in the jsUnit 1.3.0 alpha tests by running the optional 
jsUnitTestLoadStaff.html test which loads the staff.xml document from 
the DOM TS and performs some brain dead tests on it.

Mozilla loads the XML Document into the document of the IFRAME while 
Internet Explorer appears to transform the XML Document into DHTML.

Thanks! I am also trying to recruit testers with as many different 
browsers as possible. Until we all implement the W3C Standards, Cross 
Browser development is a nightmare! :-)
