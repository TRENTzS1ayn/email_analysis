[bc] No, I don't think you are off track. The current design can 
probably be modified to support loading documents into separate windows 
although handling the onload notification in Mozilla may be problematic.

The question I have is "do any of the tests actually require that two or 
more documents be open at the same time?". If so, then this is a must 
have feature for jsUnit and the DOM TS.

However, if it is only a convenience originally introduced as a partial 
work around for problems encountered earlier due to asynchronous 
document loading, is the complexity worth it?

I consider Memory performance to be an absolute requirement for 
supporting as many testers as possible. We can not require each tester 
to have 1G of ram to run the tests. However I do not consider speed as 
important. If the tests take a few minutes longer without document 
caching, no one will be excluded from running the tests.
