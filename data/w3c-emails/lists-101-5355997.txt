[bc] agreed. It could even be used as a final reporting step if someone 
wished to do so. I will discuss with Edward approaches for providing 
this. This opens the possibility of tests maintaining state somewhere in 
the jsUnit framework which I think is easily done.

[bc] Ah! Of course, the perfect example. If this is a special case, as 
it appears to be, perhaps we can use a custom approach for it instead of 
generalizing jsUnit. This can be achieved by using an iframe in the test 
page combined with the one already a part of the document loader or by 
two iframes in the test page. The precondition for the test to begin 
would be that both test documents had loaded. This was the style I used 
in my original update to jsUnit. I removed it in 1.3.0 alpha in order to 
relieve test authors of having to manage the document loading logic.

[bc] Agreed unless someone can provide us with a compelling reason.
