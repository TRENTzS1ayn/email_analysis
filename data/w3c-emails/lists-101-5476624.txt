According to http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom-
ts/2002Apr/0014.html (inlined) that I sent a couple of weeks ago, we're 
working on 1 and 3, and need to continue with 2. Also, as Jeroen 
indicates, we'd have to produce a level 3 transform before X-Hive can 
start converting tests.

All,

In order to be able to release the full level 1 DOM TS, we need to look 
into the following issues:

1. Framework. A contact has been made between Bob and Edward on the 
JsUnit framework. People from this list have volounteered to help in the 
effort, so please feel free to tell us what you need help with.
[dd] Work is undergoing, I need to report on running on IE/NS(mozilla) 
for Mac

2. HTML tests. We still need to sanitycheck the HTML tests, both the 
transcribed NIST ones and the submitted ones from Netscape. Has aynoen 
built/run those?
[dd] This is what we need to concentrate on

3. Grant of license wording. Philippe, do you have the final woringd yet?
[dd] Work underway, we can still release the full level 1 suite without 
solving this, but we need to look into it for tests that are to be 
submitted from now on.

[...]

Other things: I have personally heard nothing on using the DOM TS in IE 
for Mac and have had no follow up from the Microsoft representative I 
spoke to during the W3C Tech Plenary.

Also, if possible, could someone run the level 2 TS in IE on Windows and 
report the results to me? I need to report back to the DOM IG list on 
results and would prefer having the results from a clean Windows 
environment test reather than doing it in my Windows emulation 
environment.

[dd] this would be in line with what many have stated they want for the 
ECMA TS. However, you yourself indicated that this could grow out of 
proportion if we were to do the same thing for Java in 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom-ts/2002Apr/0006.html. We may 
need to strike a fair tradeoff somewhere.
