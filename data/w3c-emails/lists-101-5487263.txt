     We  are currently adding subject lines to the level1 and level2 HTML tests and should
     be able to commit them soon.  
 
     I've been getting inconsistent results when running the HTML tests on both
     Mozilla and IE6 using jsUnit.    I used Curt's suggestion(see below) on Mozilla and
     added a dummy test at the beginning of each interface and am getting
     10 errors out of the 442 tests.

       I've not had as much success on IE6.  The results have been very
       inconsistent.  I'll run the tests and 130 errors will be reported.  I'll
       close the browser and run the tests again without making any changes
       and will have 120 errors.
