Not sure I understand why we have 4 tests -
Perhaps we should set the attribute to be something different
than what was originally in the file -- the use of  %ent1 was
an error, but rather than using &ent1;, which is what is in the
xml file already, we should set it to &ent2; - then it may be less
confusing.

What's the purpose of the additional tests.  Curt, did you create
attrcreatetextnode2, and forget to change the metadata info?  I
don't think that is a test that we created.  Could you please explain
the differences and the additional need for attrcreatetextnode2, 3, & 4?

I would think in general if a test has a bug, we should agree on a
fix and fix the original test rather than creating additional tests.  Is
there something more going on here than is stated in the description.
It does appear that you are trying to do something with nodevalue as
well -- could you provide a little more detail?
