Hmmm -- not I'm even more confused.  When I looked at 
the original test, I thought that the expected result was 
supposed to be "Y&ent1;", not the expanded version.  I 
don't have the spec in front of me at the moment, but I 
believe both it and the comment against it were that the 
expected result should not expand the entity, rather be 
the text itself.  Thus, there was a problem with the test, 
setting the result to "Y%ent1" instead of "Y&ent1;".  At 
that point, I would have changed the test to simply use 
"Y&ent1;" instead.  After further consideration, it might 
be better to change it to be some other entity, maybe 
"Y&ent2;", since that particular attribute is already set 
to "Y&ent1;" in the staff.xml file -- it's difficult to determine 
that the setValue actually did anything otherwise.

P.S.  Please for the moment cc: Rick and/or myself or 
www-dom-ts issues if you want feedback.  We seem to 
be having problems getting mail from this list.
