You have set some of the privacy preferences which prevent web sites 
from doing things you do not like. That particular preference prevents a 
script from setting the window.status which jsUnit uses at least in the 
preTest completion polling.

If this is a problem we could potentially remove attempting to set the 
status bar text. However note that Mozilla will also allow you to set 
other preferences which would likely cause the jsUnit or other tests to 
fail. In particular, the preference for blocking opening windows by 
onload handlers might cause problems. I believe the best approach is 
just to make sure that Mozilla users know how these preferences might 
affect their ability to run the tests.
