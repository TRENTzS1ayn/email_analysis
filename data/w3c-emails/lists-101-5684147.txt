Did you use jsUnit 1.3.0 alpha? It is dramatically different from the 
jsUnit 1.2.6 that is currently used in the DOM TS and I do not think can 
be used to run existing DOM TS test pages without modification.

As soon as we can settle the issues of cross browser support especially 
with respect to loading external data documents asynchronously, we can 
begin to consider how to either modify what I have done in jsUnit 1.3.0 
alpha to be more backwardly compatible with existing tests or how to 
modify the existing tests to take advantage of the new features in 
jsUnit. I don't think we are quite ready for that however.
