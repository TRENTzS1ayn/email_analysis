Have you given any thoughts on loading SVG or MathML documents?

In the current stuff, if you load a test suite (or individual test) that
specifies a content type of "image/svg+xml" then SVG versions of the test
documents (staff.svg, etc) are loaded by an "appropriate" SVG implementation
and its DOM implementation is tested.  I was primarily using this to test
the Adobe SVG control under IE.

I guess the same thing would apply to testing MathML implementations, but
haven't done any work with them.
