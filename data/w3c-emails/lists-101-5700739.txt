Not as you describe. What you are describing is a type of content 
negotiation by content type. I have been looking at the document loading 
issue as one where you specified the exact document you wished to test.

I believe this will probably fall under the idea you had regarding 
specifying the test configuration, but I have not had time to look into 
that in more detail.
