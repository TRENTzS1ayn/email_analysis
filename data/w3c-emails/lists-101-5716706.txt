Yes, I'm getting a bit confused by the lag in getting e-mail
messages as well.  Yes, my preference would be to just
have two tests, with whatever we need to put in the DOM
TSML file(s) to get the required result -- if that means
using "Y&amp;ent1;", that's okay by me.  I think using
attrcreatetextnode and attrcreatetextnode2 as test names
are more consistent with the rest of the test suite than
using 3 and 4.  I haven't looked but probably goes for
level 2 as well.
