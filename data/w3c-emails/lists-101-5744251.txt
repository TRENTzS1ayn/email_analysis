I think the intent was:

If you loaded the Doctype, its Entity nodes would be created. Period. I
can't see any reason NOT to load that info if you're able to do so...?

In the main document content tree, you would have EntityReference nodes if
the reference was not (or could not be?) fully expanded. The decision of
whether or not to do that expansion was originally left up to the processor
(or equivalent DOM builder). Presumably if you use DOM Load/Save you'd
control it from there.
