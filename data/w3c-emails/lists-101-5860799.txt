Attached is a filter test which generated test1.java if you leave out the
<whatToShow...> element.
Can someone have a look at this and tell me how you would have to specify
<whatToShow> in this case (I've been staring on it a while now) ?
I'd also like to know how you can refer to constants defined in other
interfaces,e.g. NodeFilter.SHOW_ELEMENT.
Thanks in advance,

Jeroen
