There are no attributes defined for <startElement> when it is used to define
an inner class method.  The parameter list is built from the parameter names
in the spec.

Validating the test against the schema is very helpful to identify usage
errors.  For example, in the context of an inner class <startElement> has no
attributes, so it would flag this problem immediately.

I've been using Sun's multischema validator, primarily because it had a
command line that would you validate a fileset against on schema.
Unfortunately, it seems to have some problems with the entity expansion.
For my personal convienience, I manually expanded the entities and then
fixed the schema validity errors.  I've put comments in text1.xml where I
made changes.

I don't think there currently any read-write attributes on user implemented
interfaces, but for that day, I've added an intermediate <get> (and <set>
when appropriate) elements on inner class attributes.  So an implementation
of DOMFilterBuilder.whatToShow now looks like:

<whatToShow>
<get>
<return value="1"/>
</get>
</whatToShow>


dom3-ls-javac.jar and dom3-ls-jar will now compile the sample test.  Though
I haven't attempted to run the test with a DOM L3 Load-Save implementation.
