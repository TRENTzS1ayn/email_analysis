tablecell.html:  

Changed BGCOLOR="00FFFF" to BGCOLOR="#00FFFF" and BGCOLOR="FF0000" to BGCOLOR="#FF0000".  A similar change was made 6 weeks ago to tablecell.xml, but the corresponding change to .html wasn't made.  IE6 will apparently "repair" the bad color value and add a "#" and pass the test as it was, however we shouldn't be throwing bad test documents at an implementation.

map.html

map element had both name and id attributes but with different values.  Brought in line with map.xml which was corrected 6 weeks ago also.

font.xml, font.html

Tests expected "arial, helvetica", documents had "arial, helvitica"
