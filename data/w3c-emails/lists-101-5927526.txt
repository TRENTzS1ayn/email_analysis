Hello all,

I was tasked by the DOM WG to run the DOM Level 2 HTML test suite in 
Mozilla and Microsoft's Internet Explorer in order to move the DOM Level 
2 HTML specification forward. So far I've only been succesful at running 
these tests and getting results using Mozilla (current trunk, which 
should match 1.1), I'm unable to run the test suite in IE due to errors 
either in the test harness, or in IE that cause the test suite to not 
run more than a few tests. I'm still working on getting results from IE, 
but here's the results from running the tests in Mozilla.
