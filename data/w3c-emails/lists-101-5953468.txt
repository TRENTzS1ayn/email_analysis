Hello,

I am trying to run the DOM-TS-Level1-Core testsuite in Konqueror
(KDE's web browser, which I help developing).

The first problem I'm hitting is that the TOC-generation in 
index.htm doesn't work, because the document has an XHTML doctype 
(and uses accordingly lowercase tag names, like <div> and <h2>),
 but the Javascript code (in resources/toc.js) calls
getElementsByTagName("DIV")
getElementsByTagName("H2")
etc. (using uppercase tag names)

Due to the XHTML declaration, Konqueror looks for lowercase tag names,
and doesn't understand what the uppercase DIV and H2 tags are about.
Is that a Konqueror bug, or is that behaviour correct (and toc.js wrong) ?


This is the testsuite I found on http://www.w3.org/DOM/. Is there any other,
more up-to-date, testsuite I could test in Konqueror? DOM Level 2 should work 
too, but I wanted to start small and progress incrementally ;)
