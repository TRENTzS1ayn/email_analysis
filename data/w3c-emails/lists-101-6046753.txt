Most of that previous message was mistaken.  The object attribute is supposed to contain a URL locating a resource containing the serialization data for the applet, not the serialization data itself.

I've added a void main() to DOMTSApplet.java to produce a file containing the serialized content.  The JDK 1.1.8 serialization has been put in the CVS as java/applets/DOMTSApplet.dat and java/applets/org/w3c/domts/DOMTSApplet.class was updated.

I modified applet2.html and applet2.xml to reference DOMTSApplet.dat and they now properly display the DOM TS Applet in IE (HTML only) and Mozilla (HTML and XHTML).  Doesn't seem to change the test results for IE, but since the page is now correct and complete, then the test is reasonable.

Build has been updated to copy the DOMTSApplet.dat file to the HTML L1 and HTML L2 test directories.

applet.xml referenced the undefined org.w3c.domts.DOMTSApplet1.class.  While investigating this, I realized that we had lost the ability to test XHTML implementations.  I'll try to restore that this weekend.
