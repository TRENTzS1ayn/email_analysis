Thanks.
The last issue I have with tables is insertRow(-1). The DOM says
"the new row is appended". But to which section? To the last <tbody>, or to 
the last section in logical order, which could be a <tfoot> ?
Note that insertRow(rows.length) would do the latter.

The test HTMLTableElement39 seem to indicate that the new row is added
to the <tbody> section, not to the <tfoot>. I would have no problem with that.... 
but this doesn't even seem to be the case in Internet Explorer v6 - IIRC the 
insertRow(-1) behavior was supposed to be copied from IE. If that's the
case, then the test must be fixed, to look at the tfoot after inserting the row.

Same issue with deleteRow(-1), in HTMLTableElement40.
