David Faure already reported some problems of this kind in the test
suite. We really to fix those before the publication of test suite...

However, because the rows in a table are numbered with TFOOT rows at the end, it's not clear to which section insertRow should append: The last existing section? The TFOOT? The TBODY?

Netscape/Mozilla will insert the new row in the last existing section.
IE/Win is somehow inconsistent:
Try the following: create the following table in memory by using only
createElement and appendChild (instead of using
createTHead/createTFoot):

<table>
<thead></thead>
<tfoot></tfoot>
</table>

If you do table.insertRow(0), you'll obtain:

<table>
<thead></thead>
<tfoot></tfoot>
<tbody><tr></tr></tbody>
</table>

Now, if you create this table:

<table>
<thead><tr></tr></thead>
<tfoot></tfoot>
</table>

and do table.insertRow(1), you'll obtain:

<table>
<thead><tr></tr></thead>
<tfoot><tr></tr></tfoot>
<tbody></tbody>
</table>

Note that tbody elements are created and that's not a defined behavior
in the spec. (insertRow only creates a tbody if the table is empty).
same thing for createThead/createTFoot, they create tbody as well.

I believe that Netscape is going to change this behavior.

Regarding the specification, it's too late for an update. If we do
something, it will be in an erratum now.
