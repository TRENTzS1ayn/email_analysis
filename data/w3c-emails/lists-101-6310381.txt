The test suite also works with Oracle's XDK 9.0.2.0.0D (current beta) but not with the officially released version due to an older JAXP version.  Downloadable from http://technet.oracle.com (may require registration)

If the Oracle parser is the only JAXP implementation on the path (or you have configured JAXP to run the Oracle parser), then you can either "java -jar dom1-core.jar" or run TestDefaultParser from the GUI.  You can also run TestOracle and TestOracleAltConfig from the JUnit GUI or from the command line.

The parsers that I have tested (or presume to work from previous experience)

Xerces-J 1
Xerces-J 2
Oracle XDK 9.0.2.0.0D
Crimson 1.1.3
GNUJAXP
DOM4J

I'd obviously expect the IBM XML4J's to work, but I haven't tested them.

Batik is close and may just require a little work on its side.

The ECMAScript harness I have tested with IE 6 and Mozilla 0.9.7 (on WinXP) and IE 6 + Adobe SVG Viewer 3 (running svgalltests.html)
