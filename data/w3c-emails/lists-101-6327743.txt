In view of relesaing later this week, I'm building the TS with the 
latest CVS snapshot (taken a few minutes ago).

dom1-core-jar fails, has anyone else experienced this?

matrix, schema seems to work fine.

Rick, do your problems with the new jsunit work affect the ability to 
run the dom1-core tests as well?
