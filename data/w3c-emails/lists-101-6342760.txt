Did the same, a full source get into a new directory, worked just fine.

I'll produce a distributable containing:

1. Java tests (Junit)
2. Ecma tests (JsUnit)
3. Doxygen information
4. XML source
5. Doxygen information (optional, except if people definitely want it 
in?)
6. Test Matrix

I'll have to work a bit on the matrix XSLT first, though.

The first diiistributable is mainly for internal sanity check and error 
checking. While doing that, we could also discuss whether we go for two 
separate dstributables (Java and ECMA) or one containing both bindings. 
If we add Doxygen, we get 4 or 2, respectively.
