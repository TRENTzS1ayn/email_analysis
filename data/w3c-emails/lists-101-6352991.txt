Would be interesting to know the exact type of
failure.  I did rebuild the suite after my last commit
with a full source get into a new directory.  So
whatever the problem is doesn't seem to appear on my
setup.

Also, I can't recreate Rick's failure either.  Though
I have sent him a checklist offlist (I didn't notice
that he had cc'd www-dom-ts).

p.s. Please cc to CurtA@hyprotech.com
