I don't believe Doxygen produces documentation of ECMAScript code, so there
would be only one optional Doxygen download, not two.

I expected to have heard from Edward Hiatt (the JSUnit guy) about
incorporating the patches that I supplied.  Usually he has been very quick
to respond.  Obviously, asking end users to patch JSUnit is not a good
solution and if we can't get the code (or functionally equivalent) into
JSUnit, then we would probably back off the changes that eliminated the
interdependency between locations of the tests and JSUnit.  However, I hope
it doesn't come to that.
