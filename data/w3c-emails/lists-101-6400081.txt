[dd] We'll know pretty soon, I hope to be able to finalize the matrix 
XSLT (basically to simplify reading and allow linking to tests (locally) 
as well as print out test purpose in table form before it gets too late) 
as well as zip the entire distribution. I'll post results later, 
tomorrow morning at the latest (GMT +1)

[dd] No, even if I'm thinking of running them that way if it solves my 
problem of it (still) not working on my OSX machine; problems with the 
path. However, if I'm the only one experienceing problems with JsUnit, 
let's not spend more time on changing the code and instead hope that 
Edward replies soon.
