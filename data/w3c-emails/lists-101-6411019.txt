I have run the ECMAScript suite long time ago with Mozilla on Linux, but
won't be able to do that until Saturday at the earliest.

Does the problem affect both Mozilla and IE on OS X?  

Can JSUnit pass its internal sanity tests (in the jsunits/tests directory)?


Does JSUnit accidentally use backslashes instead of forward slashes for
relative references (I can check this in a few hours)?
