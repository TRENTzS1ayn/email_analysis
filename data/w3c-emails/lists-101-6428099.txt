1. Added copyright statement at the bottom
2. Uses generic W3C stylesheet, same as for DOM TS page
3. Uses 2 columns strictly to avoid table being outside browser's width
4. Writes out test description in full, as some browsers don't show the 
entire desc if it's big (eg. Netscape 0.98)
5. Test name if clicked opens up the xml source
6. Outputs headers for interfaces for easier readability

If we decide to keep my proposed version of verbatim text instead of in 
the title attribute, it's easy to delete relevant constructs in the 
transform, I let them in just in case. Currently, the tests in the right 
column in all tables axcept for the last one, where the tests are to the 
left, point to the local copy.

The transform now produces correct links to the local copies of the test 
files, however, I didn't manage to convert the test name case: using the 
translate() function xalan produced jibberish. If case-sensitivity will 
be a problem, we need to look into this.

Curt, as you wrote the original transform, please sanitycheck. I did not 
use your emit-tite template, for example, but made the linkbuilder 
inline. Please feel free to change this if it disturbs the logic in a 
way I didn't anticipate.

Also, I'll generate the distributable tomorrow as it's 4:30 over here.

I think that's it.
