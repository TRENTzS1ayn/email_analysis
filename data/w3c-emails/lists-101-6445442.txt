Maybe not, [1] says "element type names exposed through a property are
in uppercase", but what really confuses me is [2].
Before reading the above, I was naive enough to think that a doctype
declaration would be enough to define DOM behaviour....

If I understand correctly you are talking about HTML, not XHTML. So I
guess [1] is correct in this case.
