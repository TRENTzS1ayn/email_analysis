Everything seems to run smoothly, I've looked a bit at filesizes and 
such.

The distribution I'm about to package consists of:

index.htm -- DOM TS starter, pointer to DOM TS page, CVS repository, 
documentation on how to run the suite etc
build/ -- pretty much what you get after build minus the doxygen folder 
(the size of the latter is 13,1 MB, so we may want to make it optional 
after all; the doxygen.zip is 2,2 MB)
dist/ -- dom1-core-doxygen.zip, dom1-core-jar, junit-run.jar, junit.jar
lib/ -- jsunit and junit folders
tests/ -- DOM Level 1 core xml tests

Total size uncompressed: 28,4 MB (without Doxygen 12,9 MB uncompressed, 
with Doxygen compressed 15,1 MB). So we'll go for including the zipped 
Doxygen folder, giving us a size for the distribution of 5,6 MB (we 
could get this down to 3,4 if we omit Doxygen altogether and make it 
optional).

Some things that need to be done:

Links in the doxygen documentation need to be checked, I'm not sure all 
work. Also, I've no idea where the Doxygen folder must reside relative 
to the source files.

General sanity check: imagine that you've downloaded the DOM TS and 
click away like mad to check that everything is there. Run it to see 
that everything is OK and read the documentation to make sure that 
nothing has been left out.

If we have any possibility of trying to get feedback for JsUnit before 
this weekend and release Sunday/Monday, that would be even better. I 
suppose that was the last open issue?

I'll make the distr available and post a link to the mailinglist shortly.
