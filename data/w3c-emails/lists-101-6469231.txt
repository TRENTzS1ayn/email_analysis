You forgot:
[[
For DOM Level 1 [HTML], the transitional and frameset DTDs for HTML 4.0
are assumed.
]]
http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-DOM-Level-1-19981001/level-one-html.html#ID-1176245063

XHTML cannot me manipulated with the DOM Level 1 HTML. Have a look at
DOM Level 2 HTML in order to manipulate XHTML 1.0 documents.

Mozilla behaves correctly.

http://www.w3.org/2002/01/test/htmlorxml2
http://www.w3.org/2002/01/test/htmlorxml3
will tell you if, depending on the mime type, the browser loads the DOM
tree correctly.

HTML is a special since it is not XML, so the rules differ. If you
manipulate an HTML or an XHTML document using the DOM Level 2 HTML, the
rules will be different.

Yes, for HTML 4.0 documents.
