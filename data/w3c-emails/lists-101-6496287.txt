The left column links were all href="$feature" due to
a missing {} in the transform.

I dropped the text after colons in the description
which prettied up the exception codes in the subjects.

Exception scenarios have not had an assigned ID in the
existing DOM specs and I fabricated xpointer ID's to
identify them.  Since existing browsers do not support
xpointers yet, I replaces the xpointer with a link to
the nearest id.

With DOM 3 and SVG 1.1 coming up, it would be nice if
you could add explicitly assigned IDs to the exception
scenarios to the DOM Spec Markup Language.

p.s. I dropped the repeated checks of test document
loading for Mozilla, so now it will only ask you to
press OK once per document load.  There are is no
checking that the document has loaded however.  Should
definitely not be a problem locally and if running
remotely with Mozilla over a slow link, just don't be
in an insane hurry to press OK.
