The release version of Xerces-J 2.0 fails two tests in the standard
configuration.   One is the replace attribute with self test we discussed
earlier which Xerces-J 1.x also fails.  The other appears to be a regression
in Xerces-J 2, since Xerces-J 1, Crimson, et al pass it.  However, there is
a chance that it was a differing interpretation of some aspect of the spec.
Unfortunately, I won't have time to review it till Saturday or Sunday.  If
someone else can take a quick look at it to confirm that it is an issue with
Xerces-J 2 and not with the test, I would appreciate it.
