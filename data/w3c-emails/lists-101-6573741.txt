Hello,
      I'm fairly new to the world of XML and I have a question
concerning End-of-Line characters & End-of-File characters.  When XML
parser validates an xml document for well-formness, how does it handle
End-of-Line characters & End-of-File characters?  For example, say I
have the following XML document ("$" denotes End-of-line characters):


<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>$

How does DOMCount treat the end-of-line character between the DOCTYPE
tag and the Namespace declaration?  I have bolded the $ that is being
referred in the previous sentence.  Thank you for your patience.

P.S.  If I am mailing the wrong work-group with this question, then
please forgive me of my ignorance and kindly refer me to the correct
work group in W3C.  Thank you.
