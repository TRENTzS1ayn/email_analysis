The problem that Jason and Mary were experiencing were probably due to calling a method, setTracer, that was just injected into the test page in the previous line of jsUnitRunner.js.  setTracer() is used to pass to the test a Tracer object that enables the warn, debug and inform routines.

The attached zip files contains replacements for main.html, jsUnitCore.js and jsUnitRunner.js from the previous patches.  In these files, instead of the testRunner setting the tracer object, the tests will retrieve the tracer object from their parent when warn, debug and inform are called.

warn, debug and inform are not used by the DOM tests, but can be checked by running the jsUnitTestSuite self-test suite.

Please let me know if this resolves the issue and please confirm that the self test passes appropriately.
