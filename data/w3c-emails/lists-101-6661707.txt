Unfortunately, that was the only way I could find to fake a synchronous
parse with Mozilla.

That should be described as an expected exception if you don't have a parser
in the classpath.

The first way described to run the tests should be:

java -jar dom1-core.jar

Which will run all tests in two modes on the default JAXP parser and print
results to the console.

The "TestXerces" and other classes are JUnit specific and therefore are
located in junit-run.jar.  JUnit's GUIs don't populate the combo box (at
least for us), but do remember previous entries.

I haven't seem that message before, it would indicate that the class was
loaded, but the suite method doesn't exist which should not be the case.
Any more diagnosis you could provide would be appreciated.
