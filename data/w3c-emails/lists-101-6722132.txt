All,

I'd like to ask of you to allocate today's afternoon (for most of you) 
to check on the distributable I'll post around 23.00 - 00.00 CET, enough 
time to check and provide feedback so that I can post the final version 
to the W3C server tomorrow midday CET.

I'll incorporate all changes proposed by Curt and Philippe, however, to 
speed things up:

1. About the jar files you mention Curt, are the verison numbers 
generated or written by hand? If it's the former, we should commit the 
appropriate changes to the transform

2. JsUnit issues: if we provide our own patch, can we be sure the 
current TS will be runnable in the next JsUnit framework? If not, we 
should clearly indicate JsUnit framework, patch needed, as well as have 
the patch on the W3C machinery for future reference. As indicated by 
Curt, there shouldn't be a problem with licensing. Also, if this is the 
only patch that indeed works, we need to change the entire build 
process, as I presume the changes Curt sent to this list are not 
included in JsUnit itself.

3. Any other issues you (are more than kindly invited to) provide.

Thanks

/Dimitris
