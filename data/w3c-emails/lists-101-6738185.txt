Using this patch seems to fix the problem.

 

Thanks!

Subject: Another try at injection

 

The problem that Jason and Mary were experiencing were probably due to
calling a method, setTracer, that was just injected into the test page
in the previous line of jsUnitRunner.js.  setTracer() is used to pass to
the test a Tracer object that enables the warn, debug and inform
routines.

 

The attached zip files contains replacements for main.html,
jsUnitCore.js and jsUnitRunner.js from the previous patches.  In these
files, instead of the testRunner setting the tracer object, the tests
will retrieve the tracer object from their parent when warn, debug and
inform are called.

 

warn, debug and inform are not used by the DOM tests, but can be checked
by running the jsUnitTestSuite self-test suite.

 

Please let me know if this resolves the issue and please confirm that
the self test passes appropriately.
