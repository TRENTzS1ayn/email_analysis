For simplicity's sake I'll just mark them as 1.0

I'ev run a bit late but should be able to put the distributable at the 
same place as last time within half an hour. Sorry for the delay.

In any case, we still have two issues as I see it:

1. JsUnit used in distribution not the same as the "regular" one
2. Curt's email about Xerces-J 2.0 sent a few days ago, has anyone 
looked into this?
