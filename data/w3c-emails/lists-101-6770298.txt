I've made the changes proposed by Curt, Jason and Philippe in previous 
emails, except for only pointing to the software license, as a verbatim 
of it is given in the tests, the index.htm and the test matrix. All 
other resources (pics, stylesheet and toc.js) are put in a new resources 
directory.

About JsUnit: it seems to work on Windows platforms, something stated on 
teh JsUnit homepage, so it not working on Mac cannot be considered a 
stopper. I'll bring this to the JsUnit mailing list, but waited for 
Curt's patches to see if they would help. In the meanwhile, have someone 
with a Mac cross-check, in case I'm doing something wrong (there should 
be someone with a Mac at the W3C).

I'm uploading the new distribution to 
http://www.ontologicon.com/DOMTSL1Core-20020212.zip, should be there any 
minute.

I also attach index.htm separately, I think Curt (or someone else) needs 
to formulate a better how-to on the JUnit, command-line and GUI 
respectively. We may actually need to describe eeach parser mode 
separately.
