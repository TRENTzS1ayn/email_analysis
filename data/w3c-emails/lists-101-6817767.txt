 Not there yet.  Is the URL right?

index.htm contains <body onload="init()">, but function init() is not
defined which throws me into a debugger.

[dd] I missed this one completely as it is not listed among the targets
you see with 'ant usage'.

No, there isn't an ant target to build the distribution, but there should be
one.  When I get your distribution, I'll make modify build.xml so that if
you do "ant dom1-core-dist" it will make a replica of the file that you
uploaded.

I played with trying to run JSUnit from the web, but it would require a
serious amount of hacking to JSUnit that I don't think I want to do tonight.
testRunner.html's inline script calls routines that are defined in external
files.  When not run locally, testRunner.html executes the script before the
external files are loaded and displays an error box.  Basically,
jsUnitRunner.js would need to move into main.html and some tweaking would
need to be done to the onload() handler.
