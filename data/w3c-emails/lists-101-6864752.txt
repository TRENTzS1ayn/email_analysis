I'm uploading the new distribution to

  Not there yet.  Is the URL right?

[dd] I'm having some problems with my web hosting, I'll look into it 
dorung the day.

index.htm contains <body onload="init()">, but function init() is not
defined which throws me into a debugger.

[dd] Please manually remove the onload attribute from the attached file; 
it refers to a function that is there in the distributable (following 
Philippe's comments init() is a function defined in a .js file that is 
shipped together with the distr. and not pointed to)

Are you building the distributable with Ant?  There should be a task
like
dom1-core-dist that would build everything repeatably.


[dd] I missed this one completely as it is not listed among the targets
you see with 'ant usage'.

No, there isn't an ant target to build the distribution, but there 
should be
one.  When I get your distribution, I'll make modify build.xml so that if
you do "ant dom1-core-dist" it will make a replica of the file that you
uploaded.

I played with trying to run JSUnit from the web, but it would require a
serious amount of hacking to JSUnit that I don't think I want to do 
tonight.
testRunner.html's inline script calls routines that are defined in 
external
files.  When not run locally, testRunner.html executes the script before 
the
external files are loaded and displays an error box.  Basically,
jsUnitRunner.js would need to move into main.html and some tweaking would
need to be done to the onload() handler.
