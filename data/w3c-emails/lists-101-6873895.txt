| I'm uploading the new distribution to
| http://www.ontologicon.com/DOMTSL1Core-20020212.zip, should 
| be there any
| minute.

I have already downloaded the zip 6 times and tried to open it both with
winzip and winrar (or something like that anyway). It appears corrupted
(the error says corrupted or multipart); I cannot open the archive :-(

| [...] files.  When not run locally, testRunner.html executes the 
| script before 
| the
| external files are loaded and displays an error box.  Basically,
| jsUnitRunner.js would need to move into main.html and some 
| tweaking would
| need to be done to the onload() handler.

I could check out stuff like that but... (See above)


| From: Curt Arnold [mailto:curta_ontheroad@yahoo.com]

| index.htm contains <body onload="init()">,
| but function init() is not
| defined which throws me into a debugger.

Shouldn't this file be in the TS archive?
Anyway, a global variable will do the trick:

<script type="text/javascript" src="resources/toc.js">
</script>
<script type="text/javascript">

var tocLoaded = false;
function checkLoaded()
{
   if(tocLoaded)
      init();
   else
      alert("external script files cannot be found");
}

</script>
   </head>
   <body onload="checkLoaded()">



I have modified the index.htm as follows:

a) the onload event handler calls the checkLoaded() function that lies
in the head of the document, in a new script tag.

b) this new script tag declares a global variable as false.
checkLoaded() will call init() if that variable is true.

c) NOTE: you will have to add this as the last line of
"resources/toc.js":

tocLoaded = true;

The modified page is attached.

Kindest regards,


Manos
