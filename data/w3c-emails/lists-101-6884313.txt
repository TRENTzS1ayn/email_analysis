Thanks Manos

Upload OK, the file is downloadable from 
http://www.ontologicon.com/DOMTSL1Core-20020212.zip. It was corrupted as 
a maximum file limit size kicked in, but that is taken care of now.

The toc.js is indeed in the TS archive, so I don't think we need to 
rewrite index.htm (it was attached in an email to this list for sanity 
checking).

Also, after lots of tweaking, I managed to run JsUnit in Mozilla on my 
Mac OS X with Curts inserts. Mozilla tries to give the path to the test 
file using colons instead of slashes, explains most problems. Still no 
luck with IE for Mac, though.
