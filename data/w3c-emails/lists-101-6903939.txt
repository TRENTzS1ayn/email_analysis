We've acquired some steam woth keeping up, so once we've released the 
Level 1 TS for core, we should start working with HTML.

There's been two major options brought to the list so far:

1. Convert as many as possible of the existing NIST level 2 tests to 
level 1 HTML

2. Convert some of Netscape's HTML tests to our markup

How long would this take?

Also, since both are open options, it seems a good idea to try to 
minimize duplication by stating what tests would be relevant and within 
what time frame.

Best,

/Dimitris
