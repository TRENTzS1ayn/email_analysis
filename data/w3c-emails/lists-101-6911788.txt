What type of tweaking, did you need to change some of the logic in JSUnit to
handle the format of the Mozilla/Mac file URL?

I'm pretty sure you have to use a different mechanism (not new
ActiveXObject("MSXML2.DOMDocument")...) on Mac IE to parse an XML document,
however I have had no luck on finding what it is.  If anyone knows of any
resources on using XML with Mac IE, please let me know.
