With respect to the NIST tests, there are
two issues:

1) DOM Level 1 HTML -- these tests are pretty much the
equivalent of the DOM Level 2 HTML tests - 90% of which
just require pointing to the Level 1 DTD -- there are a few
tweaks necessary for level 2, but not too much -- minimal
effort to convert ~ 1 week.

2) DOM Level 1 Core (HTML only implementations) -- much
more difficult, as the Level 1 XML tests would have to be
converted -- these tests currently load an xml file and manipulate
the file via dom calls.  In order to convert, the xml file must be
converted to an html file, and each of the tests would have to be
changed.  Most of the tests start with a getElementsByTagName call -
these would have to be changed to be consistent with the HTML
version of this file.  Other tests try to get attributes from various
element
names -- I'm not sure the best way to represent this in HTML.  So
essentially the logic of these tests can be reused, but probably all of
them will have to be recoded.
