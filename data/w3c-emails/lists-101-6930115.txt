All there was to it was substituting the ':' in the path to the 
alltests.html or the self tests for that matter, with '/', as well as 
making sure your changes were there.

I didn't want to change the code since that would surely make my current 
setup uncompatible with a new JsUnit (at one point I thought of 
hardcoding the path in the script itself to see what went wrong, but 
didn't).

Let's just say that Mac OS X won't be our reference platform, however, 
I'm glad it worked in the end.
