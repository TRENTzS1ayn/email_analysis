The distribution has a lot of apparently superfluous stuff and the organization follows the development/build environment which is unnecessary.  A couple of issues,

.FBCIndex, .DSStore, .FBCLockFolder

These files appear in a couple different places and take a large amount of room, I do not know where they come from.

The distribution contains .js files and .class files that do not need to be provided (the code of the .js files is a replication of the similarly named .html files and we do not have a command line ECMAScript harness that could use them).

I would rework the distribution so that it would have the following structure:

/DOMTSL1Core-200202xx
    index.html
    matrix.html
    w3c software license
/java
    junit.jar
    junit-run.jar
    dom1-core.jar
    junit license
/ecmascript
    /jsunit
   *.html
   *.xml
   *.dtd
   *.svg
/tests  (no need to make them several layers deep in a distribution)
   *.xml
   dom1.dtd
   dom1.xsd
   /files
/doxygen
   { doxygen output goes here }
/resources
   gif and script for index.html
     

I'll attempt to do this evening US Central Time.  I'll have it automated in the build.xml file (target dom1-core-dist) so that it can be reproduced on demand.
