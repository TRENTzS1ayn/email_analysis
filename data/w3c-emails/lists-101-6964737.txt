I've made my (unofficial) stab at a distribution now temporarily at http://home.houston.rr.com/curta/dom1-core.tar.gz (2.5 MB)

This was produced by the new "dom1-core-dist" target which will run most of the other targets, assemble a distribution in build/level1/core and then tar gzip and zip that image into the dist directory.

Things that had previously been build into the dist directory (such as dom1-core.jar, junit-run.jar) are now built into build directory.

The archive contains a patched version of JSUnit.  The patches are in the patches directory and automatically applied during the build process.

The test matrix now has links to both the XML source and Doxygen documentation for each test since Mozilla doesn't display raw XML in a pleasing manner.

index.htm is now stored in docs/level1/core in the CVS (it is copied into the build directory as part of dom1-core-dist).  It has been substantially modified and now I hope it is clearer to read.  I'm sure that I didn't properly trademark some software product names, so if someone else could do the niceities.
