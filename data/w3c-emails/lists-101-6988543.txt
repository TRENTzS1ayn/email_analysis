comments inlined

general remark: the ecmascript/tests folder is very strange, contains 
files with truncated filenames (problem with file name length?), several 
similar files, eg. documentinvalidcharacterexcepti, 
documentinvalidcharacterexc.1, documentinvalidcharacterexc.2 and 
documentinvalidcharacterexc.3

Problems during the build or file system related?

I'll run the dist target and create a distribution which I'll post at 
the usual place.

Thanks for the rework, Curt.

[dd] OK, but we still don't want to release before having the patches 
built into a release of JsUnit?

[dd] Several of the links to the Java source didn't work.
