I don't see that in my local copy of the tar.gz.  Though I often see
warnings in other open source projects that .tar.gz files must be extracted
using GNU tar (or compatible) since earlier Unix tar's apparently had
filename limits.  The distribution produces both a .zip and a .tar.gz, but I
only uploaded the .tar.gz since the .zip was much larger and I didn't have
enough space on my personal home page.

The Java source is provided in the dom1-core.jar.  The .js standalone code
is not usable by any known test framework.  I thought providing it would be
confusing since people may set breakpoints on the .js file, not realizing
that the running code is actually within the .html pages.

I'd prefer that we don't, but this would be tolerable.

[dd] Several of the links to the Java source didn't work.

Possibly the same issue with filename truncation.

The idea is that anyone with the right tools installed can come back and
generate any specific release by checking out properly tagged sources from
the CVS and building.  In our case that depends that several external
resources remain available and unchanging (the DOM specs, JUnit, JSUnit).

I cheated (it was getting really late) and did not do a "ant clean" before
"ant dom1-core-dist" and inadvertantly provided xercesImpl.jar and
xmlParserAPIs.jar in my distribution.  The proper way to do the distribution
is to do a full checkout of the CVS sources to a clean directory and then
run "ant dom1-core-dist" to ensure that no uncommitted file is participating
in the build.
