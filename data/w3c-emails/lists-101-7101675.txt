also, remove xerces 2.0 from the java directory.

just tried it with xerces 1.4.4 and xerces 2.0.0, and it worked fine. 

java -classpath dom1-core.jar junit.textui.testRunner
org.w3c.domts.level1.core.TestDefaultParser
returned
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError:
junit/textui/testRunner

java -classpath dom1-core.jar junit.swingui.testRunner -noloading
org.w3c.domts.level1.core.TestDefaultParser
returned
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError:
junit/swingui/testRunner

for ECMAScript:
[[
open the JsUnit test runner in the browser you want to test, then enter
"tests/alltests.html"
]]

I add to browse into ecmascript/test/alltests.html. entering
tests/alltests.html doesn't work.
(idem with SVG tests)

Didn't work with my nightly build of Mozilla. wasn't maybe a good idea
to install a nightly build version. Did someone try it with 0.9.8?
