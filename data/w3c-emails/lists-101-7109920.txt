OK, so far we have positive feedback from Mary, Rick and (partly) 
Philippe.

I think we've sanitychecked enough, so the question is:

Do we

1. publish the TS using the patched JsUnit, or do we
2. wait for the official JsUnit update?

There is a middle way which is to

3. publish as is now, given that there is commitment to include our 
patches into the next release of JsUnit.

I'm in favour of 3. Others?
