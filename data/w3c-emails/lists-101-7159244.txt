Have successfully run using Netscape 6.2.1 and Mozilla 0.9.7 and 0.9.8 on
Windows.  (Tried on SuSE linux but was getting errors about
libgmodule-1.2.so when installing Mozilla).

The patch files for JSUnit were produced from changes that I submitted to
the JSUnit mailing list.

By DOM L1 HTML, do you mean a second release of the DOM L1 Core test suite
with additional tests that are compatible with HTML implementations?  Those
additional tests will also be compatible with XML and SVG implementations.
To test best of my knowledge, there isn't a W3C rec for DOM L1 HTML.

DOM L2 Core should be next since all we have to do have the WG resolve the
outstanding issues.  However, none of that needs to be talked about now.

Could you clarify?  Could could simply rename dom1-core.tar.gz to
DOMTSL1Core-2002021x.tar.gz or do you want a DOMTSL1Core-2002021x directory
within the archive?  If the latter,  you could add something like this to
the end of dom1-core-dist

<copy todir="${build.dir}/DOMTSL1Core-20020212">
<fileset dir="${build.dir}/level1/core"/>
</copy>

<mkdir dir="${dist.dir}"/>
<zip zipfile="${dist.dir}/dom1-core.zip" basedir="${build.dir}"
includes="DOMTSL1Core-20020212/**"/>
<tar tarfile="${dist.dir}/dom1-core.tar" basedir="${build.dir}"
includes="DOMTSL1Core-20020212/**"/>
<gzip src="${dist.dir}/dom1-core.tar"
zipfile="${dist.dir}/dom1-core.tar.gz"/>
