Good point, I'll add it.

In reply to your previous email:

By DOM L1 HTML, do you mean a second release of the DOM L1 Core test 
suite
with additional tests that are compatible with HTML implementations?  
Those
additional tests will also be compatible with XML and SVG 
implementations.
To test best of my knowledge, there isn't a W3C rec for DOM L1 HTML.

I obviosly mean a second release with additional tests for HTML, not a 
separate one.
