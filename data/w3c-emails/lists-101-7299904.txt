Can't repeat it here.  Thought for a moment that Edward Hieatt may have
updated JSUnit which would have invalidated the patches, but that doesn't
seem to be the case.  Try deleting jsunit.zip and the jsunit directory from
lib and run jsunit-init again.  Possibly the files were read-only or already
patched somehow.
