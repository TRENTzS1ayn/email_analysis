Good point, but what really concerns me is MSXML 4.0; to use it's
features, one must use a version specific ProgId:

var myDomObject = new ActiveXObject("Msxml2.DOMDocument.4.0");


The use of a version independent ProgId calls MSXML3.0 or lower
depending what's in the machine:

var myDomObject = new ActiveXObject("Msxml2.DOMDocument");

Does the TS handle this?


BTW, although L1 does not define a standard way to create document
objects, IE doesn't even follow the "good practice" of "createFoo"
factory methods. I hope IE will support this as below, instead of using
company_ name_Bla to load a document:

document.implementation.createDocument('','',null)
