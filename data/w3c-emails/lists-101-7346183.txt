As the junit-init still fails, I'kk manually recreate the build process, 
running dom1-core-dist, manually patching JsUnit with the latest patches 
sent to this list by Curt (I suppose they haven't changed since, before 
being committed to the CVS), zip ant tar.gz the build directory manually 
and post the two distributions to the usual ontologicon space.

 From there on, given that everything runs smoothly, could Philippe 
please put them on the .../DOM/Test/Downloads space?

I'll send a relevant pointer as soon as the build are finished.
