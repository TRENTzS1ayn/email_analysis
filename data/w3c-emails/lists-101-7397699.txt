All, in 15 mins you'll find DOMTSL1Core-20020213.zip and .tar.gz 
respectively for download at http://www.ontologicon.com/DOMTSL1...

What I've done is tweak build.xml a little:
<target name="dom1-core-dist"...>

     [...]

     <!--<mkdir dir="${dist.dir}"/>
     <zip  zipfile="${dist.dir}/dom1-core.zip" 
basedir="${build.dir}/level1/core"/>
     <tar tarfile="${dist.dir}/dom1-core.tar" 
basedir="${build.dir}/level1/core"/>
     <gzip src="${dist.dir}/dom1-core.tar" 
zipfile="${dist.dir}/dom1-core.tar.gz"/>-->


</target>

<target name="compressOnly">
     <property name="build.dir" value="./build"/>
     <property name="dist.dir" value="./dist"/>
     <mkdir dir="${dist.dir}"/>
     <zip  zipfile="${dist.dir}/dom1-core.zip" 
basedir="${build.dir}/level1/core"/>
     <tar tarfile="${dist.dir}/dom1-core.tar" 
basedir="${build.dir}/level1/core"/>
     <gzip src="${dist.dir}/dom1-core.tar" 
zipfile="${dist.dir}/dom1-core.tar.gz"/>
</target>

I commented out the compression part of dom1-core-dist, ran 
dom1-core-dist, manually put the content of the ecmascript directory 
from Curt's release in the right places in the build/ directory (in app/ 
and also substituted testRunner.html), then ran compressOnly on my 
(changed) build directory. I could also have run the original 
dom1-core-dist and commented out jsunit relevant tasks, but I ralized 
this would entail rerunning the entire build process, which I didn't 
want to do.

This is as far as I can see an equivalent operation to running the 
original dom1-core-dist with functioning patch.
