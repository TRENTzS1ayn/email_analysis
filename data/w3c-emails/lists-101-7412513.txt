The DOM Test Suite Group releases the first version of the DOM
Conformance Test Suite, Level 1 Core.

The first version of the DOM Conformance Test Suite for Level 1 Core has
been released by the DOM Test Suite Group. The DOM TS aims at helping
implementors test their implementations' conformance with the W3C DOM
Level 1 specification.

This work, launched by W3C and NIST, is a publically developed and open
framework to test the DOM Level 1 Core implementations. Read about the
Document Object Model (DOM) Conformance Test Suites at
http://www.w3.org/DOM/Test, where you can also download the DOM TS
distribution.

Comments are appreciated and need to be sent to www-dom-ts@w3.org
