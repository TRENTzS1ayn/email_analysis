One way to solve this since we ship test files and not a framework to 
generate correct files is in the transform; we could consider writing 
one transform for each known implementation, or write a loding mechanism 
for each implementation which JsUnit uses to load the tests (which do 
not then need to be written for each known implementation).

If this is a good idea, proposals are more than welcome.
