As we have done a good job with sanity checking lately, and solved all 
issues, I sent the release version and the go ahead to Philippe, who 
promptly published it on W3C space.

This would not have been possible were it not for the keen interest and 
hard work of all involved. As the DOM WG representative to this group, I 
wish to thank all people, especially those not related to the 
organisations who launched this activity, for bringing it about.

I look forward to working on the HTML part in the very near future, 
which I think will be easy now that we've overcome the learning curve 
and gained speed.

I announced the release to the following fora:
www-dom (public mailing list)
www-dom-ts (of course)
w3c-dom-ig (the DOM Interest Group)
w3c-dom-wg (the DOM Working Group)
www-qa-wg (the W3C QA Working Group)
www-qa (the W3C QA Interest Group)
xml.com (editors)
xmlhack.xom (editors)
xml-dev (mailing list)
slashdot.org (submitted as an article)

If you can think of another forum I should have included, please do not 
hesitate to contact me or announce the TS yourselves.

Again, thanks to all, and I look forward to continuing working with you.

Best regards,

/Dimitris
