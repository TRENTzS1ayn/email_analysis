Been a long road to this point.  Probably would be good to tag the CVS at
this point and continue on with the next milestones.  Any W3C convention for
tagging releases in the CVS?  If not, how about calling it L1Core-R1.0?

Probably next step would be to identify the open issues with the L2 Core
suite.  Obviously, the getElementsByTagName("*","whatever") issue needs to
be resolved.  I don't remember any other open issues off the top of my head.

The Mozilla HTML loader in DOMTestSuite.js was failing, but it might have
just been a nighly build issue.  It had worked with previous versions, I
haven't tried it with the 0.9.8 milestone release.  What I had
misinterpreted as a problem with getElementsByTagName()'s case-sensitivity
appears to be a failure to load the <body> element into the DOM (which
causes massive numbers of test failures).

The Mozilla XML implementation will crash in one of the DOM L2 Core tests
(about 2/3 of the way through).  There had been a similar situation earlier
with the DOM L1 tests.  It would be nice if someone could do a find the
cases that are failing.  With the DOM L1, basically had to do a half
interval search, splitting alltests.xml into smaller fragments until the
failure was located.  I don't know if the Venkman JS debugger will let you
debug a script that large (MS Interdev 6 had problems with massive scripts).
If you have access to Mozilla's talkback data, if you can find a recent log
for carnold@houston.rr.com, it should point to the method that failed.

I'll probably change test-to-jsunit.xsl to add an unload() call at the end
of any test that loads and modifies a document.  Closing the corresponding
window in that call would minimize the desktop clutter from running the HTML
tests.  It would do nothing in XML or SVG loaders.
