Yeah, I know I've been quiet lately; sorry I've not been able to make
more time available.

The "." in the tag name is not allowed by CVS (probably not by RCS
either).

For Python, we tag minor releases with r<version> and major releases
with release<version>, just dropping the dots (though that doesn't
scale).  Using a different term for "release" makes it easy to read
through the list of tags at the top of "cvs log" output.

If the W3C doesn't already have a convention, I'll propose the tags
have the form <what>-(r|release)<version>, where <what> is something
like the "L1Core" you propose (perhaps a hyphen between the level and
the component would help readability?), and <version> is the version
number with dots replaced by underscores or hyphens (but always the
same).
