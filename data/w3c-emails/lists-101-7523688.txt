From DOM2 Core:

"nodeValue of type DOMString
   The value of this node, depending on its type; see the table above. When
   it is defined to be null, setting it  has no effect."

That explicit silent failure seems to take precedence over the
read-onlyness. Of course the user shouldn't be trying to set the value of
these nodes anyway, but...
