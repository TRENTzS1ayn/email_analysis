 From the top of my head there are the following issues brought up by 
Netscape representatives (they will send a message to this list after 
having checked thouroughly):

1. Browser sniffing -- it seems that the sniffing is not elaborate 
enough, makes Mozille, for example, run code with calls to an ActiveX 
object.
2. Tests on default attributes require a validating parser, which is not 
a requirement (for XML), for HTML default attributes need to be there. 
The issue is then that the TS tests the XML appclication DOM, not the 
browser DOM


And from IBM:
1. readonly issues, as indicated in a previous message
2. Ability to run single tests (in Java) instead of the entire suite. I 
promised to come back with relevant info on how not to run entire suites 
(this is the way we run it right now)
