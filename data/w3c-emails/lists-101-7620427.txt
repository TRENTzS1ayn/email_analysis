I'll admit that it isn't elaborate, but under what scenario does Mozilla run
an ActiveX object?

It doesn't require that the document be validated, but it does require that
the DTD be processed.  The DOM rec doesn't seem to allow a processor to omit
default attributes or return null for doctype when there is a DTD.

, for HTML default attributes need to be there.

The DOM Level 1 test suite currently only contains tests for XML and SVG
documents.  Microsoft IE does not have an browser implementation of the XML
DOM so the MSXML2.DOMDocument is used for tests using XML documents.  Since
Mozilla does have a XML DOM in the browser, it is used for tests on XML
documents.  I believe that Netscape was converting going to be providing DOM
1 Core tests that use HTML documents, and when those tests are run using
HTML documents they will use the browsers HTML DOM implementation.

Let me search the archives and come up with a history of the discussion on
these tests.

From the command line, if you do:

java -classpath dom1-core.jar <testclassname>

such as:

java -classpath dom1-core.jar
org.w3c.domts.level1.core.documentcreatecdatasection

it will run just the specified test twice (once for each configuration).
Individual tests cannot be run (currently) from JUnit GUI's since there are
not junit.framework.TestCase derived classes corresponding to each test.
