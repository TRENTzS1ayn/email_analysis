Bob,

Thanks for the input.  Let me join Dimitris in welcoming you to this effort.
We welcome
any help, but in particular, are very happy to have someone who can help
ensure that
the tests interface well to Mozilla.

I can see that some of your comments bring up the issue of "conformance".
You are
correct in pointing out that some folks think of the whole nine yards when
the term
"conformance" is used -- that is, a comprehensive test suite, certification,
validation, etc.
I think that you can see that this effort hopes to someday be comprehensive,
but we are
not yet there.

Additional comments inlined.

--Mary

[mb] Yes, this is a limitation of the test suite.  As Dimitris pointed out,
we
have raised this issue on several occasions.  In fact, in correspondence
that
we've had with Netscape, we though we had it figured out.  Obviously, we
still have more work to do...          To date, all of the NIST tests
work this way -- it was a design decision early on in our testing effort --
the
other approach would be to use the DOM to create a DOM tree and then
manipulate it per a particular test.  This approach requires that methods
exist
for creating a DOM tree, and that those methods are correctly implemented.
We can't always depend on that to be the case, so we opted for what we
believed at the time to be the lesser of two evils.  This approach may
inadvertently
introduce dependencies on a browser's parser -- in fact, we are aware of
some,
such as white-space, and entity expansion issues.  Please raise other issues
that
you may see, so that we may zero in on potential solutions.  It will take a
while to
sort out creative ways of dealing with the differences, but I think that
they can all
be overcome.  This approach has worked well for many java based
implementations.
We are still trying to gain experience with EMCAScript based
implementations, so
any insight that you can provide on how a particular implementation works
would
be helpful.

[mb] Why don't you think this is a gray area.  As Jason points out, the spec
reads:

<quote>
Some languages and object systems do not support the concept of
exceptions. For such systems, error conditions may be indicated using
native error reporting mechanisms. For some bindings, for example,
methods may return error codes similar to those listed in the
corresponding method descriptions.

How does Mozilla deal with exceptions?

[mb] I'm not sure I follow you here.  With respect to the term
"Conformance", I
think that the web pages for the test suite are clear in what is meant.  I
do understand
that "conformance" can imply different things to different folks -- that's
why so much
effort was expended in defining what the test suite process is all about.  I
would hope
that folks aren't reaching conclusions without first reading this
information.  As far as
the tests themselves go, each test was created because there was a clause in
the specification
that defined what should happen.  We tried to ensure that each test was
well-grounded
in the specification, and in the xml representation of the test, there are
subject pointers to
the area of the spec being tested.  In addition, here at NIST, we have the
actual clauses
from the spec that were used to develop the tests.  If you believe a test to
be flawed,
please identify a specific test, and discuss why you believe it to not be
grounded in
the specification.  These tests represent a first pass -- through an open
and iterative process,
we hope to improve implementations, the specification, and of course the
tests themselves.
