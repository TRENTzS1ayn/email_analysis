The report that Mozilla attempted to run the ActiveX object is a red 
herring due to a misunderstanding in verbal communications with a member 
of the DOM WG.  As far as I know, no one at Netscape made such a claim. 
The issue with sniffing is that it is too restrictive.

 From the top of my head there are the following issues brought up by 
Netscape representatives (they will send a message to this list after 
having checked thouroughly):

1. Browser sniffing -- it seems that the sniffing is not elaborate 
enough, makes Mozille, for example, run code with calls to an ActiveX 
object.
2. Tests on default attributes require a validating parser, which is not 
a requirement (for XML), for HTML default attributes need to be there. 
The issue is then that the TS tests the XML appclication DOM, not the 
browser DOM

The issue with MSXML vs. Native browser implementations is another issue.
