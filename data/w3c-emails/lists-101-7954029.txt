[dd] This we all share. I've had problems with the term 'conformance' 
but I think we've solved most issues with it so far. However, your views 
are important to us and will be discussed.

[dd] I was very disappointed too by the numbers, but wouldn't be too 
alarmed by the comments themselves. Except for this version being our 
first release and thus subject to change (which is indicated in every 
second piece of information regarding the DOM TS), C. Arnold pointed out 
that comparisons and claims made simply cannot be made. I understand 
that it is alarming that people claim they have seen "how conformant 
Mozilla and IE really are" but we will have to wait to deal with this 
issue until the framework is properly set and we can have something more 
official to say (not saying it is ootright erroneous, but it needs 
polishing).

[dd] My own job (I'm currently freelancing, so you can appreciate how 
much time this takes from my day to day job) is to strive for 
implementation of web and information standards. My job in this effort 
is not to give rates of conformance, but provide the tools necessary to 
do so. If the tools are flawed, I'll help in fixing them, which I 
understand your mission to be too.

[dd] I wouldn't go so far as to say that the DOM TS (intentionally) 
furthers any view on conformance with the DOM specifications. As has 
been the case from the start, we formed this group a year or so ago to 
work with the then largest bulk of tests, the NIST load, and to try to 
find a framework to give each implementation a fair shot at running them 
(and other commited in the future). The issue with Mozilla's problems 
with asynchronicity has been known from the original days of the NIST 
DOM test suite (Mary, please provide a relevant date, I cannot remember 
right now), and we have continually tried to contact relevant persons to 
solve it. I'm hoping that this will start happening now and I feel 
confident it will, given the intention of each and everyone involved to 
strive for standard implementation.

[dd] I once joined the DOM WG for that particular reason, so I know very 
well what you mean.

[dd] As far as the documentation goes, I dod hope that I had written it 
clearly enough. If there is any possibility of misunderstanding as far 
conformance claims go, I'll see to that they are eliminated in furuter 
revisions.

[dd] You're right. However, I'm afraid parts of the web developer 
community didn't take the time necessary to read the documentation, and 
there is only so much one can do about that. In any case, I'll make it 
as clear as possible.

[dd] I don't think anyone misinterpreted your intentions, and I for one 
am happy that you're aboard. I'm sure you can contribute greatly to this 
effort and it seems that your goal is shared by all involved in this 
group.
