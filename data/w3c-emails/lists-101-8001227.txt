Thanks, will incorporate this into DOMTestSuite.js in the next few days.

I did spend several hours trying to get JSUnit to work Opera, but I might be
beat.  Got it to run the tests, but if there is a test failure it starts
looping.

I've also started fleshing out a browser hosted test runner.  I've attached
a skeletal prototype.  This runner would be an alternative to using JSUnit
to run the tests.  Still trying to figure out how to present the results on
Opera, since it appears to be extremely difficult to change anything about
the rendered page programmatically.

I'd also like to support Konquerer, anything that I should know about that?
