I've getting ready to commit the 440 plus
HTML tests for level 1.  I took the Level 2
tests and made the following changes.

I've changed the DTD reference from dom2.dtd to
dom1.dtd and also changed the reference
LEVEL-2 to LEVEL-1. 
Also there are several attributes that needed to
be changed from long to DOMString for
the HTMLImageElement interface(border, height,
hspace, width and vpsace).

Anything else necessary that I am missing?
