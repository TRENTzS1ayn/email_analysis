I tried adding an <?xml-stylesheet?> PI to one of the tests and displaying
it in Mozilla (the primary motivation behind the transform) and didn't see
anything displayed, but I only had a few minutes to play with it before
heading to work.

Didn't want anything like a grid display, just something that looked like
pretty-printed XML when displayed in either Mozilla or IE and had some
minimal hyperlinks.
