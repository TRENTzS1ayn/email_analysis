Just got in, won't have time to do anything useful before tomorrow 
morning my time, but I ran Manos' stylesheet which displays fine in 
Mozilla.

I'll work on it now and post it later on, possible tomorrow as I also 
have to get ready for the W3C Cannes meetings.

I'll read mail again before taking the plane tomorrow, could you 
formulate any isses you want me to take up with the DOM WG? I can see 
the following:

1. We are about to have 400+ HTML tests submitted from NIST
2. We are about to have 150 HTML tests submitted from Netscape (middle 
of March)
3. We are working on a web-based harness for the ECMA tests (and it 
looks as if we'll drop Junit at some point, given Bob's work)

Any other issues?
