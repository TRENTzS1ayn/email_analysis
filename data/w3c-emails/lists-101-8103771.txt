Given that we have two types of comments on this topic (one from Bob, 
the other from Boris; welcome Boris) maybe we should decide for either:

1. Adding functions to JsUnit, if Edward agrees, or
2. Writing our own harness, lending from JsUnit and incorporate 
solutions following the path laid out in Bob's and Boris' comments.

Views?
