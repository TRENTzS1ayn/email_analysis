I didn't believe that JSUnit could properly recognize test exceptions that
occurred after the test had apparently completed by returning from the test
method.  However, I could be wrong on that.

I would also require that the body of the test code be fairly radically
changed (which would be done in the transform not in the actual test
definition) so that all the context variables would be accessible in the
code that executed in the onload handler.

Also, you would need to stagger the load() calls so that 50 documents are
not being loaded simultaneously.

With the XMLHttpRequest approach (or by preloading the document cache), we
can the generated ECMAScript code still resemble both the test definition
and the corresponding test code from Java and other languages where
synchronous loading is the most widely supported.
