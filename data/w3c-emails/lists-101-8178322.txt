Robert,

It makes me very happy to see activity coming from people behind my
favorite browser in this public list.

Workarounds are demanded by the DOM spec and IE works according to spec
as well (on this matter ). Indeed the DOM Level 1 Recommendation
requires 'createXXX' factory methods to create objects  ( for example
[1] and [2] ). 

However, the second paragraph of [2] makes quite clear that creation of
DOMImplementation and Document objects is not covered; implementers are
to provide for a proprietary way to create those. This, of course, has
been mentioned before in this list.

Perhaps I don't have the background to anticipate the reasons of this
distinction as decided by the DOM WG but the point is both the Test
Suite and IE behave ok on this subject.

I hope I will find time to comment on the rest of your post.

Kindest regards,
