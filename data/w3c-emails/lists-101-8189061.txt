Manos,

Thanks for the comment. I suppose my mind set is on Level 2 rather than 
Level 1.

I stand corrected on the issue of DOM Level 1 creating Documents and 
DOMImplementation. However, creating empty Documents via implementation 
specific methods and using the remaining DOM methods to populate the 
test document should still be possible and the preferred approach. I 
still believe the introduction of parser related issues where not 
absolutely required is inappropriate.

For Level 2 tests however the ability to bootstrap the tests from the 
DOMImplementation interface means that external documents are not required.

The DOM Level 2 API does not define a standard way to create

objects; DOM implementations must provide some proprietary way of 
bootstrapping these DOM interfaces, and then all other objects can be 
built from there.
