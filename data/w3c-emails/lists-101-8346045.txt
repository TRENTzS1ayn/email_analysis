A happy new year to all of you.

As we are going to release the DOM TS this month, as reported to this 
list and the DOM WG in previous mails, I'd like to put a few, still 
pending items, to the table:

1. HTML tests. Given an earlier thread, there was some confusion about 
these tests. The tests that are committed now are level 2 HTML tests 
only, and if I understand correctly, some of them could be used as 
Level1 HTML tests as well. If this is the case, we should come up with a 
mechanism to do this, perhaps by submitting slightly altered tests, or 
in the trasnform of the source.

Also, we've had information from Netspace indicating that contacts have 
been made to see if Netscape would be interested in submitting theur 
existing tests to our framework. To we have an update on this? What 
would be the approximate time needed?

2. Documentation. What we have is:

- General homepage
- FAQ
- Build instructions

What we will have soon is:
- Matrix of existing tests (as soon as we resolve the HTML issue) [dd]
- Schema documentation [dd]
- "How to write tests" document, I do not anticipate to coved all 
aspect, perhaps this is a chapter in the previous document, in any case 
we should have something for implementors to use while writing tests 
(especially for levels 2 and 3). [dd -help appreciated]

I can't think of any other items, if I've forgotten something, please 
advise.

I take the items indicated by [dd], anyone volounteer for some of the 
others?

Best,

/Dimitris
