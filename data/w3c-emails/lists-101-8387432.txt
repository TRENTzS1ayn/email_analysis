[mb] Yes, the vast majority of the tests can also be used as level 1 tests
for
the HTML Module.  This still does not solve the issue of having HTML
tests for core.

[mb] That may very well be true.  What would you like to see covered in
this document?  I can see two possibilites -- how to take a portion of the
spec, identify what can be tested, and set about building tests for it.  I
could also envision a section on the steps that should be taken after a
test is written in xml.

Any thoughts?
