[dd] OK, which means we leave out HTML tests for Core but tests Core and 
HTML implementations. Is that good enough?

[dd] What I had in mind is your first option, as it's probably what is 
least evident. Your second option, I think, is covered in other 
documents (Process for submitting and Build for building/checking out 
and so forth) which should perhaps be in a separate document.

Main things to be taken up in the document would be:

1. Identify what is being tested
2. Describe expected results
3. Description of the tests for matrix purposes
4. How we deal with programmatic constructs in DOM TS ML
