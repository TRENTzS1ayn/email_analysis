No, that was about it.  Basically when we have resolved all the open issues
to our satisfaction, then we would give implementers a chance to either
acknowledge or challenge any test failures before we present them as a
deviation from the recommendation.

Could you clarify that?  Do you mean that Netscape is able to run the XML
Level 1 Core suite (which isn't a surprise since we have been doing that
with Mozilla)?  

Or that Netscape has converted an internal test suite (such as
http://mozilla.org/quality/browser/standards/dom1/tcmatrix/index.html) based
on (x)HTML content to our test suite markup language and is ready to donate
it?

If not, would Netscape have a problem if I took a stab at reformulating
those tests into test markup language?
