[dd] Good, then we agree. As per your last email, one open issue was the 
one D. Brownell brought up, do you have any others? Do other people have 
issues?

[dd] To my understanding, Netscape build and ran the test suite as is 
now, and expessed interest in looking into transforming their existing 
HTML tests to our format. I suppose they would need some help in 
reformulating the tests, though, so any assistance would be appreciated.

If we manage to produce even a minimal set of HTML tests, I think we 
should aim at releasing once we've done that. If I can help with the 
Netscape tests, please tell me. Could we have some feedback from 
Netscape on this?
