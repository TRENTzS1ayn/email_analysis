In off-list discussions with Dimitris, I mentioned that we still had not
received a resolution for the createEntityReference issue needed to complete
the L1 test suite.  I had mentioned a vaguely recalled message from David
Brownell, but had not been able to locate the appropriate message.  It
apparently was
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom-ts/2001Nov/0055.html
 which discussed this issue in addition to the interpretation of "*" when
used as a namespace parameter.

Many of these tests intentionally use createEntityReference since the
read-only behavior would be untested when the processor or application
chooses to expand entity references.

They are in GNUJAXP, but not in Xerces-J.

All the entity definitions are in the internal subset so the sections that
allow external subset entity definitions to be ignored for non-validating
parsers should not apply.
