Hello,
      I was wondering if anyone could let me know where I could download
the file "dom1.dtd" version 1.4.  I downloaded "dom1.dtd" version 1.3,
but I can't seem to get the xml test files to parse correctly.  I do not
believe they are functioning as intended with "dom1.dtd" version 1.3.
Thank you.

Jae W. In
