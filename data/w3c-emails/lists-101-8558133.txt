Hello,

The dtd you are referring to does not exist for download; you would have 
to build the DOM test suite in order to get the dtd (which is generated 
by applying an XSLT transform to the DOM Specification).

We will release the DOM TS fairly soon, and the dtd will be present in 
the package.

Kind regards,

/Dimitris
