Let's go for one distributable for both standard bindings.  Do we want a
.zip, .tar.gz or both?

Not hurtful and shouldn't bloat the archive much.  If provided, should also
have dom1.dtd and dom1.xsd provided.

The Doxygen generated output is both very useful in understanding the tests
and awkward for a casual user to generate on their own.  I'd recommend at
least having it as an optional download if not in the distribution archive.

Style.  I believe the contents are technically accurate (other than the test
URL's being bogus) but everything is straight black-on-white HTML with no
copyright notices, introductory text, etc.  If the tests are going to be in
the distribution, then the test matrix links should refer to the local copy.
If doxygen output is in the distribution, then a link to the Doxygen page
for that test would also be nice.

I'm going to post something on the JSUnit mailing list shortly and will
investigate tonight.

It would also be nice to be able to run the Java tests from the JUnit GUI
runner.  I'll take a look at adding classes that correspond to running the
Level 1 Core tests for specific processors and configurations.  So you could
start the Junit GUI runner, browse junit-run.jar and then select
TestDOM1CoreJAXPDefaultConfig1, TestDOM1CoreXercesConfig1,
TestDOM1CoreCrimsonConfig2, etc.

Also, it would be appropriate to add GNUJAXP to the .jar class paths.
