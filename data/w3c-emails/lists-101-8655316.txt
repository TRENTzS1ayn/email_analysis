[dd] I think we go for both, .tar.gz will certainly be smaller.

[dd] OK, another issue with this is that we should post the two schema 
files in the CVS repository to avoid confusion (people have tried to 
validate the tests against the existing dom1.dtd) after build and 
release.

[dd] OK, we can do that, ie, have an optional download that includes 
doxygen documentation.

[dd] I'll look at this.

[dd] This would indeed be very good, I've encountered the same problems 
you have with the GUI runner.
