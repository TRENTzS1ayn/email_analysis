Yes, I know, I just wanted to notify the DOM Group. I'll remove the 
files this evening.

[dd] OK, another issue with this is that we should post the two schema
files in the CVS repository to avoid confusion (people have tried to
validate the tests against the existing dom1.dtd) after build and
release.

The schema and dtd files are generated and should not be in the CVS.  The
better way to avoid confusion would be to remove (or at least annotate) 
the
source of the out-of-date dom1.dtd and have the schemas and DTDs for the
various levels available for download.  The level 1's could be included 
in
the level 1 distribution, but the level 2 and 3 DTD's and schemas should 
be
available for download before the test suites are released.
