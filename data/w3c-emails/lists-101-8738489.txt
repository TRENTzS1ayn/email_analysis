I strangled for a while on how to implement that.
Seems to me that the best solution would be to change the current way the
API is bootstrapped. First, we'll need to replace JAXP with DOM Level 3
LS and then do a wrapper between L3LS and JAXP. This also includes having
support for the bootstrapping in DOM L3 Core. That way, the switch to
DOM Level 3 will be easier. I realized that having support for Batik and DOM4J
is a case-by-case basis unfortunately even if the Batik implementers said they'll
be happy to change their bootstrap API with whatever we would recommend. Not
sure also if we want to have all specific cases in the repository, though.
Bootstrapping the DOM tree with SAX does the work to some extend but we're lacking
lots of creation methods that are supposed to be done internal, in particular
the notation and entities nodes. 
Unfortunately, I didn't take the time to finish the code I started due to 
good and bad reasons. I'll be forced to go into with the release of L3 Last
Calls drafts in any case.
Apologies for not having anything to show for the moment and don't wait for
me to release the current work. I'll probably need to spend some week-ends
on it in order to do it. For the moment, I prefer to make sure that LS is in
good shape and help Johnny on the editing work.
