FYI: 

I'll need to add the new Xerces2 JAR names to the Manifests.

Subject: [ANNOUNCEMENT]: Xerces-J 2.0.0 final release now available


The Xerces-J developer community is extremely proud to announce the
availability of Xerces-J 2.0.0.  This is the first production-quality
release of the Xerces2 Java XML parser.

This new version of Xerces introduces the Xerces Native Interface (XNI), a
complete framework for building parser components and configurations that is
extremely modular.  The Apache Xerces2 parser is the reference
implementation of XNI, but other parser components, configurations, and
parsers can be written using the Xerces Native Interface.  XNI has achieved
a high degree of stability, but changes are still possible.

For application writers preferring to use standard DOM level 1, level 2, SAX
1.0 or 2.0 or JAXP 1.1 API's to process XML, Xerces-J V2 provides the same
level of conformance as Xerces-J V1.  Xerces-J V2 now comes in two jarfiles:
one, xmlParserAPIs.jar containing the standard API's that are implemented,
the other, xercesImpl.jar, the implementation of those API's.  With this
exception, users of standard API's should find Xerces-J V2 to be a drop-in
replacement for Xerces-J V1.

In most cases, Xerces-J 2.0.0's various components are complete rewrites of
the corresponding functionality of Xerces-J V1.  The implementation of the
W3C schema specification in particular has been rewritten so as to make
schema construction faster and less memory-intensive, and to remove the
limitations that existed in the Xerces-J V1 implementation.

For a complete list of changes that have been made in this release, please
see <http://xml.apache.org/xerces2-j/releases.html>.  The release is
available in both source and binary versions, as a zip file and a tar-gzip
archive, from <http://xml.apache.org/dist/xerces-j>.
To simplify the task of migrating from Xerces-J 1.x, we have also retained
binary packages (those name deprecatedXerces-J-bin.2.0.0) containing the
deprecated Xerces V1-style single jarfile.

Enjoy!
