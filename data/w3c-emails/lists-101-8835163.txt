I've committed three new tests HTMLFrameElement09, HTMLIFrameElement11 and
HTMLObjectElement19 that test the contentDocument attribute to the
DOM HTML Level2 test suite.  I've also added the associated test 
files(frame2.xml, frame2.html, iframe2.xml iframe2.html, object2.xml and
object2.html) to the files directory.

HTMLCollection02, HTMLCollection03, HTMLCollection10, HTMLCollection11 
and HTMLCollection12 were modified in the DOM HTML Level2 test suite.
The tests need an interface="HTMLCollection" added to the namedItem element to pass validation.

The tests HTMLIsIndexElement01 and HTMLIsIndexElement02 in the
DOM HTML Level1 test suite were also modified.  An ignoreCase
attribute was needed for the assertEquals element so that the tests
would pass validation.
