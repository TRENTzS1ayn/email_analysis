All,

I'd like to do a survey on how things stand in order to estimate how 
much more work we need before being able to release the next version of 
the DOM TS. Most activity of late has been in connection with HTML 
tests, and not so much the DOM TS framework.

1. HTML. What is the count of tests for L1/2? Have they been checked for 
correctness?

2. Framework. I've informed the DOM WG that we've started working on a 
new framework and invited the member companies to provide feedback on 
the new framework. Are there particular issues Bob and Edward would like 
help with? When do you expect to be able to run the new framework with 
the old tests?

There are a few more issues that I've taken up with the DOM WG, in 
particular:

1. Tests for particular modules. We've discussed having tests written 
for the modules by those responsible for producing them (the member 
companies whose representatives prdocue the specifications).
2. DOM TS Group involvement: I've raised the issue of not having a very 
balanced division of labour (as indicated earlier in a series of 
postings to this list) which in turn means that we cannot ensure that 
all implementations will run smoothly with the new framework.

Any other issues?
