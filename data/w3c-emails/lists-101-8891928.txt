    There are currently 521 tests committed for DOM Level 1 HTML and
    537 tests committed for DOM Level2 HTML.  I've been using Curt's 
    JsUnit 1.3.0 alpha TestRunner to run the tests and have been able
    to run the tests on both IE and Mozilla.
    
 
    I do have a question. There are some tests in level 2 that I'm not sure
    if I should commit to level 1.  An example is the exception tests for
    insertRow() and deleteRow() methods in the TableElement interface. 
    The DOM Level 1 spec does not mention anything
    about the exceptions  however the DOM Level1 Second Edition does.
    Do I include these tests in the Level 1 suite?
