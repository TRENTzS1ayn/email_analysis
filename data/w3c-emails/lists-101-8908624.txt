I've gotten HTML L1 down to what I think are true implementation bugs. 
 Rick was supposed (and probably has) mirrored the changes into the HTML L2.

There is currently a fork in the JSUnit work.  About a month ago, I 
updated test-to-ecmascript.xsl, the support files and provided a hacked 
version of the initial JSUnit 1.3 alpha that would run the tests. While 
I was in the death throes of getting that ready, Bob issued a revised 
JSUnit 1.3.  I had asked Bob to review the generated tests and my hacked 
JSUnit and suggest a path forward, but didn't get any feedback.  I like 
the way the tests are currently rendered and in general, like the 
modifications that I made to JSUnit.  However, I did the JSUnit mods 
quick and dirty and may have broken something, so I'd suggest 
incrementally working in the changes and making sure that existing non 
TS tests still run.
