Edward,

Curt has contributed some updates to jsUnit which I would like to 
discuss with you and Curt. I think this should be considered for 
inclusion into JsUnit but would like to discuss it with you and Curt 
first. I am attaching a diff -u against the JsUnit CVS trunk and a zip 
file containing the new files Curt has added.

It would be good to get some test results with alternative 
browsers/operating systems.

Curt, I have taken your version of JsUnit, cleaned up the line endings, 
and generated a diff against the current trunk of JsUnit on sourceforge. 
Can you apply these changes to a fresh checkout of JsUnit from 
sourceforge to make sure I have not broken anything?

It includes a couple of additional changes from your version:

a) fix for a NS 6.2 bug which was added to JsUnit 1.3.2
b) minor edits in xbDebug.js
c) fixed line endings in jsUnitStyle.css
d) update of name from JsUnit 1.3.0 alpha to JsUnit 1.3.2 to match 
current trunk.

I also added your name to the contributors list in the new/modified files.
