[dd] We've discussed this in the past and I agree that it is important 
to host the tests/harness somewhere easily accessible. In the past, W3C 
said they could host this, so I think we can suppose they still can 
(otherwise we'll come up with an alternative). The only thing I would 
like to stress is that the hosted version be functionally equivalent to 
the built version, once released, in order to not have differences 
between various DOM TS.
