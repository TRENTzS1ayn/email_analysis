I'm trying to finish up writing the html tests and have
committed some new tests to the level 1 & level 2
test suite.  There are some issues with these tests
that I would appreciate feedback on.

I am also looking for some suggestions for writing
tests using the blur(), focus(), select(), etc...
on several of the interfaces.
I'm not sure how to go about writing tests for
these methods.  I've tried a few things but
haven't had much luck.  


  The tests committed today:

  HTMLAppletElement11(level 1 and level 2)
  HTMLBaseElement02(level 1 and level 2)
  HTMLObjectElement01 & HTMLObjectElement19 (level 1)
  and HTMLImageElement14(level1)

  
***********************************************
  The test HTMLAppletElement11 causes the following
  alert box to appear when running on IE6 but runs
  successfully on mozilla.

  An ActiveX control on this page might be unsafe to
  interact with other parts of the page.  Do you want to
  allow this interaction?
************************************************

  The test HTMLImageElement14(level1 only) tests the lowSrc
  attribute.  The lowSrc attribute will not pass validation
  so I wrote a test similar to the one that tests
  the code attribute on the object element.  However it
  comes backs undefined instead of "". Why would
  undefined come back instead of ""?
*************************************************
  A while back I think it was Philippe that mentioned
  he had some HTMLDOMImplementation tests for the HTML
  test suite.  Philippe if possible could you commit these tests?
