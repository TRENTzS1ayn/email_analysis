[dd] As Curt indicated, the DTD (and schema) are generated

[dd] Most of the current tests are validated against the same DTD, since 
this is generated from the W3C specifications and Working Drafts. 
However, it's best to generate them using the specific target in the 
build process.

[dd] I think the best way to go about is to take a test file (XML) and 
compare it to the code which is generated from it to understand how it 
works. There isn't a description of the markup language, mainly due to 
lack of time.
