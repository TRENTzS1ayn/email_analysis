What language and/or implementation are you wanting to test?

The code generation templates are pretty numbingly complex XSLT.  Probably
the best process is to:

generate the Java tests
manually transliterate a few of them to your target language, binding and
xUnit test framework
Transliterate the framework functions
Get the few tests running
Create a test-to-whatever.xsl from test-to-java.xsl to produce something
like your transliterated tests
Iterate

I know someone has already done the process for a C or C++ parser, would
have to check the mailing list history for the details.  If you can tackle
the first couple of steps, we could probably help on the last couple.
