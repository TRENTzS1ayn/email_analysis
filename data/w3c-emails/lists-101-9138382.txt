That was problematic earlier since it required a fixed relative path between
JSUnit and the test, an absolute URL for JSUnit or having the TS include
JSUnit code.  The "injection" code attempted to address that by having the
JSUnit framework add the appropriate code to the test, but that code was
definitely browser specific.
