That can be done but it fixes the test to only working with one specific
version of JSUnit (or versions of JSUnit with a compatible jsUnitCore.js).
If you tried to run the test suite with a latter version of JSUnit, bad
things might happen.

If the implementation of the methods could be moved out of jsUnitCore.js and
replaced by proxies that do something like:

function assertTrue(msg, value) {
   //  delegate to implementation in test runner
   //    actual statement is bogus
   navigator.frames(2).assertTrue(msg,value);
}

Then you'd be able to switch to later versions of JSUnit without needed to
replace the jsUnitCore.js files in your test directories.
