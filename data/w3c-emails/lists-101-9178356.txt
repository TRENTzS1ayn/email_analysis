I suppose you could do this. An implementation of the functions is 
available in the main-data.html page. You will still need to replicate 
the page loading logic and the definition of JSUNIT_UNDEFINED_VALUE from 
jsUnitCore.js in your test page however. Seems like extra work to remove 
a conditional copy in a build process, but feel free to do whatever you 
think is best.
