I've just added the supporting test files for collection, frame, frameset and iframe to the test suite.




  I've just run dom1-html.jar with a modified versions of Xerces-J (patches attached).  Quite a few tests failed since supporting test files were missing, specifically collection.xml, frame.xml, frameset.xml, and iframe.xml (the HTML versions are also missing).
