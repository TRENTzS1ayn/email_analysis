All,

The DOM WG has a face to face meeting next week, during which it would 
be good to be able to run the DOM L2 HTML TS on IE and Mozilla. SInce we 
are still dealing with framework issues and, if I remember correctly, 
the TS does not run as is on the new framework, what would need to be 
changed so that the L2 HTML TS could be run? Has anyone succeded in 
tweaking the JsUnit alpha in order to do that?
