I started working on JSUnit after I got the HTML compatible Core tests done
10 days ago, but was only able to put a few hours into it.  Hopefully, I'll
be able to spend some more time on it this weekend.

What I would like to align JSUnit more with JUnit.  JSUnit mimics the most
common JUnit pattern of tests as functions, but does not mimic the pattern
of tests as instances of a test class.  Using instances should make it
easier to provide anciliary test information like document names,
configuration panels, and test URI's.
