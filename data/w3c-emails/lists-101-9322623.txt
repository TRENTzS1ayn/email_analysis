Could you make some guess at where you expect to by the beginning of 
Next week as the working group approaches their face to face meeting on 
Tuesday?  It seems like it may not be realistic to get any numbers by 
then, but if that is still possible, that would be a good thing.

Any real numbers that the DOM WG group could get running IE and Mozilla 
1.0 against the HTML test suite would be helpful in knowing where we 
stand in the HTML CR phase.  If the state of the current framework does 
not make it likely we will reach any meaningful numbers by the face to 
face meeting on Tuesday, then that is the message and we will have a 
much less informed discussion of where the HTML 2 implementations are.

We appreciate your work,

Ray Whitmer
