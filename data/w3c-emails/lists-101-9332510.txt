Hard to see the future is.

There are still a large number of DOM L1 and L2 HTML tests failures 
against the Xerces-J implementation that have not been investigated.  
 Rick Rivello was looking into that earlier in the month, but has not 
reported anything since the 6th.  It would be very helpful if any 
additional analysis of the test failures could be provided and errors in 
the tests corrected.

I have not attempted to produce a test matrix for the L2 HTML tests to 
see what methods might not be covered.  However, a quick check shows 
that createHTMLDocument and contentDocument (the two methods added in L2 
HTML) have no tests written for them.

I've spent a couple of hours tonight on jsUnit attempting to add the 
JavaScript equivalent of junit.framework.TestCase.  I'll plan to spend 
time on it this weekend and it is possible, but definitely not assured, 
that I could get some test results this weekend.
