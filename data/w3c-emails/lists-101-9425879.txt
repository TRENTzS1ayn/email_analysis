   I've been running the DOM HTML Level 2 tests and have discovered
   that running the tests on IE6 takes approx 3 minutes while running the
   same tests on Mozilla takes approx 22 minutes.  Has anyone else
   had similar results?  Is there something I need to set/change within the 
   Mozilla browser to make it run faster?
