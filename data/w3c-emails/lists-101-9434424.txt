I don't think that anyone else has been running the tests on the old JSUnit
and the new JSUnit isn't ready yet.  Running the old tests on JSUnit on
Mozilla definitely stressed the browser in unnatural ways and would crash
due to issues not directly related to the implementation.  Hard to believe
that changing the case of an argument to an assertion would cause the
browser to crash, though.

Can you summarize the results of the tests against IE6?
