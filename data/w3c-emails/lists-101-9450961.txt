I tried to run Bob's tests on my Windows XP and didn't have lots of
success unfortunately.

I wasn't able to try with Mozilla 1.0.1 but both Mozilla 1.0 and 1.1
didn't run the tests.

IE6 becomes unstable when running the tests for Core (it crashed after 2
or 3 retries) but I managed to obtain a result for DOM level 2 HTML (see
attachment). That is interesting data for the WG since it shows that
some types in IE6 don't match the ones in the CR of DOM level 2 HTML.
There are some uppercase/lowercase issue as well and some of them are
probably errors in the tests themselves. A tagName will "BODY" if the
document was HTML 4, and "body" if the document was XHTML 1. If someone
has the output results from Mozilla 1.0.1, I'd like to have a look at
them.
Curt mentioned that createHTMLDocument and contentDocument tests were
missing so I started to work on them. I have 2 for createHTMLDocument
but are not able to test them for the moment unfortunately.
