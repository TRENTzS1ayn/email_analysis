Philippe,

When you run the test with Mozilla, try it with a fresh profile to make 
sure you haven't disabled features that are required for the framework 
such as opening windows, setting status bar, etc.  To create a new 
profile, start mozilla like this:

mozilla -profileManager

After you create a fresh profile, can you run the standard jsUnit tests at
<http://bclary.com/jsunit/jsunit/testRunner.html?testpage=http://bclary.com/jsunit/jsunit/tests/jsUnitDeclTestSuite.html> 
?

If you can not run the standard tests, open the JavaScript Console 
(Tools->Web Developer->JavaScript Console) and copy/paste the error 
messages into an email and send them to me please.

If you can run the standard jsUnit tests, please try the demo dom ts 
with Mozilla again. If it fails to run, please use the JavaScript 
Console and send me the error messages.

When you ran the DOM Core 1/2 tests with IE6 which implementation did 
you use? native? MSXML 3 or 4? Which suite did you run? What version of 
MSXML do you have installed? You can find the msxml*.dll files in 
c:\winnt\system32\. Right click them and choose properties then the 
version tab.

If no one else has the test results available, I will post them later today.

Bob
