Are you experiencing the same performance issues with my variant of JSUnit
from earlier this week.  A quick test this morning was about 350 seconds for
text/html on Mozilla 1.0 on a Pentium III 700.  

Could not provide numbers for IE since any exception was stopping the tests
on my machine.

I did fix up a number of capitalization issues in the tests at that time
that may not be reflected in Bob's demo.
