Mozilla 1.1 Alpha Released
Mozilla 1.1 Alpha is our bleeding edge alpha release which is meant to 
get wider testing for all the changes that happened on the trunk since 
we branched for Mozilla 1.0. See the release notes to find out what's new.

The trunk is not really the best place to be testing at the moment. :-)

you can find zip files and installers for Mozilla 1.0.1 at: 
<ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla/nightly/latest-1.0/>

I usually dl a zip version and unzip it into a separate location. It is 
usually easiest when running multiple versions.
