I've made modifications to many of the level1/html/files/*.html files to 
make them valid HTML 4.01.  The most common chance was to changed the 
public id when the public id identified the document as strict, but it 
contained transitional elements or attributes.  Also synchronized id and 
name attributes when they differed, removed onfocus and onblur 
attributes and added a few summary attributes to tables to avoid warning 
messages from JTidy.

I assume there are similar problems in the XHTML documents and in the 
level2 fileset, but that is for tomorrow.
