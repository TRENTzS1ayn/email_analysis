Changed in DOMTestCase.js rev 1.14.
DocumentBuilder.isDOMExceptionCode(ex,code) now returns (ex.code == code).
This results in every test where an expection is anticipated to fail for all
COM-based implementations accessed from JScript.

If a test's expected behavior is deemed to not be required by DOM L1 Core
but to be required by DOM L1 Core, then the test should be removed from the
DOM L1 Core conformance test suite (that is removed from alltests.xml) and
added to the DOM L2 Core conformance test suite.  We also could create an
nonnormative test suite for tests failure of which is undesirable but would
not constitute a non-conformance.

However, I'm not sure what the magic phrase that makes providing default
attributes required in DOM L2 and optional in DOM L1+Errata.  It would be
good if DOM L3 could be extremely clear on the conditions, if any, that a
conformant processor could not provide attribute nodes for default values.

For example:

1.2 Interface Document)
