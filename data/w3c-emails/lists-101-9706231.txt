We are still using Xalan-J 2.2 since when we attempted to use pre-release
versions of at Xalan-J 2.3, there were still problems with the large number
of document() calls being made in the transforms for the overall test
suites.  I haven't tried using the current Xalan-J code base on DOMTS for
quite some time, so those issues might be resolved.  I'll take a look at
running the build process with the current Xalan-J and log the appropriate
bugs.
