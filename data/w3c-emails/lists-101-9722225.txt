My  opinion is we should only  accept submitted tests in the XML DOMTS 
format.  If there are binding-specific things, then this should be 
accomodated using that format.  I do not feel  that the potential for 
getting more tests in a particular language outweighs the advantage in 
getting all of  them in a platform-neutral way.

Were the current guidelines  not strict, the anticipated Netscape 
contributions would not be language-neutral.  If the  tests were  not 
language-neutral, and some tests were submitted that did not apply to 
the platform I work on, my incentive to care about  the correctness of 
the tests would diminish, which I believe would result in a lower quality.

On the other hand, Netscape would have loved to just dump all its tests 
into someone else's hands and not worry  so much about format or quality.
