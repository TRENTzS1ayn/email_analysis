I was thinking of something similar, although maybe trying to translate the
xml into [X]HTML that wasn't gibberish.  My first thought was trying to make
a table that had elements that corresponded to employees.  We would have to
be careful to ensure that the proper content models were represented.

I'm home on medical leave right now and can't really work on it this week.
I
hope to be able to put some time into this next week.  If someone else gets
to it first, just let me know where you are and how I can help.
