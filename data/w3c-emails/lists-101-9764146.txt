Hi Everyone,

I'm about to start on trying to translate the level1 core xml 
tests to be html only tests.  This will involve translating 
staff.xml to an equivalent [X]HTML file, and modifying each 
of the core tests to use this file, and manipulate the new 
elements, attributes inside of this file.  Before I start, I 
have a couple of questions:

1) Curt, could you possibly supply a skeleton with pointers 
to how the tests should be set up?  In particular, should I 
do anything inside the test to indicate that the test is for 
HTML only implementations?  What about any pointers 
regarding case-sensitive, case-insensitive comparisons?
I know this has been discussed, but I don't remember 
the resolution.

2)  Where should I put the tests? Under tests/level1/core - 
should we mix them with the available xml tests or create 
a separate directory?

3) What about naming -- my gut feeling is that the tests will 
be similar in concept to the xml equivalent, but may be 
significantly different in terms of what tags we grab, etc.
Any feelings on whether we should keep the nameHTML, 
or possibly name them as we did for level2 tests, or 
any other suggestions?

Thanks,

--Mary
