XHTML test files must be valid to be XHTML in the first place; technically speaking though, there is a way to have valid XHTML just by adding a 'wrapper'[1] to the existing files while using XHTML Modularization (either in XML Schema [1] or DTD [2]). I would be very interested to help if something like that is chosen, especially if XML Schema is involved.

[1] like

<!DOCTYPE  bla>
<html xmlns="myDomain/bla">
   <head>
      <title>
         Untitled
      </title>
   </head>
   <body>

<!-- existing XML content -->

   </body>
</html>

[3] http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-modularization/

Kindest regards,

Manos
