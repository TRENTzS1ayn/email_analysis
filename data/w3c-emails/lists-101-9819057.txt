Did anyone try the suggestion of creating an internal dtd instead of external?
Will this fix the problem without requiring validation?

  Subject: Tests that depend on node being inserted for default attributes


  Per http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom-ts/2002Mar/0002.html, I just marked 9 tests (listed below) that depend on nodes being inserted for default attibutes to only be applicable when the processor under test is validating.   If a processor supports validation, the existing validation setting will be overriden for these tests.  If a processor does not support validation, the test will be skipped.
   
  Currently, the ECMAScript harness does not implement support for implementationAttributes so it does not immediately remove the 9 tests from the reported failures for Mozilla.  However, that will be corrected as part of the development of the new test runner.
   
  To determine the tests affected, I (temporarily) removed the default attributes from staff.dtd and logged the tests that then failed with Xerces-J 2.  
   
  The tests that will now only run with validation = true are: attrdefaultvalue.xml, attrnotspecifiedvalue.xml, attrspecifiedvalueremove.xml, documentcreateelementdefaultattr.xml, elementremoveattribute.xml, elementremoveattributerestoredefaultvalue.xml, elementretrieveallattributes.xml, namednodemapremovenameditem.xml, namednodemapremovenameditemgetvalue.xml;
