Can you take a look at the existing files, under
/level1/core/files and give it a try?

known XHTML elements as usual while determining the display of the rest
based on style (CSS) or some default handling rules (i.e. display the text
contained in them). Validation is not mandatory.

that contains the XHTML modules along with the custom modules.

example using HTML specific collections such as document.forms) or raw XML
tests to non XHTML elements included in such a file while the file is valid
(either as XML or XHTML).
