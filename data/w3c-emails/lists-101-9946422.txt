[dd] In case the resolution is not clear, which I'll know as soon as the 
minutes become available, I'll take the issue up with the DOM WG again 
and report back to this list.

In any case, default attributes in a processed (known) DTD are to be 
present; in the internal subset case, having been processed, they should 
be in the DOM.

I thought this was clear from my March 2 post with the report from the 
DOM WG F2F, http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom-
ts/2002Mar/0002.html. On rereading I understand that there is an issue 
with internal as opposed to external subsets.

[dd] Are there any other issues that have not been promptly or 
satisfactorily discussed by the DOM WG?

[dd] I think my comment above resolves this. HOwever, let me 
double-check.

[dd] The issue, as I have understood it, is whether default attributes 
should be in the DOM, and this divides further into two cases, internal 
and external. Is that right? The resolution points toward your 
interpretation being correct (the 'when validated' clause allows for 
testing only internal or also external subsets).
