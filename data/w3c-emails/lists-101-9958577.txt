Here is my take on it, speaking personally, not for the WG:

Pro: The XML specification requires processing of attributes in the 
internal subset in some cases (see the XML spec for which cases are 
required and which are not).  Also, since Mozilla relies on a quality 
parser implementation, I would fully expect Mozilla to pass (or in the 
unlikely case it did not, to be fixed promptly).

Con: This is not a common practice (find me a use case on the web), and 
there are a few complications you have to be aware of when designing the 
test case, so whether you really want to construct the test seems to be 
a matter of priority.
