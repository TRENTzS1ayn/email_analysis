I sent a message earlier which may need to be qualified (it's on the web 
archives but hasn't been forwarded yet):

The DOM WG has on several occasions discussed this issue, and it is one 
which goes back to XML 1.0, as Ray indicates.

My personal reading, not necessarily that of the DOM WG, is that default 
attributes should be present with the value specified in the internal 
subset, if the document has one [1].

For our purposes, I think we should come up with some use cases for 
having internal subsets, as Ray points out.
