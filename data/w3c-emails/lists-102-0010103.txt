Yep, that's what I meant.

you're right, I have to dig into that.

Actually what I meant here is that the example is to start the discussion, I'm 
in favor of a language independent setup.

Currently we have implemented it on top of DOM, although it was a poor mans 
choice. I think it should be an integral part of DOM.

Remember this is our implementation which was an example. We use a standard 
where our interfaces have a suffix If, which obviously is different from the w3c 
convention.
