    so the choices now are a) nothing happens for a year 
     and we all
     hope that the Query WG does what we want; b) the DOM defines an XPath
     extension; or c) some ad-hoc group proposes an interim 
     "standard" (a la SAX,
     perhaps) and encourages vendors to support it.  I think this 
     mailing list is
     considering b) vs c) ... and a) is the default, I guess.

Or we introduce a formal note to w3c along the lines Scott suggests,
which puts a peg in the ground onto which the various groups can
hang their little bits? I like the 'survival of the used' approach.
Why shouldn't c be via the w3c rather than 'ad hoc'?
