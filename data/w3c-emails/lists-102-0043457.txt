     We believe that and XPath API as part of DOM makes sense, it 
     takes way too long 
     before the Query WG has a spec available. This API is supposed 
     to get the 
     discussion started. (and nothing more !, feedback is appreciated)
   
big snip.

Not sure I like the seperation of namespace from xpath string.

What would be the call for something like

 //rdf:name/item[@mine:attrib="x"]

Would it involve setting the namespace first, then executing the 
call?
