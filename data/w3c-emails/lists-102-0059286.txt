I've seen many cases of this.  Certainly this occurs in an XSLT engine
(some XSLT engines may want to use the facilities provided in the DOM
implementation).  If someone is writing their own custom transforms using
Java or JavaScript and XPath, it could easily occur.  In a client
environment where an application is processing many tiny DOMs I guess it
could occur.
