     Maybe this actually is the killer use case for XPath on DOM?
     That an XSLT
     engine should be able to use it rather than to have to
     implement it's own
     XPath implementation?

Sorry to sound negative, but I haven't yet heard anything
convincing that says this is 'real'.


Some... may.. could.. I guess...

Can I sound unconvinced that there is a real use case here.
