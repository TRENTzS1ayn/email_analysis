I agree and I think most MSXML users fit into this category (I bet Oracle
users will follow suit). Ever since selectNodes was introduced, I hardly
ever use any of the other hierarchical members (of Node) for traversal.

Agreed.

I'm starting to believe that a combination of *minimal* and *performant*
should be the scope of this work. I think a *minimal* solution that covers
90+% of the use cases is a good first step, while looking forward to a more
long-term, complete solution that ties in with the work of XML Query.
