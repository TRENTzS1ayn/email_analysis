     Has anyone got an example of where this problem is likely to arise? I
     can't think immediately of any reason why it should be more common with
     DOM than with XSLT, and it doesn't appear (yet) to have popped up as an
     XSLT problem.

ce.

I'm not saying its more common in as a DOM  issue,
just that its fully integrated in an xslt implementation.
From the code I've seen, its a 'bolt on' for the dom.
