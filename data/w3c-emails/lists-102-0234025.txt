     If we're going to leave out namespace-aware documents, we 
     might as well call
     it a day,

No, not call it a day. Declare that it is not compliant (yet).
I'd still support this as an initial release.
Declared, its surely an improvement on the MS 'wrong'
(but practical) compliance approach.
     <foo xmlns="urn:foobarbaz">
        <bar>
           <baz baq="booz"/>
        </bar>
     </foo>
  
     
     If we want this API to conform 100% with XPath 1.0, we're kind 
     of stuck when
     dealing with default namespace declarations. But if we care more about
     usability, MSXML's approach is more straightforward.

good example Aaron.

I would risk this for a clean & early response, with
a compliance goal when we can do it cleanly.
