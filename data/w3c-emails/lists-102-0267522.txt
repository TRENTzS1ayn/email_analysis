I think a minimal approach won't get the necessary support by W3C which
is critical, otherwise we'll get another note which is archived for
several years.

I'm in favor for a complete support including the full context, I don't
see any reason why this shouldn't be possible within limited time.

By the way, 

Who's visiting WWW9 or the AC meeting in Amsterdam ?
Because it's in Amsterdam I'm in the position to organize a face-to-face
parallel to the conference, this might speed things up. Any need for
that ?
