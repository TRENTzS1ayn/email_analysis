ries, streaming support, etc.)


     I think a minimal approach won't get the necessary support by W3C which
     is critical, otherwise we'll get another note which is archived for
     several years.
but it would provide a solid start on which to build?

     I'm in favor for a complete support including the full context, I don't
     see any reason why this shouldn't be possible within limited time.
-1 for reasons above.

     By the way,

     Who's visiting WWW9 or the AC meeting in Amsterdam ?
     Because it's in Amsterdam I'm in the position to organize a
     face-to-face
     parallel to the conference, this might speed things up. Any need for
     that ?

I'm in Amsterdam for the AC meeting.
