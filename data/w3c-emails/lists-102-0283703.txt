Though a lot of the follow-up items were from me, I would agree.  However,
we also need to know where the design is likely to go as it grows.  KISS is
not a good thing if the designers are blind to the curves ahead.  Make a
list of potential user requirements, then purposefully say what we're not
going to do on the first pass.  Have a rough plan, even though we may only
implement 10% of the plan.
