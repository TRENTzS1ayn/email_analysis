No.  MSXML's approach is worse than not compliant.  It is wrong... if you
try to fix it later, you break applications that used the broken approach.
I might be able to live with incomplete conformance, but there is no way I
can live with incorrect conformance.  It is not an option to define another
standard because someone thinks it  is more straightforward, IMHO.
