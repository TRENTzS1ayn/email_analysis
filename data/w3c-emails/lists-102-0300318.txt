I would propose that we create three rough competing proposals for a DOM
XPath:

1) Ultra Minimal (e.g. Microsoft/Oracle selectNodes as they exist today).

2) Minimal but with separate interface+namespace context support.

3) Complete as makes sense (e.g. full context initialization, variable
support, maybe matching, maybe compiled queries, etc.)

Then we can vote on which one we want to converge on.  If, as is probable,
we decide on 1) or 2), we can use 3) as a potential long range plan, and
try to see if there can be a continuum from at 1) or 2) to 3).

I would be glad to work with someone on either 2) or 3) (preferably 3).
