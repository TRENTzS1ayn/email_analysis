     Though a lot of the follow-up items were from me, I would
     agree.  However,
     we also need to know where the design is likely to go as it
     grows.  KISS is
     not a good thing if the designers are blind to the curves
     ahead.  Make a
     list of potential user requirements, then purposefully say
     what we're not
     going to do on the first pass.  Have a rough plan, even though
     we may only
     implement 10% of the plan.

OK, thats an improvement Scott:-)

Know what the vision is, but isolate the (achievable) steps
towards that goal.
