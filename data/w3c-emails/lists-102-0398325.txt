Ditto from me for the straw poll.

Which is to say, I still think we (or a subgroup) should do a draft
proposal for 3), if only to see what the continuum might be from 2) to 3).
Also, some folks, like me, *will* implement more complete APIs for XPath,
regardless.  If we have a draft proposal for a complete API, it will at
least give some guidance to implementors, so that later, when the API is
firmed up, the transition may be easier.
