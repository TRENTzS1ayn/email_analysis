Fair enough: Mike pointed this out to me just after I posted
that message.

That said, it would be nice if we could come up with an XPath
query module for the DOM in time for Level 3. Given that a full
blown, well architected, language independent XPath API
probably won't be forthcoming in time, it might be worth
focussing on something a bit more modest, at least initially.

Cheers,
