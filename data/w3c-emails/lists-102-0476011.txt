Defining a lightweight DOM of DOM Level 2 core is in the scope of the DOM
WG/IG/Public. Even if there is a need for a "core of the core", I think that
this is outside the scope of this mailing list. Proposals are always welcome
on the DOM public mailing list but don't expect anything for DOM Level 3. Our
list of issues for DOM Level 3 is already full. This is unfortunate but the DOM
WG can't address all requests. Our goals for DOM Level 3 are defined in
the requirements document :
 http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Requirements/
As usual, comments on our requirements are always welcome.
