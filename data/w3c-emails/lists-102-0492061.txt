Personal view?
I don't give a shit whats behind it. I want an xpath interface
to a document. Be it in a database, in memory in dom, or written on
carbon paper with a blunt knife.
  But thats just a users view :) Sorry.

If I'm talking small, fast, perhaps an in-memory document is OK.
If I'm talking huge, then a db would be 'best'.
  DOM is only useful in that it provides the standard api to a 
well formed (maybe valid) document.
No more, no less.
