DOM's hasfeature() could be used for this, but unless anyone has a
strong case for not implementing the full set of functions (and they
don't look too scary to me) I think the any compliant DOM XPath
implementation should just implement the lot, and leave hasfeature() for
querying whatever is tricky enough to be left optional. Liek XPath
itself!
