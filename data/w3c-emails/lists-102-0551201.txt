Well, I'm just reaching.  Match pattern support is a pretty generic
concept... a perl library could do this, I guess, though the match values
should probably be changed to something less XSLT-based.  Context
initialization seems to me to be pretty generic also.

I'm not sure how much water "expression language independent" holds.
Certainly, the thing should be optimized for XPath, and perhaps later on
down the line for a XPath-based XMLQuery.  Do others have opinions on this?
My opinion isn't very strong.  It just seems to me to be cleaner if the
APIs are kept abstract from the expression language... it feels like
they'll be longer lived, and hold greater potential value for a wider
community.
