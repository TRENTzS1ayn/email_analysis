     Here's a revision that has Dave's requested changes.
     
     Also, I apologize if this came across as an official W3C 
     document of any
     kind, or even the start of one... I didn't realize that the 
     stylesheet had
     added the copyright, and I should have removed the W3C logo.  Please
     discard the previous version of this document.


If its intended as a submission, no problem in using the
DTD as intended. perhaps just add a 'draft' note at 
the top, or some wording as to status in the appropriate place?


Regards, DaveP
