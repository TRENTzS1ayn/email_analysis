I asked Scott to remove the logo and the copyright. Our communication staff is
a bit nervous (for historical and unpleasant experience reasons) when they see a
document with the W3C logo in it. I prefer to prevent any future problems than
waiting for them. In any case, the W3C doesn't have any rights on Scott's
proposal.
I also don't think that this mailing list wants to go in the formal W3C process
for the
moment.
Scott, for your next release, can you replace :

by
http://www.w3.org/StyleSheets/TR/base
, please ?

You don't need to resend your proposal for the change. Your proposals
are already archived on our site (see [1] and [2]) so it's too late to change
them. It could be fixed in the future release.


Regarding the proposal itself, I don't see any list of user cases. In particular,
I'm thinking about one user case but I didn't find my answer yet:

Given a specified node and a specified XPath expression (with a namespace
context),
find if the node matches the expression or not.

I can already do this using the selectNodes method but it's not very efficient:
- select the list of nodes from the document element node with the specified
XPath expression.
- check if the specified node is in the list.

Did I miss the function in the current proposal or am I the only one who would
like
to see this function ?

Regards,
Philippe
