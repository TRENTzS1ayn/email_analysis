Yep, done.  Again, I apologize for the mis-step.

Yes, you missed it.  It's in the Expression object, in the "int match(Node
context, XEnvironment environment)" method.  I intentionally didn't add
this to the Inquirer object, as it didn't seem part of the minimal
interface.   Personally, I would be just as glad to see it in the minimal
interface also.  I should note that the return values of match(...)
probably needs some work... the return values are based on what you would
want if you were an XSLT processor.

I'm glad you would like to see this functionality, because it seemed as if
most people didn't want it.

Note that match expressions are not exactly the same as XPath expressions
-- they are subsets of XPath.  There are some things that don't make sense
in match pattern expressions that are in XPath, though I forget what just
at the moment.
