     > xslt does not contain the phrase 'match pattern', only pattern.
     
     Yes, "Pattern" is what I mean by a match pattern.  The 
     relevant section is
     http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt#patterns.  Sorry, in the XSL WG we 
     often speak in
     terms of 'select' expressions (a subset of the expression syntax) and
     'match' patterns.
     
     > I still want to understand the restrictions mentioned above.
     
     The big difference is that "2+2" is not a valid match pattern 
     (but neither
     is it a valid select expression).
     
     The "match" pattern grammar is defined at
     http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt#NT-Pattern and the "select" 
     expression is defined
     at http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath#NT-UnionExpr.  The grammars are 
     pretty hard
     to read.  One difference between the two is that "../foo" is 
     not a valid
     match pattern (you can't use "." or ".."). 

Well -1 then. I need relative addressing for my use case.
Up arrow takes me from 'here' to ancestor::*[1]
  .... Unless I *can* use the full syntax as apposed to the 
abbreviated? This sounds like a crazy limitation. Is it just
the shorthand form thats disallowed? I need to read up some more.


     > One more. What document (information?) model are we assuming?
     
     Theoretically, the InfoSet.
I note the caution ;-)
