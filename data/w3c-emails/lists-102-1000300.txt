Hi,
I am using MSXML 4.0 in my application (in visual c++ 6.0)

The following XPath format using numeric predicates
node-name[pos]
is correct if pos is in the range of 1 to N.

However, in my application, even if i put the value of pos as 0, which is actually an error, it still works. any idea why?
