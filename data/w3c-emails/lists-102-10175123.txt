Right, and I'd include WebDAV along with DMA.  I think the DOM WG *should*,
maybe in Level 3, be looking at extending the DOM API to support
"zero-latency" (buzzword du jour!) interaction with repositories, lazy
loading, etc.  But for now, we've got pretty much the same tools as the
HTML people have (HTTP, etc.) to work with XML over the Web.  We can do
better someday, but this will suffice for now, and it's all the DOM can
handle for now.
