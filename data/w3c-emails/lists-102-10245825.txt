Now I am a member of this list.

Supporting query method is kind to the users, but a burden to the
implementation.
Exposing attributes, the opposite, in some sense.
I don't know which is important.
But in case of fetching default value from DTD, a query procedure must be
written AFTER ALL for Element->getAtribute. DocumentType, Attr or Element
should contain such procedure. I think DocumentType is most reasonable.
