Hi,

    I was wondering how side-effects should be implemented during error
conditions.  For example replaceChild removes newChild if it exists and
replaces oldChild...  But an error occurs if oldChild doesn't exist.  Is
newChild removed for the error case?  And can you generalize so your answer
would consistently apply for side-effects with other errors?  Thank you.
