Toivo,

From the "DOM Interfaces and DOM Implementations" section of the DOM
specification at

http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-DOM-Level-1/introduction.html#ID-E7C30826

"Attributes defined in the IDL do not imply concrete objects which must have
specific data members - in the language bindings, they are translated to a
pair of get()/set() functions, not to a data member. (Read-only functions
have only a get() function in the language bindings)."

Best,
