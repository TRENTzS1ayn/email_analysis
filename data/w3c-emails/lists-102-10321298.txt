There seems to be a minor error in the DOM Level 1 Specification.  From page
http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-DOM-Level-1/level-one-html.html :

"Interface HTMLQuoteElement
For the Q and BLOCKQUOTE elements. See the Q element definition in HTML 4.0.
"

"Interface HTMLBlockquoteElement
See the BLOCKQUOTE element definition in HTML 4.0."

It would seem that HTMLBlockquoteElement is used for BLOCKQUOTE, so
HTMLQuoteElement is presumably used only for Q.
