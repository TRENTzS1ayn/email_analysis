The new version of DOM (July 20) does not include a section for XML APIs.
The old version (April 1998) does include a section for XML APIs and the
XML APIs use some obsoleted classes (NoteIterator..)  Do you know if a new
version of XML APIs is coming soon or should we use NodeList instead of
NodeIterator?   Thanks for your time.

The XML APIs are now part of the "Core". There is a caveat in certain
interfaces that HTML-only products don't need to implement them (e.g.,
EntityReference).

NodeIterator was removed from the Level 1 spec; something like it will
return in Level 2.  In the meantime, use NodeList.
