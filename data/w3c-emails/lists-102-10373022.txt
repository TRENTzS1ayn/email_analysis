Depends on what you mean by "robust". As we've seen, NodeList has hazards
too; random deletions and insertions will change the index-number-to-node
mapping (which may result in missed or double-processed nodes) and may
create serious performance bottlenecks.

Whichever approach the user picks, they have to exercise appropriate care.
