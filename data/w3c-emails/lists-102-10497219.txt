Consider live nodelists for getElementsByTagName, for example.  This,
according to previous postings on this list, exists to support scripting in
browsers which attempt to start running the script while the document is
still being read in.  It supports at most two application programs:
Microsoft's and Netscape's browsers.  It does so at the expense of either
requiring getElementsByTagName node-lists to traverse an average of half the
tree for each call to "item", or adding a significant overhead to every
element and every editing operation.

Keeping the children of EntityReference up-to-date when the corresponding
Entity is changed is a similar nightmare.  The whole treatment of entities
is aimed at applications that _read_ XML documents, and is unuseable
(without extensions) by applications that write or edit them.

...but the process appears to have been seriously distorted by the desire to
get something out the door in time for the next release of the two browsers
mentioned above.

During which time I made major implementation decisions based on the
expected presence of iterators.  I can still keep _my_ iterators, but I have
little confidence in the ability of the WG to come up with something in the
spec that I can use with any degree of efficiency.
