>either it is being traversed or it is being edited, but not both at once

Apologies for the shorthand. Obviously accessors would have to be held off
while edits are in progress and vice versa (at least when they're in the
same area of the DOM tree), as well as edits versus edits. The trick is
reducing the granularity of locking, and trying to allow simultaneous
non-editing access, so performance impacts are minimized.
