Seconded; I agree with Stephen in thinking that the Level 1
spec nails down some behaviours that may be unintuitive in some
contexts, and complicate the implementator's job.  I find the liveness
of getElementsByTagName to be the most annoying such case, since I
think of it as something like a query, and don't expect the query
results to magically be updated.

divorced. Gets old. One thing that it doesn't do is die. It has to be killed.
