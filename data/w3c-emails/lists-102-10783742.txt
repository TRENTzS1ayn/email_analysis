I think this is a bad idea, but I won't go into my reasons now,
except to say "If the DOM isn't interoperable it's nothing."

I understand the motivation for this.  But if you have real iterators,
then the only NodeList whose liveness is at all expensive is that
returned by getElementsByTagName.  Better to just deprecate this
in favor of the obvious iterator and trivial visitor.

Why?  My (nascent) DOM implementation is based on explicit
next and previous pointers, with no explicit arrays containing
children.  The getChildren NodeList returns the node itself (or
a trivial wrapper, in some cases), and caches the most recently
retrieved child for the sake of people who use a for-loop to
iterate over the NodeList.

I prefer the second idea.
