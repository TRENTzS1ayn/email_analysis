One hacker's opinion, not authoritative:

Insert always returns the node you passed in,  so inserting a
DocumentFragment should return the DocumentFragment. Your mistake, I think,
is assuming that the DocumentFragment is destroyed by the copying process.
It isn't, it just loses all its children. The user can destroy it, or reuse
it, as they see fit.
