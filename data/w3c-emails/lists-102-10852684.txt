To:"DOM Lis"<www-dom@w3.org>

As Joe pointed out, you are assuming that the original DocumentFragment is
destroyed within insertBefore.  There is no concept of destruction in DOM
API, only removal and abandonment.

The DOM spec will not make sense all the time because sentences were added
and removed by many editors in their effort to clarify [or weasel out].
