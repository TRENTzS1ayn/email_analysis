This is how I understand it...

The following tag:
<INPUT TYPE='TEXT' VALUE='something &lt something else'>

Would be the following core DOM tree.

An Element with a nodeName of INPUT
The element would have 2 Attr nodes in its attributes NameNodeMap
The first has a name of TYPE.  It has one child 'Text' Node.  The value of this Attr would
be 'TYPE'
The second has a name of VALUE.  It has three children.
    The first child is a Text Node for 'something '
    The second child is a EntityReference for the &lt
    The third child is a 'Text' Node for ' something else'

However, I have a question about the second attr.

Should its value attribute return 'something &lt something else' or should it return
'something < something else' ?
