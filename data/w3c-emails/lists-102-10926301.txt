Actually I *was* thinking of invalidating all iterators, on the assumption
that the number of iterators is typically small, even if we can't
(due to garbage-collection considerations) determine its actual value.

For Level 1 purposes, a NodeList doesn't actually get invalidated
from the user's viewpoint; it just has to rescan the tree from the origin.

I think it's simplest to treat moves as remove + insert.
