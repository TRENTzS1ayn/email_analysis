I don't remember anything talking about this in the spec, but I'm a bit
confused on how exactly a browser should provide accessibility to the DOM
from javascript.

First, what should the traditional "document" object in javascript be bound
directly to?  Should it be an HTMLDocument object, or is it left up to the
browser on how it impliments it?  Should "Document" then be the access point
for the Level 1 Core, and "HTMLDocument" be the access point for Level 1
HTML?

Second, should the browser be assuming "HTMLDocument" context within
javascript, so that you can just call "createElement('P');" instead of
qualifying it with a name(from the above question)?

Right now, IE5 and NGLayout(Mozilla 5 engine) are very inconsistent in both
of these, and it doesn't appear you can write compatable javascript to
utilize the DOM engines in both of them.  If the spec doesn't directly
answer these questions(I didn't see anything after breezing though it
again), then something needs to be written or agreed upon very quickly,
before both of these browsers are released with incompatability at the
simpliest level.
