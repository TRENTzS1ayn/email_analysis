OK, I agree that this check is O(1). However, that's only
because the granularity of the check is so coarse: a single
document-level timestamp will cause a lot of unnecessary
invalidation ... I suspect that it would make the performance
of modifying a document via iterators unacceptably poor.

Moving to per-node timestamps would reduce the amount of
unnecessary invalidation, and preserve the O(1) check,
but at the cost of making tree modifications O(log n).

Cheers,
