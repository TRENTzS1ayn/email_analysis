I haven't had time to read about it too carefully, but there is now a
DOM Level One (XML) implementation for Perl; the information is at
<http://www.erols.com/enno/dom/>.  I am not aware of an implementation
of the HTML methods, however, and if anyone wants to work on that, I'd
be happy to contribute.  (I sketched out a few of the simpler classes
sometime last month, so I guess that's a start.)
