Things I'd like to see,

1. A standard mechanism for creating XML/HTML documents.

2. An interface for moving/copying subtrees between
   documents belonging to the same implementation.

3. An interface for moving/copying subtrees between
   documents belonging to different implementations.

4. Non-live iterators for a few, well-chosen, tree
   traversals: over children; over descendents in
   pre-order (others?).

5. A node visitor.

6. DTD support.

Cheers,


Miles
