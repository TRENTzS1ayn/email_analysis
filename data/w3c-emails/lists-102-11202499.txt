That was me.  I agree with you: I'd really prefer simple O(1) iterators with
no implementation impact and easily-documented conditions under which their
behavior is undefined.

The *also* was to mollify the crowd that wants to have robustness at any
price.  In my opinion this should be left as an implementation decision.
