Oh, I left out one major thing for me (and I suspect others): thread safety.
Even if it results in no overt API changes, the statement that DOM can be
used in a server environment is essential.  There will probably be more to
it than that, but I second Stephen's comment that DOM should be robust
enough for "real applications".  I would merely refine it to say "including
real *server* applications".

I am working on that aspect now in my implementation, and would be happy to
pass on any insights along the way.
