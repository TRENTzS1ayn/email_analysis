The message reports a possible omission in exception reasons for the
AppendChild and InsertBefore methods of Node (pages 29 and 31 in the PDF
version).

Since a document is allowed to have only one root Element, I believe the
specification should require the AppendChild and InsertBefore methods of
Node to raise a HIERARCHY_REQUEST_ERR exception if either method is used to
insert a sibling for the root Element.

The existing description of this exception states:

   HIERARCHY_REQUEST_ERR: Raised if this node is of a type that does not
   allow children of the type of the newChild node, or if the node to
   append/insert
   is one of this node?s ancestors.

I suggest changing this to read:

   HIERARCHY_REQUEST_ERR: Raised if this node is of a type that does not
   allow children of the type of the newChild node, or if the node to
   append/insert
   is one of this node?s ancestors, or the action would create a sibling
   for a
   document root element.
