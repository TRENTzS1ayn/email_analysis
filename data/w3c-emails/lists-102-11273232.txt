Is there a standard way to access the 
Element Type Declarations read from a DTD.
I have looked at several implimentations of DOM 
and there seem to be extentions to the DOM DocType interface
with methods like 
    NodeList getElementTypes() or 
    Enumeration  getElementDeclarations() or
    cloneElements()

What is the prefered or correct way to access
the element declarations on a parsed DTD
or is there a way in DOM 1.0. If not what does the
future spec look like.

I would like to get a list of elements declared in the DTD
with the attributes possible.

Thanks, jcl.
