I apologise in advance if this is an inappropriate posting, or this 
subject has been covered before, but I'm new to this list.

I would like to write an application in Java which uses the DOM 
interface to transfer information from an HTML page to a database.  
Reading the w3 DOM pages this seems to be the sort of thing the DOM 
is designed for.  Can anyone tell me whether the DOM/Java is ready 
for this yet - I can't see anything in the jdk1.2 documentation about 
the DOM, but maybe I've misunderstood something?

Any information gratefully received.
