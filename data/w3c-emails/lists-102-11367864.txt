I think the simple answer is that nobody has done it yet, though the idea
has been discussed. The folks on these working groups are very busy, and
it's been a lot of work getting out what has been done so far.

Incidentally, the "mapping to OMG IDL" is actually the specification from
which other bindings are mapped, not a mapping. Java and EcmaScript are
both language bindings.
