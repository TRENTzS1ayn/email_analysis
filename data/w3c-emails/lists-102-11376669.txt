This should be possible. I think that data types will be an issue - you may
need to use some form of regular expression to infer data types from the
form of the data. And the DOM will only help you in reading the HTML pages,
it won't do anything on the database side, that's not what it's designed for.

The DOM will require you to navigate the page to access the information.
