Hmmm....we seem to have interpreted the question differently.

I thought she wanted to take information from web pages and put them into
traditional databases, not XML/SGML/HTML repositories like Texcel. For
repositories, the best route is for the repository vendor to support the
DOM directly, as we intend to. I can't say anything about dates, though.
