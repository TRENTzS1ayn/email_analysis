Fiona:

Sun's XML library is not included in the JDK1.2 release, however you can
download the XML extensions from the following URL:

http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/earlyAccess/xml/index.html

This download provides a bunch of XML related stuff, including an
implementation of DOM - however it is an non-conformant release at this
stage.  According to Sun's documentation they are in the process of bring
this to up-to-date with the DOM recommendation.

Cheeers, Steve.
