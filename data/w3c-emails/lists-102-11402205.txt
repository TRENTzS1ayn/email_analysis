Fair enough ... Another thought I had is that it *should* be possible to
write a DOM application in Java that serializes an XML or HTML document (or
subtree) to/from a database using JDBC.  (I forget -- are there some
limitations on a DOM application's ability to serialize an arbitrary
document?  Perhaps some of the XML entity/notation stuff won't round-trip,
my memory is fuzzy ... But the DOM Level 1 *should* be powerful enough to
serialize an HTML or simple XML document, right?).  Has anyone seen such a
thing, or tried to do it?
