Unfortunately we do not currently have any french translation of the DOM
Level 1 Specification. I'd like to use this as an opportunity to remind
people that volunteers to translate the spec in various languages are
always welcome. Several people have sent a message stating they were
going to work on such a translation. If you have got anything available,
even if it's not completed, please let me know. I will add a link from
the translations page.

I just got a japanese translation.

Thanks.
