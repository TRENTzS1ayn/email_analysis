DOM level 1 loses information -- it is not possible to reconstruct the
original document from the "equivalent" DOM tree.  This is one of the
most serious problems with it, by the way.  Another is the inability to
represent generic SGML documents.  They're related.

I am hoping that these two deficiencies will be addressed in Level 2.

Examples of things that don't round-trip include choice of quotes for
attributes, named vs. numeric character entities, omitted start-tags and
end-tags in HTML documents, presence of line breaks before and inside of
tags, and whether an explicit end tag or "/>" was used on an empty tag in
XML.  And of course, the DTD and any other declarations embedded in the
document don't get into the tree, either.

I ran into one of these recently, when I was contemplating using &#64; for 
@ in documents containing my e-mail address to foil spammers (at least until
they start using DOM-based address-suckers).
