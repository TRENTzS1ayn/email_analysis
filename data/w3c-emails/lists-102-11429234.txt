Each of these is an example where there is more than one way to encode the
same document structure. HTML is slated to become XML conformant in the
future, so omitted start-tags and end-tags will become obsolete, but some
of these others might really matter in an authoring application that
persists the output.

Currently, of course, we can't persist documents, so it doesn't really
cause any problems. These things are primarily important for round tripping
- the main purpose of the DOM is to represent document structure, not the
keystrokes originally used to encode them. But as soon as we can persist
documents, round tripping gets pretty important, IMHO.

Right. We are all very aware of the need to represent the DTD.

The DOM isn't *supposed* to represent generic SGML documents, it's not in
our charter. I don't think we should spend our time figuring out how to do
record ends and other obscure things few people are using.

Now waitaminit, they can't use our DOM to do anything so despicable as
writing address-suckers...
