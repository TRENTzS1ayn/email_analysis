No. Level 2 won't address any of these, and I doubt any level will
actually. First, SGML is clearly out of the picture. Second, the goal of
the DOM WG is to make round-triping possible but this is round-triping
as in DOM -> file -> DOM, and not file -> DOM -> file. In other words,
it should be possible to serialize a DOM tree, read it back, and get an
equivalent DOM tree.

Keep in mind that the overall goal of the W3C DOM Activity is to define
a standard API that enables people to write interoperable
scripts/plug-ins/modules/programs. You don't need to know what quotes
where used in the serialized version of the document for that.
