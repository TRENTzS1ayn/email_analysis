Version 0.5 of the Python/XML distribution can be downloaded from 
http://www.python.org/sigs/xml-sig/files/xml-0.5.tgz

The Python/XML distribution contains the basic tools required for
processing XML data using the Python programming language, assembled
into one easy-to-install package.  The distribution includes parsers
and standard interfaces such as SAX and DOM, along with various other
useful modules.  Version 0.5 can be considered a beta release.

The major change in this version is that the DOM implementation has
been extensively modified, and is now much closer to compliance with
the DOM Recommendation.  There are still differences on various
points, but there are a lot fewer of them, and they'll be worked on in
future releases.

Other significant changes in this version:

* A Unicode type has been added as the subpackage xml.unicode.wstring. 

* Various subpackages have been upgraded to their most recent versions.

* ... and the usual random bugfixes and improvements.

The package currently contains:

* XML parsers: Pyexpat (Jack Jansen), xmlproc (Lars Marius
Garshol), xmllib.py (Sjoerd Mullender) using the sgmlop.c accelerator
module (Fredrik Lundh).

* SAX interface (Lars Marius Garshol)
* DOM interface (Stefane Fermigier, A.M. Kuchling)
* xmlarch.py, for architectural forms processing (Geir Ove Gr?nmo)
* Unicode wide-string module (Martin von L?wis)
* Various utility modules and functions (various people)
* Documentation and example programs (various people)

The code is being developed bazaar-style by contributors from the
Python XML Special Interest Group, so please send comments, questions,
or bug reports to <xml-sig@python.org>.
