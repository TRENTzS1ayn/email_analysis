I must be feeling contrary today, but I think you're saying isn't true.
String.equals( String ) does examine the contents of two different objects
to determine that they are identical.  But this is the case only because
String explicitly overrides the equals( Object ) method in Object, which
isn't true of many objects.  The equals( Object ) method in Object only
returns true if the objects are actually the same object, ie.
( *x )->equals( *y ) if and only if x == y.
