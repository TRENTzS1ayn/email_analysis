There are actually six equivalance relations that are useful for DOM nodes;
the first four apply to objects in general:

identitytwo objects are identical if they have the same object ID. 
Java, C++ ==; LISP eq

equalitytwo objects are equal if they have the same class and the
values of all attributes and content are recursively equal.
LISP equal

equivalencetwo objects are equivalent if they are either identical or
both equal and immutable.  Equivalence is permanent; if two
objects are equivalent, nothing the program does can make
them unequal.  
Java equal (Java require that equal objects have the same
    hash code)

lexical equality  two objects are lexically equal if they have the same
  external (string) representation.  It is also useful to
  make lexical comparisons for greater and less as well. 


similaritytwo nodes are similar if they are equal, or if they have the
same node type and their names and contents are recursively
similar.  In DOM terms, they have the same structure, but
they may differ in their attributes.  This is useful for,
e.g., comparing the text of two pages from different
servers. 

textual equality  two nodes are textually equal if they are lexically equal
  after removing all markup and expanding all (defined)
  entities.
