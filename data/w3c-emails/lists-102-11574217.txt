Indeed; it looks like there are several different variations on what
equality would mean for a DOM node, and none seems obvious as the most
intuitive meaning for ==.  So the best course seems to be to define ==
applied between nodes to raise an exception, to be changed in case DOM
Level N defines it, and have a collection of functions which implement
different equality tests.
