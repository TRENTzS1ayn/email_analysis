Hi folks,

I'm attempting to use the appendChild method of the DOMDocument object
(in MSXML 2.0)in order to replicate the various children nodes from one
parsed
document to another, and I'm attempting to do the following;

newXML.appendchild oldXML.childnode(0).clonenode(True)
newXML.appendchild oldXML.childnode(1).clonenode(True)
newXML.appendchild oldXML.childnode(2).clonenode(True)

The purpose is to copy over the first two tags (i.e. the <?xml ...> and
<!DOCTYPE...> directives).  However, on the second appendchild method it

balks and tells me the method failed.  Based on the documentation, I
know a DOMDocument object can only have a single child Element, so in
those terms I can understand why the appendchild method would fail;
however, how are you supposed to add these first two elements to a new
document object?

Thanks for the help,

Derek Stevenson

p.s. I was referred to this mailing list from some folks at the XML
newsgroup at Microsoft, and said there was a way to subscribe to the XML
discussion list at the W3C.  How do I do this, or is there info on your
website?

It was actually updated the day before Stephen's post, so at most
only minor conformance problems should remain.  Drop a line if you
find any (to the address noted in the release).

This are my comments as a non-member to the PR-DOM-Level1-19980818:

"Document Object Model (DOM) Level 1 Specification Version 1.0 W3C  
Proposed Recommendation 18 August, 1998"


This comments are done after three implementations of the DOM in  
Objective-C, using the YellowBox/OpenStep Apple/NeXT frameworks.

NodeList and NamedNodeMap. The "liveliness" of this interfaces  
creates problems when at least one out of two threads of execution  
modifies the NodeList or NamedNodeMap and other[s] iterate through  
the contents. The clean object-oriented way to preserve this  
"liveliness" is to provide Iterators or Enumerators to the contents  
which take a "snapshot" of the contents of the collection object.
I propose to define this Enumerator/Iterator interface in DOM 1.0 to  
provide forward-comaptibility when thread-safety arrives to the DOM  
recommendation.


Node.
=====
The "Node" interface makes the concrete classes of the  
implementation respond to many message not related to the nature of  
the class, Like "accessor" methods to non-required instance-variables  
example: attributes [accessory method] returns null for all subtypes  
of Node except Element [seems like is an attribute of Element not  
Node].
Likewise nodeValue is used for Attribute, Text, CDATASection and  
processing Instruction but not the others.
Similar is nodeName, but when not used this responds to predefined  
constants instead of null. This behavior is inconsistent, because  
there are some nodes which will never respond with the predefined  
constant. I propose to respond with null when there is no name  
associated. If required, could be defined a new className method  
which could respond with the interface name of the node, making this  
behavior consistent.


NodeList
=======
NodeList should have the following attributes and methods removed  
from Node: firstChild, lastChild, insertBefore, replaceChild,  
removeChild, appendChild, hasChildNodes. Also could have the  
following methods previousSiblingOf(Node), nextSiblingOf(Node)  
similar to the existent attributes in Node.


Element
=======
remove methods:
  wstring                   getAttribute(in wstring name);
  void                      setAttribute(in wstring name,
                                         in wstring value)
                                         raises(DOMException);
  void                      removeAttribute(in wstring name)
                                            raises(DOMException);
  Attribute                 getAttributeNode(in wstring name);
  Attribute                 setAttributeNode(in Attribute newAttr)
                                             raises(DOMException);
  Attribute                 removeAttributeNode(in Attribute oldAttr)
                                                raises(DOMException);

Use the appropriate in NamedNodeMap.


NOMENCLATURE
===============
In the sake of consistency an a clean object-oriented design,  
Node.nodeName, Element.tagName and other node names should all be  
renamed simply "name". Prefixing an instance variable with the  
type/class as in nodeName is a wrong approach to O-O.


INSTANTIATION
=============
The creation of node objects requires to comply the DTD semantics,  
so in order to make this cleaner, the creational methods in Document  
should be moved to DocumentType which should hold the rules of  
creation of node elements.


REQUIRES PRECISION
==================
The specification for method Text.splitText(in unsigned long  
offset), requires an example to clarify what happens when a Text with  
3 characters is divided at offset 1?. Who knows thte answer, the  
spec does not tell.

What is the rule to return a predefined constant when calling to  
Node.nodeName?. What happens when a node with a name instance  
variable does not have an associated name value? Should respond null  
or should respond the predefined constant?


MISSING XML constructs
====================
Where is thte interface to access the XMLDecl [<?xml version="1.0"  
encoding="UTF-8"?>] ? May I use a regular ProcessingInstruction?

childNodes, firstChild, lastChild.- Should not be in Node, should  
appear when the node can contain others.

previousSibling,nextSibling.- In all my implementations does not  
make sense to make a node know about siblings, only about a parent.  
This interfaces could have similars previousSiblingOf and  
nextSiblingOf in the parent nodes.
