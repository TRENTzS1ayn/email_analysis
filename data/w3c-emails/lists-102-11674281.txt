  This is a very real concern.  I think comparison if nodes is only
interesting for equality.  When Python finally implements the "rich
comparison" semantics that have been proposed, equality will be
testable indepently of ordering.

  A good point.  I was particularly interested in equality *without
consideration for parent*.  So, I was ignoring context.
  Perhaps there is no fully general equality that isn't identity?  I
think the Python implementation would still require implementation of
a comparison method to achieve this since it uses proxy nodes, but
that's really just an implementation detail.  Python's native identity 
operator doesn't work in the presence of proxies that represent the
same node.
