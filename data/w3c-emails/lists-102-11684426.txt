  The spec does include IDL, and a Python binding for IDL is being
developed.  (Now, I've not checked that the Python DOM uses the Python 
IDL binding.  Andrew, perhaps you can address this in the Python
XML-SIG?)

  A couple of issues seem appearant to me, but depth is not one of
them.
  First, the current implementation of Python's comparison semantics
require complete ordering, which doesn't make sense in this case.
That can be ignored for now if the documentation states that only
equality/inequality is supported.  Future versions of Python are
expected to correct this problem.
  Second, the concerns Paul Butkiewicz raised about the relevance of
context need to be addressed.  Basic equality may have to be
interpreted as node identity.
