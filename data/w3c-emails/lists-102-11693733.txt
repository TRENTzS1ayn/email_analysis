Before you define equality generally for nodes, don't you have to define
equality for each element and even each attribute? This may be a trivial
task, but I suspect there are some issues (like if a Text node contains an
entity reference, which, after being evaluated, results in a text string
which is the same text string contained in another Text node without that
entity referene) that are not specified. 

Another issue would be order of children. Without a DTD, how do you tell
when order of child elements is significant? Perhaps this has to be an
parameter to the deep comparison operator. 

If you made a decision on these issues and defined a comparison operator,
I would say that it should be recursive because otherwise, the comparison
operator isn't all that useful. Of course, given all the vagaries in the
mapping of semantics of the word "equal" to the semantic meanings of
various subtrees of two DOM trees, I wonder whether a single generalized
equality operator will be useful to many people..
