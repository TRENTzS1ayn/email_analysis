Someone mentioned in this list or another that a set of objects
corresponding to a Visitor pattern is something that should be added to
DOM. There could be a default "equalityVisitor" that would have certain
default equality rules built in (lets say, a separate equality test method
for each DOM class). You could simply subclass the equalityVisitor to
modify the semantics of the equality test for whatever particular elements
you needed. Perhaps the equality visitor could simply have enough
configurable parameters to make it do what you want without having to
subclass.

The original context of the Visitor suggestion was for rendering XML into
HTML (I believe).
