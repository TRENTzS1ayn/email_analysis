The branch of mathematics called "Order Theory" (a subset of Discete Math)
is already a 'global and timeless standard'. I don't think we would want
to dictate any specific orders. That should be left to specific
implementors. 

Example: Compare two documents: the Bible and the Koran. 
Under the concept 'testaments of religious beliefs' they are virtually
identical. Under the concept '<somebody's personal beliefs>', the books
might be completely different. [Jon Bosak's 'tstmt.dtd' is a kind
of 'most general unifier' for the first concept above]
