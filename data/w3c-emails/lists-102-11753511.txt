To be precise:  Fully general equality (fge) for mutable objects is
identity.  Fge for immutable objects is the fge-ness of their parts,
since indiscernable objects are identical (Leibniz's criterion).

E.g. immutable strings are equal if their characters are equal,
but (mutable) vectors are equal only if they are identical objects.

(There are other definitions of equality, of course, but they are
not general.)
