The trouble with that scheme is that it makes equality hard to
reason about.  Intuitively, we expect equality to be transitive,
(if a = b and b = c then a = c), reflexive (a = a), and symmetrical
(if a = b then b = a).  Making equality depend on mutable properties
defeats this: a might = b at one time, but a later check for 
b = a might fail.

I presume this is a *destructive* reverse (leaves a reversed)?
