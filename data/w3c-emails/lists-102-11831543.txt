With the increasing use of namespaces, there seems an increasing need
for some sort of namespace support in the DOM.  Namespaces don't
really seem like something for Level 2 or higher, but are fundamental
enough that they should be added to Level 1.  Is there any work being
done on a version 1.1 of the DOM Recommendation that corrects this?
Has anyone thought about what namespace support would look like?
