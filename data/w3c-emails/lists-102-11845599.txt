In the W3C DOM Level 1 you can't do any of these things, including loading
an XML file. Implementations may give you a way to do it, but this will be
a non-standard extension to the DOM. 

We're looking at adding standard methods for creating, loading, and saving
XML documents to the DOM Level 2 specification.
