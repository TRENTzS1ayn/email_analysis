Subject:        New deadline for XTech '99 presentations
Send reply to:  Jon.Bosak@eng.Sun.COM (Jon Bosak)

The deadline schedule for XTech '99 presentations has been 
changed from a "soft" deadline of Monday, December 14, 1998, to 
a "hard" deadline of Friday, January 8, 1999.  The change reflects a 
growth in the size and importance of the conference that requires 
increased lead time in the planning and preparation of printed 
schedules.  Where formerly we were asking for early proposals but 
allowing late submissions to within a few weeks of the conference, 
we are now setting one deadline for all submissions well in advance 
of the conference.

We will make a serious effort to find a space for late-breaking
news of really serious import, but if you want a spot on stage, 
you'd better get your proposal in now.

THE CONFERENCE

XTech '99 is the third annual West Coast spring GCA conference 
for XML and related standards.  Last spring's conference, held in 
Seattle, sold out at more than 700 attendees.  This year's event, to 
be held March 7-11 in the San Jose Convention Center, promises 
even more essential news and information for the XML technologist 
plus a parallel event, XIO '99, for the live demonstration of cross-
product interoperability among exhibitors of XML products.  The 
primary sponsors of XTech '99 are the Graphic Communications 
Association, Sun Microsystems, and OASIS.  See 
http://www.gca.org for details.

PROPOSAL FORMAT

The single most important criterion for acceptance of papers at
XTech'99 will be the presentation of new technology.  The goal of
XTech'99 is to showcase the latest technical developments.  Put
simply, to have the best chance of getting on stage, you should be
prepared to demonstrate some XML-related technology that will be 
news to the audience.

As with previous events in this series, formal papers need not be
submitted in advance.  Instead, proposals should be submitted in 
clear text to xtech99@gca.org in the following form:

   Author's name and job title
   Organization
   Postal address
   Email address
   Telephone
   Fax
   Abstract (500 words or more)
   Two-sentence description for conference brochure
   Target audience
   Biographical information
   New technology that will be demonstrated

All presentations are 45 minutes in length and must be 
accompanied at the time of the conference by an electronic version 
suitable for posting on the conference web site.  Proposals for half-
day and full-day tutorials are also welcome and should be sent to 
xtech99@gca.org using the format above.

Categories for presentations and tutorials include network 
messaging, publishing systems, programming, tools, and 
products.  Presentations must be related to XML, XLink, XSL, RDF, 
DOM, and related standards, but are not limited to web 
applications of those standards.  While there will be a
track for case studies and other management topics, the primary 
XTech audience remains the XML developer and expert user, and 
therefore a strong priority will, as always, be given to running 
implementations and the very latest developments in tools and 
techniques.
