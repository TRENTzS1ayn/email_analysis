I suspect this a very old issue - I have been following the
mailing list for some time but haven't seen it discussed
recently.  Are DTDs not on the agenda for Level 2?  I
can imagine some reasons why that might be the case but
would be grateful if someone could ever so briefly summarize
the view which holds sway in the WG.
