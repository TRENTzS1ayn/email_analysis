The WG laid out a long list of options on what to work on for Level 2
(based in large part on input from this mailing list), gave everyone 4
votes, and Range, Events, Style, and Iterators/Filters were the top 4 vote
getters.

The most often cited reason for not wanting to tackle DTDs in Level 2 was
that there is a lot of impetus to define a standard XML-syntax "schema" to
replace DTDs, and we didn't want to spend a lot of time supporting DTDs
only to find that we had produced an anachronism, so we thought that
waiting to see what the schema people came up with would be a good idea.
When Level 2 is done, obviously this needs to be reconsidered in light of
whatever progress is actually made toward coming up with a standard schema
language.
