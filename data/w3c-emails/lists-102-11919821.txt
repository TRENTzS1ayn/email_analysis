Again, I apologize for barging in and asking someone to rehash
something already said many times over.  But ... may I ask if it
would be appropriate at this stage to consider or even to make
a specific proposal introducing a very small set of methods which would
today use information gotten from the DTD, perhaps later from a schema,
and would provide something quite useful without covering the full
expressiveness (or, if you will, arcaneness) of a DTD?  For example, I could
do quite a lot with only a single method which would return the set
of elements permitted in a context.

I personally think it is needed in level 2 although it may well be
less important that the 4 work items selected and, yes, I did not
participate in the prior discussions anyway.  But if the process
is such that such an idea could be entertained I do volunteer to
do the work on making a proposal which respects the overall objectives
of Level 2.
