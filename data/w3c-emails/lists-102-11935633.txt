I have just posted some thoughts on XPointer support to the xlxp mailing
list. One of the thoughts was on the need for disjoint selections (see
section 3.7 of the XPtr specification "http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-xptr#3.7").

Section 4 of the DOM 2 specification discusses range selections which is one
of the capabilities of XPointer. Disjoint selections in XPointer can be made
up of both element and span components. Something to think about...
