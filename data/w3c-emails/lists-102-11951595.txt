xlxp is a public mailing list that Ralph Ferris of Fujitsu set up for
discussion of XLink and XPointer. It is a spin-off of xml-dev.
Unfortunately, there is no archive that I am aware of.

I am reacting to the spec. Since I am not a W3C member, I am not privy to
any discussions that may have occurred on internal mailing lists on ranges
:-(

Both the string and span locations terms of XPointer "select" ranges.

Not that I can see.

I agree with you. I would very much like to see a level 0 version of
XPointer that is only about addressing. XQL seems like the best place to put
the query (disjoint selection) capability. Even the "string" location term
is borderline since it is really a query rather than a navigational
construct.
