Okay, you seem to be using the term "range" somewhat loosely.
Most XPointer location terms address parts of an XML tree that
may contain multiple data characters and/or multiple nodes in
the XML tree.  I thought you might be asserting that a stated
goal of XPointers was to be able to address any DOM range, and
I would take issue with that.  I now understand you not to be
asserting that.

I did. The word "range" is not used in section 3.7 at all.  In fact,
I scanned the entire document for the word "range," and it is never 
used in the DOM sense.  (It is used three times:  one in reference
to a number being out of range and twice to all younger or older
siblings of an element.)

Sounds like we agree on what I think is the key point here.
