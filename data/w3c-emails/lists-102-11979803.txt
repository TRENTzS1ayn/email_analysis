We say NOTHING about what an implementation does with badly formed HTML.
Obviously Netscape and Microsoft are free to continue their practice of
"fixing up" broken HTML and somehow representing it in the DOM.  The DOM WG
has argued this one to death, and all we can say is that if you want to
*ensure* interoperability of your HTML page across all compliant DOM
implementations, you *have* to make it valid HTML 4.0.  If you're
comfortable with placidly assuming that NS and MS will "do the right thing"
with invalid HTML, fine, but don't whine at *us* when your pages don't work
with some new version of a browser ;-)
