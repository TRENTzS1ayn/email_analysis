Naturally not.

Well, you're right, but not for the reason being discussed.  The
following small variant:

<TITLE>Foo</TITLE><P>Bar

*is* valid HTML 4.0 (assuming you add an appropriate DOCTYPE declaration).
It is equivalent to:

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Foo</TITLE></HEAD><BODY><P>Bar</P></BODY></HTML>

You can confirm this with the W3C HTML Validator Service.
I have put up http://www.ccil.org/~cowan/foo.html as a sample;
the Validator Service is at http://validator.w3.org .

Character data is not permitted directly within a BODY element,
which is what was wrong with my previous example.  But my points
about HTML, HEAD, and BODY all being present in all HTML documents,
even if both start-tags and end-tags are omitted, is correct.
See the HTML 4.0 DTD.
