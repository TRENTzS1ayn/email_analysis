Add a valid doctype to the original and it is a valid HTML 4 document (and I
believe 3.2).

One more thing - I was "caught out" once by having whitespace preceding the
doctype - not allowed by the spec! (since until the doctype is read nothing can
be deemed valid, I guess ;-))

Paste the above into a file and bring it up in Netscape. No complaints.

This is certainly not valid HTML 4.0 (or any other version of the standard
I can imagine), but it is "HTML-ish" in the sense that it looks enough like
HTML for the browsers to make sense out of it, and thus (I'm sad to say)
for many, many people to happily write documents in "HTML-ish" and put them
out on the Web.
