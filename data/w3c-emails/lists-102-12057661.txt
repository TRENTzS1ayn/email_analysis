Character data is not permitted directly within a BODY element,
which is what was wrong with my previous example.  But my points
about HTML, HEAD, and BODY all being present in all HTML documents,
even if both start-tags and end-tags are omitted, is correct.
See the HTML 4.0 DTD.
===========

Agreed, and as it should be.  The "evolution of thinking" that has given us the
"logical" model we have is to be admired IMHO.  If a given UA is not able to
parse minimally tagged source it (surely) doesn't qualify as a UA.
