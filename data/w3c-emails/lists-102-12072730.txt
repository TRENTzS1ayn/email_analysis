So there are basically two points:

1. The DOM Rec doesn't say what a DOM builder should do with invalid HTML,
and a conforming DOM implementation is allowed to make demons fly out
of your nose, and all that.

2. All valid HTML documents contain HTML, HEAD, and BODY elements even
if no such tags are present, and therefore conforming DOM implementations
must represent them explicitly as nodes.  (TBODY, which is a container
for table rows, obeys the same rules: it appears implicitly in every
TABLE element.)
