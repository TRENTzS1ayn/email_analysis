I've been following your thread with much intrest, and need a little
clarification.

Would the adding of these tags be the job of the builder or the DOM
implementation?  If it is the job of the DOM implementation, when should these
be added?  In the example giving earlier, I imagine it would be the job of the
builder to make sure the DOM structure represents a valid 4.0 document even if
what it is parsing is not completely valid (missing the HTML tag or such).
However, should

d = someFactory.createHTMLDocument();
d.setTitle('A New Title')

add a HTML and a HEAD (and of course a TITLE) to the document?

or should:

d = someFactory.createHTMLDocument();
d.getBody();

create a BODY tag and then return it?  What if the user really wants frames??


Much thanks
