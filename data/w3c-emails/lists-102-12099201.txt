Building DOM nodes for elements that logically must exist in an HTML
document but may not actually exist as tags in the source text *is* the job
of a DOM implementation. I don't think it matters if these fixups are done
"eagerly" when the document is created or "lazily" when someone asks for
one of the elements that were implied. 

I don't follow the implication of "what if the user really wants frames?".
