OpenXML release 1.0.5 is introduces the X3P Publisher API, support for
XHTML 1.0 and major performance improvements. Major features include:

* Substantial improvements in parser performance. The parser has been
tested to work twice as fast and memory consumption has dropped to a
quarter, owing much to improved string handling.

* New X3P Publisher API provides uniform model for publishing and
storing documents to a variety of output targets. Supports output
streams and files, XML, HTML and XHTML formats, pretty printing and DTD
control.

the DTD set for HTML documents.
