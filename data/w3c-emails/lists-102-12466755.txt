I think a more correct statement is that "DOM" doesn't let you
do what you want without writing some additional code.  You were
neither running into bugs, nor were you using extended facilities
in Sun's implementation (e.g. namespace support).  So it's nothing
specific to work Sun has done.

There are more and less efficient ways to do what you're doing,
within the context of the DOM APIs.  We're glad that you have a
solution that works for you!
