Hi,

I have found through Sun's Project X project that they are creating implementation classes for your W3C DOM Level 1 spec, but apparently only the CORE package.... I am looking for an implementation of the W3C DOM HTML spec which models the HTML elements.  Do you know where I could find some information?

Thank you,
