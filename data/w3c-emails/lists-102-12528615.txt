To position a node in relation to the position of other elements, one can
use the insertBefore() , getPreviousSibling() and getNextSibling() methods
defined by the Node interface.
As far as I know the DOM interfaces provide no method for retrieving the
numerical
value of the position of a node in a stucture implementing a NodeList.
