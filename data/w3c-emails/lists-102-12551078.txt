Hello again,

another question: How is an Event sent to the DOM?

I cannot find an IDL description of an Event reception function in the 
current DOM Level 2 draft. So,

(1) Who does initiate the event flow? Is it the DOMImplementation towards 
an Event is directed or is it a Document within a DOMImplementation? If 
it's the former, is the event then directed to ALL Documents currently in 
the DOMImplementation or only to the one that contains the target?

(2) What is the IDL notation of the method from where the event flow 
originates? What parameters does it take? This is probably the Event, 
anything else?

(3) In the current docs, it reads:
--snip--
Interface EventTarget 

       The EventSource interface is implemented by Nodes which can be 
targetted by events. The interface allows event listeners to be
       registered on the node. 
--snip--
Shouldn't this be "The EventTarget interface is implemented..."? Who 
implements the (not yet specified) EventSource interface?

Thanks for any hints, Christian.
