Version 0.5.1 of the Python/XML distribution is now available.  It
should be considered a beta release, and can be downloaded from
the following URLs:

http://www.python.org/sigs/xml-sig/files/xml-0.5.1.tgz
http://www.python.org/sigs/xml-sig/files/xml051.zip

Changes in this version:

* A DOM test suite has been written, during the course of
which a number of bugs turned up and were fixed, which greatly
increases my confidence in PyDOM's compliance with the DOM
Recommendation.  Test suites have also been added for various other
modules.

* Added marshalling into various XML-based formats: a generic
one for Python objects, WDDX, and XML-RPC.  The generic marshaller can
be subclassed to implement marshalling into a specific DTD; both the
WDDX and XML-RPC marshallers were implemented in this fashion.
 
* Collected the licences for everything into a LICENCE file.

* Various subpackages (sgmlop, xmlarch, xmlproc, expat) have
been upgraded to their most recent versions.

friendly party, but they say nothing, and if we do not use the gifts they
bring, they carry them as silently away.
