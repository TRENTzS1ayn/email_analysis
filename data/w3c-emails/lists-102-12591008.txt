The current DOM specification for insert operations specifies that it throw
an exception if newChild was created from a different document than the one
that created this node.  

Q1: If you do want to import nodes from multiple documents, is there an API
call to change the owner of a node, or to make a copy within another
document of a node from another?

I suppose one could do it by hooking up input/output streams, but I think
the API should support these operations.

Q2: Does anyone else have a requirement to merge/import DOM's ?

Thank you.
