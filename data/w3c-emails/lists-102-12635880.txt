When are we likely to get a peek at the next version of the DOM spec?  A
number of questions keep coming up related to creating documents and moving
nodes between documents, both of which are scheduled to be addressed in the
Level 2 spec.  I have coded around these issues in my implementation, but it
sure would be nice to make my version conform to what will ultimately be in
the spec.
