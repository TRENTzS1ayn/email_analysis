Yes, yes, yes I know.  But as always I need to publish to joe sixpack who
lives in the here and now.  I've been pushing for this external entity to
be implemented in through the object tag.  Is that a valid place?  I've
been speaking to my local browser vendor (Microsoft) to include this
functionality, but in an appropriate place.  Object seems to be a good
candidate. CSS does not.
