I just tried replacing the root element with:

a) another element
b) a fragment containing one element
c) a fragment containing two elements

What I expected was that (a) and (b) would succeed and (c) would fail. 
 (Remember that when you replace a node with a fragment, the children of 
the fragment and not the fragment itself are used.)  None of the five DOM 
implementations I tried got the results I expected.  Any opinions as to 
which (if any) is right and why?
