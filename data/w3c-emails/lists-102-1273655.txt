As you know, you can't, either my way or your way.

I don't think so, for two reasons:

#1. The OBJECT tag includes an essentially opaque object. I don't think
it should have radically different semantics when it is including HTML
code.

#2. The feature *already exists*. There is syntax for it, documentation
for it, working implementations (not browsers, but hundreds of other
tools), well-defined semantics, etc.

#3. The external entity feature must be implemented for XML anyhow. Now
is as good a time as tomorrow.

I disagree with the former statement but agree with the latter.
