I am now reading "W3C DOM REC-LEVEL-1-CORE" document. 
Then, I have one question about the location of "DocumentType" object.

Could someone show me how "Document" object must hold 
the "DocumentType" object?

In the current DOM spec, we can see two different explanations.

At first, at the DocumentType section, that was written
as follows:

:Each Document has a doctype attribute whose value is either null or
: a DocumentType object.

But, at the "1.1.1. The DOM Structure Model", It tells:

:The node types, and which node types they may have as children,
:  are as follows:
:   Document -- Element (maximum of one), ProcessingInstruction,
:               Comment,  DocumentType
:                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^

So, Should "DocumentType" object be Document's
1)child ?
2)attribute ?
3)both child and attribute ?
4)either child or attribute ?

Thanks in advance.

Best regards,
