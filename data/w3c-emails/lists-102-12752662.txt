The GMD-IPSI XQL engine, a Java based storage and query
application for large XML documents, has been updated to the
first non-beta release 1.0.0. The distribution contains:

1. A full, persistent implementation of the W3C-DOM
2. A full implementation of the XQL language

The download site is http://xml.darmstadt.gmd.de/xql/ .

New Features for PDOM:
  - Support for all W3C-DOM operations, including updates and inserts.
  - PDOM files are build using SAX events, main memory no longer is a
    limit for file size. 
  - PDOM now includes a fully fledged org.w3c.dom.Document interface.
  - The PDOM file can be compressed on the fly, saving disk space.
  - The PDOM is thread-safe for read and write access.
  - New command line interface for multithreaded benchmarks.
  - New public package with DOM utility functions, including: 
    - pretty-printing XML from a DOM, 
    - instantiating a DOM from RTF and HTML (requires Swing). 
  - The Entity_Reference interface is supported. 

New Features for XQL:
  - Added regression test suite. 
  - Command line interface improvements: 
    - Allow user to choose any SAX parser and DOM implementation. 
    - Option to control whitespace treatment. 
    - Accept URL and filenames as input source. 
  - Queries can be posed against HTML, returning XHTML 
  - Support of name:* in queries. 
  - Speed improvement for queries involving attributes. 

Fixed Defects:
  - Greatly improved API documentation. 
  - Queries of the form //@* and //@name missed parts of the result.
  - Subscript, filter and function calls had wrong precedence.
  - The jar file for 1.0b1 was not working with JDK 1.2.x.
  - Fixed wrong mixed usage of 'current set of reference nodes' and
    'search context'. 
  - Corrected XQL functions end() and index(). 
  - API change: User defined functions are now passed the current
    reference node and a set of reference nodes. 
  - Upgraded to JavaCC 1.0. 
  - Removed hardcoded dependencies on xml4j.
