Hi:

I was trying to construct a html table using DOM (Level 1 HTML). I found
insertRow which returns rowelement and insertcell which inserts a cell
in each row. However, i cannot find any API to fill the contents of a
cell. Can someone please
let me know what i am missing ? How can i insert content into each cell
in a table ?

thanks a lot,
hari.
