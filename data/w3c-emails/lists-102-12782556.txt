The way I would do it is to create a text node and then make that text
node the content of the table cell.  This may be the only way.  Thus
you could have a function like the following ECMAScript:

function makeTDWithText ( textstring ) {
  // returns a TD element with text textstring inside
  tdElem = document.createElement("td");
  tdElem.appendChild ( document.createTextNode( textstring ) );
  return tdElem;
}

Many of the functions needed for manipulating text are in the DOM level
one core, rather than the DOM level 1 HTML.
