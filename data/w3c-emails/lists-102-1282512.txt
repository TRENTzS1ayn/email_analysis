I've now received an authoritative statement on this. I'm glad to say I
can let this list know of the notation that actually *works* in Netscape
Communicator:

include-source: url(firstdoc.html);

I understand this will be published any day now on
developer.netscape.com/...somewhere...

Cheers, nice to see this list get a useful start
