That pretty much depends on how you define "xml:space=default". Is
'default' a specific behavior, or is 'default' really "no intentions as
regards application space handling". My understanding of the XML REC is
that there are only two possible states: preserve and default, where
default and clueless are pretty much the same.

In no place does it really say what 'default' should be, which is what
the WS RFC attempts to clarify.
