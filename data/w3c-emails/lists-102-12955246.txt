Some general thoughts: 

1. It would be really, really nice if the DEFAULT behavior were 
deterministic, i.e., guaranteed to produce the same DOM tree
under different parser implementations.  If one is concerned
about parser efficiency (i.e., not unduly constraining parser
implementations), then an option could allow the parser to
produce its preferred DOM tree for maximal speed.
In other words, it would be nice if the specifications supported
an application development model of: "FIRST make it correct, 
THEN make it fast".  This would be best supported by making
the default behavior be the most deterministic, and the non-default
behavior be the fastest (assuming one must choose between the two
objectives).

2. It seems to me that the most appropriate 
default should be to NOT preserve whitespace, since:

a. This is likely to be the behavior that is
desired by most applications; and

b. The people writing the applications that wish to
PRESERVE whitespace will be a somewhat more select group
of programmers; thus it is more reasonable to require
them to know a little more than others, rather than
the other way around.

Personally, I like to think of XML as a very direct
representation of an abstract syntax tree.  Under this
kind of thinking, syntactic details such as whitespace 
are irrelevant.  This viewpoint may reflect a bias of my
background, but I suspect I am not alone in this view.
This is another factor in favor of making the default
behavior be to NOT preserve whitespace.  However, I am
certainly open to other viewpoints.
