Larry,

Try the following trick with your Web browser:

<b>this is packed</b>
<b>this
is formatted</b>
<b>this    is    excessive</b>

See what happens? They all end up the same. HTML does not preserve
whitespaces by definition expect for the PRE element. By definition (and
I recommend you pay close attention to the specs), whitespaces are not
used for formatting in HTML documents, except for the PRE element.

You pretty much have the same ratio in XML documents:

<book>
  <author>John   lots-of-spaces Doe</author>
     <title>  Whatever
     </title>
  </author>
</book>

Can you spot which whitespaces are redundant?

The problems you are seeing with editors mutilating HTML documents has
to do with improper structure, not whitespace handling. You can try
running their output through Tidy to see how messy it was to begin with.
