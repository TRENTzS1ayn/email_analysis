Why? What purpose does this formatting serve in 90% of the cases? (Keep
in mind that white space handling is a default behavior, it can be
turned off; e.g. XSL requires to turn it off)

If you want to print out a formatted, easy to read, nested with line
wrapping, image of the DOM structure (which I guess you do), you can use
OpenXML to do that. But does it make sense to store all that excessive
spaces in memory and have the application try to avoid them as it
processes the document, just to implement this feature?

It is very clear that the input document might include redundant spaces
just for the sake of formatting the document. It is very clear that the
output document should include them for the sake of readability. It is
very clear that the document tree does not need them for any use, and
that the application should not be expected to go around them. So the
whole issue is how to define a clear path between source to DOM back to
source, that will allow us to do all that.
