I think that if there are errors in your HTML you should clean them up
before trying to manipulate them with the DOM.  Most pages that will be
relying on using dom will probably be new, or will be older pages that
will be re-produced, or fixed to ensure compatibility. HTML mistakes can
be fixed there.

This fix would be bad as it separates the percieved structure from the
"physical" strucutre of the HTML file.  This would add extra elements into
the strucutre and would cause strange workarounds.  Better to know that
your HTML is broke so you can fix it, rather than having to place all
kinds of workarounds in your scripting because this particular page "acts
all wierd".

I'd be in favor of number 1.  Or maybe even return an error status to the
UA.
