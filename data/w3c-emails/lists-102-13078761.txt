I think Larry makes a good case for the value of
whitespace preservation in some applications.  

Perhaps the key question
is how many people will be writing applications such
as XML editors that should retain whitespace formatting,
versus how many people will be writing other applications
that simply need to consume XML, and don't care much
about the whitespace formatting the input had.

My personal guess is that there will be a lot more people 
writing XML applications that consume XML and do not care 
much about the whitespace formatting than there will
be people writing XML editor-like things.  But I don't
have any data backing up this guess.  Anybody
got any data quantifying the expected uses?
