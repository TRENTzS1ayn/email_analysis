No, for the DOM, that is *not* the key question.  Of
course there are more consuming (browser) applications
than producing (editor) applications--that is practically
tautological but irrelevant.

The DOM has already decided that editor applications are
key reference applications.  The DOM must allow editors
to support XML.  Spaces in XML are data and cannot be tossed.
