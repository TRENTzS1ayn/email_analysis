"Spaces in XML are data and cannot be tossed."

Which is practically the view of the RFC. But we all know that some
spaces are not data, and that the DOM does not preserve txtual format.
According to the DOM, the following two can be returned as the same tree
content:

  <img    src = "http://www.test.com"
          alt = "Nothing else to say" />

and

  <img alt="Nothing else to say" src="http://www.test.com"/>

Notice how the formatting information is lost, even the order of
attributes is not the same. If your editor is trusting the DOM to
deliver a visual presentation of the source document, you better
re-think it.
