One of the difficulties of reading the DOM spec comes from the fact that
the term "attribute" is used for two different things. There are the IDL
attributes you can find on interfaces and the XML/HTML element
attributes. We wish we could avoid this confusing situation but we
couldn't. We didn't define any of these, we simply had to live with both
of them...

This refers to an IDL attribute that gives direct access to the
DocumentType that is related to the Document.

This is correct. A DocumentType is child of a Document.

It must be a child and be accessible through the doctype IDL attribute.
