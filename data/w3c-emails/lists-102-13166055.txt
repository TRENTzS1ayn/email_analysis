I still think your use of the word "format" to refer to the source 
document is confusing--even to yourself.  Because it's making you 
think that those spaces, in some sense, "don't count" because they
are "only there for formatting" and "formatting" isn't really part of
the document content.

You're wrong about that.  The input is the input, spaces in data content
of a document have nothing to do with "formatting," and those spaces are 
really there.

The solution is to use some kind of "filter" in the DOM to ask for the
next element node if that's what you want.  Just pretending the spaces
aren't there--even if that made sense--wouldn't solve your problem given
that things like comments and PIs could also be "in the way" between the
elements you wish to see (to say nothing of the mess you'd have if some
of your <book>...</book> elements really got there by being the replacement
text of some entities).
