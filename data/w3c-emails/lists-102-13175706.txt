Here's a simple test that I use to decide if something is "format" or
"meaningful" to a DOM application.

Exhibit A, XML document

  <book-list>
    <book>Moby Dick</book>
    <book>Bible</book>
  </book-list>

Exhibit B, DOM generation

  bookList = doc.createElement( "book-list" );
  book = doc.createElement( "book" );
  title = doc.createTextNode( "Moby Dick" );
  book.appendChild( title );
  bookList.appendChild( book );
  book = doc.createElement( "book" );
  title = doc.createTextNode( "Bible" );
  book.appendChild( title );
  bookList.appendChild( book );

Now, if Exhibit A and Exhibit B produce the exact same DOM document tree
than they are equivalent. Anything that is excessive in the document
tree is, for the purpose of the application, redundant. There is no
reason on why Exhibit A should produce a DOM structure that is different
than Exhibit B.

As for your solution, I don't see the DOM being changed that easily to
get around the problem, nor do I see developers rushing to learn the new
workarounds. But that's just personal opinion.
