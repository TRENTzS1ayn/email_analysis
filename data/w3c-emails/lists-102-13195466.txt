Fine, I guess, but then it's not a conforming XML parser (neither
validating nor well-formed).

I sure don't claim to know what market forces will behoove what behavior,
but XML parsers must pass on all whitespace.  Anyone adding a switch to
provide non-compliant behavior will have to make it clear that their
parser, when operating in this mode, is not an XML parser.

A public standard way to request non-compliant behavior from your
XML parser?  I can't help but think it's odd to try to develop an 
IETF "standard" to contradict a W3C "standard."
