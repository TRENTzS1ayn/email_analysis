In the DOM level 1 specification, the HTMLFormElement interface has a "name" attribute, even though FORM elements don't have a "name" attribute in the HTML 4.0 specification.  Now, I'm certainly glad that HTMLFormElement has a "name" attribute, since major browsers have supported a "name" attribute for FORM for several years now and the "name" attribute is widely used in JavaScript scripting.  But as the DOM is supposed to be more or less a reflection of the HTML 4.0 specification, it would certainly be nice if you explicitly noted in the DOM specification that the "name" attribute is actually not part of the HTML 4.0 specification.

Thanks -
