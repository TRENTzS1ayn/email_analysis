This is NOT a problem: do NOT attemp to cope with broken HTML at all.

The behavior of broken HTML objects should be undefined. If browser
manufacturers are smart, they will flag broken HTML as errors, allowing
developers to catch problems during testing rather than masking them.

For getting real work done, DOM Level 2 is one of the most useful concepts
since the web itself. I would be very disappointed to see it mucked up by
attempting to cater to idiots. Or, for that matter, by catering to vendors,
and level 1 smacks strongly of that: "Uh... we can't do that." "That's ok,
we'll call it Level 1 and you can still say you're compliant."

Some of us remember the original ANSI C and POSIX committees....
