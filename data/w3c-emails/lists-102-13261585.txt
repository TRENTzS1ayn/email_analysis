Your current specification

    http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-DOM-Level-1/level-one-core.html

states that removeNamedItem returns null if "no node with such a name
exists" and also raises NOT_FOUND_ERR "if there is no node named name in
the map." These statements appear to contradict each other. Can you
clarify this?

Many thanks,
