The DOM level 1 specification contains a HTMLTextAreaElement interface representing a TEXTAREA element in HTML.  HTMLTextAreaElement has a "value" attribute of type DOMString; according to the specification, this attribute represents "the current textual content of the multi-line text field".  So, if the text field has several lines, what character or characters are used to separate the lines in the "value" attribute?  A \n?  A \r\n?  Either?  The specification should be more clear on this point.
