That might be so for DOM implementations embedded in UAs
(tho' I'm not even sure about that), but what about
server side uses of the DOM where the structure model is
built using the creation APIs,

  public void foo(HTMLDocument doc)
  {
    // assume doc is newly created.

    NodeList bodyList = doc.getElementsByTagName("BODY");
    NodeList frameSetList = doc.getElementsByTagName("FRAMESET");

    if(bodyList.getLength() == 0 && frameSetList.getLength() == 0)
      doc.setBody(doc.createElement("BODY"));                       // 1
    else if(frameSetList.getLength() == 1)
      frameSetList.item(0).appendChild(doc.createElement("FRAME")); // 2
    else if(bodyList.getLength() == 1)
      bodyList.item(0).appendChild(doc.createElement("P"));         // 3
  }

As far as I can see from the REC, any of the following might
legitimately be true,

* (1) might never be executed, because a call on
  HTMLDocument.getElementsByTagName() might trigger auto
  insertion of HTML and BODY elements into an otherwise
  empty document.

* (2) might never be executed, for the same reason.

* (3) might never be executed, because an implementation
  might _not_ auto insert of HTML and BODY elements on a
  call to HTMLDocument.getElementsByTagName().

And I there a quite a few other possibilities too.

Maybe these are slightly perverse examples, but I does
look as tho' the spec needs a little tightening up here.

Cheers,


Miles
