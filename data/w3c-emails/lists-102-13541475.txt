ID attributes also need to be examined.  What happens when I clone a set of
nodes having unique IDs?  Are the IDs cloned as well? Under the current
definition, I would presume so.

What happens when I copy those cloned nodes with their duplicate IDs to
another section of the document?

Even more complicated is nodes with IDREF attributes, when the value of an
IDREF points to a node that is also being cloned.
