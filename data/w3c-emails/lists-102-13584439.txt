I agree in this particular (ie., DTD) case, but not as a
general rule.

Interfaces constrain implementations ... a given interface
might make an implementation with properties X, Y, Z
impossible. This has come up wrt the DOM: the way the 
NodeList interface was specified makes it very difficult to
put together an implementation with acceptable performance
characteristics.

Designing interfaces is something that has to be done with
a view to possible implementations ... it's an iterative
process, not a top down one.

Cheers,


Miles
