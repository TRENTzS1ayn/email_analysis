We developed a C binding using the Java bindings as a guide. The first
argument is always the object (which is a vtable like self descriptive
object), and overloaded method names were extended to include type in the
name:

   value = PDOMgetValue(textObject);

   PDOMsetValue(textObject, "new value");

   etc...

It would seem a C++ binding based on the Java bindings as starting place would
be straight forward.
