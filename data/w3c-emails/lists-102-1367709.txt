Coping with broken HTML greatly increases the complexity 
of any HTML-related development project. It helps prevent 
small companies from competing with the big guys and
ensures that simple shareware and one-off utilities will not be 
generally useful. Strictly enforcing the model will save 
countless hours of programming in the future, and make 
the tools market more competitive.
