Not necessarily - you may also get back just the Core Element of
type "P", unless you specifically 
a) find out whether the implementation supports the HTML DOM
(hasFeature), and
b) depending on the language, you may need to cast to HTMLElement or
HTMLParagraphElement.

This is so that implementations can manipulate documents that use
the HTML tag set without having to implement the HTML DOM - the
script writer misses out on the convenience functions, but does have
the Core functionality.
