     I have a bit difficulty to trace down places that the exception:
     "NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR" should be raised. From the document, the 
     doctype attribute of the interface Document does not allow 
     modification because Level 1 DOM does not support editing document 
     type. I also found a couple of similar mentioning in other sections of 
     the DOM document. Are these the only places that the exception should 
     be raised when being modified.
     
     Thanks
