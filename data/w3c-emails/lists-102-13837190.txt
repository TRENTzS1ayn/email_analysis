As has been noted before, DOM itself does not support such a method.

It being a useful thing to be able to do, however, several versions
of DOM support extensions which enable this.  In particular if you
use Sun's package, the "com.sun.xml.XmlDocument.changeNodeOwner()"
method lets you do that.  Of course, this won't work if you're trying
to mix DOM nodes from multiple implementations.
