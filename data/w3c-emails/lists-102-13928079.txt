     Hi, Any suggestion on the clone operation of documenttype node? This 
     operation perhaps happens only when cloning a document node. If the 
     clone operation of the documenttype node is not deep the consequence 
     seems unpredictable. The resulting document may not be well-formed at 
     all, do not mention the validity. 
     
     BTW, can a node from cloned document be detached from that cloned 
     document and inserted into the original document? In other words, is a 
     cloned document considered the same as the original one?
     
     I am writing a C++ version of DOM and need the answers to these 
     questions badly. Any suggestion is greatly appreciated.
