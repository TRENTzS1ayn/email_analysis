Hi,


It seems (reading CSS2, 2.2) that the 'target' property of the event
object is defined as the top most element that has received the
event. For example:



  <TABLE border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0
         onmousedown=doSomething() onmouseup=unDoSomething()>
    <TR>
  <TD> content </TD>
     </TR>
</TABLE>


In this case, by default TABLE, TR and TD have the same size, and TD
would always be the target, and I don't see how to know that the event
handler was triggered on TABLE (i.e. that TABLE is the source that
triggered the event).



Did I miss something ?



jm.
