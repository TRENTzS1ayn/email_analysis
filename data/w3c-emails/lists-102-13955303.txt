     You need to look at the entities and notations attributes of the 
     doctype attribute of a document node. entities attribute gives you a 
     collection (NamedNodeMap type) of entities, same does the notations 
     attribute.

     P.S.
     
     For the following XML
     
     <? xml version="1.0" standalone="yes" ?>
     <Hello>
     </Hello>
     
     Does any one know which part of a DOM structure holds the the section 
     'standalone="yes"' It obviously cannot be an attribute science 
     Document node does not allow attribute.
     
     Thanks
