Those that come quickly to mind include Netscape "Gecko", IBM's alphaworks XML parser, Sun's "Project X", the docuverse.com DOM SDK, Object Design's Excelon beta, the Oracle 8i XML parser ...  Most of these are pre-release things that require registration as a beta tester or whatever.  If you can't find them by the usual means, I'm sure I can dig up the URLs.

    Subject: DOM platforms
    
    
    I'm working on developing some tests for the DOM Level 1 API, and
    am interested in finding support for it.  I've already been playing with
    Internet Explorer Beta 5  -- are there other platforms that might be
    useful as well?
