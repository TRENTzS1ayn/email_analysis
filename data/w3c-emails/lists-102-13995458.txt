Mozilla.org has implemented the following DOM levels: level 1 core
(interface), level 1 HTML and level 0.  (per Vidur's status on 1/29)
DOM implementation is a part of NGLayout--the Next Generation Layout
engine.

For writing test cases, you can download the latest (and greatest,
not-crashing-on-start-up) builds at: (XP, not just windows)
ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla/nightly/
*Run apprunner, as it is the newly built app through which these test
cases are to be run.  (previously, viewer and appviewer were used,
now--no longer)

Vidur Apparao is maintaining the DOM implementation effort for mozilla.
Vidur's out-dated-but-that-means-the-items-on-here-should-work list at:
http://www.mozilla.org/newlayout/doc/domhelp.html

Current test cases--however, this page probably needs updating:
http://www.mozilla.org/newlayout/testcases/

Hope this helps.
