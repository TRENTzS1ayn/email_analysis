Hi,

I searched the archives for answers to these questions, but I was unable to
find any:

I would like to be able to control the DOM of a browser's current HTML page
from an embedded Java applet.  Can this be done?  How is this done?

Some information I have come across seems to imply that this is
implementation dependent.  If this is true, does anyone have pointers on how
to do this in Microsoft's and Netscape's browsers?  If these implementations
are different, which one is leaning toward being the standard (if any)?

If Java cannot access the DOM of the browser's current page, can JavaScript
be made to talk with an applet (so that the JavaScript can then manipulate
the DOM for the applet)?  Can an applet send events back to JavaScript?  If
this is implementation dependent, does anyone have pointers to how to do
this in Microsoft's and Netscape's browsers?  If this is currently
proprietary, is there any move toward a standard on this front?

I apologies if this is a FAQ and I just missed it in the archives somehow.
I would think this would be something people would often want to do.  I was
surprised that I couldn't find anything on it.
