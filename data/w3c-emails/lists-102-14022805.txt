We've created an XML and SGML browser based on the Mozilla source and
have a demo package which has several nice examples of DOM functionality
accessed through JavaScript.  You just download the browser package,
install it, and start the program - the start-up page has links to all
the demos.  I think it is the easiest way to see XML and XML DOM
demos in a browser today.

This "Preview" version of our browser was actually created in December
when Mozilla's DOM implementation was not yet complete (and much of
the other code was still pretty shaky).  It is relatively stable
though and more stable than what you can download today from mozilla.org.
We are working ourselves feverishly on the next update which will have
the latest code and 100% DOM Level 1.

Our browser, DocZilla, can be gotten at http://www.doczilla.com.
The current version is targeted only for NT.  It works under '95
but we do not encourage its use due to performance-related bugs.
UNIX versions are planned as well.
