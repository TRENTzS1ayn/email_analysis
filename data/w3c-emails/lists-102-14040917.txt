I have written a Java application which uses the network classes to 
read in a user chosen  HTML document from the web into a String.  I 
currently use alot of String manipulation methods to pull out data.  

What I would like to do is use the XML DOM classes to do this more 
easily - for instance, get the value of the <title> tag.  Presumably 
this is what methods like getElementsByTagname do?  However, I 
cannot work out from the XML documentation how to get to the point 
where I can use this method - could anyone point me in the direction 
of some help?

TIA

Fiona
