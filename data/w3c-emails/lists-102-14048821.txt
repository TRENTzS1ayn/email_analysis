getElementsByTagName could give you a collection of all "title" elements;
the value of any one of the title elements is formed by the set of child
nodes of that element.  In the simplest case, there is only a TextNode whose
value is the string you want, but if the title itself contains markup (such
as emphasis or entity references), you'll have to do some work to extract
the title as a simple string.

I hope this helps,
