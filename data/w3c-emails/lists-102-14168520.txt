The "create a structure model from this XML" step is out of
scope of DOM, so I'd say the spec doesn't address this.  Just
like it can't address whether various artifacts of that process
must show up (like ignorable whitespace, CDATA boundaries,
EntityReference nodes, comments, and so forth).

The XML spec requires "ignorable" whitespace to be reported as
such by "validating XML Processors" in certain circumstances,
but they don't apply in that particular example (no DTD!) ... so
it's not possible to get rid of them.
