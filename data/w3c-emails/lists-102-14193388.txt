Hi Arkin,

Ok, I have some remarks
(even if they are not DOM specific ...)

Strictly spoken is a HTML processor at present a specific SGML processor.
That means e.g. (according to the HTML DTD) some start or end tags of
elements may be omitted.

Well, your example is incorrect HTML. The start tag <TR> must appear.
But - what should a browser do while reading such code? Printing an
error message like a compiler seems not to be very reasonable. So it
tries to do its best ...

If we have a HTML DTD in XML then all tags must appear. Omitting tags
is not allowed any longer. For browsers this is again a theoretical
demand: what to do if an author doesn't play the game by the rules?

Sorry, that's not correct. E.g. PRE may contain special elements like A
or IMG, phrase elements like EM and STRONG, and even form control elements.

I agree.
But as I see from other postings the opinions, if whitespaces should be
reported or not, are quite different.

I should think about it a little while ...

Cheers,
Oliver
