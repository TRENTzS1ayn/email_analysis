One clarification, which we may or may not state in the spec but we
definitely discussed -- a validating parser and a non-validating parser may
produce two different structure models from the same document, for the
reasons noted in the original posting.  This is more properly in the realm
of XML than the DOM -- the DOM just reflects the output of the XML
processor, which can differ depending on whether it is validating or not.
