How long is your NodeList?
Um, a couple of feet?
20 bytes?
Oh, never mind.

It seems to me that lists don't have "lengths", they have some number of
elements. Back in the old days of computing programmers used things that
we used to call "Arrays" which had lengths, but modern lists definately
have counts, not lengths.

How about:

NodeList.getCount()
