The _only_ way the DOM specification defines for "creating" a structure
model is to take a Document (org.w3c.dom.Document) instance and populate
it manually.  Not that it says how to get an instance of a Document!  
Since it's an Interface, and not an instantiable class, even that first
step is out of scope of DOM Level 1.

So that text is fully compatible with what I said, and vice versa.
