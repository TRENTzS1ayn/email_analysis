The only mechanism for event handler registration that we're specifying
in the spec is the programmatic model.  We also are tasked with ensuring
the new model will coexist with the existing HTML 4.0 model. If other
methods of specifying event handlers exist they can certainly be made to
work with the DOM event model but we don't explicitly support them.

This is really more a change to HTML than it is to the DOM.  As such,
its kind of outside of our scope.  I too would like to see a better
mechanism for event handler registration inside of the HTML tag syntax. 
I have seen proposals similar to the one you suggest and I think that's
probably the right direction.  However, the HTML working group is the
one which much accept the proposal.
