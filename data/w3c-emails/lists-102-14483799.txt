Err ... then 'don't do that' (TM).

Seriously tho', that sort of issue should be
resolved by defining the semantics of the
DOM under mutations from arbitrary threads.

For my money those semantics should be
defined as 'undefined', and synchronization
should be achieved via the use of synchronized
wrappers (as seen in the Java2 collections
API).

Cheers,


Miles
