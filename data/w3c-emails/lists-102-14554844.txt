Thanks for clarifying this out.

Now I know which spec covers what and the confusion amounts: According
to the XML spec "A validating XML processor must also inform the
application which of these characters constitute white space appearing
in element content." That application would be the DOM implementation.

How would the XML processor tell that to the DOM, what will the DOM do
with this information (should it wait for normalize() to be called? by
whom?) and should the DOM implementation pass that knowledge further on
or keep it to itself (as it does with the xml:space attribute).
