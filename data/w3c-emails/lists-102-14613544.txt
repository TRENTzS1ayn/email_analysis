In the definition of the add method of HTMLSelectElement [1], the before
parameter is defined as

  The element to insert before, or NULL for the head of the list.

Should this instead read ("head" changed to "end"):

  The element to insert before, or NULL for the end of the list.

(To me, head means beginning, although it's not perfectly clear.)

The method seems analogous to the insertBefore method [2], which defines
NULL as meaning the end of the list.
