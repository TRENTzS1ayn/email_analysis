TclDOM version 1.6 - DOM for Tcl - is now available.

TclDOM is a language binding for the DOM to the Tcl scripting language.
It allows script writers to build documents using DOM constructs,
and be able to serialize documents into XML.

Document parsing is also supported, using either TclXML, a Tcl XML
parser, 
or TclExpat, a Tcl interface to James Clark's expat XML parser.

This package works with Tcl 8.0 or later, and is best used with 
Tcl 8.1 (which supports Unicode).

Version 1.6 includes Document Type Declaration and XML Text Declaration support,
support for empty elements, and many bug fixes. See the changes file for details.
