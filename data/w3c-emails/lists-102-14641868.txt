Why not just have it take a string value, the same way the STYLE attribute
does?

Yup.

What we're really missing here is a binding between a scripting language and
the style sheet. The DOM, as it stands, provides dynamic documents. Is there
a demand for dynamic style sheets? Is there a place for

    @script(stylemebaby.js);

in the new world order?

I'm not claiming the answer's "yes", but given browser developers'
initiative in shoehorning a CSS-esque syntax into their DOM implementations
(where I think it *really* doesn't belong), I think the question bears
asking.
