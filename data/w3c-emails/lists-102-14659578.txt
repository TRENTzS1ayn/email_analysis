When you've fetched a Node out of a NodeList, it doesn't know it
was *in* a NodeList, so nextSibling is the Node on its right
in the tree, not its successor in the list.

Use the index method, being careful to note what you are doing
(i.e. if you are removing each node as you find it, always ask
for index(0) each time).
