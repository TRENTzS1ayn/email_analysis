I have just set up a mailing list for XQL (XML Query Language). This list
is intended to answer questions about the definition of the language, how
to implement it, who has implemented it in what products, and whatever else
seems to be of interest.

I will also use this list to try to reach consensus in the XQL community if
decisions need to be made, eg to add new extensions.

The XQL FAQ may be found here:

  http://metalab.unc.edu/xql/

It contains a link to the mailing list, but you can also access the mailing
list directly here:

  http://franklin.oit.unc.edu/cgi-bin/lyris.pl?enter=xql

Hope this is helpful!
