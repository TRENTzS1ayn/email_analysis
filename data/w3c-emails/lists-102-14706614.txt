Announcing Zveno Swish XML Editor Version 1.0 beta 1

Zveno has now released its first beta version of the Swish XML Editor.

Swish is a non-validating XML editor.  It features both a tree-view and a
document-view of the XML document being edited, with both views being
completely integrated.

Major new features for this release are availability on the Macintosh and
a plugin facility which allows extension and customisability by third-parties.

Swish uses Tcl/Tk, an easy-to-use scripting language which users or
third-parties 
can use to add specific features to Swish.  As part of our Open Source effort,
Zveno also makes available components of Swish for free, TclXML and TclDOM.

All beta releases of Swish are being made available for evaluation
purposes free of charge for a period of thirty days.

To download Swish for Linux, Windows 95/98/NT and Macintosh PPC, see the 
Swish Web page at:
