You might want to set/get individual properties.

But actually, the STYLE attribute part is already taken care of (in
section 4.4.2 of the 1999-03-04 draft), by the style attribute of
HTMLElement2 [1].

So I guess what I really meant to ask about was whether there would be
some way te get (but there would be no need to set) the current
cascaded style on any element.  One could do the setting through the
style attribute [2], but might want to see the current cascaded value
through something like currentStyle (as I believe MSIE implements).  If
it would be too difficult to make the values within currentStyle
readonly, then setting currentStyle could be made equivalent to setting
style.

I worry that saying style is of type CSSStyleDeclaration is too
CSS-specific.  But I don't know how else to provide the same features.

One final note:  the parentRule attribute of CSSStyleDeclaration should
probably be defined as being null if the parent is not a CSSRule.

of 1000.  See the references and comments of my previous post:
