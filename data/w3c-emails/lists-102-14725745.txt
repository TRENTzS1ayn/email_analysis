Good point. It does seem like too much to ask to expect script authors to
parse a string for this information.

Yes, I found that after making my previous posting.

Me too.

I remain of the opinion that a better model would forego this direct
manipulation of styles on elements altogether, in favor of an exclusive
binding of the scripting language to the style sheet. Thus script has the
ability to modify only the stylesheet itself at runtime. The style rules
applied to an element can be modified in the document by changing the
element's class or id at runtime.

These techniques could be consolidated in a behaviors syntax similar
philosophically (but different syntactically) to Netscape's CAS. It is
unfortunate that the current description of CAS is tied to the CSS style
mechanism.
