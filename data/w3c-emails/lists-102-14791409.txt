Any particular langauge? We have 4DOM written in python that will do
both XML -> DOM -> XML and HTML -> DOM -> HTML.

The latest version can be downloaded at

http://www.fourthought.com/opentech/projects/4DOM/

check out the docs to see the interface for loading and printing XML and
HTML documents.
