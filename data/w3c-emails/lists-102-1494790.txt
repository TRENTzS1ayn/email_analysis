This is not exactly DOM business, but I assume many readers of this list
will be generally interested in Dynamic HTML.

I'm sure we all recognized that the famous, and very stylish, "Stella
Chelsea" demo of Canvas Mode [1] was an impostor, in that it was not in
true canvas mode (still had the title bar and minimize/kill buttons).
I've just completed a study of Canvas Mode for our latest book [2] and
now have two complete online demos to offer [3] [4].

Figuring this out required, I may say, heroic efforts because much of
the process of getting a security certificate and signing the JavaScript
is undocumented or very poorly documented, and the certification
authority Verisign has a somewhat primitive concept of tech support.

The process is too lengthy to describe here but I might answer specific
questions. And if there are any magazine editors on list, there's a fine
article to be done.

It almost goes without saying that Netscape Communicator 4.x is
obligatory for viewing any of the online demos.
