Hello,

I've seen that this question has been asked a few months ago by Dan, but I
couldn't find a solution.

I'm using the XML4J DOMParser to parse an xml file.
Then, I modify the DOM tree (with methods such as insertBefore, removeChild,
etc), and I would like the initial xml file to relect those changes.

Do you know how I can do that ?

I've read that this should be possible with the DOM level 2 specification,
but is there a "temporary" solution ?

Thanks a lot for your help,

Regards,

Benedicte
