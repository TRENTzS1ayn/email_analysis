Suggest to change to COBRA 2.1 since it have better International
support.

2. Some interface refer to String and some refer to string. I suggest we
clean up this.

3. Document class: Should the NodeList epilog move to XMLDocument if
epilog is not exist in HTML ?

4. HTMLDocument: should we add method to get NodeEnumerator of  FRAME ,
StyleSheet, (Layer) ?

5. Node: getLeftSibling() and getRightSibling().... These two names are
very Western (left to right) centric- Could we change to a  bettern name
which do not imply left come before right ? Should it be
getPreviousSibling() and getNextSilbing() ?

6. NodeList: Node getNth(in unsigned long index): Should we clearly
state it is 0 base index or 1 base index.

7. PI: This class name is a little bit strang. All the rest of the class
are not abbreviate, only this class are abbreviate as PI. Should it be
ProcessingInstruction to make the class naming convenition more
consistence ?

8. UcChar, UcString: Do we still need those classes ? (I assume all
String should be UcString already ... Maybe I am wrong). If we use Cobra
2.1, we may use wstring....

9. Character: As someone answer me eariler, this classes will be deleted
, right ?
