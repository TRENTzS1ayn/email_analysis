The definition of the UIEvent interface [1] defines a button attribute
to show which button changed for the event.  What are the possible
values of this attribute?  That is, does 0=left, 1=middle, 2=right,
3=multiple, or what?

Also, while I'm asking, should the units for {client,screen}{X,Y} be
given in the spec, or not?  (I would think it would be pixels when
relevant, or characters for tty media types.)  Is the upper left 0,0?
