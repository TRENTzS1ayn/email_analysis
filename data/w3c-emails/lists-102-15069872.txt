Hello all,
 
I was expecting that the Level 2 spec would address saving a DOM out to
disk, and reading it in for that matter, but it doesn't.  Will this be left
as an "implementation dependent" issue, or will it be specified at some
point?
 
Short of being specified, when "roundtripping" a DOM, is the conventional
wisdom on escaping special characters ("<", "&", ...) that it should be the
responsibility of the DOM implementation, or the client application?
