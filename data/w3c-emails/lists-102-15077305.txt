In section 5.5.3. "HTML event types", it says:

load 
             The load event occurs when the DOM implementation
             finishes loading all content within a document, all
             frames within a FRAMESET, or an image.

Is there any reason to restrict this just to images? Couldn't I attach 
it to an <object>, whatever sort of thing it is?
