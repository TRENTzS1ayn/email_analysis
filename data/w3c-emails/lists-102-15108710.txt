Hello W3,

I have been using the DOM for some time in an application I'm writing
and I've noticed something
that may be of issue:

When copying (and now, importing) nodes which have "id" nodes or "idref"
type nodes,  the copy is immediately invalid because the id nodes are
now not unique.   Of course, without a DTD or schema to check against,
the method won't know the difference, but, at the very least it would be
nice to have some mechanism which allow id's to be-issued and give the
option for idref copies to relative (refer to nodes in the copied
branch) or absolute (continue to refer to the original id) where
relevant.
I realize the is a complicated issue, because I've had to deal with it
with my software.
Without going to the extra effort to validate a document or fragment, it
would be nice to have a provision to allow the DOM to maintain a valid
document by allowing the user to give hints to the copy and possible i
mport functions.

Respectfullly,
Jim
