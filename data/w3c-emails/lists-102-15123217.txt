Exactly. This what the errata says. See

This stands for readonly nodes, such as entityref's children. I don't
think it's meant to cover the setting of nodeValue when this doesn't
make sense. So I guess you found a hole in the spec. I'll add it to the
issues list so that it is addressed by the DOM Working Group.

Thanks for your feedback.
