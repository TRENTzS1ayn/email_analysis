It is not a part of the specification, but most DOM implementations handle
it in some way.  If not, the basic idea would be to walk the tree,
extracting the relevant bits of information from each node based on its node
type, format them into well-formed XML and stream it to disk.  You also need
to escape any special characters that may appear in the various content
bits.
