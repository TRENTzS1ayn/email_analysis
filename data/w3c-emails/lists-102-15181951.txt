I hope there is someone out there who can help me.  I am trying to read
in a file called hamlet.xml using the Sun Parser.  The following code is
always throwing errors.

Can anyone tell me how to use the dom to read in files?

InputSourceinput;
XmlDocumentdoc;

input = Resolver.createInputSource (hamlet.xml);

 doc = XmlDocument.createXmlDocument (input, true);

Chris
