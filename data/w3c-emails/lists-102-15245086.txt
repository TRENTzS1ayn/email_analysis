XML DOM structure:

when i tried to pass a node as a text node to get the text content of an element, the runtime error says that there is a ClassCastException. this does not happen when i pass it to an Element node type, but the getNodeValue() for the Element node type is always null. what other ways can i use to get the text content out from the DOM structure?

TIA,
James
