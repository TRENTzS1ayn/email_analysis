Hello!  My name is Scott Means, and I'm working on an XML book for
O'Reilly.  As a result, I've been going over the spec at a pretty minute
level, and I have a question.  In the CharacterData interface, several
methods accept an offset into the data attribute, and the documentation
indicates:

INDEX_SIZE_ERR: Raised if the specified offset is negative or
greater than the number of characters in <code>data</code>.

Since all offsets in the CharacterData interface are intended to be zero
based, shouldn't this read "Raised if the specified offset is negative, or
greater than or equal to the number of characters in <code>data</code>." 
In zero-based operations, the valid range is 0 <= index < length, right?

Just checking.
