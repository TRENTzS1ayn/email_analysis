After some investigation/experimentation with Java-based DOM parsers
(openxml, ibm4jxml), I have questions about using DOM with ArborText
Adept
Publisher documents.

I have experimented with different Java-based DOM parsers, and all of
them with
apparent problems dealing with the DOCTYPE declaration as specified in
the document we are attempting to parse (the instance is
created using the "SAVE AS XML" File menu selection in adept publisher,
using
a variant of the DOCBOOK DTD).

The prolog of the instance is (more or less):

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE book PUBLIC "-//sample//DTD (Based on DocBook DTD V3.0)//EN"
  "file://C:/dausr/sample.ptd" [
<!--ArborText, Inc., 1988-1999, v.4002-->
<!ENTITY sample TIF SYSTEM "c:\sample.eps" NDATA eps>
...
]>
<?Pub UDT _bookmark _target?>
<?Pub Inc?>
<book id="bk980001">

When the first DOCTYPE declaration line is parsed, things generally fall

apart. Sometimes cryptic error messages are reported, such as: "MISSING
'
or ",  " or "whitespace expected";  or sometimes trapped messages are
reported, such as: "Invalid XML document could not get root".

Does anyone know of a resolution to this issue? Has anyone ever used any

Java-based DOM parsers successfully with XML documents created with
ArborText Adept Publisher using the DOCBOOK DTD? If so, how did YOU
resolve this issue? If not, any suggestions?
