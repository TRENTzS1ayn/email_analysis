The word "operation" is a language independent keyword in IDL.  The word
"method" is a word that is used in some language (e.g. Java) that from an
IDL perspective is a language specific implementation of an operation.  As
such the DOM1 spec usage of the word "operation" is correct and should not
be changed.

You are referring to the object reference that is returned from the
operation firstChild.  It is correct to say that the reference returned from
this operation is null, because languages enable the tests to determine if
the value return is a null value.  As such the existing wording seems
correct to me.

Please see prior comment.
