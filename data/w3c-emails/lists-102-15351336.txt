Even though this may (or may not) be DOM Level 1 compliant, it will get you
nowhere with Netscape 4.x. This browser simply doesn't support anything
close to DOM Level 1, instead having its own proprietary DOM. Wait for Gecko
(Netscape 5's new rendering engine by Mozilla)!

We are using a JavaScript function to resize a frame in real time. This
works well in IE4.x but not in Netscape 4.x. We want to be sure this type of
method for modifying attributes is DOM Level 1 Compliant (my client needs
this guarantee).
 
Anybody can help?
 
The function is:
 
function resize() {
 
 if (high==100) high =300
 else high=100
 parent.innerFr.rows = high +",*";
}
