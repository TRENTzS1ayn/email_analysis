I suspect the original poster wanted something that works in 
Netscape 4.X.  For those that just want to test the JavaScript
DOM interface in mozilla now you may obtain a build of
Mozilla from mozilla.org (www.mozilla.org) or the DocZilla alpha
(www.doczilla.com).  The DocZilla alpha is time-bombed to expire at
the end of this month but there will be a fresh version put in place
sometime in the very near future.  The DocZilla alpha contains demos
showing the use of the DOM through JavaScript.

The DOM, in my experience, has reached a very high level of completion and
reliability in either recent mozilla builds or DocZilla.
