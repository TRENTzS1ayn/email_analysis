This isn't a DOM question.  You have a DOM document in one frame.
You have a DOM document in the other.  How you communicate some
information from the one to the other is an environment issue, in
this case, the environment of a browser supporting the concept
of frames.

You need to study up on the frames array (frames[].document).
Check any JavaScript book.

Good luck,
