In the latest working draft for DOM level 2, there are
two options for namespace support--one that provides
new interfaces (that way a NodeImpl class could
implement both Node and NodeNS interfaces, remaining
backward compatible with Level 1).  The other option
involves changing the existing interfaces.  I think
the first option is the better choice.

DOM level 2 also includes a Document2 interface that
specifies an importNode method: 

  "importNode...Imports a node from another document
to this document. The returned node has no parent
(parentNode is null.)."
