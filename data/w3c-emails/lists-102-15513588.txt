[This is my first posting to this list -- indeed to any of the w3c 
discussion lists, and I have been unable to check the archives, so 
please pardon comments about things already discussed earlier ..jb]

I, too, had been planning to use the DOM as the basis for software 
development that was based on XML, but not in a browser-context.  I 
have also been disappointed to see that a number of XML "things", 
including (of interest to my application) efficient linking between 
elements connected by means of IDs and IDref attributes, do not seem 
to be anywhere under discussion.  I can, of course, extend the 
definition myself to meet my needs, but this seems such a pity, for 
the reason Stephen Savitzky notes above.

I confess that I know nothing about "how things are done here" (!).  
Nonetheless, I'd be interested in knowing where, and how, decisions 
are made about what specific parts of the XML spec are recognized in 
the DOM.
