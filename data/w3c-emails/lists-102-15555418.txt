FourThought LLC (http://FourThought.com) announces the release of

                             4DOM 0.8.0
                      -----------------------
                  An implementation of the W3C's
                  Document Object Model in Python

4DOM is a close implementation of the DOM recommendation, including
DOM Core level 1, DOM HTML level 1, Node Iterator and Node Filter from
DOM Level 2, and a few utility and helper components.  4DOM can work
in a CORBA* enviroment, or in a purely local set-up.

4DOM is designed to allow developers rapidly design applications
that read, write or manipulate HTML and XML.

News
----

There have been many changes to 4DOM since the last major release, 0.7.0.
There were two more releases, which were only bundled with 4XSL.  For a
complete listing, please see


ftp://FourThought.com/pub/4Suite/4DOM/ChangeLog

But some highlights:

* Support for non-CORBA usage
* Improved performance
* DOM Level 2 NodeFilters and NodeIterators
* Pythonic interface for NodeLists and NamedNodeMaps
* XML Namespace support (proprietary until W3C decides chooses between
  the proposed Level 2 interfaces)
* Several interface changes in Ext
* Re-organized module structure
* Explicit garbage-collection method
* Better-tested Fnorb and Ilu support
* Many bug-fixes

*For CORBA users, 4DOM directly supports ILU and Fnorb.
