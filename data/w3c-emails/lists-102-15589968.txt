Raph,
I understand your irritation and will make sure that your comments get
reviewed.
This said, simply stating that the current draft is broken isn't quite
appropriate. As a matter of fact, the current draft (well, the latest
internal draft at least) does fulfill the requirements we've been
working with. Your problem is simply that they do not cover your
requirements. Now, again, I will see if there is anything we can do
about that.
Thanks for your feedback.
