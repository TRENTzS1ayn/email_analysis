I see; one have to be pretty clear in what one writes. I did not, of course,
mean that any interface was *changed* in DOM2.

I meant that the "thing" was changed and the change was that some new
interfaces was introduced, that would solve problems found in DOM1

I don't recall seeing anything in DOM level 2 (not DOM 2.0) that changes
_anything_ in level 1.  It's all a bunch of additional interfaces that (in
my opinion) still aren't particularly useful outside the scripting
environment that the DOM is intended for.

The DOM is most emphatically NOT a general-purpose, easily-implemented,
least-common-denominator interface for SGML.  It was never intended to be
and, as far as I can tell, never will be.
