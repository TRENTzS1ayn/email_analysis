Come on guys, could you open your eyes and try and see things from
another angle for a minute? I don't see what you're hoping to get from
repeating the same thing again and again. In particular when it is
false. W3C is an industrial consortium, we do what our members want to
do. Again, there are many member companies besides the browser vendors,
and this is especially true in the DOM Working Group. So you're
statement is simply wrong. The truth is: if it is not required by enough
members, it is not likely to get into the requirements.

Now, it is very possible that our members requirements do not match
yours, but then what? If you want yours to be taken into account, I can
only encourage you to join and lobby for yours. You're very welcome!
This is what an industrial consortium is all about.
