I'd love to, but it's a bit difficult for most individuals:

 There are two classes of membership: Full and Affiliate. The annual
 fee for Full Members is $US 50,000. The annual fee for Affiliate
 Members is $US 5,000. There are no differences in Member benefits
 between the two classes of membership. All new Members must commit to
 a three-year initial term of membership. After that, membership renews
 annually.
