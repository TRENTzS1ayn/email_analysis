FourThought LLC (http://FourThought.com) announces the release of

                             4DOM 0.8.1
                      -----------------------
                  An implementation of the W3C's
                  Document Object Model in Python

4DOM is a close implementation of the DOM recommendation, including DOM
Core level 1, DOM HTML level 1, NodeIterator and TreeWalker from DOM
Level 2, and several utility and helper components.  4DOM can work in a
CORBA* enviroment, or in a purely local set-up.

4DOM is designed to allow developers rapidly design applications that
read, write or manipulate HTML and XML.

News
----

The DOM Level 2 Core Interfaces have been implemented.
Bugs were fixed in Printer, Attr and elsewhere.
__repr__ has been added so that orbless users can get more useful
results from printing Node instances.

More info and Obtaining 4DOM

 ftp://FourThought.com/pub/4Suite/4DOM

4DOM is distributed under a license similar to that of Python.


*For CORBA users, 4DOM directly supports ILU and Fnorb.
