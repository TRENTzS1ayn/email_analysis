> What is the correct behavior when the current node is deleted?

Nodes can't be *deleted* in the technical DOM sense, only removed
from the document tree, either singly or as a result of removing
some ancestor.  In either case, TreeWalker just walks the
fragment, either finding itself unable to move, or else able
to move but not to reach the Document node.
