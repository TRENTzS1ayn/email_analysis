Yes. You should, however, redistribute the whole document, especially 
the section that says "this interface is liable to change at any 
time". There may also be slight inconsistencies between the Java 
definitions and the rest of the document; please tell us if you 
notice any so we can fix them. This is a first draft, and as such is 
liable to have errors. We would welcome any feedback.

cheers,


Lauren
