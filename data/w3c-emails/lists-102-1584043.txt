These are comments on DOM Level 1 document as of 9th of October draft.

In Element:
  There might be comments inside the tag (eg <foo --this is foo-- bar=val>
  Am I correct in understanding that comment node should be generated for
  that and returned in getChildren() call, but not in getAttributes()
  call. The alternative is to not represent in-tag comment in DOM. What
  about error nodes. (I know they should not happen, but....)

In Attribute:
 Description for when null is returned for getValue() is slightly hard to
understand. :-{ Also, how stylesheets will influence this getValue() is
not clear either. In my understanding CSS value would be check after
explicit value, but before default value. Some mention of it should be
done, even if it is not quite in scope yet.

In PI:
 I don't know about XML, but isn't PI ends with >, not ?>.

Whitespace for HTML:
  If I have a sequence of whitespace, would the corresponding TextObject
contain a single whitespace or multiple whitespace? Basically, whether
space collapsing should happen before or after DOM?


 Requests.

It would be nice to provide an archive of files with relative links
between documents. As of now, I had to download each file separately and
read through them by checking what document link is _trying_ to point too.

I want to use DOM's java definitions for my Browser project. Do I have to
put the definitions in w3c.dom package or it should be in my personal
project space because they are still in a state of a fluke? (basically, I
don't want to end up in trouble with w3c released packages). Also, for
future, would it be possible to release those files as a downloadable
archive in natural (java) form, so people could use them straight away?

Regards,
  Alex.
Ps. I like DOM. :-}
