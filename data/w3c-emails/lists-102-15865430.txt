However, empty is equivalent to not being specified, which is clearly
wrong.  An application that *uses* the methods of the CSS OM to cascade
and find computed values would be unable to handle the following rules
correctly:

div {
  border-color: green;
  }

div {
  border: medium solid;
  color: red;
  }

It would give div elements a green border (instead of the correct red,
assuming the color isn't changed anywhere else), since the border-color
property seems (through the CSS OM) not to be set within the second
ruleset.

This is more a problem with CSS than the DOM, but I'm bringing it to
the attention of the DOM list as well.

They cannot be specified by the longhand properties, but they can
clearly be decomposed into those longhand properties.  In particular,
see the second sentence of the following (which is within the URL you
cite):

# That is why this property is "almost" a shorthand property: system
# fonts can only be specified with this property, not with
# 'font-family' itself, so 'font' allows authors to do more than the
# sum of its subproperties. However, the individual properties such as
# 'font-weight' are still given values taken from the system font,
# which can be independently varied.
