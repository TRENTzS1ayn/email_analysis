There are some useful exception types defined as part of the standard CORBA
exceptions (implicit for all interface methods) that are not enumerated in
DOMExeception. For example, NO_MEMORY would be a useful exception to have
for any of the dom::Document::CreateXXX() methods.

Probably would be a bad idea to say that OMG IDL standard exceptions are
assumed and instead increase the number of exception codes defined.

I'd be interested to know what you think.

Andrew.
