This is correct but it isn't new. DOM Level 1 already prohibits you from
sharing an Attr node. Indeed, setAttributeNode() raises an
INUSE_ATTRIBUTE_ERR DOMException if you try. Given that, we decided to
go ahead and add ownerElement which a lot of people have requested.

All of these can be added later so there is no real harm not to have
them now. And something gets added when someone thinks it is necessary
enough to lobby for it and can convince the rest of the group it really
is necessary.

I don't know where you got that from but it is incorrect. The XML
Information Set only includes some information from the DTD. It doesn't
include an element content type for instance.
Anyway, support for DTDs and schemas is definitely on our list for DOM
Level 3. Stay tuned.
