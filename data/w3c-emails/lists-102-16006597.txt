Believe me, we understand your frustration. I've wanted DTD content models since
before DOM Level 1 was finalized.

DTD support was held up in the hope that XML Schemas would coalesce quickly and
that we'd be able to do a single solution for both. Unfortunately the schema
work has turned out to be a larger challenge than expected.  We still hope to be
able to achieve that compatability, but we may have to make some guesses (and
take the risk of guessing wrong) rather than waiting for the dust to settle.

If we _didn't_ provide DTD support in Level 3, XML developers would be hanging
us in effigy, and I wouldn't blame them. (Memo to self: If you see a town named
"Effigy", detour around it!)
