You could (and almost certainly ought to) rescue sharable attributes by
allowing (or, better, requiring!) attributes defined in the DTD to return
null from ownerElement.  They would still be ``in use'' but not by an
Element.

This stuff WAS in the earliest drafts of the DOM.  So were a lot of other
useful things.  I'm especially annoyed about the fact that a Notation node
exists, but is completely useless because you can't get the notion of an
attribute.

Or too hard to annoy.
