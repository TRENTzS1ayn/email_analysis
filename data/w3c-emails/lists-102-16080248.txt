MutationEvents in 6.6.4 ... consider a Document, with one Element.  That
Element has an Attr object which has one child, a Text node.

Now let's say that text node gets modified.  What events will fire?

   In the Attribute's tree
- DOMCharacterDataModified, delivered to the text node
- DOMSubtreeModified, delivered to the attribute

   In the Element's tree
- DOMAttrModified, delivered to the element
- DOMSubtreeModified, delivered to the element

Within each tree, bubbling and capturing apply.

Q:  Is that right?
A:...

SUGGESTION:  The text should make clear that a document isn't the only
example given of the "top of a subtree". DocumentFragments and Attributes,
plus disconnected elements, are other common cases.

Also, the lack of examples I think hurts this section.
