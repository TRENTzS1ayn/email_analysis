In which case the statement is in urgent need of rephrasing.

Trying to do everything that everyone wants is a guaranteed road to
disaster.  I'd rather have distinct DOM and InfoSet interfaces than DOM
Level 50 piled on top of 49 ever-more-bloated special-purpose interfaces and
years of regrettable decisions.  The InfoSet API would then be free to model
_exactly_ the information in the document, and nothing else.

I'd settle for an "isWhitespace" flag and let the application decide whether
it's ignorable.  In fact, that's what I added in my implementation.

But you can hardly claim even to _intend_ to have Level 2 be an API to the
Infoset in that case.  The best you can do is say that Level 2 is intended
as an API to a subset of the Infoset as defined at the moment, and that
_maybe_ Level 3 will be intended as an API to the Infoset as it might
become.
