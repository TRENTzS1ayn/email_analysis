UNSUPPORTED_EVENT_TYPE: Good catch. That should have been defined.

I do like the idea of explicitly saying that all ErrorCode values -- or at least
some sizable portion of that space -- are reserved to W3C. I've already seen
someone start trying to define his own values just above the official Level 1
set, and had to warn him that his code was likely to break in future releases of
the DOM.
