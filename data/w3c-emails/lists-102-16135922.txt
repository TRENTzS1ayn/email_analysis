The same kind of thing goes for node types -- I've had to define several.
My approach is to reserve positive values for the DOM, and use negative
values for the implementation, reasoning that the spec was unlikely to
expand in that direction.  

The spec really ought to make that distinction explicit.  There has to be
_some_ way to add implementation-specific extensions, and splitting between
-1 and 0 gives the maximum amount of space to both.
