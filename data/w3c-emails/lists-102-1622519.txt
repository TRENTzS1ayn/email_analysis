What about the case when it is possible. For example, if you look at html
source code with errors in Netscape, you would notice, it recovers from
errors by ignoring part of the input (it is shown in different color).
This way, you can see where was the error. In the same way an Error node
would just contains text representation of skipped part and can be ignored 
by the application processor if not needed. Most probably it could happen
on any level.
