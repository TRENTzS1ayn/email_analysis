Surely some folk on www-dom will be interested in this.
I don't seem to recall seeing news about any L2 versions
out there, except maybe a Python version a while back.

Feedback appreciated -- bug reports, kudos, patches, etc.

The DOM Level 2 discussions are getting closer to becoming
a REC from W3C ... the current spec is a "last call" before
it goes to "Proposed RECcomendation" status.

So, now's a particularly good time to start playing with it.
If you're interested, jump to:

http://home.pacbell.net/david-b/xml/

There, you'll find a new DOM implementation that's got the
updates to the core APIs, notably namespace support and some
new factory methods hanging off the implementation class.

Probably a lot more fun for developers will be the fact that
it's got basic support for the "Event" APIs.  This includes
having the DOM generate "MutationEvent" messages that your
listeners can work with, and a simple user event extension.

On top of that, there's a new stateful iterator.  And if you
grab that whole package, you get (free!!  limited time bonus!!)
complete javadoc for all the W3C interfaces; no, that's not
really a conspiracy to sell bandwidth (it makes this an 820K
download, most of which is javadoc).  Also, simple examples!!

For the bandwidth-starved, I also stuck the whole thing up on
this website; no promises it'll be there a long time:

ftp://www.brownell.org/pub/xml/dom2/index.html

The javadoc is browsable from there.

p.s. there's lots of DOM L2 that's not implemented here...
the HTML and CSS support, ranges and views, and
gooey events.
