This works in an interpreted language, or a compiled language that supports
interfaces, as Java does.  In a compiled language which does not support
interfaces, for example C++, printOutElementsWithNS will fail to compile, or
may compile against header files but fail to link against the DOM
implementation actually in use.

This would be disastrous for those implementors who need to define new
types.  For example, the DOM currently does not have nodes that an
implementation can use to represent the DTD.  Those of us who need to
represent DTD's _must_ define new node types.  

My solution is to use node types and exception codes less than zero; this is
a direction in which the DOM is unlikely to go, and it seems better to
reserve negative codes for implemention-specific uses than to completely
prevent extensions.  The only possible effect of the latter would be to
force those of us who find the present specification too limited to
abandon the DOM altogether.
