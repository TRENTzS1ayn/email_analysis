Very little, but the comment I was replying to suggested that you might have

Blast it--I missed that.  I've been working with the Java bindings almost
exclusively, and rarely look at the IDL.  Java doesn't have unsigned
integers, of course, so it worked for me. 

It's a problem -- there _has_ to be some extension mechanism defined in the
spec.  The simplest thing would be to set aside for the implementation all
values with the high-order bit set; these would map into the negative values
in languages that don't have unsigned integers.
