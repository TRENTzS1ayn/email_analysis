I will have to let others answer for HTML--preferably someone from Netscape
or Microsoft.

XML does not allow a document to have well-formedness errors.  An object
that is not well-formed is not an XML document and is therefore not
addressed by the DOM per the current official position as I understand it.
Therefore, there will be no such thing as an Error node in the DOM for XML.
