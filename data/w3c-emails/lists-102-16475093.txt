Something that returns an unknown node type is still a Node, and can be
treated as such without loss of generality by an application.

Every properly-written application still has to check NodeType explicitly
for the cases it can handle, and ignore the rest -- otherwise it will break
the next time the DOM specification is extended.  Or are you suggesting that
the set of node types is now completel and none will ever be added?

And in any case it's unlikely that an application will be using an extended
version of the DOM unless it's prepared to deal with the extensions.
