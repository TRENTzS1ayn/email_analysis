Help me out here; I unerstood from a lot of reading that
XML (as opposed to HTML) had as its primary purpose
the definition of a syntax which would facilitate the
machine processing and generation of information.

What exactly does your proposed extension do that
you couldn't define an XML namespace to do? I have
to admit the proposal to allow for extensions which
allow things I thought the standard already allows for
rather surprised me.

I certainly have no objection; you can do anything
you want (the great advantage of computers). I
just don't see from what you wrote why you want to
do what you describe, since as far as I can tell,
XML already appears to define what you want as 
a basic feature.
