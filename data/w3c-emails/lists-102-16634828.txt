Sure.  Go ahead.  Just don't expect DOM to handle them.  You
missed (or ignored) my point about markup.  For an ASP/JSP/XYZ
looking like

Here's some text.
<%foo ... %>
Here's some more text.
<%bar ... %>
Yadda yadda yadda.

Exactly what would Document.elementNode return?  Since it's not
markup, it doesn't obey markup structure rules -- assumed by DOM.
No root element.
