Actually, that note was intended for the IG list, and was a continuation of a
question I'd raised there; my apologies for bringing it up out of context here.
I think it's converging on a reasonable answer, so if folks don't mind I'd
rather wait until we've batted it around a bit more in the IG before making a
fool of myself in public. <grin/>

Thanks, and apologies...
