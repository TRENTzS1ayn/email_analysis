Why not? I guess you misunderstood what I said. All I'm saying is that
if you're defining your own type of Node, giving up on interoperability,
relying on the W3C nodeType attribute is no longer a requirement. You
can add a myVeryOwnType attribute that all your nodes will have and for
which you're completely free to use *any* value.
