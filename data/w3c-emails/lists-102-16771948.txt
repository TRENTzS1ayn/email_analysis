I agree with what Christian Roth said; all I meant by "obviously limits
interoperability" is the boringly obvious assertion that proprietary
extensions generally only work in one implementation, so code that uses them
won't work with other implementations.

I'd be very receptive to specific suggestions as to how we can tweak the
Level 2 spec to make it more extendible, e.g. making the space of reserved
names and numeric codes explicit up front.
