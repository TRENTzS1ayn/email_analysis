That is my understanding of what it does.

I think this might be rephrased "ALLOWS a breadth-first traversal of the
tree", or something.  The intent, I'm quite sure, was to convey that
iterating over getNextSibling calls moves across the breadth of the tree
rather than the depth.  It should return NULL when it gets to the last
sibling node, not go down a level.

Thanks for pointing this out.
