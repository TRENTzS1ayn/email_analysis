Just 2 small comments on the DOM Level 1 document as of 9th of October draft.
1. It could be useful (if not necessary?) to have some kind of "mustOmitEndTag" attribute for the Element interface, 
so that an exact re-creation of the source document could be done 
without access to the DocumentType.

2. The definition of a read-only subset of the DOM may be useful,
but this is straightforward to do, and probably out-of-scope here.
