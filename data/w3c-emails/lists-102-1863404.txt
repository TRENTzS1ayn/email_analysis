Hello.  I have a question about what DOM has to say about the
validity of the documents represented using DOM.

It seems to me that objects comprising DOM map isomorphically
into the elements comprising an XML document.  Given that
validity is defined for an XML document, it should be possible
to define validity for a DOM document through this mapping.
Such a definition would likely be intuitive and directly
derivable from the XML definition.

The DOM (Core) Level 1 draft says that issues of document
"validation" are being deferred to subsequent DOM levels.  I'm
wondering if anyone can answer the following questions for me:

(1) Does the term "validation" in the Level 1 draft refer to
    ensuring document validity, where validity is defined by
    derivation as I have suggested above?  If not I'm curious
    to know what it refers to or whether the whole notion is
    still being left open (and what it might entail).

(2) If for purposes of this question we do define validity as
    I suggest above, what does DOM have to say about the
    validity of DOM documents?  In particular, I'd like to
    know the degree to which DOM allows for the creation of
    invalid documents and what DOM interface operations
    require that validity be preserved.

(An answer the the first question will probably also answer
the second question.)

Thanks for your help, and I apologize in advance if these
concerns have been covered elsewhere.
