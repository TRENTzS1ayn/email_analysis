The XML interfaces supplement, but do not hide the core.

Yes.  The DOM insists that the underlying document be well-formed, but
makes no assertions about its validity vis a vis the DTD.  One could (as a
previous reply indicated) add validation functions built with the DOM
methods, and we could imagine these being added to the DOM itself someday,
but I can't imagine ever forcing the document to be DTD-valid in order for
it to work with the DOM.

I personally have no interest in enforcing such restrictions in the DOM
itself; perhaps some vendor could write a DOM client (e.g., a JavaBean)
that extends the DOM to provide these features.  One could imagine a
"VALIDXML" interface that supplements the XML interface in the DOM itself,
but I'm pretty sure the WG won't get around to it for quite some time even
if demand exists.

I don't understand; is this still relevant in light of the other answers
you've received?  Again, anyone can write their own extensions to the DOM
on top of the core API; the constraints of the XML or HTML interfaces are
only relevant if you go thru those interfaces.
