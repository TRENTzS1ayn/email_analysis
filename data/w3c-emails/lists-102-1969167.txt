It's funny ... I had a discussion at lunch in which I became convinced that
having standard validation methods in the DOM *would* be a good idea,
especially in a distributed XML application in which "validity" could only
be determined by some server-side process that saw the big picture ...
Anyway, I think there are a lot of good ideas here, but we're so deep in
the mud building foundations at the moment that it's hard to think about
the upper stories.  I *can* see the utility of a VALIDXML interface a
couple of levels up (Level 3 or 4), and I hope you can bear with us until
we can give this the consideration it deserves.

In the meantime, part of the work to validate the lower level specs is to
think through what it would take to build higher-level applications on top
of the Level 1 DOM.  To the extent that one can point to flaws in Level 1
that  would make such a DOM application (or a Level n extension) difficult,
we can try to fix the underpinnings now. So the more real
design/prototyping work people can do with Level 1, the better Levels 2, 3
... will be.
