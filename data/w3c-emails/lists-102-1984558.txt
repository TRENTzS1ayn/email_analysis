[FOR YOUR INFORMATION]

Spam activity is increasing on most public lists. In order to reduce
the pain to subscribers of this w3c mailing list, we are temporarily
closing foreign submissions to it.

Q. What does "foreign submission" mean? 

A. Only subscribers to the list can send messages to it.

Some problems may happen. For example, if you subscribed under one email
address and posted under another one, your message won't make it right away
to the list.  Instead, the list maintainer gets a copy of the "banned"
message and he must decide if he wants to forward it to the list. This
may take some minutes, some hours, or some days, depending on how far
away the list maintainer is from his mailbox.

This is only a temporary solution. We're in the process of setting up a 
spam filter at W3C which should help decrease spam on our lists.

Should users complain too much about having a closed list, we will reopen
it again.

-Jose Kahan, on behalf of the W3C sysadmin team
