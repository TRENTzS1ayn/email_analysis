Dear People,

We are consultants specialising in Document Management and advising large
companies, world-wide on their long-term strategies.


We are aware of DOM, SGML and the recent developments with XML, which sound
interesting.  
My question is, will this affect or be useful for storing ANY documents
created by applications such as MS WORD?  i.e. Which of these (or other?)
standards could/should be used as an application-independent, long-term
storage standard for all document data?

I look forward to hearing from you and best wishes for the Holiday season.

Alan Griffiths
Principal, IIC Consulting
