I'm not so interested in distributed systems as in inter-language
communication, but distributed systems are a nice side effect.

I've done that, and a quick browse through the files doesn't reveal to
me any real extraneous stuff. Of course there are all of the distributed
object support files (_*.java, *Helper.java, *Holder.java) , but you can
just delete those if all you want is the interfaces, can't you? Can't
you just concatenate the real interface files and call that "the Java
interface"? I noticed that the enumeration is a little ugly, but Java
enumerations are pretty weak. And ugly enumerations seem a small price
to pay for reliable inter-language communication and distributed
operability.

Perhaps you could just give me some examples of things that are very
different between what you are developing and what idl2java produces
(other than the helper/holder cruft).
 
BTW, It was nice to meet you too. Hopefully we'll meet again somewhere
where we have more time to talk. I found your paper interesting and I'm
pondering the ideas therein...
