I'm working on Java tools which handle documents from a browser.
I used DOM in order to make my tools independent of the browser.  

+-------+     +-----+---------+
| my    | <=> | API | browser |
| tools |     | DOM |         |
+-------+     +-----+---------+

To traverse the tree of a document HTML, I use a specific method to
get the root node and traverse the tree.
for example, if I want the TITLE Element:

  Object dc = myBrowser.getCurrentDocumentContext();
  Object title = ((w3c.dom.DocumentContext)dc).getDocument().
getElementsByTagName("TITLE");

The systematic cast is painful, but it's possible.
But, how to create or to append a new node ?

I think if DOM wants to propose API for Java, it is necessary to 
include classes.  

This subject has been already discussed by Mark L. Fussell.
Can you light us?
