Hi there.  I've been working on a concrete implementation of the current DOM
spec (09 Dec) in Java, and have been wondering about the following:

1. Is it intended that different implementations of DOM can co-exist within
the same Document?  An example of this might be a couple of specific
implementations of some XML DTDs, created by different authors, being
combined into the same document.  It could happen :)

2. Are we expected to attempt to cast incoming Nodes, NodeLists, etc to our
implementations in order to be able to do basic things like set the Node's
parent, etc.  If the answer to 1. is Yes, then the current system is very
inadequate. If No, it's still pretty dodgy, since we're relying on dynamic
casting (which is not available in some languages) to be able to perform
necessary, basic functions.

3. I noticed that 'long's are returned in both the IDL spec and the Java
API.  I noticed at the top that an IDL 'long' is equivalent to a Java 'int'.
Should this be reflected in the Java API?

Thanks

David Peterson
