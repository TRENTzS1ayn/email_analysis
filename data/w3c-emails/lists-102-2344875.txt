Hi,

Everything that has to do with the document type definition should be
moved to
the Core specification because it is common to XML and HTML. The only
interface
that is left is XMLNode. It has no reason to exist because it isn't used

anywhere. It could be made to derive from Node as a lot of other
interfaces.
Only the operations getEntityReference and getEntityDeclaration should
be kept.

With kind regards,
