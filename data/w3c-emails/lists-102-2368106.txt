Thanks for your very perceptive comments; those that are outright errors

Why not? It's a special type of DocumentFragment that has addtional
properties that pertain only to "top-level"documents?

There is a strong feeling that the Core should be as small as possible, and
that any objects that are not relevant to HTML users should not be
represented in Core.  Do you see a serious problem with leaving DTDs out of
Core?

Yes.
