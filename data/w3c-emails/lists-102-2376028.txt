No I don't. The Core and XML parts are the ones that interest me the
most and I will be using them together anyway. I understand it would be
unusual to consult the DTD when working with a HTML document. Strictly
speaking this could be possible however, because an implicit DTD is
always present for HTML. But it is indeed not important.
