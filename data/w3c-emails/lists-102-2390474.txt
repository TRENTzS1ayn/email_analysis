The attribute documentType of interface Document in the Core DOM specification
is defined with type Node, but the interface DocumentType is not defined to
inherit from Node.  As it is, a DocumentType object cannot be assigned to the
documentType attribute, which looks like a bug to me.

Greetings,
Axel.
