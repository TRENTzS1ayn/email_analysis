AttributeList (and NodeList, and NamedNodeList, etc.) is obsolete.  We
(after much discussion) decided to add methods to the NodeIterator object
to make it usable as both a "Collection" such as AttributeList was an an
iterator/enumeration object.  

Take a closer look at NodeIterator in this context, and let us know if you
still think this is a mistake!

Thanks,
