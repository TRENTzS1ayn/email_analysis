`XML for Java', an XML processor written in Java, has been
updated at 17 Apr.  You can get it from
http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/formula/xml



The parser of `XML for Java' generates DOM [18-Mar-1998] trees.
But some interfaces and methods are not implemented because ...

 o I can't understand specifications (i.e. Element.normalize())
 o Designs of XML for Java and DOM is too different to adapt.
   (i.e. com.ibm.xml.parser.ContentModel vs ModelGroup)
