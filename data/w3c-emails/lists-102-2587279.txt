I've tried posting several messages to this list, none have made it yet.
Here's another try:

I'm confused. What is the purpose of using nodes to hold collections of
elements (the DocumentType externalSubset, internalSubset,
elementDefinitions, etc.).  Is this just a convernience mechanism for
implementors?  Is it even possible to implement correctly?
How can an ElementDefinition belong to both the external subset and the
elementDefinitions node?
