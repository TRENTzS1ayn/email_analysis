Another weak point in the spec is with entities.  The current model allows
an entity declaration to have a replacement string or a replacement
substring.  Period. What about the public/system identifiers (which may be
necessary for implementations to perform "lazy" evaluations of an external
entity), the notation, etc. It may also make sense to include an enum that
provides information about the type of entity: INTERNAL, EXTERNAL, PARSED,
UNPARSED, etc.
