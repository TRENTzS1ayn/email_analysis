Hi,
I have a doubt in the interpretation of the DOM Spec 1.0.
The interface 'Document' has an operation 
Attribute CreateAttribute(in wstring name, in Node value);

Also the interface for 'Attribute' has an operation
wstring getValue();

If the value is of type Node, then this operation should
return an object of type Node, right?

Am I missing something obvious ??

Thanks in advance,
Rajesh N.
