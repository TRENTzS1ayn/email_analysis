Hi,
There seems to be a contradiction in the spec regarding the
description of the interface 'Element'.

The operation 
void getElementsByTagName(in wstring tagname);
is NOT returning anything as per this declaration. But the 
description says that this operation 'Returns an iterator through
all subordinate elements with a given tag name.' which seems to 
be logical. Should this operation return a NodeIterator ?

Any clarifications ?

Thanks in advance,
Rajesh N.
