Understandable. But what if the DOM forms the core of the XML processor
implementation? It should be possible to reproduce an ENTIRE document,
not just an intermediate representation of a document.  Consider the
following:

    documentA -> processor -> DOM -> generator -> documentB

Assuming no limitations on the part of the processor or generator, documentA
and documentB, the DOM should not prevent documentA and documentB from being
identical.

Also, it might make sense to differentiate between general entities and
parameter
entities since there are significant differences in their behavior.  I'm
talking about separate
interfaces, not just a "type" identifier.
