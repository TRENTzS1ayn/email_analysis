You're right; I've come to realize that I was extrapolating too far from
the DOM draft spec's statement on entity handling in core in my previous
reply.  I'm speaking for myself since it's clear that this is not clearly
laid out in the spec, but from some informal consultations on this I think
it's clear that we need to a) clarify the relationship between DOM and the
XML processor and b)we need to put type information on the
EntityDeclaration object so that the DOM user can tell what it is and where
the declaration was found. 

Thanks for your persistence in setting me straight here!
