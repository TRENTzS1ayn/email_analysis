I would expect that specializations for particular DTDs would either (as
for HTML)
use the Core DOM as a base, or layer on top of the XML DOM if some
XML-specific
features such as entities are required. We should probably add some words 
explaining how we expect this to work to the specification.

The latest thinking, which has not yet been put into a public draft, is to
have HTMLDocument and XMLDocument. We do expect application-specific
stuff to be tied to the Document, but I guess this isn't strictly necessary.

Not yet, but it's an interesting question. We have talked a little about it
in light
of embedding XML in HTML, but probably not enough.

Another interesting idea that we need to think about.

True. Thanks for bringing these questions up.

cheers,
