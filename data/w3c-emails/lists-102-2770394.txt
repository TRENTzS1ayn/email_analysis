Very good argument. Specifying that iterators are "live" without specifying
any synchronization methods means that implementations will undoubtedly
force additional requirements on clients.

I believe the lack of resonance is based on the immaturity of
implementations. When we start stress-testing the processors out there, I
think we'll find that memory management is necessary.

Since an attribute's value can hold text and can have entity content, it
does make sense to keep it as a Node.
