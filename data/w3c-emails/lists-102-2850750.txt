Right. Some object -- and the document tree is a logical choice -- must
maintain a reference to iterators.

But I thought you were also arguing that maintaining these references would
be very expensive. I was claiming that there are implementations where, in
fact, it isn't very expensive at all.

In the subset of language bindings which garbage collect -- I'll include
ECMA Script and COM in that category -- I don't believe there is a
requirement for adding a release mechanisms to the DOM API. Doesn't Java
also fall into the same category?

To be clear about this, an iterator can have the same lifetime as the
document itself, regardless of how many editing operations have taken
place. So the only reason for the DOM API to have a release mechanism
for iterators would be to support languages that don't garbage collect
so that a programmer who is worried about memory usage can do his own
collecting.

Personally, I would rather not add memory management to the API. But I'm
keeping an open mind on the subject.
