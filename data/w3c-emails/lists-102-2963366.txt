Mike,

If ECMAScript programmers do not call release(), Nodes will simply
accumulate NodeIterators and will work in most cases.  When NodeIterator
accumulates enough to slow down editing operations, release() method can be
called by ECMAScript programmers as a performance enhancement.

In reality, most ECMAScript will be using C++/C based DOM implementation and
NodeIterator.release can be called by the implementation implicitly.

Bottom line is that there is no conflict with the release idea and
ECMAScript.
