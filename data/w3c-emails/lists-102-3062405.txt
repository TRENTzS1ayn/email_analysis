It won't be in Level 1; we have plans to do such a thing, but not until
Level 3 or so.  Right now the DOM's insists on well-formedness, not
validity.  

There have been several requests for validation methods from www-dom over
the last few months; I personally see this more as an opportunity for an
enterprising tool developer once the DOM PR is out rather than a near-term
requirement for the WG. In my personal opinion, we're trying to build a
good foundation in Level 1, not a complete toolset that DOM implementers
would provide "for free".
