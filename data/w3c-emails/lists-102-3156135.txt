If that is the intent, then Attribute doesn't derive Node in the IDL
definition.  Although the concept of Attributes as Nodes never made sense to
me.  Attributes are do not need any particular order, and shouldn't be able to
have children.

That said, I also notice the NodeType ATTRIBUTE, was also left in, so maybe
that was the intent.

    My understanding is that Attributes are still Nodes.

        I just noticed that the method

           NodeIterator getAttributes();

        has been left in the 980416 spec, even though Attributes are not Nodes
anymore.
