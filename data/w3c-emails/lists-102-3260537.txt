A preliminary version of SAXDOM supporting the latest DOM spec (04/16/98) is
released.  There are still some clean ups (i.e. syncronization blocks for
concurrent access to DOM objects) and plenty of tests to go.

This version of SAXDOM includes NodeIterator.release method which is
currently not in the spec.  I am hoping it is included in the spec.  You
will find SaxContainerIterator class particularly interesting because it is
implemented as a Node to allow 'between' iterator position and 'live' model
requirements.

Enough said.  Here is the URL:
