Actually, SAX is a little more complicated -- the application has
two options for each external entity reference:

1) ask the parser to resolve it; or

2) provide an alternative resolution (including possibly an empty
   stream). 

More generally, entity references should be invisible to production
processes (such as those targeted by SAX), but they will, of course,
matter to authoring tools.


All the best,


David
