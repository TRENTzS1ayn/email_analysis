It's great to see some commercial implementers on this list.

My intuition says the <I></I> should follow the marker, although this
obviously needs to be defined within the DOM.

This seems to depend upon the implicit filter used when creating the
iterator/marker.  If the iterator was created by a getchildNodes call to the
<B> Element, then the marker must remain with the removed node.

If the marker was created for use with a TreeIterator of a ancestor or created
via a call to ancestor's getElementsByTagName(...), then the marker needs to
be placed bewteen X and Y.  However this seems prone to errors since the
iterator just changed position without a method call.  I think some form of
notification needs to in place for this situation.
