I agree that some want to scoot left and some right, but in my
experience it is generally relative to other iterator-like invisible
markers, and the order and way in which they were inserted, not in a
constant direction.

In my work, multiple markers that occur at the same position seem to
need a sub-order established relative to each other, and which way each
iterator scoots depends upon which side the inserting marker occurred
on, using the sub-order where the actual position is identical.  A
simple gravity flag does not automatically do the right thing most of
the time without complex gravity switching logic that seems to be
handled more simply by sub-ordering.
