Although I am not deep into this ongoing discussion, I will add my comments
anyway.

reuse of objects. From a practical view it is desirable to achieve good
performance,
so explicit reuse in the API would be appropriate. From an API view I would
think
this be rather poor practice, because it will move the burden of memory
allocation
to the API programmer (once again). Recycling of these kinds of small objects,
should be handled by the memory manager in conjunction with the garbage
collector.
The mem-man could detect intensive allocation/deallocation of certain objects
and
apply a recycling scheme.
