This was discussed in Malbourne as part of the discussion about NDATA
entities (the only way to get binary data in XML). I noted that we
probably need to provide some interface for directly accessing the
binary data, and I think most people agreed in principal.

Expect to see something in the next spec. I will be revising the stuff
on entities, and will take care of this then.
