I would also like to mention that two other developers and I are close to
finishing up a proposal for embedding binary data in XML which does not use
NDATA.  We will be addressing the DOM related issues as well once we are
done.  We are just haggling over the proposal name (the effort started off
as XML-Binary but the proposal now covers more than just binary data so we
are trying to come up with more reasonable name).

Don't worry.  We have our eyes on the ball.  I just wish I knew where the
heck I am ;-).
