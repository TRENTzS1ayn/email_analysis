You are right in that COM programmers will instinctively (yeah right, COM is
real natural *add some rolling eyes here *) invoke Release which will
conflict with 'release' method.  One ugly solution would be to double AddRef
to account for double release.
Better solution would be to name the release method to match the COM Release
method.  Its almost COM-ical when you think about it.
