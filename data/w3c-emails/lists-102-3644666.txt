It's better to post DOM questions on www-dom@w3.org.  I'll answer here and
cc: to ww-dom so please look there for any followup.

But anyway, Good Point!  We can't distinguish the two cases and I have no
idea what I was thinking when I typed it.  I'll remove the clause starting
with "likewise" from the spec.


It should work as follows.  Consider an iterator through nodes A, B, C.
The last node returned was B, so the "current position" signified by the
"^" is after B.   

   A --------B--^-----C     

If a new node X is inserted between B and C, the current position remains
after B, so X will be returned by getNextNode(), and B returned by
getPrevNode().

   A --------B--^-----X--------C

Sorry for the confusion,

Mike Champion
