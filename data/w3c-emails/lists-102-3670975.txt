I think there's some errors in the current draft of the spec (the Attribute
stuff was discussed at the last minute before the draft went out), and
things DEFINITELY should be explained more clearly.

Conceptually, Attribute values are Nodes because in XML, entity references
in can expand to make the value an arbitrarily complex tree, and the Node
is the root of that tree.  In HTML, and in probably the vast majority of
XML applications, the value is a string.  SO, we formally define it as a
Node, but give convenience methods to get/set attribute values as strings
since that will be the most common usage.

I'll clarify all this in the next draft.
