Akitoshi,

SaxNodeVector will soon be replaced soon with a faster, lighter, and robust
implementation of NodeIterator.

SaxNodeIterator you are looking at IS vulnerable to the changes you
mentioned.

SAXDOM has be deprecated (oh, how I hate that word) in favor of FREE-DOM
which has a cleaner and safer implementation of NodeIterator.  Vector-based
iterator is used in a few places (i.e. attributes) still but it will be
removed as soon as I get a nod from my wife.
