Hello,

I'm trying to implement DOM in perl and was wondering what the semantics
of the NodeIterator interface for TreeIterators should be. Do the
NodeIterator methods only navigate the siblings of the current node, or
do they define an ordering (depth first for example) for all the nodes
in the tree?
