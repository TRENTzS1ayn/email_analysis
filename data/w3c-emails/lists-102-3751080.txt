Hi Mike,

This is what I thought also until I realized that it could cause problems if
an Attribute is shared among multiple element (this could happen if the
attribute is FIXED or is inherited as DEFAULT value).  Furthermore, I think
it is confusing to have getParent returned the element when Attribute is not
a child of the element.


Best wishes,

Don
