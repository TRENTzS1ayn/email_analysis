Because we are not defining a data model but only an API that anyone
should be able to map onto his/her own (possibly existing) data model.
This means, for instance, that the user just doesn't have a clue on how
to actually set a node's parent, but the DOM implementation does, and
will do it underneath when the user calls insertChildNode().
