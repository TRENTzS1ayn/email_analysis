This is a fundamental dilemma we face.  If we were designing an API for
some "captive" audience, I'd agree with you.  Instead, we're trying to
design a standard that will "woo" people away from the proprietary APIs
they already have, and to bridge the gaps between the HTML - XML worlds and
the scripting - programming worlds.  Everybody wants it to be "simple", but
the various worlds have different and incompatible notions of what the
fundamental objects and methods should be.
