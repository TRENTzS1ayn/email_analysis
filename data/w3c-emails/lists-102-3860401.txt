I'm not sure I understand; is the issue that the "B" tag is "really" for
procedural markup rather than being structural?  
In any event, the DOM doesn't get into this; HTML tags should parse into a
DOM element object.  The representation of text in the DOM is a subject of
dispute, but as it stands now,a DOM-aware parser should produce a tree
something like:
              HTMLDocument  
                 |
                 P
              /  |  \
"How would"      B  " be parsed?"
                 |
               "this"
   
In words, since my ASCII drawing may get reformattted ... there is 
an HTMLDocument object that contains one P element.  The P element has 3
children, a TextNode with the string "How would ", a B element, and another
text node containing the string " be parsed?".  The B element has one
child, a TextNode containing the string "this".

Does this answer the question?
