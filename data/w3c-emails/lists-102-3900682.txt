Is there any policy on object ownership for languages like C++ which do
not have native reference counting support, or are the objects expected
to be reference counted?

The spec could be read to imply that Node insertion passes ownership to
the containing node and removal/replacement returns ownership to the
caller. Is this a reasonable interpretation?
