Hello,

I haven't seen a reply to Kent's questions about DocumentType
and NodeType.  I'm confused about these same issues as well.

Also, I'm assuming (perhaps incorrectly) that Attribute extends
Node. If that is so, can't AttributeList extend NodeList/Collection?

If Attribute does *not* extend Node then what is the meaning of
Element.getAttributes() (which returns a NodeIterator) ?
Should it return an AttributeList instead ?

Any idea when the next working draft is due?

Thanks,
Claude Zervas, UTL Co, Seattle

Document.documentType is Node.  But DocumentType doesn't inherit
Node.

If DocumentType is Node, what does an Iterator returned by
DocumentType.getChildNodes() consist of? An internal subset or
an external subset?

DocumentType has no methods to get NodeIterator of an internal
subset / an external subset / entities / notations / element
definitions.

What node does the getNextSibling() method of child nodes in
DocumentType return?
