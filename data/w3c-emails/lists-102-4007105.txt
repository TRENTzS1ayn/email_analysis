Hello,

Would there be any chance that the node tree traversal
methods in the Node interface be deprecated and sent
to some sort of work camp for bunk code patterns?

It seems to me that NodeIterator could handily replace
them and be much more efficient for most implementations.
The aggregate/iterator pattern is pretty standard these
days (C++ STL, Java JGL, Java 1.2 Collections, etc.)
[See Gamma et al] and is not only easy to use but
implementing it is a snap!

IMHO the following methods can be summarily deprecated:

Node.getFirstChild()
Node.getPreviousSibling()
Node.getNextSibling()

Also, I saw some previous posts requesting that reference
counting be somehow tacked on to the DOM. I vote no on that.

Thanks,
