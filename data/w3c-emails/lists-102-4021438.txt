This "bunk code pattern" is well-beloved by untold generations of SGML
weenies ;~) who would prefer to deprecate the idea of used indexed arrays
to represent document structures.   

It's a dilemma for us -- there's no single acceptable paradigm for document
structuring and navagation that we've been able to find, and we don't want
to bloat the spec by supporting everything, and (while I happen to agree
with you about the iterator design pattern) iterators are not supported in
any of the legacy APIs from which we're trying to build.
