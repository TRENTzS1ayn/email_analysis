Hello,

I noticed that AttributeList is only referenced in the Document
interface as a return value for the factory method
Document.createAttributeList().
Nowhere else in the DOM is it used or referenced.

Since Element.getAttributes() returns a NodeIterator
can't AttributeList and Document.createAttributeList()
be deprecated?
IMHO DOM users (and implementors) can always create their
own collection of Attributes if they need to since it isn't
used at all by the DOM.

Is this another legacy thing or is it a placeholder for
a future interface rev?

Its no problem implementing these things but it just seems
like the simpler the better...

Thanks,
Claude Zervas
