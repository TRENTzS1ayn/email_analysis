Gee, what makes you think that? <g>

Since I have implemented NodeIterator several times already, I can
definitely say that NodeIterator, as it stands now, is NOT easy to
implement.  I do prefer NodeIterator over all other methods but
implementation options are severely limited if current design is adopted.
BTW, STL is not thread-safe last time I checked and JGL is not very
efficient IMHO.

Just a few million users and about hundred thousand lines of code just
waiting to enter alpha, I believe.

I got projects left and right just waiting for the DOM API to settle down
which I hope will happen after the June WG meeting.  The problem is that
people like us are part of the problem: implementing before the standard.

The dog is running backward with its tail swing madly ahead.  The good news
is that Microsoft and Netscape folks are hanging onto the tail with the rest
of us.  The bad news is that hindsight makes poor foresight.

All we can do is pucker up and hope for the best.

Best wishes,

Don
