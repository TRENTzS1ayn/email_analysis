Hello,

The HTML DOM defines quite a few (most) attributes
for HTMLElement subclasses that have been deprecated
in HTML4.0 in favor of stylesheets. The HTML DOM prose
states that it is following the HTML4.0 draft yet
most of the HTML DOM spec is HTML3.2 based. Is this
just legacy compatibility?

For example, should HTMLBodyElement.setText( "black" )
actually set the value of a deprecated attribute or
should it hook into the inline style mechanism?
ie. should the HTML look like:

<BODY text="black"> ... </BODY>

or

<BODY style="color: black"> ... </BODY>

Thanks,
Claude Zervas, UTL Co., Seattle
