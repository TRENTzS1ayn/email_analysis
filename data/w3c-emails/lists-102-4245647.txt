It's more difficult for Core elements, since something called "ID" may not
in fact be one, and something with another name may be an ID. So we have to
come up with a generalised method. We will be doing this after Level 1 is out.

Yes, the id attribute is the ID attribute - HTML does not have
case-sensitivity.

Yes.

This is currently being discussed in the DOM WG and there will be a method
in the next public draft to access elements by their unique ID.
