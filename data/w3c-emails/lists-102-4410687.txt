While sometimes it makes sense to force an either/or choice
it is sometimes useful to remember that ALL OF THE ABOVE
is a reasonable answer sometimes. 

To each their own: some designers want an immutable list and others
will want a test for membership. It is, I would argue, impossible
to come up with the single approach which will satisfy everybody 
unless sometimes we include all of the alternatives and let
people make their own choices.
