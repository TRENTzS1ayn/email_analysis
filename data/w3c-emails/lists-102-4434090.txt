Actually, the rule is that it must be a valid HTML, which is always properly
nested. If it isn't I believe it errors (obviously since it's very clear
that XML must nest correctly, there's not problem there). If the text
doesn't nest right, the browser is at fault for interpretting it
incorrectly. Netscape and Microsoft don't worry about nesting order, but the
spec does.
