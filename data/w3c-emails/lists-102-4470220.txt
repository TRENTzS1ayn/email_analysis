Can anyone present a status report on the JavaScript binding for the DOM?
Will it be included in the next public draft of the spec?
And, is that draft still scheduled for release soon?

(I ask these questions as the author of the book JavaScript: The
Definitive Guide.  I'm updating the book, and want to include as much
material as I can on the DOM standard.)

Thanks for any info,

David Flanagan
