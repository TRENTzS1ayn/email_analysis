The following comments relate to the "W3C Working Draft 09-October-97" as
in http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-DOM/requirements-971009.html.
They are not necessarily representative of the views of my employer.

1  For General Requirements item 8
>>   8. It must be possible to read in a document and write out a
structurally identical document to disk
>>  (both documents can be represented by the same raw structural model)
delete the words "to disk" because they are unnecessarily restrictive (and
not matched by a constraint on reading).

2  For Document Manipulation item 3
>>  3. Operations must restore consistency before they return
clarify the meaning of "Operations" in the context of the two preceding
items [ie it may be necessary to combine several add/remove/change actions
into a transaction-type operation if the individual actions do not maintain
consistency].

3  For Event Model item 3
>>  2. There will be interaction events, update events, and change events
clarify the intended distinction between the three classes of event
(especially, how they relate to the add/remove/change actions used
elsewhere in the document).

4  Remove (if it is not significant) or clarify the difference in wording
between
>>  Document Meta Information
>>  These are requirements for what must be exposed ...
>>    1. There will be information about the document and ...
and
>>  UA Information
>>  These are requirements for information about the user agent environment
...
>>    1. There will be a way of obtaining relevant information about ...
[They currently read as "there must be exposure, and it must cover
information" and "there must be information, and it must be exposable".]
