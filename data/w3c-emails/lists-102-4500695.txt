So you think the concept is clear enough without saying "to disk"? We 
want to be clear that different implementations may or may not share 
the same way of implementing the DOM, but that results of the DOM 
operations will be the same.

Good point. We'll be talking about this when we get to the 
concurrency and threading discussions.

We'll be clarifying this once we've started the discussions on the 
topic and know more about the in-depth requirements.

We'll take a look at this before doing the next public release.

Thanks for your comments.
