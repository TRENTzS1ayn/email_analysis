I notice that none of the Java API definitions include a package name.  Since 
this is imperative to the usability of you interface definitions, could you 
please include this on the next draft of the spec?

For now I'll be content with using org.w3.dom.core, ...dom.xml, and 
...dom.html.  Perhaps this needs to be preceded by "level1"?
