Sorry for the repost, but I was not a part of the list when I originally sent 
this and none of the comments were CCed to me.  I'm interested in hearing 
what people say with regards to the Java package issue.

I notice that none of the Java API definitions include a package name.  Since 
this is imperative to the usability of you interface definitions, could you 
please include this on the next draft of the spec?

For now I'll be content with using org.w3.dom.core, ...dom.xml, and 
...dom.html.  Perhaps this needs to be preceded by "level1"?
