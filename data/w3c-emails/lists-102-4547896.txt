The following are a list of notes I've been keeping as I have been working 
implementing a DOM compliant XML parser.  Some are questions, Some are issues 
with the Java interfaces.

-----------------------------------------------
Notes on Core DOM:

 * Should DOM.createText include a boolean to set ignorableWhitespace? 
 Otherwise, what is the default value of this?
 * Should DOM.createAttribute implicitly set the attribute.specified flag?
 * What is the value of an Attribute such as "declare" in the following HTML 
OBJECT tag:
     <P><OBJECT declare
             id="earth.declaration"
             data="TheEarth.mpeg"
             type="application/mpeg">
        The <STRONG>Earth</STRONG> as seen from space.
     </OBJECT>
 * The description of Text.data says, "Text nodes contain just plain text, 
without markup and without entities".  Does this mean Text should not include 
translated character entities, such as '&' where "&amp;" was?  If this is 
true, how are these represented in the DOM?


-----------------------------------------------
Notes on XML DOM:

 * What are the NodeTypes of DocumentType (and the other DTD nodes)


-----------------------------------------------
Notes on the Java Interface Definition:

 * DOM needs to be declared as a class, not an interface, to be accessible in 
a consistent manner.
 * All methods need to be declared public.
 * The following need to convert their longs to ints (Java ints already are 
32-bit, as noted under "IDL Issues")
    node NodeList.item(long)
    long NodeList.length()
 * Node.NodeType constants need to be declared static
