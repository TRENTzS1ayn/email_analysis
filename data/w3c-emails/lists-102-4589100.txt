Thanks to all who replied to my last batch.  The following is just a need for 
some clarifications:

 * Is the NodeEnumerator of a "live" NodeList, such as getChildren, also 
considered  "live"?
 * Is an empty NodeList a valid response to getChildren for a Node that has 
no children (instead of null)?
