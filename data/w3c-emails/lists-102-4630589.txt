% Also, can I reiterate the call for a new draft. It sounds from
% recent emails that major changes are afoot and it would be
% nice to get them in before people in our wider organisation
% start using the code I've been writing.

We're aiming to get a new draft out with Core and XML updates
next week. 

cheers,

Lauren
