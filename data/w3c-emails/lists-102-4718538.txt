We're looking at something similar to this in the range proposal that 
we're discussing. It won't be in the next public draft becuase we 
haven't ironed out some of the problems yet (like the ones you point 
out) but it'll get there some time.

Thanks for your comments. It's good to know that at least some of 
what we're thinking of adding will be used.

cheers,

 
Lauren
