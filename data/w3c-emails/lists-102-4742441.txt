Are up online, in case people hadn't noticed. The DOM WG would be
most interested in hearing comments about the way the spec is now
formatted, in addition to comments about the content.

In particular:
   1) How do people feel about having the spec bnroken up
      into multiple files? The WG acknowledges that the lack
      of contextual clues and next/previous/up buttons hinders
      usage. These will be added if people prefer multiple small
      pages.
   2) How do people feel about having the spec formatted as a book
      made up of multiple sub-specs? WOuld it be better to treat it
      as a single specification?
