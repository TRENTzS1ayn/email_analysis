greetings:
i'm trying to figure out what the paragraphs in the discussion of
"attribute" under "Attribute value" mean. in particular, to reconcile
the discussion re lists of interspersed text and entity values with the
declared returned value type of "node".

A. legibility
1. a table of contents within the section whould help the reader to
determine whether (or not) the respective declarations were present here
or elsewhere
2. links (for example on entity reference) would do the same.
3. in my search i observe that the reference from toc-19980318.html to
section 4 is missing the .html extension

B. semantics
1. i did find the defnition for entity reference in 3.5. i didn't find
it in the html level 1 description.
i had presumed entities to be fairly intrisnic to all dom
implementations. i would have expected them to appear in chapter 2. the
distinction surprises me.
2. how does the definition of node permit attribute.value to return such
an instance for both text nodes and  collections of text and entity
references?

bye,
