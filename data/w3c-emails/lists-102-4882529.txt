Hello!


Are you aware of IDL's syntax wrt indentifiers and case sensitivity?
It is not allowed to use an identifier twice with the same name and
just different casing. So this is wrong:

interface DocumentContext {
  attribute Documentdocument;
            ^^^^^^^^    ^^^^^^^^
};

and this:

Node setNode(in wstring name, in Node node);
                                 ^^^^ ^^^^

omniidl2 (the stub compiler from omniORB2), fails to compile this.

Also I have had problems using IDL syntax words as identifiers,
so Attribute may not be a good name for an interface.
omniidl2 seems to compile it without problems though.


Cheers
