Then we still don't get that length field etc. I vote for 2 typedefs
domchar and domstring (perhaps other names but...)

Arrrgh! Is this supposed to be a standard or just Yet Another
Non-Standard (tm)!? The advantage of defining APIs in IDL,
is that it it possible to grap any stub compiler for
generating an API in any programming language. Then you
just use CORBA to use, say a C++ implementation of DOM
from Smalltalk or whatever. I'm still waiting for an
IDL->SML97 mapping, so that I can use a C++ implementation
of DOM from SML97, but that's another story...

I think it is very unattractive to use a Java API which
"more or less" maps to the DOM IDL files.

Dot y'all agree with this?
