Hello everyone,

i just startet with the 'latest' version of DOM
http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/WD-DOM-19980416/DOM.tgz 
(according to the w3c website).

I can't believe that anyone ever used that. That's
not even valid java source code (at least not for a 
sun compiler). If the spec. is
of the same quality I better forget about the whole
DOM and knit something for myself...

Bye,
Axel Zeilner
(az@cri.de)

P.S.: By the way w3c should delete the 'version 1.0'
in the Header of the page http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-DOM/
or change it to 0.1 (or was that a typo, too)
