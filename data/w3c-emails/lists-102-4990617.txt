It would seem to be that either a) one is calling a DOM function via
CORBA,and the ORB will handle the marshalling/translation .. or b) one is
calling DOM from the same platform, so whatever wstring maps to on that
platform is the same on both the calling side and the DOM implementation
side.  So I don't see that this is a problem, but maybe I'm missing something.
