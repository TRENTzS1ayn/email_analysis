As I see it, you will only be converting text when reading input
from somewhere (an XML-file or whatever) and building a DOM
hierachy. You might need this conversion anyway, depending
on the file format etc. Then there's a conversion when rendering
text output from a DOM hierachy, but that might still be
necessay, depending on how / where it is rendered.

If at least the DOM spec. is consitent, you have rules to
follow.
