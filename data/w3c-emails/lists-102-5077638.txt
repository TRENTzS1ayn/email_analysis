I have a question about what should be contained in a tree iterator.
Originally I thought it should contain all the named nodes, but not the
attributes, but now on a rereading of the spec I am not so sure as attribute
values are described as child nodes of attributes.

Any way can anyone please tell me which is the correct (preferred)
interpretation in the following document.

In the document
<xdoc>
    <!--a simple document-->
    <greeting manner="cordial">Hello <emphasis>W3C</emphasis> DOM</greeting>
</xdoc>

Would a tree iterator based on xdoc just contain:

    1. Just the elements

        xdoc[0],greeting[1],emphasis[2]

    2. The six named nodes i.e (I believe the preferred interpretation)

        element(xdoc)[0], comment[1],element(greeting)[2],
attribute(manner)[3], text(Hello)[4], element(emphasis)[5], text(W3C)[6],
text(DOM)[7],

    3. The six named nodes plus the value node i.e.

        element(xdoc)[0], comment[1],element(greeting)[2],
attribute(manner)[3], attributevalue(cordial)[4], text(Hello)[5],
element(emphasis)[6], text(W3C)[7], text(DOM)[8],

  The correct interpretation obviously has a profound  effect on the
indexing of the vector contents!

TIA,
Frank

P.S. I was not able to find any archives of this list, so if this issue has
already been discussed I apologize.
