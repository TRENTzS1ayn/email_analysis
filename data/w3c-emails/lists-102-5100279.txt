There will be a new draft of the DOM Level 1 specification out soon, 
so please hold your questions and comments until it's out. We've 
actually changed the specification quite a lot, and will welcome 
your comments on it as soon as it's published.

We're also making sure that the Java and IDL compiles.

thanks,



Lauren
