Hello Jerome Thirion,

SGML is a language to write structured documents

DOM may be used to build up the structure of a document
in program memory as an object tree. 

As XML is a "subset" of SGML one may answer your question 
"yes, but". The difficult part arises where you try to use any
SGML features which are missing in XML. But as far as i know
you will meet these problems only if you try to generate a
SGML document out of the DOM representation  instead
of an XML document.
