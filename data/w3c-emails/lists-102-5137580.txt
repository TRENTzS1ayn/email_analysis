The latest Level 1 DOM specification has just been released, at
http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-DOM/.

There have been significant changes since the last public draft. Amongst
others:
There is no separate XML document; all the XML interfaces are in the Core
document.
We took the DTD stuff out, pending work on schemas in a future version of
XML (what we had will shortly be released as a separate WD).
We took out NodeIterator.
The Java and OMG IDL bindings now validate.

The DOM WG thinks the DOM specification is nearly finished and almost ready
to go to PR. The remaining issues are mostly listed in the spec, so
feedback on these (to this mailing list) would be welcome.

regards,

Lauren Wood, Chair, W3C DOM WG
