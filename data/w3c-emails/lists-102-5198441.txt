I remember reading a while ago that Microsoft would be releasing
a MIDL compatible IDL file for implementing the DOM in COM.

Can anyone at Microsoft comment on this? It may well be that the
recent IE5 preview (in which I believe MSXML is close to DOM compliance)
contains something useable, but I imagine it will be mixed up with
the implementation class definitions and other stuff. In any event,
I'm not going to download the preview just to find out.

On a more general note, is this something which the WG is interested
in maintaining? In theory, COM is platform independent, although I
know this doesn't mean too much in practice. At the moment, the MS
COM implementation is closely tied to IE4/IE5 which makes it
questionable
to write to as a standard. I'd like to see the WG publish the MIDL
definitions along with OMG and Java.

Anyway, I've written a little Omnimark LE script to convert the OMG
IDL bindings into MIDL compatible stuff, based on IDispatch. If anyone
is interested in it, let me know. I'm particularly interested to get
some feedback on how the interface looks from VB as I just know C++.
I'm also interested to know if tools to do this from OMG already exist.

Finally, is the WG SGML/XML source available for the interface
definitions??

Sorry if this is slightly off topic, and thanks for listening...
