The latest spec has a 'delete' member function on the Data
interface. This clashes with the C++ delete operator (and
presumably the Java delete too). I don't know if this is
strictly legal but MSVC++ definitely doesn't like it...

Any chance we can change the name to 'remove', the semantics
might actually be slightly better?

Thanks, Alfie.
