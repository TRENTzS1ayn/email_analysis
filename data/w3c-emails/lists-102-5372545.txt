Frank,

Document.createXXX() methods do not insert the created objects into the
tree.

I am afraid your second question looks to me like an aftermath of too many
insertBefore and appendChild.  what are greeting[1] and text[1]?
appendChild takes a Node argument and not a string.  Could you try again?

Best wishes,

Don Park
