>>appendChild takes a Node argument and not a string.  Could you try again

Sure. Basically what I am asking is  , once you've created an object how do
you insert it into the tree.

I start with:

<xdoc>
<greeting>Hello XML</greeting>
</xdoc>

I want to end up with

<xdoc>
<greeting>Hello XML</greeting>
<greeting>Hello DOM</greeting>
</xdoc>

I create an element greeting with

        document.createElement(greeting)

I create a text node with

        document.createTextNode("Hello DOM")

How do I insert them into my document tree? by append child? by
insertBefore?

If I use append child, how do I reference them, because as you say they are
not inserted into the tree therefore cannot be referenced by a nodeList
integer.
