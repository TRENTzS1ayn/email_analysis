Hello, 

I'm now trying to design a DOM builder. 
But I have one problem with the attribute value default declaration,
"#IMPLIED".

For example, some XML document is described like following:

---in a DTD----
 :
<!ELEMENT elem EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST elem attr CDATA #IMPLIED>
 :

---in a content ---
:
<elem />
:

What kind of DOM object should be created for the "elem" element?

 1) "elem" element object including "attr" attribute object
 2) "elem" element object including no attribute object

If 1) is created, an application can easily understand a existance of 
"IMPLIED" attribute. On the other hand, if 2) is created, an application
need to check a DTD object to know whether any "IMPLIED" attribute is 
specified or not.

Thanks in advance.

Best regards.
