I cannot compile the IDL files I downloaded from w3.org.. I am using
VisiBroker for Java 3.2, and also tried VisiBroker for C++ 3.2.. I get
the following:

C:\Download\XML\DOMIDL>idl2java org-w3c-dom.idl
wstring.idl: 0: Encountered "wstring" at column 34.
Was expecting:
    <ID> ...

DocumentFragment.idl:1: The scoped name "Document" does not correspond
to a type

Document.idl:3: The scoped name "Element" does not correspond to a type
Document.idl:4: The scoped name "Element" does not correspond to a type
Document.idl:6: The scoped name "Text" does not correspond to a type
Document.idl:7: The scoped name "Comment" does not correspond to a type
Document.idl:11: The scoped name "Attribute" does not correspond to a
type
Document.idl:12: The scoped name "Entity" does not correspond to a type
Element.idl:7: The scoped name "Attribute" does not correspond to a type
Element.idl:8: The scoped name "Attribute" does not correspond to a type

Encountered 13 errors and 0 warnings.

Any ideas/help?
