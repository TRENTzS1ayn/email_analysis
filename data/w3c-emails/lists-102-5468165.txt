I have some further rather simplistic questions, which I think I know the
answers to but as I am writing about it I want to be sure I have the
correct answer!!

For the entity attribute it is not clear absolutley clear to me what
notationName  or systemID is meant to return.

if the XML document contains the entity reference &dom;

If the DTD contained the entity declaration:

<!ENTITY  dom  "Document Object Model">

would the method:

var x=dom.notationName

assign to the varible x  the string

"Document Object Model"

or the string 

"dom"

Similarly if the DTD contained the entity declaration:

<!ENTITY  dom  SYSTEM "XMLtutorial.txt">
would the method:

var x=dom.systemID

 assign to the varible x  the string

"XMLtutorial.txt"

or would it assign the contents of the file XMLtutorial.

TIA, 
Frank
