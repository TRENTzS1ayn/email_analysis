I don't see how getElementsByTagName could _possibly_ return a ``live''
NodeList unless one of the following two conditions is true:

  1. it only returns immediate children of the given node, AND the indices
     of those children in the NodeList returned are the same as their
     indices in the parent node, i.e. there are some indices that contain
     nulls. 

OR

  2. Elements found by getElementsByTagName are _ripped out_ of their
     original places in tree, and made into the children of a single,
     possibly orphan, Node.
