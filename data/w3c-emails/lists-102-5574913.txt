Fellas,

This confusion stems from the movement of words between different versions
of the spec.  If you read the latest spec more carefully, you will see that
the word "live" is used only in the description of the attribute
"childNodes".  This means that the NodeList itself is not always live and
that the NodeList returned by getElementsByTagName is not live.  Only the
NodeList returned by getChildNodes is "live".

Does this help?
