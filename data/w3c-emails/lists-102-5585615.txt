Yes.  It matches our interpretation of the spec two versions ago, and and is
trivial (though not particularly efficient) to implement.  Somehow, in the
transition betweem versions, the wording drifted to the point where it could
be interpreted with unintended broadness.  

There was a lot less inefficiency in the implementation when there were
iterators; each implementation of the NodeList interface could return the
most appropriate implementation of Iterator.  I hope they return soon.
