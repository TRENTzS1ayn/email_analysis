You and Don Park need to get together on what ``liveness'' means, and when
it's required by the spec.

This means that every call on item() involves a complete traversal of half
the tree (on average) to make sure that a new node of the type selected by
getElementsByTagName hasn't snuck in behind your back.  In the case of large
documents, possibly containing references to external parsed entities, this
could take a *very long time*.

I think this suggests that the spec is ambiguous, and should be rewritten to
clarify the situation, preferably in the direction of Don Park's commonsense
interpretation.
