Re the DOM finding wider use than you might expect: Absolutely. It's a good
design, and some of the proposed applications I've heard suggested for it
both with and without XML/XSL are pretty darned huge. If you don't allow
for this, a representation that _does_ is likely to take over relatively
quickly.

Plan for scalability, whenever possible. In today's climate, it doesn't
succeed big it won't succeed at all.
