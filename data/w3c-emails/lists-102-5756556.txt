All I can say is that your point of view is very well represented in the DOM
WG and IG.

I am a proponent of server-side DOM as well but it is my assessment that
client-side DOM is and will continue to be the most hyped use of the DOM
API.  Netscape and Microsoft has a chance to unify the their respective
browser's document model in Navigator 5.0 and IE 5.0.  It makes a lot of
sense not to lose sight of the potential benefits to the entire Net
community if this happens.

It will take a lot of time and frustration for the server-side DOM vendors
to pull together to scream together in harmony.  Just give it time.
Meanwhile, we will have to make do with implementation specific concurrency
control.  If you do not want to wait, gather some people and companies with
similar interest and start writing down the server-side DOM requirements.

That is my understanding.
