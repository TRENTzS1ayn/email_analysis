Documents are either frozen (piecewise static) or are in production (flux).

How concious should we be of multi-user at this point?

Remember Memex: we'd weave a document collection through dozens of encoded
resources from different sources.

When my time comes to 'reproduce a trail' for someone else to load into
their memory then the document model had best be able to determine which
types of links allow replication, and which links do not.

Or are we working from the 'universe is one big document and there is no
need for replication' model.


If we can accept that there will be 'rights holders' to the document
collection, and we can accept that access license is not equivalent to
reproduction license, then the document repository will have different
interpretations of a given document based upon the rights that have been
negotiated by the
specific consumer.

Or am I jumping ahead to inter document linkages which we'll tackle after we
have a common document model.

Yours in spirit
