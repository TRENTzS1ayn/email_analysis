My point is that there is more than one kind of application.  Applications
that _consume_ XML files do not need to "see" entity references.  However,
applications that _produce_ or _edit_ XML files _must_ be able to manipulate
entity references directly.  The failure to make this distinction in the
specification is a serious problem, because it means that an XML editor, for
example, cannot possibly conform to the specification!

What's even worse, an XML editor cannot make use of an XML parser or DOM
class library that conforms to the specification (unless I have seriously
misread something).  I think that this fact should be sufficient to prove
that the specification is inadequate.
