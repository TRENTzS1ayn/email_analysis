The are some on the committee who agree with you 100% on this one; and
others who equally can't see why we want next/previous at all, because they
think that index-based lookups and navigation are much more natural to the
user... so we ended up with both methods in effect. (all those
next/previous-walking methods on Node).

Yes, the getElementsByTagName is an exception, but when we do the full
filter/query system (planned for Level 2) we'll also probably have
iterators to hold the results of those, so getElementsByTagName might
become completely superfluous.
