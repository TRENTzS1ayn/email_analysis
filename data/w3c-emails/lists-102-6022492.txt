In the documentation for Element, it is specified that, in the following
example, 
               <elementExample id="demo"> 
                       ... 
               </elementExample> 

getTagName returns "elementExample".  Would the attribute nodeName contain
"demo" in this case?  If that's true, perhaps getTagName should be renamed
something like getElementTag, or nodeName renamed nodeID.  

It would seem essential that the nodeName contain the ID, because that's the
only way you can use NamedNodeMap to represent the ID/NAME namespace, but
it's not really clear in the specification.
