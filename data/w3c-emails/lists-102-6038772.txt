     There are other ways of creating nodes, however: most languages have a
     "new" operator.

It's legitimate to say "That will allocate the space but will not produce a
properly initialized/valid/usable object."


Remember, the DOM _is_ an OO design; objects may be produced only by valid
constructors and factories -- and a given object's public API may have
_only_ factories and not constructors.

But if that's the desired behavior, the spec should make it unmistakable.
