No, nodeName returns elementExample as well.

This only works in the HTML specification, where you can use 
HTMLDocument.getElementById(in wstring elementId); and 
HTMLDocument.getElementsByName(in wstring elementName);

We're planning on doing a filter/query language in Level 2 to give people
that functionality for XML as well; it gets a little more complicated when
an attribute can be called ID but not be of type ID, or be of type ID but
not be called ID.
