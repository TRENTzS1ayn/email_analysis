There seems to be some differences of opinion about whether all NodeLists
are live.  I think this is a matter which can usefully be left unresolved.

If this is really the intent, it should say so.  This merely specifies that
the NodeList returned by getElementsByTagName should be computed lazily in a
context where the document may not be entirely present in memory, and
does _not_ require that it be "live" across all possible modifications to
the document.  The latter is a much stronger requirement, and much harder to
implement.  The former can be ignored completely by an application that
parses the entire document before processing it.
