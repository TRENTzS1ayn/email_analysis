In that case, getTagName is redundant.  I suppose it's in there for
compatibility with some existing scripting language?  In any case, the
situation needs to be clarified.

Doesn't XML have ID as an attribute type as well?  We'll leave aside the

True.  Oh, well; I'll just go ahead and implement AssociativeNodeMap.
