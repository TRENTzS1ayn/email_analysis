In Java and Smalltalk (and, indeed, every OO language I know of except
badly-written C++) "new" produces a properly initialized, valid, useable
object.

Actually, the DOM is a _subset_ of an OO design -- it's a set of
standardized interfaces to a set of classes that, under the hood, can have
other interfaces (even public ones) as well.  Our application simply cannot
be written using only the DOM interfaces as specified; with several tens of
additional classes it could be written but would have at most half the
performance that it would with extended interfaces and more appropriate
behavior.  It is NOT likely to be rewritten in JavaScript.

I don't believe that the spec _should_ include this restriction.  In any
case, the DOM specifies only interfaces; in most languages one can go
``behind the DOM's back'' and go direct to the implementation classes.
Besides, as far as I know one can't specify a constructor in an IDL
interface.
