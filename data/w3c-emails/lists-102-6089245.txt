a XML document is not only flat but its a thin line, a character wide.  DOM
is a projection of that thin line into a two dimensional structure,
specifically a tree.

an iterator over a structure is like cockroach roaming about a house while
an iterator over a result is like a dungbeetle crawling around a manure
truck.  a house is made for living while a truck is not.

i agree that the cockroach and the dungbeetle are two different animal.
