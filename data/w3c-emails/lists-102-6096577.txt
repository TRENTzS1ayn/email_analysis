In Java, you can create an object that has no public constructor, in which
case "new" will simply not be available. That's part of how one enforces
singletons and factories and static-only classes and some of the other
design patterns. (Gods know I've done it accidentally enough times.) This
does require that you not inherit from anything that has a public
constructor, and/or that you override it to private.

Can't vouch for Smalltalk; I can sometimes read the language but have never
written it.
