I think I'll second the confusion. Given that the application processing
the EntityRef  knows what kind of node it's processing, why does the value
need to be attached as an actual Child rather than being available via a
method invocation on the EntityRef itself (which would leave the
implementation relatively unconstrained)?

Again, apologies if this has all been hashed over in the past; feel free to
say "Oh, not that again" and ignore me...

(BTW, in your copious spare time <grin!> it'd be Real Nice to have an
annotated DOM spec -- like the annotated XML spec now available -- where
you could put standard explanations of why particular design decision were
made and other commentary which doesn't really belong in the spec per se.
The answers posted here would probably be a good start on those footnotes.)
