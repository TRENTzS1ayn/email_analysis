Requiring production via the factory methods: Strikes me as perfectly
reasonable design; just make sure this is clearly stated in the spec.
(Probably in the introduction for each of the factory-built objects.)

(If the IDL really can't handle the concept of constructors -- or "self"
factory methods, which comes out to about the same thing -- that suggests
the IDL needs to be fixed.)
