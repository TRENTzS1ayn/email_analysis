The discussion of NodeList being "live", and of exactly what "live" means,
probably belongs in the description of this interface rather than in the
functions that return an instance of it.

NamedNodeMap: I take it that this too is implicitly "live", in the sense
that index numbers may (or may not) be unstable as the contents change. (In
other words, lazy implementation is OK.) Might be worth adding a caveat to
that effect. Typo: "derive the named which the node must be stored under".
