I would like to make a request for a convenience method.  Could
the working group consider adding a getText() method to the Element
interface.  This returns a String containing the character data of the
element and all of it's children.  The MSXML object model classes do this,
and I found it extremely convenient.

ie:  If you have a DOM tree for the text "<P>This is an <EM>example</EM>
of what I mean</P>" calling Element.getText() on the "<P>" element would
return "This is an example of what I mean".

Your consideration is appreciated!

p.s. Much thanks for cloning!
