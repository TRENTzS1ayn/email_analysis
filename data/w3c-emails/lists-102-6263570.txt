Actually the DOM assumes that all characters are converted into 
the Unicode characters before being passed to the DOM, so the 
DOM never sees the character entity references. This should be 
better described (we have a few of these little nits left!)

We've actually decided for this round to dump joinText altogether 
due to precisely these sorts of issues - it will no doubt come back 
in a future Level. You still have normalize which will join all the Text 
nodes in a subtree.
