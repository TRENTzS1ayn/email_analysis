Also: While HTML isn't sensitive to whitespace, XML-based languages _may_
be. The XML spec says which whitespace is guaranteed _not_ to be eliminated
but leaves anything outside of that up to the implementation of the
processors for each individual notation.

So keeping or elminating whitespace isn't really something the DOM should
be involved in. A DOM _implementation_ might mark which whitespace is
potentially ignorable... but that would be an extended feature in support
of whatever tool generated the DOM, and hence is part of that tool's spec,
not the DOM's.
