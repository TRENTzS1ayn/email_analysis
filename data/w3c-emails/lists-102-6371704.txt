I should have noticed this one earlier: The definition of DOMImplementation
doesn't say what "version" represents, or what format it takes.

I assume it's intended to indicate which level(s)/version(s) of the DOM
spec for that feature are currently implemented. But it's not at all clear
how level and version are intended to be expressed in this string.

If you really want it to be useful as guidance to an application, or a
user, I think it needs to be nailed down more tightly. Otherwise folks
won't know how to phrase a query in such a way that they can trust the
answer.

(I'd also suggest that, if my interpretation is correct, you might want
separate parameters version-of-the-spec and level-of-the-implementation...)
