I presume you mean your page contains Javascript code...? As far as the DOM
is concerned, that's just going to be a block of text. The application
(browser or whatever) would be responsible for any interpretation,
execution, and/or storage of Javascript -- either by overloading the DOM or
by maintaining data structures alongside it.

> <img name="foo" src="foo.jpg">

I haven't looked at the HTML support, but I think it's the same answer:
The DOM itself stores this as an Element with Name and Src attributes. Any
additional info is the application's responsibility.
