I was wondering if someone could comment on the relationship of the
current DOM API and the XPointer spec.

I was sort of expecting that the DOM, in particular its ECMA script
bindings, would include accessor methods like 
an_element.child(2, "foo"), etc.

Was this not done because A) not enough time B) it doesn't belong in
level 1 C) the XPointer api sucks D) the XPointer api is expected to
change E) other?

Thanks
ted
