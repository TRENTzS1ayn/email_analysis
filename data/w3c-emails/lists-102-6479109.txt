Following restrictions are inplace for Level 1 of the DOM API:

1. DocumentFragment exists within the context of the Document which created
it.

2. ownerDocument attribute never changes.

3. DocumentFragment can not be used as a template because nodes will be
'moved' to the destination.  Think of it as a 'laundry line' or a
'clipboard' for now.

4. Level 1 does not allow any movement of nodes between documents as well as
implementations.

Is this clear enough?
