Totally clear; what it means is that DOM Level 1 in its present form is
totally useless for anything but client-side scripting.  It has been made
abundantly clear that client-side scripting is its only purpose, but it's
very unfortunate nonetheless.

Since I'm implementing a document processor, not an ECMAscript interpretor,
the present DOM is of little interest to me at this point.  What I'm going
to do is continue implementing a version of the DOM API with all the
interfaces but without the semantic restrictions, and hope that they get
lifted in Level 2.

In the mean time, there's no hope of getting a useable DOM library from a
third party in the near future (not that I needed one), of interoperating
with anyone else's DOM implementation, or of using a DOM implementation as a
portability vehicle.  Oh, well.
