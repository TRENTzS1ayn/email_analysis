Well, that is the bad news.  The good news is that Level 1 will arrive
sooner than it would have if we tried to address everything in Level 1.
Frankly, I am as frustrated as you are and hope to do my best to make sure
all the shortcomings are met in Level 2 and 3.

My understanding is that they will be either removed or loosened.

<hype>
Docuverse DOM Server will solve that problem and many more when it is
released and  I am sure there will be other DOM providers with similar
capabilities.
