On the DOM Activity page, at http://www.w3.org/DOM/Activity, you will find
the statement
"Level two will include a style sheet object model, and define
functionality for manipulating the style information attached to a
document. It will also allow rich queries of the document and define some
event model. "

So yes, we are planning on adding this to the DOM in the future.
