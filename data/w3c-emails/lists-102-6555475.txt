Is this code LGPL'ed? If so, we might join forces. I'm implementing
DOM in C++ for the Berlin project:

http://www.berlin-consortium.org/

It can be compiled so that it can be used both with and without
CORBA. Others outside the Berlin project are interested in
the code too.

I have finally read the new 0720 spec. and all the 100+ emails on
this list, so now I can start working on it again. In a few days
I expect to release some new code.


Cheers
