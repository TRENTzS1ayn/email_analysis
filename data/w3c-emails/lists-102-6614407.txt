That's what the language mappings for IDL are for. There are already
mappings for C, C++, Java, Smalltalk and others. Using enum is a kind
of typesafety, which should be used if at all possible. The IDL
language mappings takes care of using them whenever possible.

This might be a problem with enums - I agree. But since your unsigned
shorts are defined in Node, you are still in trouble. You have to change
the implementation of Node to add constants later and if that is an
option, it can be done for enums too.

So in short: There are no real arguments against enums right?
