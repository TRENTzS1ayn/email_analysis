Everything will be as you described because anything else just does  not
make any sense.  DataChannel's DXP started out with my Free-DOM/SAXDOM which
had my own rendition of org.w3c.dom package (there wasn't any Java binding
files at the time) which is out of sync with the current version of
Free-DOM.  All this will be sorted out once we go REC.

I would like to suggest that, for REC, we provide binary-only JAR and ZIP
files along with the current source and binary ZIP.
