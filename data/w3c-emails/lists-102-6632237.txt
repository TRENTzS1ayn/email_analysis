Not really.  It's one thing to extend an interface by adding new
elements; that's routine.  But an enum is a class, without the
feature of extensibility.  (At least not in C--; in Java, enums
are usually implemented as ints anyhow.  One could create a special
class with just N pre-constructed elements and access them through
static variables.)
