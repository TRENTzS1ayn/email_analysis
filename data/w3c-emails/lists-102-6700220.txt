Tom,

I can see that replaceChild and appendChild needs to throw
NO_CHILDREN_ALLOWED_ERR but I don't see why removeChild needs to throw it?

BTW, the latest spec (not public yet) documents insertBefore, appendChild,
and replaceChild as throwing HIERARCHY_REQUEST_ERR instead of
NO_CHILDREN_ALLOWED_ERR.
