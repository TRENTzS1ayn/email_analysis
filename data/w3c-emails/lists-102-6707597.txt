Don,

I would have thought that NO_CHILDREN_ALLOWED_ERR (or HIERARCHY_REQUEST_ERR)
is more precise that the presumably alternate NOT_CHILD_ERR and may be more
useful in some cases.  As an aside, if one were building an editor, it may
also be useful to have an accessor that determines whether or not children
are allowed, so that the UI can adjust itself according to a node's "child
bearing" capabilities.

Just a thought...
