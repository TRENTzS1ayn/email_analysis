Sounds good. I'll start making up a list.

This would be fine as long as the "xxx DOM" package can selectively
deprecate or at least not implement certain core DOM features such
as Node.previous/nextSibling, etc. that hinder the use of that package
and still be "conforming". Also, these new "packages" should not at
all be required to be saddled with stuff just because Microsoft,
Netscape, et al have some customers with old scripts that can't be
rewritten. Most of the server-side and editing use of the DOM are
relatively new and probably don't depend on the more byzantine
parts of the DOM and could instead use (or already use) things
like iterators, etc. It is really sad that NodeIterator never
made the cut for DOM Level 1.

Ok, as long as there is a clearly defined path that vendors
can follow who selectively implement or extend parts of the DOM.
For example Document.open/write/close should be clearly labeled a client
side scripting interface and a server-DOM can choose to
not implement these and still be fully compliant within the
definition of a "server DOM". A server implementation would most likely
have its own Document factories, parsers, and renderers that
are external to the DOM itself. There may be cases where you
need a HTML3.2 parser, an XML1.0 parser, and a loose HTML4.0
parser that can all be used to generate DOM trees. These engines
may use any conforming DOM implementation, even remote ones
(eg via CORBA).
Document.write() is kind of silly for this.

Maybe some of these methods/attributes could be eventually lifted out
of Level 1 and plopped in a seperate package ie org.w3.dom.scripting
that contains things like ScriptNode, ScriptDocument, etc. To have
things like this in the core is really kind of messy. I suppose
its a little late though...

Sounds good. You're right about the lack of support for informal
specs like SAX from the big vendors. The backing of W3C is definitely
needed.
So, anybody who's interested in alternative DOM uses speak up!
