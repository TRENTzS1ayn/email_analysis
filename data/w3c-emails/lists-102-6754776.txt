A few things that I can think of now is:

1) Threadsafing/concurrency.
2) Update notifications (events when the DOM-tree/text changes)
3) Lazy text-loading.

If 1) is supported, it will allow multiple users possibly on
multiple computers to logon to the same document. All users
can edit the document at the same time. If 2) is also
supported, all users can see realtime updating text being
edited multiple places at the same time ("ghost-cursors"?).

I belive 3) is possible with the current interfaces. A
text-file can be read/parsed, and a DOM-tree can be
built as needed. I just thought that it would be a good
thing to keep this in mind.
