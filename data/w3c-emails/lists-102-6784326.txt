Yes! Clearly defined behaviour when used in a multithreaded
environment is a must.

>2) Update notifications (events when the DOM-tree/text changes)

The observer pattern is perfect for this. It should be
possible for an observer to register itself with a
document (or a node) to get change notifications. Node
collections (ie NodeList) should have been defined this way
so that 'liveness' is explicit (since it is not always
needed).

I would like to add a request to deprecate or at least
make optional the Node.next/previousSibling attributes.
These appear to be archaic scripting artifacts and
should be replaced with the use of iterators.
