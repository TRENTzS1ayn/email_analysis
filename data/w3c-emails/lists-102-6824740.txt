Actually, Text (and for that matter CData) can contain any characters
whatsoever.  It just happens that when you *write out* a Text or CData
object you need to canonicalize it, and in different ways.  This is not
something that the current DOM has specific interfaces for.

This is a consequence of the fact that Text objects contain character
data, not markup.

Only if your writeOut method is unacceptably naive.  The writeOut method for
Text-not-CData objects should emit "<" as "&lt;" and "&" as "&amp;", and the
writeOut method for CData should emit "]]>" as "]]&gt;".

The only thing that can "break the document" is an attempt to insert
characters that aren't Chars by the XML rules; i.e. non-Unicode values.
