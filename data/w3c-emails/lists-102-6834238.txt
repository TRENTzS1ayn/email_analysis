Actually, I believe that it is Text-not-CData that needs to emit "]]>" as
"]]&gt;" (see [14] in the XML spec, as referenced by [43]).

CData needs to replace "]]>" with something like "]]]]><![CDATA[>" because CDATA
sections cannot nest.  Breaking up the section seems to be the only way to
preserve the characters, since &gt; would not be interpreted inside the CDATA
section (see section 2.7).
