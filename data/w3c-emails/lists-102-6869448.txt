| Are there plans for a standard query/filter language based on the DOM?
| Has anyone implemented one?

XPointer is AFAIK the closest you can get at the moment, and there are
several DOM-based implementations. See

One thing that would be nice to have would be a query/filter language
based on CSS2 syntax. That would be more or less ideal since it would
give us the things that are likely to be the most used, with a nice
concise syntax and special features for HTML.
