The DOM spec discusses what to do with default Attributes in terms of
overwriting them and restoring them. It mentions that defaults come from
declarations of the attributes.

It doesn't say whether, or where, the DOM stores those declarations. The
Extended Interfaces architect storage for entities and notations, but not
for the rest of the XML DTD.

Should I take it that this was made the implementation's responsibility, or
deferred to Level 2?
