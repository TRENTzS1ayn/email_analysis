Not to worry.  There are no such things as "character entities" in XML.
There are "character references", the "&#nnnn" and "&#xnnnn" things,
but there are no "character entities" that they refer to.

What the above quotation from the DOM WD presumably means is that
references to "lt", "gt", "quot", "apos", and "amp" need not be
treated as Entity objects, but can be incorporated in Text nodes.
Likewise with character references, since they are not references
to entities.

So it's only references to declared parsed entities (and only
internal entities at that, if the reference is still to Attribute
nodes).
