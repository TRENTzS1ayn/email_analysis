Claude, I'd still like to understand why removing get-next and get-previous
from the server-dom spec would be a good thing. What harm are they doing if
you don't use 'em? On a server, I presume your concern isn't code size.

It could be performance, but... reading between the lines, I'd suspect that
concern could be addressed by doing a bit of per-session caching of which
node you last accessed. Not perfectly, but to about the same degree that
caching data makes NodeList's "liveness" managable.
