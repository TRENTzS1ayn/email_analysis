Because they preclude or make difficult the mixing of implementations
and node sharing. Iterators are just a better solution and don't
preclude any future changes in this direction. It would be fine if
I could just count on myself not using them but I can't govern what
a remote client may expect from a supposedly compliant DOM.
I realize now I'm just going against the majority opinion now, but
it just seems kind of short-sighted to completely dismiss using
the DOM in a heterogenous distributed environment...
The document trees on my server are not just used by a single
server application but by clients, other servers, and various other engines.

I'm not really that concerned with the performance issues, since they
can be solved, but I am concerned with the parts of the DOM that
could potentially limit its use and/or expansion in the future.

Maybe Don Park is right and the DOM is not a good place to start
but there is no other public standard that comes as close.
