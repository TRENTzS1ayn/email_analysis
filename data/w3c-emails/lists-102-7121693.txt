I have some question about the DOM Level 1 specification W3C Proposed
Recommendation.

At 4th paragraph of expranation of Interface Entity;
  The structure of the child list is exactly the same as the structure
  of the child list for an EntityReference with the same nodeName value. 

If only Entites have expanded contents, and EntityReferences are omitted
its contents, Is it illegal for this spec?
