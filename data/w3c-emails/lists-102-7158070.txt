The _idea_ of sharing nodes between implementations is pleasant. The
thought of what could be involved in implementing it properly makes me
worry about whether it belongs in the DOM or in a higher-level
architecture.

External entities: Strikes me as the right answer for multiple-source
documents.
Among other things, since applications are explicitly permitted to decline
to expand the entity (if not validating), or lazily expand it,  partially
masks the challenge of implementing getElementsByTagName() across this
boundary. Not completely, though.
