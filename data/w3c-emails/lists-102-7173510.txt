Actually, the last version of the spec said something about newly created
nodes being implicitly the child of a DocumentFragment _somewhere_ off in
space, which presumably would in turn belong to a specific document. I had
implemented that by creating a "nullDocumentFragment" object which caught
anything that didn't have any other obvious parent.

ownerDocument is definitely a cleaner architecture.
