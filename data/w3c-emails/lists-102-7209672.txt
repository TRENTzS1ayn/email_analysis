I'm confused. I thought we left it at "All NodeLists and NamedNodeMaps
_are_ live accessors."

The PR is unfortunately no more clear than the WD was in this regard. Some
instances of NodeList carry words saying that they're live. Others don't,
but do not say that they _aren't_ required to be. And the description of
NodeList itself doesn't even mention the issue.

I'm somewhat disappointed by this, and I hope it's going to be fixed soon.
The fact that we're still disagreeing and/or confused is more than
sufficient indication that the document is not yet clear enough.
