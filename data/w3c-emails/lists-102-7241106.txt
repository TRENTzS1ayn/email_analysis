What do you mean by EntityReferences omitting its contents?  If
EntityReference occurs in the document and there is an Entity with matching
name, Entity contents are mirrored in EntityReference.  If an implementation
decides to expand entities, it will replace entity references with expanded
contents of entities.  Depth of expansion is left entirely up to the
implementation.
