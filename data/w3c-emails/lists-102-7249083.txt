Hi!


There are still a few bugs in the 980818 spec. that you forgot to fix:

1) wstring: Do NOT use this name! It is already a reserved IDL word.
Your
DOM-spec even says so:

>Note: As of August 1998, the OMG IDL specification included a wstring type.
>However, that definition did not meet the interoperability criteria of the
>DOM API since it relied on encoding negotiation to decide the width of a
>character.

2) Attribute: Do NOT use this name as an interface! It is also a
reserved IDL-word.

3) Why do you still have NodeType as const unsigned short instead of an
   enum? You have ExceptionCode as enum...


Cheers
