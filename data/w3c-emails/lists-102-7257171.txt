If any EntityReferences have copy of expanded entity, it is too expensive.
If the EntityReferences which have same entity name refer only one expanded
entity, then traversing tree to lower level than EntityReference and traversing
to upper level than EntityReference will not be compatible.

I want to implement Entity and EntityReference as "Entity has expanded entity
as its children and EntityReference dosen't have children only have entity name".

Is this way illegal?
