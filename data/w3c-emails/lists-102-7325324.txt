It's getLength() now... I didn't bring this up because the question was
specifically about NamedNodeMap, where length will probably be easier to
calculate than the NodeList. But given that NodeList wants to be able to
avoid calling getLength(), it makes sense for NamedNodeMap to be consistant
with that design and permit the same coding style.

Further, deponent saith not.
