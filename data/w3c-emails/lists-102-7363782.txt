Wrong or not, do it better than the implementors of streams in 
terms of aesthetics and fault tolerance.

Out of memory is very often first detected by Operating System, 
should be handled by Implementation Language, is (not?) handled 
by tools/libraries/packages and the implementation? DOM should 
tell the implementation what to do so the application developer can 
rely on a well known mechanism. 
My vote for "Raise a out of memory Exception".
