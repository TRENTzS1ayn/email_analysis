Count me in!

I think that we can go a long way with this if we start by simply flagging
those portions of the spec (almost all, I think, semantic restrictions
rather than the actual interfaces) that don't work for our purposes.  The
two most egregious of these are: "Every node has a parent" and "every
NodeList is live".
