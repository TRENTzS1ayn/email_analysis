To current Free-DOM users:

It turns out that FreeDOM is a trademark of Siaware Inc.
(http://www.thepattern.com/freedom) so Free-DOM has been renamed and
repackaged as Docuverse DOM SDK
(http://www.docuverse.com/domsdk/index.html).  I would like to thank Siaware
Inc. for defer the name change until the release of Docuverse DOM SDK.

One important difference between Docuverse DOM SDK and its predecessor is
that the DOM SDK is a commercial product instead of being a freeware.  I
appologize if this change affects your plans.  My only defense is the desire
to improve the product quality and support.

Best,

Don Park
Docuverse
