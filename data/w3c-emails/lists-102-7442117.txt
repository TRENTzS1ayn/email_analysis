Right.  Since Notations are effectively read-only due to the fact that we
don't expose editing operations on the DTD information via the DOM API,
there's no reason for a Factory method.

BTW, the WG just agreed *not* to do much on defining an API for validation
or editing the "DTD" information until the schema situation is clarified;
we're concerned that hard work would be nullified by changes in this
rapidly evolving area.  I don't know what this means in terms of actual
time, but we won't tackle that until Range, Style, Events, and Query
interfaces are defined.
