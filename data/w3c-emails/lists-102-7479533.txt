John,

Perhaps what you are interested in is something like this?

public interface NodeEx extends Node {
    ...
    NodeList getChildNodes(NodeFilter filter);
    ...
}

where NodeFilter is defined as

public interface NodeFilter {
    boolean acceptNode (Node node);
}

This type of node filtering works quiet well and encourages reusability as
well.  In Docuverse DOM SDK, I started with NodeTypeFilter and TagNameFilter
to implement getElementsByTagName and found it so useful that I kept adding
more filters like:

CompoundFilter - for combining multiple filters
AttributeFilter - for finding elements with specific attribute values
IdentityFilter - for finding an element with specific ID
NamespaceFilter - for finding all elements with namespace attributes

[Note that NodeEx and NodeFilter interfaces in the DOM SDK are
'experimental' only and not part of the DOM API.]
