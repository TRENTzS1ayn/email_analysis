Hi!


Just to make sure that all those cool suggestions for DOM Level 2
doesn't disappear into cyberspace, I have created a document
on my homepage. It is a list of all suggestions that I found
on this list.

I have put names of some of the people suggesting each idea
(or at least people interested in the idea) If I have written
something that you don't like to be quoted
for or if I have put the wrong names somewhere - just
let me know...
