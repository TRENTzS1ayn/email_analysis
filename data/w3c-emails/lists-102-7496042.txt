Hi!


I now have a fairly complete C++ implementation of the core
DOM APIs from the 980818 spec. ready here:

http://users.cybercity.dk/~ccc25861/Programming/DOMImplementation.html

Read all about it and download it here - it's LGPL'ed. Note that it is
not yet
in the Berlin CVS repository as mentioned on my homepage.

From now you can track the progress on my homepage...


Cheers
