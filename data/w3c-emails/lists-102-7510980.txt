ANOQ,

Congratz on your C++ DOM implementation.

Actually the sentence reads:

"Cloning any other type of node simply returns a copy of this node. "

There is nothing about "without any data."

When Comment, CDATASection, and Text nodes are cloned, their text contents
are also copied for both deep and shallow cloneNode.  Element.tagName is
also cloned.

I hope this helps,
