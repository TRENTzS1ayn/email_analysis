XML for Java, an XML processor written in Java, has been
updated.  It runs on Java 1.1.x and some samples require Swing
1.0.x.

CHANGES:
  o DOM-19980818 Proposed Recommendation support
  o An experimental implementation of attribute-based namespace
    (WD-xml-names-19980802)
    PI-based namespace was removed.
  o All sample programs were moved to "samples." package and
    stored in xml4jSamples_1_0_9.jar.
  o etc.

I'm sorry that a fatal bug is already found:
  o A parser crashes by PIs with empty data like <?foo?>.
