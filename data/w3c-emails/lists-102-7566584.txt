According to the PR-DOM document (Level-1-19980818/DOM.ps), 
document.write writes to an document on which document.open has been 
used and doing document.open on an existing document clears that 
document.

This doesn't seem to cater for the most common case of 
document.write, to insert customised HTML (e.g. browser specific) 
into a document, in place of the SCRIPT element, as the document 
loads.

(An interesting question arises in trying to formalise this case in 
terms of implied calls to open and to the script fragment, as to 
whether the structure is recursive, i.e. can code introduced by 
document.write include script which in turn replaces itself by a 
recursive call of document.write.  This is not something I have a 
need for at the moment, though.)
