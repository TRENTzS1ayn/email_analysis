If you're expecting folks to follow the NS and IE behaviors, you should
probably hint at those behaviors in the spec, for the benefit of those who
believe the spec rather than existing implementations is the best
description of the Working Group's intent.

If open() really isn't required and serves only to start a new document, it
should probably be renamed from open() to something like reset().
