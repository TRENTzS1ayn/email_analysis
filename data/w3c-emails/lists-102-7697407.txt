Docuverse DOM SDK PR2 does not implement following methods:

HTMLDocument.open
HTMLDocument.close
HTMLDocument.write
HTMLDocument.writeln

HTMLSelectElement.setOptions
HTMLTableElement.setTBodies
HTMLTableRowElement.setCells
HTMLTableSectionElement.setRows

First four methods will be implemented when the HTMLReader and scripting
language support is completed (soon).  Remaining four methods were not be
implemented because they will be deprecated.
