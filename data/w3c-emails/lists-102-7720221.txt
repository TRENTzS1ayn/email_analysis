Tell that to Red Hat and Cygnus!  Charging for the direct use of
software is by no means the only means of making money off it.

How about: faster development time, lower overhead, greatly increased
product liability, increased closeness to the customer, broader
market, and others.  See http://www.opensource.org/for-suits.html .

Of course.  I merely urge the benefits of making it less restrictive.

I don't like the term "free software", possibly due to its association with
"free beer".  See http://www.opensource.org/free-notfree.html .

As for that, I'd rather have the benefits of bug-fixes and support by an evolving
community.  As long as the product is useful, that community isn't going to go out of
business, lose interest, or abandon the users --- they *are* the users.  Consider
things like sendmail and BIND, without which the Internet would come to a screeching
halt.

Absolutely.  I'm all for Don making money.  But he's not going to make money on the
DOM SDK directly; he's said so.  Larry Wall doesn't make money on Perl
(which uses the Artistic License) directly, but he's surely not starving these days.
