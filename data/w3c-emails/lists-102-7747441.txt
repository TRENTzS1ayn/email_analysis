Same here.

A better alternative would be to put this on Document rather than Node:

  Node cloneNode(Node original, boolean deep)

This would have a couple of advantages:

  1. it would keep _all_ the node-creation methods on Document
  2. it would not have to be modified or extended when new node types are
     added.  
  3. there are no problems when the original node's document and the target
     document use totally different implementation classes.
