All nice and dandy except for the weird look code:

Document doc = node.getOwnerDocument();
doc.cloneNode(node, doc);
doc.cloneNode(node, null); // assuming null implies same doc
doc.cloneNode(node, someOtherDoc);

It just does not look as natural as:

Node newNode = oldNode.cloneNode(true, null); // for same doc
Node newNode = oldNode.cloneNode(true, someOtherDoc);
