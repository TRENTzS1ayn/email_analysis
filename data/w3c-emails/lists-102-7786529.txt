On second thought, it should be called something different, like createCopy.

newDoc.createCopy(node, false); // for a shallow copy
newDoc.createCopy(node, true); // for a deep copy

We should keep the existing Node method cloneNode, with no added document
parameter.  That way if you want to add a duplicate node to the same
document you use cloneNode; if you want to creat a copy in another document
you use createCopy. 

newParent.appendChild(newParent.getOwnerDocument().copyNode(oldNode, true));

(as opposed to:
 newParent.appendChild(oldNode.cloneNode(true, newParent.getOwnerDocument()));
 under the other proposal.)

My way looks more natural if you're doing a mixture of node copying and node
creation.  You get the owner document once and perform a series of create
operations. 

Something like this is really essential if you're in a system (like the one
I'm building) which permits different DOM implementations for different
documents.
