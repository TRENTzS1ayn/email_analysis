So Document.createCopy() would become the "xeno-copy" routine we've
discussed in the past, which copies a DOM node "by content" rather than
cloning the actual object? Sounds like a good answer to me; whatever we
call it, that functionality is eventually going to be desired... and since
it has to act as a factory (since you're specifying target document),
making it one of Document's methods sounds reasonable.

Normal cloneNode() would continue to be defined on Node itself.

We'd still have to decide whether Document.cloneNode() should be
reinterpreted as "Create a new document and createCopy() of the old
document's contents" or simply be disabled.
