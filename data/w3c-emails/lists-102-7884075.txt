In cases where the "transfer" requires creating new objects (ie, when
copying content between implementations), this doubles the heap churn. I'd
suggest instead that there be a Move option as well as Copy (or rename Copy
and make this a boolean parameter), which could then recognize same-class
as a special case and optimize appropriately.
