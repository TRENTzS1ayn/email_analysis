I think we are digging too deep for Level 1.  Before we hit the gas pipe
(wrecked REC), I think we should wrap this up ASAP with minimum change to
the existing spec.

Let us avoid stray into other issues.  Should Document.cloneNode() work in
Level 1?  I say, YES!  If the naive implementation has problem then it is
not fully Level 1 compliant.
