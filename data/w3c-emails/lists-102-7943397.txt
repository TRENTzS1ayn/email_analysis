John Cowan asks:
>Am I missing something?

No, you've accurately described what has to be done in order to deep-clone
a Document.
     "For each Node, invoke the proper createXXX factory method on the new
      Document and copy all the (IDL) attributes: then insert it into place
      in the new tree"
That's a significant amount of additional code which in Level 1 would exist
_only_ to support Document.cloneNode(). It could be argued that, given
Level 1's decision not to handle the more general uses of this logic,
implementing it for this one specific case is less reasonable than
declining to support cloning of Documents would be.
