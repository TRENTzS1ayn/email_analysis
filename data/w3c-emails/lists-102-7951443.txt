> Should Document.cloneNode() work in Level 1?  I say, YES!

I'm happy either way; Level 2's going to need this code anyway... If the
answer is "yes", I think it's worth adding a comment in the spec to remind
the reader that cloning a Document does require special processing, to
readjust ownerDocument if nothing else.
