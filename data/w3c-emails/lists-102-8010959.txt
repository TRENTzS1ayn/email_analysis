I _think_ we've been sticking to public topics...

I don't want to post general questions of "what's the intended reading of
the PR" into the IG mailing list, both because I don't want to tie up the
IG's time with things that have a known answer <smile>, and because I
figure that if I'm confused other folks may also want to see the answer. If
that causes more trouble than it solves, let me know...
