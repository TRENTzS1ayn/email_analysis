Joe,

Because there is no way to set a default attribute, I have implemented
createAttribute to returned with an Attribute whose specified value is true.
Although adding 'specified' parameter to createAttribute might be useful for
Level 2 when DTD support is fleshed out, I would prefer to add
createDefaultAttribute method in Level 2 than having to worry about default
attributes being set via setAttributeNode().  If you set default attribute
for one element instance, it will have to be reflected in all other
instances of that element as well.  It feels a bit hairy, don't you think?
