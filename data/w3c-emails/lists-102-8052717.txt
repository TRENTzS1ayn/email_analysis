To: DOM List<www-dom@w3.org>

1. (editorial) HEAD is said to be represented by a simple HTMLElement,
but there is also an HTMLHeadElement interface.

2. (editorial) Clause 2.5.2 says that conflicting attribute names are
prefixed with "html", but the HTML CLASS attribute is mapped
to the IDL attribute "className" rather than "htmlClass".

3. (substantive) The meaning of HTMLSelectElement.type and
HTMLTextAreaELement.type is undefined.  Should these return constants
"Select" and "Textarea" respectively?

4. (substantive) HTMLSelectElement.add specifies that a null "before"
argument means add at the head of the list.  This presumably should be
at the *tail* of the list; otherwise, there is no way to perform
this function.

5. (editorial) The BLOCKQUOTE element is represented by both the
HTMLBlockQuoteElement and the HTMLQuoteElement interfaces.  Is this
intentional?  They are the same anyway.

6. (editorial) How is it determined, for the purposes of HTMLDocument.applets(),
which OBJECT elements refer to applets?

7. (substantive) HTMLSelectElement.remove() returns void, contrary to
the naming conventions in clause 1.1.3.

8. (substantive) Certain IDL attributes, namely "cols", "rows",
"width", "size", "value", and "width" have different types in
different interfaces.  This constrains the freedom of implementation:
a single Java class cannot underlie all the interfaces, because
methods of one class cannot differ only in the return types.

The IDL attributes which are *not* of type "wstring" are:

long HTMLLIElement.value
long HTMLPreElement.width
long HTMLSelectElement.size
HTMLCollection HTMLTableElement.rows
HTMLCollection HTMLTableSectionElement.rows
long HTMLTextAreaElement.cols
long HTMLTextAreaElement.rows

If these were renamed or given different types, implementation
would be simplified.
