At the suggestion of Mike Kay, I have enhanced DOMParser to support
SAX Locators and InputSources properly.  Reiterating, DOMParser
conforms to the definition of a SAX parser, but reads from a
DOM Document representing an XML document, rather than from a
textual representation of XML.

A new class called DOMSource, a subclass of InputSource, can now be
used to encapsulate a DOM Document for SAX parsing.  Obviously, SAX
parsers other than DOMParser will be clueless if passed such an
InputSource!

DOMParser also now implements Locator, although it returns no useful
information from it.  However, the non-interface method
DOMParser.getCurrentNode() can be used to determine the current DOM Node
being parsed.
