A standardized DocumentFactory interface would be nice, just something
simple like:

---
package org.w3c.dom;

public interface DocumentFactory {

  public Document makeDocument();

}
---

A standardized factory interface would make it easier for applications to
use multiple, or switch between, DOM implementations.  Each DOM 
implementor could implement this interface, returning a Document from 
their implementation.  Applications which build DOM hierarchies could
take a DocumentFactory as an argument allowing them to be implementation
independant.
