Only if the design tool (editor?) actually expands the EntityReference,
which I suspect it's not likely to do while you're editing.  If I wanted to
see the expansions (perhaps in some kind of preview window), I'd implement
it using some kind of tree traverser that went directly to the Entity rather
than blindly descending into the children of the EntityReference.

It all comes back to the fact that there's no TreeIterator anymore, so
people are trying to make parentNode do all the work of keeping track of
traversal state as well as the underlying structure.  It can't do both
without massive inefficiency.
