Alright, my mistake! I've just learnt that since I'm the "maintainer" of
this list actually I'm the only one to receive these messages. And I'm
supposed to decide to let them go through or not! Too bad I didn't know
that before, I'm afraid many messages were just trashed instead of
properly posted. I'm really sorry about that, I wish our sysadmin people
let me know about this...
Apologies.
