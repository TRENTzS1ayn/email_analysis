Hi!

The first sentence in the description below seems to be wrong, XML is NOT
completely described in the DOM (it is described in the XML Specification).

Appendix B: Glossary (http://www.w3.org/TR/PR-DOM-Level-1/glossary.html)

XML
Extensible Markup Language (XML) is an extremely simple dialect of SGML
which is completely described in this document. The goal is to enable
generic SGML to be served, received, and processed on the Web in the way
that is now possible with HTML. XML has been designed for ease of
implementation and for interoperability with both SGML and HTML. [XML ]
