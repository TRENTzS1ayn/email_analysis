Generally it looks good. I have two concerns:

1. Why isn't NodeType an enum, like ExceptionCode is? I think it should be an
enum, for consistency (and better type checking).
2. The NodeList and NamedNodeMap use unsigned long for the
size and the index accessors. The Java binding uses Vector to implement
NodeList, which uses "int" for size and index. Is there an inconsistency?
