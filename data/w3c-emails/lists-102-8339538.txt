Hi,

Great to see the latest DOM PR!

One small thing: I'm pretty sure OMG IDL defines long as
a signed 32 bit value which should map to the Java 'int'
and not 'long' as it does in the HTML-DOM.

See "Chapter 24-Mapping OMG IDL to JAVA"
<ftp://www.omg.org/pub/docs/formal/98-02-29.pdf>

Also, HTMLCollection.getLength() should really be HTMLCollection.getSize()
to be more consistant with NodeList and NamedNodeMap.


Cheers,
