I'm working a a binding of the DOM to the Tcl language and I
haven't encountered any real problems with the spec so far.
The use of Tcl for scripting DOM documents transcends client or
server issues - at the moment I happen to be using TclDOM on 
the server-side.

Having said that, I'd be happy to participate in your proposed
interest group... I could be missing something ;-)

I think "server-side" is too limiting a term.
"Non-GUI" perhaps? (Though that's worse!).  "Non-browser"?
