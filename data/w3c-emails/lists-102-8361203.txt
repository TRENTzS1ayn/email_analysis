Hi there.

What is the status of the proposed recommendation for the DOM? The most recent
document available on the web site is the August 18th version, which includes a
note saying that the review period expires on September 15th. Since it's now
past that date, I am very interested in finding out what the result of the
review was. Any information you can provide would be very welcome.

Thanks,
Vilya Harvey.
