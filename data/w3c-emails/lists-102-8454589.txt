It _is_ possible to design caches that will withstand multiprocessing...
but I grant that this may be more expensive than it's worth.

Of course, once the iterators and related accessors come in, we can always
tell folks that if they care about performance they should use that
approach rather than getElementsByTagName()... <grin>
