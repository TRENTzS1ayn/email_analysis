I'm currently assuming that cloning a readonly node will yield a copy
_without_ the readonly flag set, since once we take the data out of the
context that caused it to be made readonly there's no need to continue to
protect it. Anyone want to argue for retaining the value of this flag
instead?

(See also last week's wish for a clone operation that would allow
setting/resetting this flag via a parameter.)
