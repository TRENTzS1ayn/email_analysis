Hmm ... well I'd just managed to work out a reasonably
workable adaptive implementation which allowed for
constant time editing so long as no NodeLists were
active; linear time with NodeLists active; and a
technique for 'expiring' unused NodeLists. So, do lots
of editing and I'd have got O(1) behaviour, do lots of
indexed access and I'd have got O(n) behaviour.

This new requirement rules this implementation out :-(

Cheers,


Miles
