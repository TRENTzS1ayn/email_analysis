Very well put, and you're right -- for Level 1, we assumed that DOM users
would need lots of handholding.  It's unfortunate that this causes so much
overhead for those who don't need handholding and don't want to pay the
overhead, but remember that Level 1 was driven mostly by the PRESSING need
to get Netscape and Microsoft to play nicely together.

There has been some sentiment expressed to define a 'server-side DOM' or a
'canonical DOM' or whatever that would be a conformance level that is more
suited to high-performance applications written by expert programmers.  The
idea is basically on hold, partly because there is a W3C effort to define a
'canonical' subset of XML, and it would make sense to tailor the 'canonical
DOM' to that. (For example, *if* that subset of XML does not support
entities, then probably the canonical subset of the DOM should not support
entities). If this idea is important to anyone, lobby for it!
