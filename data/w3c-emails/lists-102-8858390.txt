Look at the IDL->C++ language mapping for CORBA. Try:http://www.omg.org/

There are already stub-compilers to do this mapping.

I have used it to create my C++ implementation of DOM
(not yet complete), which is LGPL'ed:

There is a standard life-cycle interface defined in CORBA. I intendto use
that in my implementation (when the life-cycle code is
ready for omniORB and I get it installed...)

If you want to mix the C++ and Java implementations at runtime, you_really_
want to use CORBA! Then you get network transparency
for free too, and the option to use any other programming-language
later too (as long as there's an ORB written for it, but they are all
mostly freeware and usually come with source-code).
