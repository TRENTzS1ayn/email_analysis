Exactly. Apparently the DOM is really geared towards naive ECMAScript authors
for Netscape or IE browser clients.
Node.appendChild() is probably one of the most common method calls when
building
server-side documents (or parsing existing documents) and to purposely inhibit
efficient implementation is extremely short-sighted (I'm being polite).

I'm even more convinced there needs to be a split now between a "server" DOM
and a "naive-script-writer" DOM. If Level 2 does not address these issues then
I think a new group should be formed soon, otherwise what is the point? It is
obvious from the traffic on this list that a lot of the implementations are
getting
around these silly issues by exposing non-standard APIs. This undermines the
whole idea of a public recommendation and the possibility of
cross-implementation
compatibility.
