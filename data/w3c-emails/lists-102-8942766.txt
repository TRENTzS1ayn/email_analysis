Is anyone out there cosntructing a Perl implementation of the DOM,
especially the fundamental interfaces in the DOM Level 1 Core?  I'm
writing an object-oriented HTML table module into which I want to
build DOM interfaces, and I'd rather not re-invent the wheel if
someone else is already working on the non-TABLE-specific aspects of
this task.
Thanks,
John T. Whelan
