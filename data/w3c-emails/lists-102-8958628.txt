Docuverse is planning to release two versions of DOM implementations: a
'lean and mean' version for deployment and a 'safe and cudly' version for
development.  We more of us are going to be doing this, we should come up
with some good names.  XML has validating and non-validating parsers.  What
should we have for DOM?
