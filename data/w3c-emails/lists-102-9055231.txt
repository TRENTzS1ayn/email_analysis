Every other attribute which returns an HTMLCollection object is
read-only (presumably because a HTMLCollection is supposed to be live
and therefore it wouldn't make much sense to build one and then try to
set e.g., HTMLSelectElement.options equal to it).  Is there a reason
why HTMLTableRowElement.cells should be an exception, or is this an
error in the spec?
