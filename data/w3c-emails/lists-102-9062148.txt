Docuverse DOM SDK PR3 is the first publically available implemention of the
final Document Object Model (DOM) Level 1 Specification
(http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-DOM-Level-1/)

You can download it from:

http://www.docuverse.com/domsdk/index.html

FYI, PR3 does not include the output framework support as originally planned
but it does support serialization of the Core DOM objects.  Support for
serialization of HTML DOM objects as well as full output framework and PSE
support will be in PR4.

Best,

Don Park
Docuverse
