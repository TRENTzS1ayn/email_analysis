You don't design a CORBA interface, you compile it withthe stub-compiler,
because the ORB ought to have one for
every language that it supports... :)

It ought to work. That is one of the reasons why CORBA exists! :)

wrt the efficiency, that will have to be tested. Of course you will need
some interfaces to control concurrent access to the DOM API,
but that is planned for level 2, if I'm not mistaken.

CORBA defines such a protocol (both a general one called GIOP anda specific
internet-protocol version called IIOP). You just need the
IDL interfaces, and they are included in the DOM distribution.

My C++ implementation of DOM can be used both with and without
CORBA (but is not complete yet):
http://users.cybercity.dk/~ccc25861/Programming/DOMImplementation.html

It is designed to be used with CORBA, but only tested with omniORB:
http://www.orl.co.uk/omniORB/

It is LGPL'ed and is written to be used with the Berlin project:
