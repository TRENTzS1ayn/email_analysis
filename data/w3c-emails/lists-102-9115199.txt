As you implemented a CORBA DOM implementation you are probably the best person
to ask.

Did you try to access a sizable XML document across the Internet and, for
example,  print it ?

It would be interesting to know how would that compare with:
- zipping the document on the server
- dowloading it on the client
- reparsing and printing it

I'm sorry but I don't understand, IIOP is an inter-ORB protocol, used to carry
CORBA calls.

What has it to do with a DOM to DB interface ?

What I was thinking was some kind of "minimal DOM interface" on which the whole
DOM could be implemented.

A DB vendor should support only this minimal set, so making porting DOM to a
range to DBs easier.

Does it make any sense ?

    Thanks
