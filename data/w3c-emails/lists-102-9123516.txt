There is a group of us who very much want to define a standard here for
what might be called a "Repository Object Model" based on the DOM.  It is
not on the priority list for Level 2.

Yes, but very slowly ... the DOM is defined on objects that are assumed to
be efficient to access one at a time; there is no way to do a "bulk load"
or "bulk save" of a DOM subtree.

Seems reasonable to me.  If your architecture allows some server-side
processing to keep the full parsed document on the server and intelligently
query and selectively pull pieces down to the client, that might work better.

Again, a subset of the DOM WG is very interested in this problem; with luck
we can get Level 2 out of the way quickly and address this.  Sorry if this
is not soon enough to help you much, but please keep in touch to make sure
we understand your requirements, suggestions, etc.
