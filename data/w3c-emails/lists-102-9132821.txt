To:"'DOM list'"<www-dom@w3.org>

Am I right in assuming that any HTMLTableElement that
has at least one row has at least one TBODY element?
ie. that HTML of the form,

  <TABLE>
    <TR>
      <TD>Foo</TD>
    </TR>
  </TABLE>

when represented as HTMLTableElement someTable satisfies
the following,

  someElement.getTBodies().getLength() == 1

In other words, should the *implict* <TBODY> in the above
HTML fragment tag be *explicitly* represented in the DOM?

Cheers,


Miles
