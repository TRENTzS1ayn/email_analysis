Yes.  Because TBODY has "O O" omissibility (that is, both the
start-tag and the end-tag can be omitted), its presence is
inferred from the presence of a TR element.  The same is
true within HTML of the HTML, HEAD, and BODY elements,
and all of them must appear explicitly in the DOM.

The minimal fully-explicit HTML document is:

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "whatever">
<HTML><HEAD><TITLE></TITLE></HEAD><BODY></BODY></HTML>

The TITLE element is not "O O", but it is a mandatory element,
indeed the only mandatory element that is not "O O".
