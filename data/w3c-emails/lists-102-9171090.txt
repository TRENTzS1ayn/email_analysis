A precedent has been set by the Java API to the DOM, which includes Javadoc
comments based on the spec...

One point to remember: Facts can't be copyrighted, only a particular
representation of those facts. So even if there _was_ a copyright issue --
and I'd be shocked if W3C objected to people quoting the spec to document
an implementation of it! -- this could be trivially worked around by simply
rewriting the description in your own words.
