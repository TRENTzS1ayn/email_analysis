Smart XML cache does sound like the way to go. Of course the API it would
present to the application would in turn be a DOM, plus whatever methods
are required to control the cache behavior.

As far as I can tell, the back-end API -- the protocol between the cache
and a document server -- is currently left as an exercise for the reader.
One can argue about whether or not it should simply be a networked version
of the DOM interfaces.
