1. Most people expects insertRow(getLength()) to append a row yet given
index is clearly not in the range of valid index values.

2. index can be end up being a very large number erroneously.  I think it is
safer to append just one row.

Docuverse DOM SDK's implementation of the HTML layer appends just one row at
the end of the table.
