Agreed. Rephrasing the question, is it better to generalize the
just-past-the-end behavior, or recognize it as a specific expression of
"append"? The former has convenience benefits, the latter has
application-design-error-detection benefits. Given the past decisions in
favor of making the DOM help novice programmers, I lean toward "tell them
they made a mistake" rather than "assume they knew what they were asking
for."
