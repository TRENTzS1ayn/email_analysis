You mean "keep reminding the users of their stupidity until they are forced
to choose between hiring a consultant and a psychiatrist?"  I am all for it
since I do consult on the side and got an endless supply of aha and hmm to
pass off as a shrink as well.  <g>

How do we let the user know that they made a mistake?  A shrug (return null)
or a kick in the groin (throw an exception)?  Neither is documented so it is
no longer a matter of interpretation.
