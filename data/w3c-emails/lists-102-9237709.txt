Another question is into which TBODY the row should be inserted, if
the specified index falls on a boundary between table sections.  E.g.,
if the existing table "fruitable" looks like

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
       <th>A</th>
       <th>B</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
       <th>Apple</th>
       <th>Banana</th>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

what does fruitable.insertRow(1) do?  My suspicion is that it should
add a row to the TBODY, since there is a Node.insertBefore method and
not Node.insertAfter

And I hesitate to ask this, but is Table.rows supposed to put the rows
from the TFOOT before or after those from the TBODY?  They occur
before in the HTML, but logically should come after in the table.
