It was my fault for not tagging my joke.  Let me try again.

The problem is that even if we are to inform the user of unspecified
behavior, how do it at after REC?  Documentation for insertRow does not say
that null might be returned nor does it say that an exception might be
thrown.  Do we go for Errata?
