My understanding is that

    fruitable.insertRow(1)

is equivalent to

    fruitable.insertBefore(
        fruitable.getOwnerDocument().createElement("tr"),
        fruitable.getChildNodes().item(1))

so I think you are correct.

Good question.  I believe that the original document layout takes precedence
over logical order.
