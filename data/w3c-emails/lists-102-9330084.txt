Yes, Alan, you've read it correctly.

True. It has an ownerDocument (the Document whose factory you used to
produce it), but has no parent or siblings; you've created an "orphan"
node. It has no parent until you insert or append it to another node.

>these newly created nodes can node <sic> be found by any of the methods
used

I presume you meant "can not be found" -- which is entirely correct.

>a Document object that is used to create an Attribute object with
>Document.createAttribute() would not return that Attribute

Also correct. It isn't an attribute of the Document -- in fact, Documents
can't have Attributes -- and it isn't an attribute of any Element until you
assign it to one.
