Yep, it's a choice between setOwnerDoc, or a version of Clone that sets
ownerDoc as a side effect (which avoids a second tree-walk), or trying to
guess what Level 2 might look like and implement some form of
cloneByContent on all the nodes.

A dozen of one, six-and-a-half of the other...

I'll do one of these some time in the next day or two, but I'd love to have
a good excuse not to <smile>. It's very much special-case code as far as
Level 1 is concerned, and I've been trying to keep my code size down
without sacrificing architecture.
