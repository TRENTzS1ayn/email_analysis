Actually there are people on this list who have far more complete
DOMimplementations than mine and people who knows DOM much better than
me, but thanks for your confidence ;)

You mean though the DOM API? Nope. The implementation is not eventested yet, and I
don't have access to make such a setup by myself.
However we were discussing to do network tests with CORBA in
the Berlin-project later on.

I guess I just misunderstood what you meat. IIOP can send CORBA callsacross a
network from an interface (DOM) client to an implementation
(possibly a DB). So there's a protcol...

Yup, now I understand it completely different - but I don't know aboutthis. That is
for the DOM workgroup to decide I guess.
