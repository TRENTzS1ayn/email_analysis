That sounds a lot like the choice between validating and non-validating XML
parsers and editors, recast to HTML... which may mean the same answer
applies, that should be available (or one that runs in both modes) so the
application can decide whether to enforce the constraints or not. Or
perhaps one tool that runs in both modes. (If you know you sometimes want
validation, you've already bought the additional code. If you know you
_don't_ want it, you can reduce your runtime's size by leaving it out.)
