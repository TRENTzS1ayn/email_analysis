Ie. validating vs. non-validating? Sounds plausible.

However this doesn't quite address my current concern, which is
what to do in HTMLTableElement.insertRow() in the case where 
there are currently no TR and no TBODY elements. Should I first
insert a TBODY element, then insert the TR as one of its
children, or should I simply insert the TR as a child of the
TABLE? I was assuming that the former was required, on the
grounds that a TBODY is implicit in the HTML, and should be
explicity represented in the DOM.

Cheers,


Miles
