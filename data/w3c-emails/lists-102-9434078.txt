SGML rules, however, are not.  An element with "O O" omissibility
*exists* whether its tags appear in the source or not.  Thus
every HTML-DOM must have HTML as the top-level element even if
there are no HTML tags.  The same rule applies to HEAD, BODY, and
TBODY.  (SGML weenies on XML-DEV: am I wrong?)

I don't see this as a problem.  This is not about rejecting what is
there, but treating what does not appear as present.
