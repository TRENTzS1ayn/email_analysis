To:"'Don Park'"<donpark@quake.net>,"'DOM list'"<www-dom@w3.org>

First a quick thank-you to Don Park for his initiative. Here are some
more issues ...

1. What should the behaviour of,

     HTMLTableRowElement.getRowIndex()
     HTMLTableRowElement.setRowIndex()

   be where the relevant row is not in the tree?

2. What should the behaviour of,

     HTMLTableRowElement.getSectionRowIndex()
     HTMLTableRowElement.setSectionRowIndex()

   be where the relevant row is not in the tree,
   or not a child of a table section element.

3. What should the behaviour of,

     HTMLTableCellElement.getCellIndex()
     HTMLTableCellElement.setCellIndex()

   be where the relevant cell is not in the tree?

4. What should the behaviour of,

     HTMLOptionElement.getIndex()
     HTMLOptionElement.setIndex()

   be where the relevant option is not in the tree?

5. Exactly which element types are returned by
   HTMLFormElement.getElements()? All control
   elements (eg. including <LABEL>, <FIELDSET>
   etc. elements) or just the <INPUT>, <BUTTON>,
   <TEXTAREA>, <ISINDEX> and <SELECT> elements.

6. According to the HTML 4.0 spec, some elements have
   a case-insensitive name attribute, whereas others
   have a case-sensitive name attribute. Should
   HTMLDocument.getElementsByName() and
   HTMLCollection.getNamedItem() respect this
   distinction?

I've also got one query on REC. Unlike all the other
HTMLCollection attributes, HTMLTableRowElement.cells
is not readonly ... is this a typo?

Cheers,


Miles
