To:"'DOM list'"<www-dom@w3.org>

Following attributes in the HTML layer will likely be made read-only:

HTMLOptionElement.index
HTMLCellElement.cellIndex
HTMLRowElement.rowIndex
HTMLRowElement.sectionRowIndex
HTMLRowElemetn.cells

It is not clear what their value should be when they are not in the relevant
context (not in the tree or not inside appropriate ancestors).  Docuverse
DOM SDK uses -1 to represent the middle finger.  <g>

I forget where I got the list from but Docuverse DOM SDK returns: button,
fieldset, input, isindex, label, legend, object, option, select, textarea.

It depends on the the collection.  Frankly, I missed this bit of 'finesse'
in the DOM SDK.

See above.
