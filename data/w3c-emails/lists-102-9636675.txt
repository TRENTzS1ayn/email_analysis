Looking back over some of the earlier DOM drafts this makes
sense. In these earlier drafts there was a straightforward
distinction made between 'Core', 'XML extensions' and 'HTML
extensions'. In later drafts, however, and in the REC, the
Core and XML sections have been merged in a way which makes
the distinction far less clear. If nothing else this new 
layout suggests that an HTML document ISA XML document ...
which is wrong, obviously.

I think a few clarificatory paragraphs would be in order
for the benefit of those of us who haven't been on board
from the outset.

Cheers,


Miles
