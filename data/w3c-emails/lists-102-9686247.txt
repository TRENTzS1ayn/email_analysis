Oops ... well, it was the end of a long day ...

What I *ought* to have written was,

  Document someXMLDoc = new BasicDocument();
  Element xmlElement = someXMLDoc.createElement("FOO");
  Element htmlLikeElement = someXMLDoc.createElement("TABLE");

  if(xmlElement instanceof HTMLElement)
    // possibly false (ie. implementation dependent)
  if(htmlLikeElement instanceof HTMLElement)
    // possibly false (ie. implementation dependent)

In defence the best I can say is that if you can't guarantee
that an interface *is* supported you'd be well advised to
assume that it *isn't* ... unless you want to get embroiled
in lots of hard to maintain switches on type. That's a bit
lame tho' ... mea culpa ...
