Neither was I, until a couple of weeks ago when I started
going through the spec with a fine-tooth comb.

From the spec:

  Case insensitive:

    BUTTON
    FRAME
    IFRAME
    INPUT
    MAP
    OBJECT
    PARAM   (language dependent)
    SELECT
    TEXTAREA
  
  Case sensitive:

    A
    APPLET
    META
    PARAM   (language dependent)

I found the easiest way to track this down was via the
'Index of Attributes' section.

Cheers,


Miles
