Because you raised the issue, I went back and 'scanned' the spec again and
found nothing about case-sensitive names.  Aren't you perhaps refering to
case-sensitive ATTRIBUTE VALUES and not case-sensitive NAMES?

If so, then only that affects the HTML layer of the DOM spec are the
following facts:

1. 'id' attribute value is case-sensitive.
2. 'name' attribute value may or may not be case-sensitive depending on the
element.

Agree?
