OK, we're back in synch.

Minor rephrasing: You'd be well advised to assume that you can't assume
either way. A programmer may _expect_ that it isn't, but since the next
release of the package (never mind switching to another package) may be
implemented completely differently, code that relies on this may break
unexpectedly.

Thanks for bringing this up; being forced to think it through again was
helpful for me!
