In fact, neither of these things are possible with the DOM Level 1.

You do not.  The only safe approach is to use nextSibling (and
even then you risk getting caught in a deleted subtree) or
to keep increasing the index until you get a null value.

The Level 1 DOM simply doesn't handle the case that someone other
than the XML/HTML parser is tampering with the node tree at the
same time that you are traversing it: multithreading is not
supported, except for the limited case of the parser (which can
only extend, never delete).
