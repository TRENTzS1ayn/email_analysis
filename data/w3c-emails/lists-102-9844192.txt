Recently downloaded the DOM 1.0 spec and have a few basic questions
which I'm hopeful you'll indulge:

1) Where can I find the DOM FAQ?

(Using the sample provided on pgs 10-11 of the spec and treating the
?elements? as xml, i.e. not considering the appropriate html interfaces)

2) Is the root node "<TABLE>" or is "<TABLE>" the first child node of
the document?

3) Finally, the spec says NodeList "contains all children of this
node".    That would seemingly include grandchildren, right?  If that's
the case, and I just want to print out a document equivilent to the
original, how can I tell where the end tags need to be printed?  

I'd expected to be able to do something like this...

   ...
   dumpNode( doc );


   public String dumpNode( Node n )
   {
      if( n instanceof Element )  // or use getNodeType()
      {
         System.out.println( "<" + n.getNodeName() + ">" );

         NodeList nl = n.getChildNodes();
         int childPtr = 0;
         Node n2 = nl.item( childPtr )
         while( n2 != null )
         {  dumpNode( n2 );
            childPtr++;
            n2 = n1.item( childPtr );
         }

         System.out.println( "<//" + n.getNodeName() + ">" );
      }
      else if ( n instanceof Text )
      {  System.out.println( ((Text) n).getData() );
      }
   }


Thanks,
