I think this proves my point.  After item 0 is deleted, the live NodeList
gets effectively re-indexed.  The paragraph that _used_ to be item 1 is now
item 0.  The paragraph that used to be item 2 is now item 1, so that gets
deleted next.  And so on.

On the whole I prefer style myself, but as I believe I have shown, it's not
always obvious when you have to check.

I think that the naive script writer is more likely to write something like
my snippet (which blows up) or yours (which is written much more carefully
and so only has _one_ bug in it) and spend a lot of time head-scratching.
