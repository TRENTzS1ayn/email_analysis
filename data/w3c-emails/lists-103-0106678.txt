Stephen,
I don't want to sound offending in any way, but I really think you
misunderstood what the DOM is all about. We've never claimed that we're
going to solve every possible problem in the world. For one thing, we
stated from the beginning that we would only care about XML and HTML. If
this isn't enough for you and you want to use SGML, you're very welcome.
But it doesn't make any sense to then come to us and complain that the
DOM doesn't work for SGML, because it doesn't preserve information such
as omitted end tags. You're just wasting your time and some bandwidth.
Now, if you have any constructive comment on the DOM spec, there are
very welcome.
Thank you.
