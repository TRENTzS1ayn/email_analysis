TclDOM has almost all of the DOM Level 1 features and is only 2200 lines
of code.
This includes functionality that is not part of the DOM spec, such as parsing
and serialisation of XML.  ~2000 lines of code is hardly a mammoth undertaking.

It probably took me more time to read the spec than to implement the
package ;-)
