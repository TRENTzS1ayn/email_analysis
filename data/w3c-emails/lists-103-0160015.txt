I have been desperate for such a feature in DOM and concur it falls into
the category of information which many apps in general will aspire for through
pure DOM (as opposed to proprietary DOM).

I'd like to point out that while getElementById() provides "a way of searching
node given an known id", "a way of discovering id" of an element is also
equally in need. (the name of which is, e.g. getIdAttributeName() )
