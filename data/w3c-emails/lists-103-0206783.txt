Forgive my perhaps careless wording, and, even worse perhaps, lack of 
time to fully catch up with dicussions to date -- but it seems to me 
that the point was made earlier by someone else that getElementById 
was a part or the HTML specification -- not the SGML/XML side of 
things.  It was in the context of XML that I meant my remark to be 
interpreted, and where, for me it would (in the limited sense I 
discussed before) be most useful, since my envisioned DOM application 
would be with XML document, and furthermore with ones with many ID 
and IDref links.

From the tone of this note and others in this discussion, this whole 
issue seems to have stepped on a few toes. I am not trying to offend 
here, and hope that the rest of my note receives some sort of comment 
as well -- including useful comments that will improve my 
understanding of the whole ID/IDref issue in the context of the DOM.  
As the rest of my note says, it seems useful to me at least to 
support the interpretion of the ID/IDref construct in XML as a 
reference -- something that getElementById does not seem to do as far 
as I can see.

The point Philippe Le Hegaret makes should be well taken, however, 
and I'll take some time when I can to read at least some part of the 
previous discussion.

Cheers!                      ... john b
