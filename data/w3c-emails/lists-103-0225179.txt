I think it's just a matter of IDs having been considered a DTD issue, and
DTD/Schema support not yet having been addressed. Everyone's very aware of that
need.

If your document edits the DOM, finding and maintaining pointers inside
scattered nodes is a bit harder than changing a central indirection table. I can
make arguments for either approach depending on the characteristics of an
individual application set. Implementation detail rather than DOM design, though
we may want to consider leaving room for that optimization when designing the
API.
