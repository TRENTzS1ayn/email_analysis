Don't worry about that!  This mailing list exists for people *outside* the
W3C to comment on the usefulness of the DOM drafts to THEM.  It would be a
great help to the DOM WG if people would tell us exactly what they've tried
to do with the DOM API, what has stymied them, and what they'd like to see
in the standard that would make their lives easier.

I for one don't fully understand what exactly your are suggesting to
"support the interpretation of the ID/IDREF construct in XML as a
reference".  Maybe a
      Node getReferencedNode(Attr idref)
method? And as someone noted, maybe a getIdAttribute method?  The more
specific the suggestion, the more likely it is to be carefully considered.
