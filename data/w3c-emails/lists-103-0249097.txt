Actually I believe I'm the one who wrote that.  Be careful of quote-nesting.

The last 10% is what takes 90% of the time.   How efficient are the live
nodelists returned from getElementsByTagName?  Can you redefine an Entity
and what happens if you do?

My Java implementation, also with (a different set of) extensions is about
twice that and is also _almost_ complete.  But making it fully compliant
would mean rewriting large parts of my application, so it isn't going to
happen.
