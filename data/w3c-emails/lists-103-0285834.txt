We don't have any design yet for the DTD support. We could hold up L2 for as
long as it takes to bang out that design, or we can let L2 continue and then
release L3 as quickly as we can manage it. I think the latter will give you
schema support at about the same date, and let folks start using the L2 features
in the meantime.

I think the WG agrees about not waiting longer for schemas. But we may want to
design the DTD support with half an eye on where they're going, so you don't
have to completely rewrite your code if you want to cut over.
