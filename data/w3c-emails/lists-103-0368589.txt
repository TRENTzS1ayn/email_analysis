I fully agree PERSONALLY ... but I don't think it's a practical approach at
this point.  Needless to say, I can't get into who advocates what, but
suffice it to say that there are very strong and different opinions about
which features are TRULY the most fundamental.  Remember that the DOM spec
is the result of a collaboration between browser, editor, and server-side
vendors; Windows/COM and Java/CORBA advocates; Java, script, and C++
developers; companies that were traditionally HTML vendors and those that
were traditionally SGML vendors; those whose users are basically page
authors who write some script and those whose users are professional
programmers ... the list of axes along which one can disagree about what the
"truly minimal core" should be in the DOM goes on and on.

[This has been a very educational experience for me -- it's a miracle that
there's any standards at all, not a curse that the standards are less than
elegant!]
