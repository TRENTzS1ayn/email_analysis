Sorry about that.  I tried to get the attribution right, but it got
muddled up :-(

These are implementation details.  When I say my package is not 100% complete
I mean that it is missing things like the string and text functions.  I didn't
bother with those because Tcl already provides a rich set of features
for dealing
with strings.  Things like live node lists are about as efficient as
they can be
in a high-level scripting language like Tcl (there is an alternative implementation
in C++ in development).

My point was to demonstrate, by example, that implementing the DOM is
not all that
difficult.
