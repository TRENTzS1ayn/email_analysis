Count me confused.  NOTATION declarations interact with at least two
things:  (1) attributes of type NOTATION, currently invisible in DOM;
(2) unparsed ENTITY objects, currently visible in DOM.

Don't be canfused by the fact that DOM's partial support for NOTATIONs
doesn't support (1), a primary use -- they _do_ so interact.
