Hmm, I sure thought some DTD proposals had been made; enough folk
have talked about "old DTD proposals".  I could make one on fairly
short notice, if need be.

I don't see a rush for getting L2 out; I'd rather see it out with
the features it needs.  And I'd far rather see a decent job be done
on DTDs in the next month or two, and cause a slight delay in L2 DOM
(and time pressure to keep it slight!), than to see most of a year
pass before L3 happens.  L3 is sure to have all kinds of other stuff
going on.
