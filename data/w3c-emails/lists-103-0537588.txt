Which is why it's so useless, even given Entity.getNotationName().

You must have been reading some other mailing list than I was!

I saw lots of comments (including mine) which concurred on getElementById,
and then said that the rest of the API (to set/derive ID info) is needed
too.  In fact I don't think I saw anyone saying it's not needed; the only
negative feedback has been along the lines you've given, that the WG has
been holding its breath for schemas to happen.

No, the precedent is that this method is on Document; see the HTML DOM.

And in fact this feature is completely unrelated to content models; it's
related to attribute declarations, not element declarations.  Consider

<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ATTLIST bar magic ID #REQUIRED>]>
<foo>
  <bar magic="one" attr='99 bugs'/>
  <bar magic="two" attr='100 bugs'/>
  <bar magic="omega">Fix a bug, check it in, 101 bugs...</bar>
</foo>

No content models.  But four elements, three with ID attributes.

You already _were_ overruled ... ;-)

The proposal was to move the existing method into the core, and the feedback
so far has been "yes yes yes" along with "and make sure ID attributes are
not a 'Yet Another Backdoor API Needed' feature".


By the way, I seem to recall that this proposal was made last year too; it's
not a new one, users have asked for it for quite some time.  And wasn't the
ability to implement XPath using public APIs a requirement for L2 DOM?
