I guess it depends on what you think Level 2 is - to me it's a 
collection of modules which happen to be ready in about the same 
time-frame. This means it doesn't really make sense to hold up 
everything else that is ready to add a new module; I'd rather get 
Level 2 out the door and start working on the modules for Level 3 
after that. 

If we do that, we can release a WD of Level 3 modules as soon as 
they are ready. Given that there are old DTD proposals floating 
around, it shouldn't take long to get the DTD module into shape for 
being released. I think we should start with requirements and then 
do the design, rather than leap straight into design. So we could 
make the requirements public as a first step and invite comment on 
those.

The gating factor for all of the DOM work, of course, is finding 
people with experience who will commit their time and energy to 
doing that work. The list of things for the DOM WG to look at 
keeps growing; with a few more experienced, knowledgable people 
on the DOM WG we could get more of them done in a reasonable 
time-frame as well.
