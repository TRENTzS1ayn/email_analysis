Not that I recall - certainly the DOM should not make it impossible 
to implement XPath on top of it. Actual support for XLink and XPath 
were deferred until the XLink WG was further along; this has now 
happened so in theory (given sufficient people who wish it to 
happen and are prepared to help make it happen) such support 
could be added to the DOM. If the DOM has something that 
precludes implementing XPath on top of it, we need to know about 
that of course.
