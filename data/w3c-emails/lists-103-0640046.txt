I am implementing the DOM2 core and ran across the following problem:

The attribute name parameter to Element.setAttributeNS is given as a localName so it is not possible using 
this API to define a new attribute that has a prefix.  When adding a new attribute that needs a prefix 
the user will then need to do a getAttributeNodeNS to get the attribute node and then do a setPrefix.
This is especially inconvenient given that the user often does not distinguish between defining a
new attribute and updating an existing one (in fact the api is defined to hide this distinction).

I propose that the name parameter be redefined as a qualified name.   This will solve this problem and
is also consistent with how attributes are created by the factory in Document.

Thank you for your time.
