FourThought LLC (http://FourThought.com) announces the release of

                             4DOM 0.8.2
                      -----------------------
                An XML/HTML Python library using the
                  Document Object Model interface

4DOM is a Python library for XML and HTML processing and manipulation
using the W3C's Document Object Model for interface.  4DOM supports
DOM all of Level 1 (core and HTML), as well as Document Traversal from
Level 2.  4DOM also adds some helper components for DOM Tree creation
and printing, python integration, white-space manipulation, etc.

4DOM can work in a CORBA* enviroment, or in a purely local set-up.

4DOM is designed to allow developers rapidly design applications
that read, write or manipulate HTML and XML.

News
----

Changes:

- Create a Reader module under Ext for importing strings into 4DOM.
  Builder is now deprecated and will disappear before version 1.0
        o Reader has three drivers currently: Sax and HtmlLib are
          just modularized versions of the functionality that was
          formerly in Builder, and Sax2 is a driver for the
          as-yet experimental SAX 2 specification.
- Fixed a Builder/Reader bug for HTML input and empty, unclosed tags
  such as <br>
- Fixed a bug in text normalization
- Miscellaneous bug-fixes
