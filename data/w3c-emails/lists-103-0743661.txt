This means that the mechanism for accessing (for example) an HTMLLinkElement as
a LinkStyle object will very from one programming language to another, and that
the "binding" -- the language-specific version of the DOM API -- defines this
mechanism.

In the Java bindings you would use the Java typecast operation.
     LinkStyle linkStyleView=(LinkStyle)myHTMLLinkElement;

But not all languages support that concept. Those which don't will have to
define workarounds as part of their bindings; one approach would be:
     LinkStyle linkStyleView=myHTMLLinkElement.getLinkStyleView()
Each language binding is responsible for evaluating the available alternatives
and selecting the most appropriate solution.
