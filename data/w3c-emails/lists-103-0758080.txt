The conference season is starting again, and I'll soon be giving the 
annual DOM updates. I would like to point people to interesting 
applications of the DOM - so if any readers of this list want their 
products or solutions talked about in public, please send me 
relevant info, URL for more info, etc. 

Alternatively, you can submit your URL to the Open Directory 
Project at 
http://dmoz.org/Computers/Programming/Internet/W3C_DOM/
I'll be checking that site regularly.

If you have any other suggested URLs for the ODP, they would 
also be welcome, of course (tutorials, examples, etc).

thanks,

Lauren
