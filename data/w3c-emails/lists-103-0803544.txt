Good question, and good catch.

Given that we've now moved splitText down to characterData -- which is also
the ancestor of Comment -- I think I agree that the description needs to be
updated. And I think you're probably right about the implication that split
should create another node of the same type as the node which is being
split.

(Just checked my Level 1 implementation, and I didn't special-case this for
CDATASections; they just inherited Text's version, which generated a Text
node for the second half. That did meet the spec, but...)
