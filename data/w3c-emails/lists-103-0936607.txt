I think you mean "cannot be shipped as part of" ... an open source
application should be able to use an implementation of such interfaces,
though it can't ship or implement them.

I think that another way to put this is:  The OSD calls for all
the relevant Intellectual Property (IP) to be open, not just to
provide access to source code.

That's a problem for any "standards" organization that wants to
control evolution of such IP, since it requires such control be
yielded.  This is similar to the issue that Sun's "Community
Source" licensing has hit -- interface/code evolution isn't in
the hands of the community, unapproved forking is prohibited.
