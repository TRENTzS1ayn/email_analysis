Where perhaps not all readers are aware that OSD is distinct
from GPL, and GPL has a slightly ... "stronger" stance on some
issues than the OSD, although GPL does conform to OSD.

Point taken -- I was focussing on other aspects of the IP, namely
the interface evolution process.  Which is an IP (copyright in
this case) issue.  You're right that trademarks are a separate
form of IP (as are patents, trade secrets, and surely more).

I'm not following you at all when you write that.  The interface
is what the DOM standardizes, and one form of it is expressed as
Java code.

There _is_ a need to yield some control over that; minimally, to let
the source be patched.  Possibly with a mandated name change, with
the "W3C" and/or "DOM" names removed, which clearly forgoes all
binary compatibility with the W3C APIs.  Clause 4.

Both protect interfaces ... SCSL also protects implementation.

Similar in that the control over evolution is a closed process,
not that they're identical.
