Interesting proposal.

Note that the same result can usually be accomplished (in Java, at least)
by declaring a new set of interfaces, in the new package, which inherit
from and override/extend the standard DOM API. That avoids needing to
copy/alter the existing W3C bindings, and makes the relationship between
your subclass and the standard DOM explicit.

This approach might not work in all languages. But it seems to offer a way
out of the current collision while we wait for the lawyers to ponder the
Meaning Of Open.
