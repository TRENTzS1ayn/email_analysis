Another data point: IETF standards-track documents and many other RFCs
also disallow modification outside the IETF standards process per RFC
2223, section 11:

  <ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2223.txt>

I believe many members of the free software and open source community
feel this is appropriate for standards and not truly in conflict with
the OSD.  It more closely matches the OpenContent license, for
example.

  <http://www.opencontent.org/opl.shtml>

ObDisclaimer: I've never before read a comment or opinion from a FS/OS
community member that speaks to this particular issue.  Probably a
good question for Ask Slashdot.
