Whether Java run-time binding is "linking" within the meaning of the GPL is
a question.  I incline to think it is; if so, no GPLed program can use an
implementation of the DOM through the standard interfaces (which is tantamount
to not being able to use it at all).

This is not the case; in particular, the OSD deliberately says nothing about
open trademarks, and it is quite common for licenses (even the MIT/BSD)
to exclude trademarks explicitly. In this case, disallowing the use of "W3C"
(as in the package name) is clearly allowed.

There is no need to yield control over the binding of a particular
version to the W3C Level 1 DOM, while still allowing modification of the
Java code itself.  It simply isn't a DOM interface any more, then.

I don't agree that it's particularly similar.  The SCS license is trying to
protect implementation, whereas what I am talking about is interface.
