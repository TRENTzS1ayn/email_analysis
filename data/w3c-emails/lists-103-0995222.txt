"When I use a term", said Humpty Dumpty grandly, "it means what I intend
it to mean, neither more nor less."

Specifically, when I say "open source" I mean "compliant with the OSI
Open Source Definition.  For legal reasons, the term cannot be trademarked,
but "open source" surely does not mean "you can read the code" no matter
what certain journalists think.

Apache is written in C/C++, for which there is no official DOM binding.

The OSD is not an open-source (license) agreement, but a statement
about what a license has to provide in order to be open source.
