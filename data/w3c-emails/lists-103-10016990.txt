Brief answer: Because that's what the spec says.

Longer answer: Because implementing a DOM often involves nonpublic
interfaces (in order to achieve the desired behavior), and those won't work
across implementations. And because Documents may be subclassed
differently, in some DOMs, which can further impede interchangability of
nodes.

I'm not sure what question you're asking. If you don't want to affect the
original DOM tree, don't alter the nodes which belong to that tree -- copy
them first. Whether that should be done via cloneNode or by importing into
a new Document is up to you, and depends on what you intend to do with the
copied nodes.
