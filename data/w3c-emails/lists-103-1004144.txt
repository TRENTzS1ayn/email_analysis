... and conformant with the OSD, I think ... though I missed the
original letter.

Alternative proposal:  type in the "org.w3c.dom" interfaces by
hand, don't use the sources W3C provides.  In effect that's what
is done for conforming to POSIX, ANSI-C, and ANSI-C++ standards
(so far as I know).

That's only "the same result" at a technical level, when the interface is
intended to be compatible ... things like "improved" APIs (lighter weight,
perhaps server oriented, removing perceived misfeatures) are precluded.
