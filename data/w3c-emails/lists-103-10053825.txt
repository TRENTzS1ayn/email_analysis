If you want information about the DOM architecture, without referring to a
particular implementation or language, you can find it at
     http://www.w3.org/DOM/
Unfortunately, Perl is not one of the languages for which the DOM spec
provides a standardized binding. But the principles should be the same. For
questions about a specific implementation, your best bet is to contact that
implementation's authors.

To add contents to an  existing node, create  the additional nodes as
needed and use the appendChild() and/or insertBefore() operations to put
them in the desired places in the DOM tree.

To find the last instance of a nodename... The simplest approach is to use
getElementsByTagName and get the last element of the resulting NodeList.
But that will involve walking the entire document, so I would instead
recommend that you develop a more intelligent search scheme which takes
advantage of knowledge about the structure of your documents.
