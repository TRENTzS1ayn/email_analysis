A DocumentFragment can never be a child of any other node. If you try to
append or insert it, its _children_ are appended/inserted instead.

That convenience feature is the main reason DocumentFragment exists...

(Anticipating the next likely question: Remember that nodes belong to
specific Documents, and may only be appended to that Document. If the
DocumentFragment was created as part of one Document, you can _not_
directly append its contents to another Document; you need to use the
importNode method or some equivalent.)
