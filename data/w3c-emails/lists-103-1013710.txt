Absolutely, and I have no problem with that.  But RFCs don't contain code!
Or if they do, it is example code that can be replaced by free code performing
the same function.

To work with the DOM, however, one must have the (compiled form of) the
very declarations in the org.w3c.dom packages.  To use them in open-source
programs, those declarations must themselves be open-source.
