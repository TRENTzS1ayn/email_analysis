Certainly.  But this is core: a program which cannot be modified in every part is
not an open-source program.

Let me be more explicit:

1) The W3C publishes some Java code under a license that forbids modification.

2) The W3C declares that this version of the code, and no other, is the
Java binding of the DOM.

3) I now wish to reuse the Java code in my application in modified form,
because I export (or import) an interface which resembles the DOM but is
not conformant to it.

4) W3C should allow me to do so, provided I do not misrepresent the modified
code as being the Java binding of the DOM, and provided (for Java-specific
reasons) that I change the package names.  But it currently will not.

5) Programs are open-source only if the license(s) covering every part of the
source code are OSD-compliant.

6) My program is not open-source.

Exactly so.

I have no problem with that, as long as the code itself (as opposed to
the claim that it is a binding of the DOM) may be used in modified forms.
