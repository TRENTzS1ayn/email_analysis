They are set to null.

[[[
nextSibling of type Node, readonly 
  The node immediately following this node. If there is no such node, this
  returns null.
parentNode of type Node, readonly 
  The parent of this node. All nodes, except Attr, Document, DocumentFragment,
  Entity, and Notation may have a parent. However, if a node has just been
  created and not yet added to the tree, or if it has been removed from the tree,
  this is null.

For a non deep copy, only the element and his attributes are copied. Childrens
are not included.

[[[
deep of type boolean 
  If true, recursively clone the subtree under the specified node; if false,
  clone only the node itself (and its attributes, if it is an Element).
]]]
