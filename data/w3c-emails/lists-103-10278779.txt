4Suite Server is a platform for handling XML processing needs in
application development.  It is an XML data repository with a
rules-based engine.  It supports DOM access, XSLT transformation, XPath
and RDF-based indexing and query, XLink resolution and many other XML
services.  It also supports other related services such as distributed
transactions, and access control lists.  It supports remote,
cross-platform and cross-language access through CORBA and other request
protocols to be added shortly.

4Suite Server is not designed to be a full-blown application server.
It provides highly-specialized services for XML processing that can be
used with other application servers.

4Suite Server is open-source and free to download.  Priority support
and customization is available from Fourthought, Inc.  For more
