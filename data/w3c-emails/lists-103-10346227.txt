I think perhaps then, the terminology could be clarified. When I see a link 
on a document that says "latest version", I read that as the *latest 
version of the document I'm currently looking at*, whether it be a draft, 
CR, PR, or Rec. If it's to point back to the latest *Rec*, that should be 
specified.

(I further think the term and linking habits are managed differently across 
working groups, leading to some of the confusion)

Best,

Ann
