>Wonder if there is a functionality in DOM to get nodes with no  children ,

The easiest solution would be to write a simple NodeFilter which Skips any
node which has a firstChild, and plug that into the DOM Level 2 Traversal
objects (NodeIterator or TreeWalker).

If you're using a Level 1 DOM, you would have to write your own tree-walker
to accomplish this.
