Hi ,
I wonder if there is a functionality in DOM to get the children elements which are the last generation in a document without looping
in every childeNode to check if hasChildNodes() is false .
I meen what am interested in are elements having no children wherever they are in the document .
Could I get them directly ?
Thanks
