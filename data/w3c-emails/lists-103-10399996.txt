Following the recent changes in the Document Object Model Activity [1],
the DOM Working Group has published an update of the requirements for the
Document Object Model Level 3:

 http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-DOM-Requirements-20001214

The major changes are:
- the addition of the Embedded DOM requirements [2]
- Views and Formatting will not be addressed in DOM Level 3 [3]

As usual, comments on this document are invited and are to be sent to the
DOM public mailing list [4].

Bests regards,

Philippe
