That seems extreme, but neither of us is a lawyer and sometimes
licences have had major bugs.

I think that your interpretation would preclude implementations
in C, C++, Python, and other languages.  After all, since the spec
defines interfaces, all implementations must be derivative.  Yet
only the Java binding actually includes code for the interfaces.
