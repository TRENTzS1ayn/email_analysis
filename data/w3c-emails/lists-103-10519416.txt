I believe that this last statement was intended to cover the case where 
xmlns is NOT theprefix, but it is the attribute name, which is how the 
default namespacefor elements is established.  This is a kink in the 
rules for associating URIs with namespaces.  Thus, in this case, it is 
the qualified name, not the prefix.
