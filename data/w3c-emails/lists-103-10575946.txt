No.  The unprefixed xmlns attribute is a special case which belongs to 
the same namespace URI as those prefixed with xmlns:.

This makes all namespace attributes belong to the same URI.

This presumes that there will never be a namespace attribute called 
"xmlns:xmlns", which would be indistinguishable by URI and local name.  
This seems to be a safe bet since you cannot use the xmlns prefix to 
address a namespace since it is reserved for declaring namespace 
prefixes and URIs.
