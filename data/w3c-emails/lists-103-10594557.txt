Yes, but you have to understand what that means.  It means that
"title" belongs to the "book" element-specific partition of the
"urn:com:books-r-us" namespace.

No.  The point of prefixed attributes is so that applications
can recognize them by their namespaces in any sort of element,
whether the element belongs to the namespace or not.  An element
belonging to a well-known namespace need not have separately
recognizable attributes.
