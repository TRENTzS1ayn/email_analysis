Unless I am missing something here, title is clearly an element, not an 
attribute, which makes it participate in the default namespace.

I think I missed a point here somewhere or something in the example.  
Attributes are typically defined and interpreted in the context of the 
element they are defined for.  I would interpret not having a namespace 
qualification is akin to a local definition.  I believe that schema goes 
a step beyond DTDs and even allows local child element declarations, but 
attributes are thought of as local to an element.  My own practice is to 
only add namespace URIs to attributes which transcend the particular 
element, which have a definition understood outside of the particular 
element accross many and perhaps even all elements, a little like the 
concept of SGML architectural forms.
