  The namespaceURI attribute is read-only in DOM Level 2.

  I would expect to get either and NAMESPACE_ERR or a
NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR here.  Perhaps *which* I should expect
should be clarified in the recommendation, but the "always" leads me
to think it can't be changed.  Since I can't set the namespaceURI
attribute, that seems reasonable.
