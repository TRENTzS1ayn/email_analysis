As I said, you'll get a NAMESPACE_ERR DOMException if you try to set the prefix
with
a null namespaceURI. The recommendation is clear on that point. prefix will
always
be null for a DOM Level 1 node and there is no way to change that.
And Fred is right, there is no way to change the namespaceURI of a Node after
his creation: the Node.namespaceURI attribute is read-only.
