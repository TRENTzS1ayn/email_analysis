  Looking at this further, the use of the same names for two
enumerations in the same scope is illegal IDL -- no IDL compiler
should accept this.  (There's also a minor error with extra semicolons
between the enum definition and the typedef name, but let's consider
that a simple typo!)
  I'll propose that a single enumeration should be used, and should
define the names that are defined for TreePosition, but perhaps call
it TreeOrder.  That type can be used for both compareDocumentOrder()
and compareTreePosition().
