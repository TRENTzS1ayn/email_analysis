Perhaps, but I'm talking about documents created by other people (which
probably include some inelegant documents ;) ). While you're correct that
the two attributes are in different namespaces, it seems to me that they
still refer to the same attribute in a particular schema.

No? Let me give a useful example:

<html xmlns=".../w3/xhtml/..." xmlns:xhtml=".../w3/xhtml/...">
...
<img src="image1.jpg" />
<img xhtml:src="image2.jpg" />

This document, while a bit silly, is as far as I can tell a completely valid
XHTML document (ignoring the missing pieces). Both <img> src and <img>
xhtml:src refer to the same attribute in the schema, right? (This, I
suppose, is my big assumption.)

If one wants to correctly interpret all XHTML documents, then, one must
search both for <img> src and <img> xhtml:src, even though they are in
different namespaces, because someone *can* create such a document and it
will be correct. (XHTML is just an example -- this applies to any schema, I
would think.)
