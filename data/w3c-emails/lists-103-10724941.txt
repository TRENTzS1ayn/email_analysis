Hi,

I have no problem creating client-side image maps using the static HTML tags 
for IMG, MAP, and AREA.

However, I am having trouble creating the equivalent using the DOM 
createElement in either IE or NN.

I would really appreciate any guidance or samples you know of.

I apologize for bothering the W3 organization with this, but I have been 
searching through all of the usual javascript/dhtml/dom forums out there 
with no luck. I have also asked this question at the Microsoft forums with 
no response and the Netscape DOM forum has been down for at least two days.

Thanks in advance!
