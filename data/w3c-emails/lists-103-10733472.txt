Of course, right after I give up and bother the W3 org, my question is 
solved at the Microsoft forum!

I appreciate Martin Honnen's taking the time right before Christmas to 
explain to me that there is a bug in IE5 and IE5.5 such that the dynamically 
created MAP element does not work with the name attribute, but only with the 
id attribute.

This single change made my client-side map work in IE. Now on to Netscape!

My question to all of you is where is the best place for me to find this 
kind of DOM bug? I realize this is a vendor bug, not a W3 bug, but I did not 
find this problem reported anywhere on the Microsoft website.

Do any of you know where I could have found this bug reported at Microsoft 
or anywhere else?
