"Tree order" doesn't seem to capture the meaning like "tree position" 
does.  The distinction in names is intentional.

While ancestors and descendants have order within a document using 
conventions of document order (which start tag was encountered first), 
they have no sequential order within a tree hierarchy.  Being an 
ancestor or a descendant does not feel like "order" to me, but rather 
relative position of the nodes, which can be in one of four directions.
