  OK.  The name itself is of limited interest for me, but the current
IDL isn't usable.  If there are to be two different enumerations,
there needs to be some prefix on the names from each ("ORDER_" and
"POSITION_" come to mind, but I won't be terribly picky).

  I concur; there is a semantic problem with collapsing the two
types.  There could be two types if the names don't clash, or there
could be a specific set of values, as for the NodeType constants.  I'm
not tied to either approach.
