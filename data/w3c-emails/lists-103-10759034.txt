Hi,
I want to build a tree showing an 
organizational hierarchy which is to be displayed on a 
browser(Netscape) and the node data will be fetched from the 
database(oracle) dynamically.Also I should be able to 
edit/delete/add a node on the browser(no applets!), may be I will be 
submitting the request to the server(iws/iPlanet ias)after 
changing the tree node to update the database.Any help/code sample
regarding this is really appreciated.

..Sunil
