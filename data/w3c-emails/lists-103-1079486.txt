No more so than the programming language's standard libraries. Those are
used by the open source project, but not distributed with it nor claimed to
be part of it. I would expect that shipping the DOM bindings separately
would put them in the same category.


However, I Am Not A Lawyer. Few (none?) of us are. They're the ones who
will have to straighten this out.

I move we table this discussion until the legal eagles have given us some
facts to argue about... <smile/>
