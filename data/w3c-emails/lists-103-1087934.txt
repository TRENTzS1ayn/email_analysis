Here is an answer for comments on the CSS OM draft. If I missed
a comment in the dom public mailing list, please, let me know.

The MediaList could be empty :
'An empty list is the same as a list that contains the medium "all".'

>  - How do media and disabled interact?

'A stylesheet only applies if both an appropriate medium definition is present
and the disabled attribute is false. So, if the media doesn't apply to the
current user agent, the disabled attribute is ignored.'

The cssText has been renamed to mediaText.

Issues from http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom/1999JulSep/0105.html
are still unresolved.
