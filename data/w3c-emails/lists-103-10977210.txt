  It doesn't look like there was ever a response to this, so I'm
reporting on what I did.  What I'd like is a clarification in the
recommendation regarding the indended value for the
DocumentType.internalSubset attribute when there is an internal
subset.
  In my implementation, I set the attribute to be exactly the text
between the '[' and ']' characters that mark the internal subset --
this corresponds exactly to the portion of the doctypedecl production
given as:

(markupdecl | DeclSep)*

  Do other implementations that support this attribute do it this way?
Was this the intended value?
  Thanks!
