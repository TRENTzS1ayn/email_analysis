Hi,

I would like to ask for some comments on an issue regarding DOM Level 2
mouse events that is being discussed on the bugzilla system of the Mozilla
webbrowser:

http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=71705

To summarize, the question is: should the "click" event fire when the user
(on a Windows platform, for example) presses the Right mouse button to
activate the browser "context menu"?

Thanks,
-TT
