I have a navigation bar at the top of all my HTML pages. I want to put a "top of page" link at the bottom of any pages that are too long to fit in the window without scrolling.
Is there any "event" based on scroll bars being present that I can use. I can't find anything in my javascript reference.
Any help appreciated.

Thanks

Lorcan de brun
