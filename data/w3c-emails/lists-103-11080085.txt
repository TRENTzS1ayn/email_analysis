Scrollbars would be part of the rendering of the document, and hence if the
DOM handled them anywhere it would be in the "Views And Formatting" chapter
-- which is currently on hold.

Don't forget, you can send other events through the DOM's mechanism, so
it's possible to standardize additional sets whether or not they're
officially blessed by the DOM.
