At least implementations using standards I'm most familiar with.

But ... if "HTML Documents" were only recognized using metadata,
never the document preface (DTD etc), then it'd be ideal.  Perhaps
there's some relevant parser that works that way.

Actually, as I've commented before, that applies well to the
DTD-related changes which WERE made by DOM Level 2!

This could easily have been changed in later L2 drafts; the
work-in-progress stopped earlier than you imply.
