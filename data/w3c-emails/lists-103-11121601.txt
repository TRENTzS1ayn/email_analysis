The new version is available at
http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-DOM-Level-3-Events-20000901/

KeyEvent are now more character devices oriented. This is the result
of a coordination between WAI, Internationalization, SVG, and DOM.

Changes:
- Renamed GetModifier. It is now checkModifier
- Added initModifier.
- Renamed keypress event. It is now textEvent.
