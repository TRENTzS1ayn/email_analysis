Hi,

Just some questions with regard to CSS and Style OM's, in the 29 Oct
release. 


CONTENT TYPE: 
5.2 CSS Fundamental Interfaces
Interface CSSStyleSheet (introduced in DOM Level 2)

'The CSSStyleSheet interface is a concrete interface used to
represent a CSS style sheet, i.e. a style sheet whose content type is
"text/css".'

How imperative is this statement? Does this read 'is and only is
"text/css"', or 'ideally is "text/css" '?


ACCESSING A CSSRULE:
5.2 CSS Fundamental Interfaces
With regard to the IDL interfaces, CSSStyleSheet and CSSRuleList, there is
no facility to implement the operations CSSStyleSheet.insertRule() and
CSSStyleSheet.deleteRule(), through its CSSRuleList attribute, as the
CSSRuleList does not support the corresponding operations. What is the
design rationale for allowing write access through the CSSStyleSheet but not
through its CSSRuleList attribute? Would it not be preferable to give the
CSSRuleList IDL interface insertRule() and deleteRule() operations? I note
that MediaList supports these operations.


ORDERED COLLECTIONS:
In the StyleSheetList, CSSRuleList and  MediaList  IDL interface
descriptions appears the statement:

'The ___ interface provides the abstraction of an ordered collection
of style sheets'

Without being pedantic, what is meant in these contexts by an 'ordered
collection'. 


TYPO's:
Section: 
Interface StyleSheetList (introduced in DOM Level 2)
Attributes
length

  'The number of StyleSheet in the list' 

I assume this is  'StyleSheet's', not 'the StyleSheet'


Section: 
Interface MediaList (introduced in DOM Level 2)
Methods
append

'It the new medium...'

should read 'If the new medium..'

Section:
5.2.1 Override and Computed Stylesheet
Interface ViewCSS
Methods
getComputedStyle

'This method is used to the computed style sheet as it defines in
the [CSS2].'

Can anyone clarify this? My guess is 'This method is used to get the
computed style sheet as defined in [CSS2].'


Regards,

Bill de hOra
