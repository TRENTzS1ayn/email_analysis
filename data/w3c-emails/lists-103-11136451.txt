  I just sent an email with supposedly-correct URLs for the Level 3
Events draft, but it already appears things have been shuffled on the
server.  These work for me now:

http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/
        http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-DOM-Level-3-Events-20010410/

(I notice that the year in the directory name for the second one has
changed.)  It looks like someone at the W3C is getting things cleaned
up on the server.
