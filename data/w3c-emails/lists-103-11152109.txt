I guess in that case, you will receive one Mouse event for each mouse button
pressed. For example:

mousedown button 0
mousedown button 1

[all kind of mousemove, mouseover, mouseout, ...]

mouseup button 0
mouseup button 1

click button 0
click button 1

order of mousedown, mouseup or click is not relevant here.

This can also be applied on the key events.

I don't think you will receive the click event in that case if the mouse is
released in the browser window. You will certainly get the two mouseup events.
Note that mouseover and mouseout don't contain buttons informations.
