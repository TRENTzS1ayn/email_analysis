Certainly not! URIs are never broken in /TR (and almost not in the other
parts
of the web server) even if they're wrong. In fact, the document was already
at
the right place since last Friday.
So I don't know what happened in your previous message but it wasn't the
result
of a wrong manipulation in the directory.
I made a wrong cut/paste in my first message since it contained the previous
version instead of the updated one.

So, the correct location is:
http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-DOM-Level-3-Events-20010410/

Anyway, thanks for your clarification and sorry for the confusion,

Philippe
