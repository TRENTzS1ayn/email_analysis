Permitting multiple instances on the same property in a rule will mislead
the CSS author. He will never be able to use them with a CSS engine. So
I'm still wondering how useful it is to represent them in the CSS OM except
for round-tripping.
Regarding CSS comments, there is still an open issue in our list but there
is no real advocate for them (the CSS WG would be a good advocate).

In the meantime, I would suggest to have a look at the SAC proposal:
