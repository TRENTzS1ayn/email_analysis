Just one comment on the DOM Core Level 3 draft at this time:

 - Node.equalsNode():  the notion of Node equality does not seem to be
   defined anywhere; this needs to be done before test suites can be
   written.  In particular, what it means attribute and element nodes
   is not clear, especially in cases involving namespaces.
