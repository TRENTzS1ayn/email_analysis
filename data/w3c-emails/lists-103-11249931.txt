More comments on the "Load" portion of the DOM Load/Save Level 3
draft:

 - There is no way to create a DOMInputSource.  Since the
   DOMInputStream is already defined as a binding-specific type, the
   DOMInputSource should probably be defined as an interface.

 - Nothing is specified about the DOMReader type aside from its use as
   an attribute of the DOMInputSource interface.  Is this type also
   binding specific, or is there an API to create one from a
   DOMInputStream?  (Is it possible this is an excessive Javafication
   of the interface?)

 - I don't see anything that says what a DOMOutputStream should be;
   presumably this is a binding-specific type as well.
