This does need to be spelled out in more detail. I believe that's just
work-in-progress.

I think you can assume that structural equality would be defined as being
namespace-sensitive and prefix-insensitive for namespaced nodes, since
that's the semantically meaningful view of the document. For non-namespaced
nodes. For non-namespaced nodes, I'd presume the nodename would be used; we
said that localname was null for those so there isn't much alternative.
