that's a little odd since the 'color' attribute sets the font color not the border. the 'border-*-color' sets individual colors and the 'border-color' sets all border colors. the problem is knowing wish of them take precedence. normally, for what i have seen, the one that is define last will take precedence to the other but I could be wrong
