Ian,

Yes, but the problem with this is that you cannot get the relative value (say "em") to another relative unit (say "px").  Most scripts deal with pixels.  

The spec is also not clear on if the unit is absolute can you convert it to relative using this method.  I see that you cannot convert from one relative to another, but what about from an absolute to a relative?

It all boils down to though that the need to be able to convert to pixels is great, no matter what unit is was declared with.  Of course I am talking about ONLY computed styles, not style declarations.

Jeff.

You mean:

   var CSS_MM = 7;
   style.getPropertyCSSValue('property').getFloatValue(CSS_MM);

...? See:

   http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Style/css.html#CSS-CSSPrimitiveValue

...for more details.
