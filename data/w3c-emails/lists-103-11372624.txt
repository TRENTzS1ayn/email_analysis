I would think that all computed values should be in pixels, but that is left
up to the implementation since it is stated that it must be done in pixels.
I have not tested this in Mozilla as of yet since it is still buggy, but I
can see where this can become an issue.

Let us say that the style is defined in points, the most convenient method
would be to just pass it along in points.  It would not require the browser
to interact with it's layout engine to calculate the value in pixels.  As
you can see, it depends upon how important speed is (both speed in coding as
well as processing) to the development team.
