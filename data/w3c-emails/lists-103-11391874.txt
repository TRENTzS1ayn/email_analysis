Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 Core Specification
Version 1.0
W3C Working Draft 26 January 2001
Section 1.2. DOM Level 3 Java Binding Extension
http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-DOM-Level-3-Core-20010126/core.html#Level-3-Java-Binding-Extension

defines DOMImplementationFactory source code.  
However that code is not repeated in Appendix B: Java Language Binding
http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-DOM-Level-3-Core-20010126/java-binding.html

More importantly, it is missing from the code distribution
http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-DOM-Level-3-Core-20010126/java-binding.zip

Is there an official version of DOMImplementationFactory available?  
Or might the explanatory example be intentionally omitted from the 
java bindings?  

Since the DOMImplementationFactory class is abstract, presumably 
defining it as part of the org.w3c.dom package (Core) is not 
a cause for collision with actual DOM implementations.

FWIW, example source code is attached.  It also inserts pertinent working-
draft prose as Javadoc into the section 1.2 source code.  It compiles OK.  
If accepted, a reverse Javadoc link back (@see DOMImplementationFactory) 
and corresponding explanatory javadoc prose ought to be also added to 
DOMImplementation.

all the best, Don
