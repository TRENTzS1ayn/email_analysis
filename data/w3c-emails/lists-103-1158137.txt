>There's no way to associate NOTATION or ENTITY nodes with a doctype node.

DocumentType's "entities" and "notations" attributes are NamedNodeMaps. You
can retrieve the appropriate NamedNodeMap, then use its setNamedItem
methods to add one of these definitions.

The real problem is that there's no factory method for NOTATIONs or
ENTITYs. And DOM Level 2 doesn't fix this.

Level 3 will have to, as part of the DTD/Content Model support.
