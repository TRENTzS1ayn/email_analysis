To quote the entire requirement:

    * The DOM XPATH interfaces SHOULD NOT return a "live" object, but 
      should return a list or iterator that will either reflect a 
      snapshot of the DOM tree at the moment the XPath query was 
      evaluated or will become invalidated if changes to the DOM tree 
      could affect its contents.
      
The object being referred to here is not the nodes, but rather the "list 
or iterator".  Perhaps the reference to a snapshot is misleading.  I 
believe that it is expected that nodes iterated or listed will be live, 
but the iteration or list containing those nodes is not live.
