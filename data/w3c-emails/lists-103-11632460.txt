Trust those obnoxious large tables in the grammar productions,
not the text explaining how they were derived from Unicode tables.

Subject: Unicode character classes and XML parser


> Sorry if this doesn't belong in the DOM forum, but the two addresses available for the XML list
from the W3C web site don't work.

> This has to do with parsing XML using Unicode. On page 29 of the (printed) specification, (at
http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-xml-20001006#CharClasses), it says, and I quote:
>
> Characters which have a font or compatibility decomposition (i.e. those with a "compatibility
formatting tag" in field 5 of the database -- marked by field 5 beginning with a "<") are not
allowed.
> Question from an implementor of the parser: does this mean xml excludes characters with
decompositions altogether (presumably to avoid normalisation issues), or does it mean xml
identifiers exclude such characters?
