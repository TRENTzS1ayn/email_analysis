This may probably be something right for the DOM mailing list,
a DOM implementation that consistently returns the same
object for the same underlying node allows you to use that
object to synchronize code that accesses that node.

For example, something like:

for(int i = 0; i < children.getLength(); i++) {
child = children.item(i);
      synchronized(child) {
//
//   do something unsafe

      }
}

Would work as intended if the same node is returned, but would
not block if independent objects were returned for the same node.

Does (or should) DOM 3 address this by adding a getMutex() or 
similar method, something like:

for(int i = 0; i < children.getLength(); i++) {
child = children.item(i);
      synchronized(child.getMutex()) {
//
//   do something unsafe

      }
}

Where an existing implementation that had a one-to-one correspondance 
between nodes and objects could just return "this" for getMutex().
