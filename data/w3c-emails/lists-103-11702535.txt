Hi:

I am implementing the DOM Core Level 3 functionality in Java for and
have some questions about the Node3 methods.

1. BaseURI - do you have examples of BaseURIs for nodes?  Are these the
same as namespace URIs for a node which belongs to a namespace?

2. Document Order - it is clear to me what tree order represents, but
what does document order represent?  How is it different from tree
order?  Are there any examples of this available?

3. lookupNamespacePrefix/URI - What does the spec mean by starting from
this node?  Is it this node and its ancestors?

4. normalizeNS - are there examples of unnormalized trees and normalized
trees to reference?

If anyone has input to help me, it would be greatly appreciated.  In
general, if a DOM is being built via SAX2, is there enough information
to support the namespace functions in DOM Core Level 3 without
modifications to SAX2?

-MA
