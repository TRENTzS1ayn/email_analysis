Joseph:

So how do we deal with the following scenarios:

1. We have a prefix without a namespace URI declaration.  Do we remove
the prefix?  Do we create a bogus namespace URI?  How do we manufacture
declarations?

2. How do we handle ambiguous nodes - children of a namespace node that
may have ancestors from another namespace.  I assume the most direct
parent wins.

Most of the other situations are easy except for the comment about how
to handle read-only nodes.

Any thoughts?  How far along is the Xerxes reference implementation?
