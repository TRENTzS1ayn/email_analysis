Yes.

To distinguish it from DOM nodes in the instance-document tree, which are a
distinctly different datatype. Or from NodeCM, which is the content-model
extension API for instance-document Nodes.

Yes, we know this is a bit less than self-evident. Some (many?) of these
interfaces are likely to be renamed some time soon, both to improve clarity
and because the whole chapter is being renamed to "Abstract Schema".
