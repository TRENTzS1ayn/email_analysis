>the DOM is lacking in the way that if deals with visual displays.

More accurately: The DOM does not attempt to deal with visual -- or any
other -- specific rendering at this time. The Views chapter would have
taken about a half-step in that direction, but is currently shelved, and I
don't think it would address your scrollbar in any case.

The DOM per se is just a model of the document. If your document language
has a way to describe scrollbars, the DOM can represent that description.
Connecting that description to the actual rendering is arguably out of our
scope, since it really isn't part of the document but part of how the
document is being processed.
