(b) is certainly more useful to a client-side web
developer.  (a) is redundant with the information
which can be found by accesing the rules of the style
sheets, but there is no easy way to find out (b),
which represents what the user agent actually renders.

What should getComputedStyle return in ie5.0 (if it
was supported) for one of the border-style
declarations that is mapped to solid?  As far as I can
tell, the computedStyle would be the style declared,
even though the rendered style is solid.
