Since font-family is not relative, there is no reason for its specified
value and computed value to differ. Hence, a.

Note, however, that canonicalisation rules for CSS values may make that:

   "Helvetica", "Arial", sans-serif

i.e., font-family names would get quoted. (Canonicalisation of CSS values
is an open issue for CSS3.)

(Either way it is definitely not b (since all fonts can get used depending
on what glyphs an element with that font-family might contain).)
