This is a very narrow attitude.  If this is the W3C DOM WG's attitude then why is CSS even part of the DOM?  Style is a visual representation of the document.  Style is nothing without the implementation.  

Since GetComputedStyle is about the representation, then it should reflect HOW the implementation is representing the style.  Period!  Thus answer b should be correct.

Jeff.

Well, the 'window' and 'navigator' etc. objects that
can be accessed via scripting languages seem to be
useful for web developers, too, but they reflect the
implementation, the envoirement, whatever you like, to
provide access to these interfaces is outside the
scope of the DOM. The DOM does not care if there is
something installed on the system, if the user agent
is able to render this or that and so on, the DOM just
reflects the document and all informations actualle are
_in the document_. The computed value of a CSS property
value relies on style declarations for other nodes, not
on anything else.

The DOM works even without something that renders something,
that's a good thing and we shouldn't change that.

If the specified value is 'solid', the computed value will
be 'solid', too, since 'solid' is an absolute value.
