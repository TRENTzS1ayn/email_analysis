The NIST Java Test domimplementationFeatureNoVersion basically
calls asserting that docimpl.hasFeature("XML","") == true.

The DOM Level 2 spec says this about the version parameter:

version of type DOMString 

This is the version number of the feature to test. In Level 2, the string can be either "2.0" or "1.0". If the version is not specified, supporting any version of the feature causes the method to
return true.

The most obvious way of "not specifying" the version would be to call
docimpl.hasFeature("XML",null).

It would probably be good to add an explicit test with a null version parameter
and to clarify the spec on how a zero-length version parameter should be interpreted.
