>1) How do I set the version

DOM Level 2 and before have not standardized this. (See
http://www.w3.org/DOM/faq.html#XMLdecl) DOM Level 3 will close this gap, by
adding a version field to the Document and Entity intefaces.


>2)  how do I print it?

DOM Level 2 and before have not standardized this. DOM Level 3 will close
this gap, as part of the Load/Save module. Until that's ready, you're going
to have to either implement your own solution, or use one of the many
available "off the shelf" -- most XML parsers also come with an XML
serializer tool.
