perhaphs, one of you could clearify this issue.

is it the responsibility of the 'importNode' function to take care of ID
attributes? i mean, should it investigate all imported attributes, if they
are of type ID and register them to the document, such that a subsequent
call to 'getElementById' really returns the expected result node. if the
'importNode' function does not care about ID attributes, the
'getElementById' is sort of useless after a call to 'importNode'. moreover,
the application has no means to find out what attributes are of type ID and
no way to register IDs to a document.
i am aware of the fact that this can only work, if the attributes are of the
same implementation.

xerces-j for instance, does not care about the IDs. but i think this is not
the right solution. in a current project, i realized that importNode is
useless as it is, if you need IDs.
