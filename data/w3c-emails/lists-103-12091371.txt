    That is a very interesting point. On top of that, I would also like to ask a
question about how fixed and defaulted attributes should be handled in a
importNode() operation.
    As we all know, importNode() is desigend to reflect the syntactic content of
the XML it describes, thus, importNode() does not import fixed and defaulted
attributes(more exactly, it only imports attributes directly expressed in the
document instance).
    My question is, what is the method to restore the fixed and defaulted
attributes in the DOM tree that has imported these nodes (which may conform to a
different DTD)?
    I believe that importNode() is not useful if it does not preserve both the
syntax and semantics of the content being imported. Without that, the document
importing the nodes only gets "half the picture".

    Any comments would be appreciated.
