>I thought an interface could not be instantiated

True. But normally you directly instantiate only the DOMImplementation
object, and thereafter create other DOM object only through the DOM's
factory methods. This hides the details of exactly which classes are being
instantiated... which is a good thing, since any reference to those
specific implementation classes is, by definition, nonportable.
