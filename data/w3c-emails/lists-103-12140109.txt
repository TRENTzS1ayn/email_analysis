Section 1.6.5 of the DOM Level 2 Events specification lists the various
event types defined by the HTMLEvents module, and specifies which HTML
elements may generate those events.  I believe that some clarifications
are needed here.

1) The wording for the load event is vague.  It implies that it applies
   to the BODY tag in addition to the FRAMESET and OBJECT tags, but it
   does not explicitly state that, as it does for the unload event.
   Also, it is common practice to implement "load" for IMG tags as
   well.  Was this omitted intentionally or is it an oversight?

2) The abort event traditionally applies to IMG tags, and the
   description of this event mentions images, but then says that it
   applies only to the OBJECT tag.  Shouldn't it also apply to IMG tags?  

3) The error event traditionally applies to IMG tags, and the
   description of this event mentions images, but then says it applies
   to OBJECT tags but not IMG tags. Shouldn't it also apply to IMG tags?

4) The resize and scroll events do not specify which tags they apply
   to.  Do these apply to the BODY and FRAMESET tags, or do they only
   apply to the View (Window) object that displays the document?  If the
   latter, then does the spec need to mention somewhere that View
   implementations must also implement EventTarget

5) The spec says that the focus and blur event types apply to BUTTON,
   INPUT, LABEL, SELECT, and TEXTAREA elements.  The HTML 4 transitional
   DTD also supports these event types on A and AREA tags, however.
   Were A and AREA intentionally omitted, or was this an oversight?

Thanks for any clarifications!
