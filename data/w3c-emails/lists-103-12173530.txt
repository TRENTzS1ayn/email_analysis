That's actually what we plan to have. In addition, the code you can see
in the public draft is out of date. We now have something much more
powerful which allows to fetch an implementation based on a set of
requested features.

All of these cases give "unordered".

I agree the name is misleading. It should really be called something
like getDescendantsByTagName(). Now, do we need another method for
immediate children? I personally think people are really lazy, the cost
of looking for this themselves by walking the list of children is minor
and there is little hope the implementation can do better. But users
always want more... So, I'll bring it up to the Working Group.

That's an interesting idea. I'll forward that one to the WG too.
Thanks for your input!
