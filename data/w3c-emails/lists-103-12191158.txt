Amen, but then they post a question on svg-developer or some other
forum thinking it is a bug instead of a feature and then need to
be taught how to iterate on nodes.

If the DOM was local and in-memory, I would agree, but if the DOM is 
out-of-process or a API for a datastore, then the difference could
be pretty substantial.  

Also, it is a place where users who aren't concerned about 
portability will go use implementation specific methods like
selectNode() and selectSingleNode()in MSXML.  Definitely not
suggesting adding calls that require an XPath implementation,
but I would think an audit of the uses of selectNode()
and selectSingleNode() would find that the pattern is almost 
always a tagName and that comparable DOM methods would be
widely used.

I'm not sure what the answer to that one is, but it is a pain.  If you
look at the NIST ECMAScript DOM 1 tests, they were trying to examine
message strings and reading tea leaves to
try to guess what exception was intended.  Of course,
logic was specific to a particular implementation (MSXML) in
a particular locale (US English).  It might be something that is 
specific to the ECMAScript binding, since it doesn't affect Java
implementations.
