I believe the problem is that there is no conforming implementations built into a browser as yet.  The closest I have run into is Mozilla and it has it's bugs.  The one that applies to this is that the DOM constructors are NOT exposed until an object of that type is constructed first.

Example:

The Range object constructor is not exposed until you create one first.

//example code
alert( Boolean( Range ) );  //alerts false;
document.createRange();
alert( Boolean( Range ) );  //alerts true;

This is a major weakness.

Jeff.
