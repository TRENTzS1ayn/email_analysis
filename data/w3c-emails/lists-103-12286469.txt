version of type DOMString
This is the version number of the feature to test. In Level 2, the string
can be either "2.0" or "1.0". If
the version is not specified, supporting any version of the feature causes
the method to return true.

The NIST tests expects impl.hasFeature("XML","") to return true basically
interpreting "version
is not specified" in the previous paragraph to at least include "version is
zero length string".
It would be good if the paragraph could clarify this saying, for example,
"the version is null or an zero length string"
