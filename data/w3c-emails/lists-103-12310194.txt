Hi all.

I just started using the DOM, and I have a simple question:  How come 
there's no "setNodeName" method?  If you're passing a node to a subroutine 
to have it filled (for example, you're converting C++ objects into XML 
nodes), that routine has no way to set the name except some roundabout 
construction of a temporary node and then a use of the = operator.

Regards,
Gavin Stokes
