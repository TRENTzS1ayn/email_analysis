While implementing DOM2 traversal I think I've found a missing exception in
the treeWalker interface. When setting the currentNode shouldn't a
WRONG_DOCUMENT_ERR be raised if currentNode is set to a node in another
document.

Otherwise a treeWalker could be created in one document and then used to
walk another document that has a compleatly different implementation.
