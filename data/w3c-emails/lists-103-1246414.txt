Hmm. True. I keep forgetting that.

>Like I said, the RFE is **for DOM L2**

I think the decision has been made to address DTD support in Level 3, and
since that will cover your RFE -- and since it's _long_ after Last Call for
Level 2 -- I think you'll have to wait. Default attributes have the same
problem; we specified their read behavior but there's still no way to build
the data structures required to support them.

I wanted DTD support in Level 1, and Level 2. Didn't happen. We can try to
expedite Level 3...
