Hi again : )

Two clairifications, better safe then sorry...

The treeWalker says that whatToShow skipping takes precidence over the
filter. Does that include if the filter returns FILTER_REJECT? I.e., if the
filter would return FILTER_REJECT for an element but elements are masked in
whatToShow would the treewalker step into that elements children?

Does nodeIterator or treeWalker ever step into the attributes of an element?
I would expect not, but the whatToShow filter has a bit for attribute nodes.
