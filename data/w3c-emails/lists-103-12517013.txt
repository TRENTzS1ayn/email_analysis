Yes. That's why we were explicit about the order in which these tests are
applied. There were good performance reasons for doing it this way. If you
want the other behavior you can get it by moving the node-type test into
your filter, so this shouldn't be a problem.

See the descriptive text for SHOW_ATTRIBUTE.
