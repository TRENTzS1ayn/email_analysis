Doh! I thought I've fine-combed the spec but I guess I've just skimmed over
the constant definitions.

However there is actually one minor detail that is a bit incorrect. The
attribute flag is also meaningful for the treeWalker when currentNode is set
to an attribute or a decendant thereof. But this is obvious (maybe an
editorial fix would be nice).
