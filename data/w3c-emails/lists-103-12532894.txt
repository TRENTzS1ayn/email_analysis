I could be nitpicking here, but really says that all decenats of entity
references should be FILTER_REJECTed. But I guess that's not the intent if
currentNode of a treeWalker is set to a decendant of an entity reference. So
something like:

"The value of this flag determines whether the children of entity
reference nodes are visible. If false, the enity reference will
appear to have no children."

maybe?
