May I point out that, as a matter of fact, the DOM is already defined in
XML? As described in the Production Notes [1], the spec (HTML), the IDL
definition, the Java and ECMAScript bindings are generated from a single
XML source document.
For historical reasons, this is not achieved with XSL, but I would
expect this to be possible. The DOM WG has actually discussed several
times the idea of switching to XSLT, the only reason we haven't done so
is a lack of resources. A lot of time has been spent on developing the
tools we currently use and, while admittedly it would be very neat to
do, we just can't afford doing so.
