Been mulling over this issue in netscape.public.mozilla.dom, and
wondering if there's an existing DOM route for accessing the containing
FRAME/OBJECT from within a contentDocument that I may have overlooked,
or if this possible requirement has been overlooked in the DOM.

(OK, so generally within existing browsers there are ways of accessing
the containing FRAME or OBJECT, as long as it's been given a 'name'
attribute. But it doesn't seem satisfactory that this should be left to
proprietory properties relying upon a sometimes deprecated attribute.)


Perhaps what's required is a property of Document, maybe along the lines
of:

 contextElement of type Element, readonly 
      This is a convenience attribute that allows direct access to
      the node that is the "IFRAME", "FRAME" or "OBJECT" containing
      element of the document, or null if there is no such element.
