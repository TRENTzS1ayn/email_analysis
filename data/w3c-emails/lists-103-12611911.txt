Folks: If you're going to recommend JDOM over the standardized, portable
W3C DOM, please at least have the courtesy to say _why_ you're steering
folks in that direction so we can discuss whether your advice makes sense.
There are some things that JDOM does make more convenient, but there are
also downsides to using it... and if folks asked the question here on the
www-dom mailing list rather than on XML-DEV, it'd be sorta polite to at
least initially assume they want a DOM-specific answer.

(I'm not intimately familiar with JDOM, but as far as I can tell from what
little I do know, it _doesn't_ have strong advantages over the DOM for this
case. Either way, you have to loop over the <company> elements, then
retrieve and process the desired children thereof. JDOM may have a few
minor convenience methods like getChildText which could be helpful, but
that's really not a huge reduction in programming effort.)
