Most XML parsers come with some sample programs. Have you tried looking at
those?


The DOM provides a structured view of your document, but you have to walk
through that view yourself to obtain the data. There are some tools which
can help simplify this process -- the getElementsByNodeNames() method, the
NodeIterator/TreeWalker added in DOM Level 3, which can help you jump to
the points you're interested in.

To retrieve the contents of an element, even when those contents are just
text, you must examine the children of that element.


That should get you started in the right direction...
