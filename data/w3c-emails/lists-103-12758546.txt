Mozilla/Netscape 6 has a security model that makes a lot of the DOM not
work. Although this is ok, there are some lines that get blurred - i.e.
which parts of the contentDocument of a frame can one domain access of the
site in the frame? Obviously the title can't hurt anything, and it would be
good if there was a security recommendation to make problems not occur
because of differing security models in browsers.

Thanks for your time.
