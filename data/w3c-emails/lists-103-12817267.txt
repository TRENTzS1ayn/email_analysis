Not exactly the way to go but Dominique (the human behind web-human@w3.org)

Currently, it was the intended line. There is no way to validate _again_ a
document once it has been loaded in a DOM tree. One of the goals of the Content
Model
API is to give you access to the "validator processor". On the other hand, this
paragraph needs work, at least the first sentence.
