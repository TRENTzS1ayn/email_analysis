Oh yeah, I almost forgot, in respect to number 4. This is really a killer as
I have learned with Mozilla. There are certain things on the page you really
need to access, such as the URL. frame.src doesn't change (which I
personally think is an errata in the DOM and HTML specs) when you change
pages in the frame unlike images, which change. So say you wanted to have a
fake browser by putting a form and an iframe. There would be no way to know
when someone clicks on a link in the iframe which page they went to. There
are two ways to solve this: allow certain parts of a document in the frame
to be accessed (such as the title and the URL). The other way is to fix the
obvious errata in the specs. I think both should be undertaken.

Now, the second issue is document.domain - Although it is good start to
allowing cross-domain access in frames, it is not without problems.

Problem 1:
Example is two pages on geocities. If you allow domain-based access to
frames in security, that gives two sites on geocities access to each other,
which is probably no problem because they have nothing that needs to be
secure, but its just an example.

Problem 2:
You have your site strewn across many domains. Setting them all to the same
document.domain would give any site on that domain access to all the
documents.

***Solution:
create document.friends which would be a linked list of domstrings which are
directories, ips, domains, or files anywhere on the web that have access to
this document. The strings could also have wildcards in them.

for instance, say you wanted to do *.netscape.com or
http://www.netscape.com/blah/de/dah*

Addressing this soon would make some of your fellow dom experts which I know
from Netscape (and make me look clueless about the dom :) probably very
happy since they are constantly harassed about the security model breaking
sites that have frames.

Thanks for your time.

Not addressed by DOM 1, 2 or 3. Our issue list still has this item but
again,
not sure about its future yet.

[[[
1.9. Security, Validity and Privacy [After Level 1]

Security, validity, and privacy considerations are interrelated and
entwined. DOM
will initially provide simple
"sandbox" security; subsequent levels are expected to incorporate more
sophisticated mechanisms.

  1.Each object must be responsible for maintaining its own internal
consistency.
  2.It must be safe to have multiple threads operating on the same object.
  3.Object locking must be incorporated to ensure consistent results.
  4.It must be possible to prevent scripts on one page from accessing
another
page.
  5.Firewall boundaries must be respected.
  6.It must be possible to restrict access and navigation to specific
elements.
  7.An external security API will be provided.
