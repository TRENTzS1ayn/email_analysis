Hi there,
I am new in the HTML, DHTML, XML, DOM etc.
I recently studied HTML and DHTML and learned about the DOM at very high level. Now I want to skill myself to start using the DOM in practice.
There is so much information on the W3C.ORG site that I really don't know where to start.
 
I am currently looking for some very good books, reference manuals on DOM objects, their functionalities, methods, properties and behaviours.
Maybe somebody can help me by sending me some references (as ISBN numbers etc.).
 
I appreciate any help on this.
 
Best regards,

Patrick
