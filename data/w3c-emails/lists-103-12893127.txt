Van, 

Danny Goodman's JavaScript Bible, 3rd edition (ISBN: 0764531883) covers the DOM.

I personally learned it via the specs.  They really are easy to follow, but to each there own.

www.xml.apache.org/xerces-j
and look at the examples provided along with the parsers,which would
really help.

along with are provided the explanations for the examples
