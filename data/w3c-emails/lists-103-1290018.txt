In short, you're arguing that all issues coming out of reviews
from now on will generally be ignored ... hence implying that
there is really no need for such reviews.  Last time I looked
at W3C process documents, that stage was called "REC" not "WD".

It's responses like that that give W3C a bad reputation in
terms of being a steward for standards.
