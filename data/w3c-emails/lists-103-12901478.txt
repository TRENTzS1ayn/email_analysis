Following a request from the Abstract Schemas editors to have public feedback
on the draft, here is a new version of the Abstract Schemas and Load and Save
specification (formerly known as "Content Models and Load and Save").

http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-DOM-Level-3-ASLS-20010607

To avoid confusion with the definition of Content Models in the XML
specification, we are using the term "Content Model" anymore:

[[[
[Definition: In this case, the constraint includes a _content model_, a
simple grammar governing the allowed types of the child elements and the
order in which they are allowed to appear.]
]]]
