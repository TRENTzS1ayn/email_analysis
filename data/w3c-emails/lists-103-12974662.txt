I think this mailing list answers DOM specific questions only.

Anyway regarding your question for this occassion:Combining two .xml files

Is it possible in the first case?
ans: Yes it is possible.

How do i combine them to form one .xml file.
ans:Initially combine the two dtds in to one .Using the concept of embedding
a dtd inside another one.
    Say call one parent.dtd and the one inside it, child.dtd.Use ENTITY
parameter.
    Now you can have one .xml file conforming with parent dtd.
