The following is just personal observation.

There have been several posters in the last few days who have asked some
how-to questions and some have expressed frustration that they did not quick
responses.  www-dom@w3.org is primarily a forum for public discussion of DOM
working drafts and detailed questions about specific points in the DOM
recommendations.  General how-to questions are best asked in forums
particular implemention that you are using such as:

Microsoft MSXML:
news:microsoft.public.xml
http://msdn.microsoft.com/newsgroups/default.asp?URL=/newsgroups/loadframes.
asp?icp=msdn&slcid=us&newsgroup=microsoft.public.xml
