I need to include in a datasection information encriptada, but inside this information there are zeros that it doesn't include me the characters after the zero when recovering the chain with a getnodevalue, however if I use the explorer if it recovers all the characters.  
  
that I can make to read the information of the cdatasection?

ahead of time thank you for the help that you/they can offer me.
