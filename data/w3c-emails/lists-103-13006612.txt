The DOM doesn't actually restrict the contents of most of
its strings, though individual implementations may do so.

However, the XML grammar _does_ restrict what characters may
appear in an
XML document. Numeric character references can't violate
those rules. CDATASections don't change what's legal; they
just provide
an alternative to the numeric character referencs.

If you need to represent characters which XML wouldn't
permit, you have to implement an encoding scheme in your
applications. The usual approach is to use a base-64
encoder/decoder, which is a fairly traditional solution to
expressing arbitary binary data as character streams.

Also remember that in some languages (such as C), the zero
character is taken as end-of-string; you may find that you
need to use a different string library to process the
contents of this file.
