I can't provide you with any history. However, if you can save to a file,
you can also save to a String? You didn't mention whether you use Xerces-C
or Xerces-J? With Xerces-J it is possible to do this without reams of code:

----------------------------------------------
import org.apache.xml.serialize.XMLSerializer;
import java.io.StringWriter;
...
Document document = ...;

StringWriter writer = new StringWriter();
XMLSerializer serializer = new XMLSerializer();
serializer.setOutputCharStream(writer);
serializer.serialize(document);
String serializedXML = writer.toString();

System.out.println(serializedXML);
----------------------------------------------

With future Load/Save implementations, you could of course create a similar
construction.


Hope this helps,
