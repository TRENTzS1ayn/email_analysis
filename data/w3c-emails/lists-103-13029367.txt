Hi,

DOM hasn't  the opposite method ( XML(String) --> DOM  or XML(File) --> DOM)
like to do this you need a parser (and it isn't into the DOM specification)
to "serialize" a DOM tree you need a DOM Serializer

Usually parsers have both of this features (XercesJ...for instance).
Another important think is that DOM serialization is implementation
independent - Xerces serialization use the tree at Document-Element level.

btw, serialization is easy to do.
