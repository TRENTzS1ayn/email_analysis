Philippe,

What's the status on the DOM Bindings Repository and the DOM Bindings
Submission process? I've got a binding that I'd like to submit, but it
doesn't look like the procedure for doing so is quite in place yet (some
links at http://www.w3.org/2001/01/DOMBindings are still 404). Do I go ahead
and make a formal DOM Binding Submission request to this list now? I'd like
to follow the DOM Bindings Submission template at
http://www.w3.org/2001/01/DOMBindingsTemplate, but it isn't there. What
should I do?
