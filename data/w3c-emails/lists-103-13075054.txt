  Hallo...

  I'm doing a University Project and I'm begin to study about DOM.

  I'd like to know:
- how can i get DOM, it has aready been installed in my computer (I've IE 5.0)?
  If it's not, how can i install DOM?
  If it's aready installed, i've to have some software or make some 
configurations do use that? Or i can use normally?
- About Levels of DOM: These Levels - level 1, level 2 and level 3 - are just 
to separate the definitions of DOM, or it's to be installed, or something like 
that?  

   Please, these are simple difficulties, but if i don't discover these things 
it'll be hard to improve in my Project.
  
   Thank you.
