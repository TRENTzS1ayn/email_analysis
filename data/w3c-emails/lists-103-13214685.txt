The DOM Working Group is currently thinking about removing the key attribute
from DOM Level 3 Core [1].

The original idea for the attribute was to address the user data problem: being
able to attach an information to a Node (see also [2]).  The current proposal
is supposed to be simple and to address all use cases: unique identifier for a
Node and several applications can use it at the same time without conflicts. It
avoids addressing cloning or copying Node issues. It requires Events support
to know if a Node has been removed in shared DOM environnements.

In a discussion regarding isSameNode [3] and especially the isSameNode-3 issue,
it appeared that the key proposal is too simple, doesn't address really user
needs,
and nobody in the WG seems really happy with it. A common approach to address
all use cases doesn't seem useful enough.

So, we are seeking for feedback on the key attribute: do you have a good reason
to keep the key attribute in DOM Level 3? Does it address your needs? Is
isSameNode enough?

Bests regards,

Philippe
