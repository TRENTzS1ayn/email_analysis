Hi,

I have a small question which I could not find in your archives.
It is as follows:
Can I insert HTML or text at a particular location in the text
enclosed betwen tags.
I mean suppose if I have a paragraph tag like this enclosing 7 lines
betwwen the tags.
Can I insert some HTML programmatically after line 3, for eg..?
If yes how do I do it?

<P>
line 1:Kolkata, June 20: The Justice Manoj Mukherjee Commission
probing the mysterious line 2:disappearance of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose
has recorded an affidavit by a freedom line 3:fighter who claimed to have
met Netaji in Myanmar in 1954, years after Bose reportedly line 4:died
in the Taihoku air crash. Mubarak Mazdoor, who described himself as a
freedom line 5:fighter and close associate of Jawaharlal Nehru and
Rafi Ahmed Kidwai, said in the line 6:affidavit that Netaji had been
living in the guise of a Buddhist monk named 'Mong' in the line 7:
Golden Pagoda in Myanmar when he had met him. 

</P>

Anticipating a positive response. I would appreciate it.
Thanks
Deepika.
