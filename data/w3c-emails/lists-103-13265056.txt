>how do I put these changes back into the original xml file?

At this time, the DOM has no interfaces for either parsing a DOM from XML
text or writing it out to XML text. DOM Level 3, now in development,
intends to close that gap. But until you can find an implementation which
supports Level 3, the answer is that you have to use application code to do
this.

Most parser packages also come with a "serializer" -- either as a sample
program, or as a utility library, or both. Check your docs. If yours
didn't,  you get to either swipe-and-adapt one from another source (eg the
version Apache is using in Xerces) or write your own.
