It is. No matter where we come down on whether it's
acceptable for them to be there, if they do exist they must
at least have the value ""; that's standard Attr behavior
and the DOM provides no alternative. And datatypes have to
be right. So these points need to be fixed whether or not
the extra attrs are considered acceptable.

BTW, note that if you take the out of saying "this a DOM
after it has been prepared for this application", that
permits doing almost anything to the document... which would
make testing against a source document something of a moot
point. That's either a problem or an escape hatch, depending
on your point of view...

For me, that's the key point. The downside of standards is
that you have to live with them, at least until you can
convince everyone to amend them. The upside is that so does
everyone else, which is a win for the customers.
