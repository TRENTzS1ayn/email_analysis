Hi everyone:
    I have three questions(maybe more) when reading<Document Object
Model
Events> of DOM2 spec.
    first, Bubble and Capture are two propagation mechanisms in event
model,
but why not broadcast or other more.?Are there any demand on the
mechanism
selection?
    second, are there any implementation of the event model APIs now?
    third, i am not very sure about the application of this event model
in document
behavior.
