It wasn't a top priority at the time, and since it can (and frequency has)
been implemented on top of the DOM Level 1 APIs it wasn't a showstopper.
It's being addressed now in DOM Level 3.

Meanwhile, DOM serializers are commonly available off-the-shelf items,
shipped with most DOMs and/or DOM parsers and avaiable as open-source
freeware,  so the "onerous task" has probably already been done for you.
Since you said you're using Xerces,  see the Apache serializer classes
included with it, or the serialzers used in Xalan which support some
additional features required by XSLT.
