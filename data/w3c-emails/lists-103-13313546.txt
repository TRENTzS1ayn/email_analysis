Using isSameNode to maintain an external map of
associations to nodes would seem to have an enormous
overhead.  However, key() was so vague that it was
hard to write code that worked uniformly in different
languages.

I don't know if there might be some parallels between
the use cases for key() and those for XSLT's
generate-id() function that could be exploited.
