DOM L2 WD (as well as L1 spec indeed) appears to fail to be clear as to
what behavior to be expected when Node.replaceChild is invoked with its
newChild being a DocumentFragment. Other methods such as insertBefore
and appendChild are explicitly stated as being aware of DocumentFragment
on the other hand.

I suggest that DOM L2 be specific on this point.
I know of DOM implementations which behaves differently upon the operation
described above: one raises HIERARCHY_REQUEST_ERR exception, the other
succeeds so that the net result is the same as if removeChild was
called following insertBefore. This is not apparently a desirable
situation for DOM interoperability thus needs to be explicitly described
in the spec one way or the other.
