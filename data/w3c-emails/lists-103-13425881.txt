This is great, Philippe.

Now, where's that "DOM Bindings Submission template" [1] referenced from
"How to make or withdraw a DOM Bindings Submission request" [2]? I'd like to
make a formal submission, but I'd also like to follow a template to make
sure I do things correctly from the start. Is there any URL you can point me
to today to get the info I need to create a submission that has a high
probablity of being accepted?

Here is the page:

I'll link from the others as soon as I have bindings proposals.
