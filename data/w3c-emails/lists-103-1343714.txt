Good catch ! It's now listed in DOMException.

Fixed.

I'm not sure I understand your comment. CSSValue.CSS_INHERIT is not mixed with
primitiveType and you can't cast the CSSValue instance to CSSPrimitiveValue.

 I checked the latest public version [1] and there is a description for the
parameter cssText.

Fixed.

Two reasons:
- getPropertyValue also returns an empty string.
- Some existing implementations already return an empty string on item() and
getPropertyValue() and it was not possible to change that.

Thank you for your feedbacks,
