I was using the editors work version of the DOM Level 2 sources to generate
the bindings. I'll make sure to use the REC version to generate the
final version for the erratum.

Yes. Unfortunately, the XML sources don't contain enough meta informations
to know if an exception should be generated or not. I think it's better to
have this solution than having no documentation at all.

We should probably fix that in DOM Level 3 but it means modifying the
xmlspec DTD...
