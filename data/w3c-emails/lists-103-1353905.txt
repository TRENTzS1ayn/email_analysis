For these issues, the DOM WG decide to leave the current draft as it is.

The special system font shorthand issue:

In [1]
"system fonts can only be specified with this property, not with 'font-family'
itself, so 'font' allows authors to do more than the sum of its subproperties."

You can't set a longhand font property to a system value. And if we allow to
return a system value on a longhand font property, then the following example
will throw an exception if the shorthand font property (on myElement2) has a
system value:
myElement1.style.fontSize = myElement2.style.fontSize;

The border-color issue: 

We can't invent a new value for this case. The border-color will be only
effective in the computed style but the specified style will give you an empty
string.

Regards,
Philippe.
