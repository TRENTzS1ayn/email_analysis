Consider an element to be a container: it can contain multiple nodes of
various types. Although you could conceive of a model where an element
is just text, that would not be as useful as the DOM. Separating element
and text types is natural for an object model since they have different
characteristics. It is also natural in the sense that a program
responding to an XML message probably should behave differently toward
elements and text. 

The confusion people seem to have regarding this model also seems to be
easily clarified. Just remember that an element contains other nodes.
The "value" of an element is not really meaningful, it is the "content"
of an element that is meaningful.
