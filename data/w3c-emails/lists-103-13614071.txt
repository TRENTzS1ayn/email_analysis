1) A DOM implementation.
2) Probably a parser which can build a DOM from an XML text file.
3) Depending on what you're doing, maybe a serializer which will write out
a DOM's contents as an XML text file.

If your browser happens to provide what you need (I haven't looked at IE in
a very long time), that's one solution. Another is to use stand-alone
implementations of these datatypes and functions. The Apache Xerces project
contains all three of the above in both Java and C++ implementations; there
are others.
