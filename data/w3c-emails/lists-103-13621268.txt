  SOME DAYS AGO I HAD ASKED:

AND I GOT THE ANSWER:

go to http://xml.apache.org/dist/xerces-c/stable/

There you'll find the components you need under Windows.  You need to
download the zip files.  There are only two.  They contain example code and
the libraries and headers you need to include Xerces in a C++ application.


NOW, THE DOUBT IS:

 When i get this files, what should i do?
- Where i've to install that? (If i have to)
- To use this in my C++ files, i've to declarate something or not?
- Generaly, how will these files function in the DOM context?

   Thank you.
