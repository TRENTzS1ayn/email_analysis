Thank u. But when i give like this i am getting a compiling error

    DOMImplementation
domImpl=org.apache.xerces.dom.DOMImplementationImpl.getDOMImplementation();

saying  DOMImplementation  not found in type declaration. (i think must
becos DOMImplementation is a interface)

     But if i change DOMImplemetation to DOMImplementationImpl  this error
is fixed but i am not able to invoke createProcessingInstruction() method.
is there any work around for this?

Regards
Jayashree
