Take a look at http://technet.oracle.com/tech/xml/classgen/index.htm --
you'll need to register first, but this class generator can take as input an
XML Schema, and generate Java code that you can use to construct, etc.,
an XML document that is conformant to this XML Schema.

A C++ class generator that does the same thing ia also available but needs
to be staged on technet.

Email me directly if you need further details.
