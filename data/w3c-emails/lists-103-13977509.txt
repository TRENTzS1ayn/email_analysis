Is there a standard way to access the DOM implementation in a web page from
an applet within that page? Currently JSObject interfaces(live connect) is
the only way to access the DOM implementation in both NN and IE. I feel
there is a need for standardizing this interface (in future DOM versions )
so that future broadcast based tool may make use of this feature. Does
anyone else finds this useful ?

Reza
