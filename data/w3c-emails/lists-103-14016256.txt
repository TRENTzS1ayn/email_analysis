Hi there,

Both DOM level 1 and DOM level 2 contain clauses regarding default
attributes, e.g.

    "removeNamedItem
    Removes a node specified by name. When this map contains the
    attributes attached to an element, if the removed attribute
    is known to have a default value, an attribute immediately
    appears containing the default value..."

However, I cannot find any information concerning other DTD properties that
can be set on attributes, such as that they are fixed, required or that
their value must be one of an enumeration of values.

Did I read it correctly that the DOM-specification only deals with the
default value part of DTD-attributes, and not the other parts? And if so,
could anybody explain to me why only default attributes are dealt with? I
could for instance imagine that if you try to remove a required attribute,
you are not allowed to.

Thanks in advance for any replies,

--Sander.
