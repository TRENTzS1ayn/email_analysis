DTD support in DOM Level 1 and Level 2 is very incomplete; it was deferred
in the hope that we could produce a single solution that would work not
only for DTDs but also for XML Schemas. DOM Level 3 expects to close this
gap.

Because this seemed to be something we needed to do, and could not defer
and then add later without breaking behavior of existing applications.
