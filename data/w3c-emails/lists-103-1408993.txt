hasFeature has a version number ("2.0" for Level 2). Since most of 
the modules are optional, just asking whether an implementation 
supports Level 2 is equivalent to asking whether it supports Level 2 
Core, and not much use if, for example, you want to know if 
traversal is implemented.

They are, and it's now in the spec.

Agreed. Also in the spec now.

Fixed the text, and added an internal subset as a string.

We added a table to the introduction to list these. Thanks for the 
suggestion.

Corrext. Fixed,

We discussed this again, and "copyNode" didn't seem any better, 
so we're sticking with "importNode".

True.

We started work on this; quickly found that the simple solution 
didn't cover all the pitfalls so it will take more work to get right.
