The problem you are having is that namespaces are assigned at parse time,
or if you dynamically create elements/attiributes at creation time with
the createxxxNS(). Just moving an element into the "scope" of a default
namespace attribute will not assign it a namespace. In fact a nodes
namespace cannot be changed once it has been created.
