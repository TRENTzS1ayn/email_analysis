Other than trying it and letting it throw the exception, I presume
<smile/>.

Currently, the only officially-blessed condition under which nodes become
readonly is when they're within the value of an EntityReference. There is
some interest in coming up with a more official definition of read-only
documents or subtrees -- it's on the Open Isses list -- but at this time
it's unclear how much of that might or might not be included in DOM Level
3; it's not currently one of our top priorities, though the XSLT folks have
inquired about it since they want a way to say that their input tree Must
Not be altered during stylesheet processing.
