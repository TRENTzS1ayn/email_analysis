Hello all,

My name is Ryan.  I'm writing from the University of Waterloo (Canada)
and am new to the list.

Small-time nodeList question: is there an easy way to sort items of a
nodeList based on a comparable attribute?  Or is it just a matter of
creating a new tree and inserting sorted subtrees manually?

Thanks,

Ryan
