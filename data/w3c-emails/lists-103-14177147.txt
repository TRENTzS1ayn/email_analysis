DOM Level 2 Core

   core-5. 2001-01-17. [error]. [20]Node.hasFeature
          The sentence:

          To avoid possible conflicts, as a convention, names referring
          to features defined outside the DOM specification should be
          made unique by reversing the name of the Internet domain name
          of the person (or the organization that the person belongs to)
          who defines the feature, component by component, and using this
          as a prefix. For instance, the W3C SVG Working Group defines
          the feature "org.w3c.dom.svg".

          should read:

          To avoid possible conflicts, as a convention, names referring
          to features defined outside the DOM specification should be
          made unique.
