It's probably actually rejecting the unclosed <icinde_not> element.  You
can mark it as empty by inserting a '/' before the closing '>'.  Or,
if it really is the characters the parser is not accepting, you can
either replace them with character references, or specify the
character-set
in use in the xml declaration at the top.
