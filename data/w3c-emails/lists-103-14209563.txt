What you do to get around the non-latin Character problem depends on how
often those Characters are used in your XML Document.

You may want to look into the ISO Character Sets found here
http://www.altheim.com/specs/charents.html and xml:lang attribute and also,
the use of XML Entities.

To use the ISO Character Sets you insert the needed ISO number inside the
xml prolog (the first line)
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-9" ?>
This is if your document is written in a language other than the regular
ASCII code or UNICODE Characters.

You would use the xml:lang for Element(tags) and their childElements that
are written in the other Character code. It is usually used in cases where
documents contain multiple languages (it overrides the language declaration
in the XML prolog)

Or you can list your Characters in a DTD and create Entities out of them
(the coversion code), then in the XML document you insert the &entity;
instead of the actual Characters.

Hope this helps
:-)

It's probably actually rejecting the unclosed <icinde_not> element.  You
can mark it as empty by inserting a '/' before the closing '>'.  Or,
if it really is the characters the parser is not accepting, you can
either replace them with character references, or specify the
character-set
in use in the xml declaration at the top.
