The obscur reason was that the user should not be able to modify the linking
element through the stylesheet itself. Even if this reason is obvious for
the href attribute, this is not especially the case for type and title. In
case, media should be harmonized with type and title. But, if the media list
is readonly, the MediaList interface becomes almost useless.

I would say yes but we might need to reconsider the readonly issue before going
further.

I would say yes too. If you change the media attribute in the CSS import rule,
you'll expect the media list to be updated, won't you?
