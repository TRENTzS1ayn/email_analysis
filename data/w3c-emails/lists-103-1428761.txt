The DOM WG discussed this and decided to wait for the DTD 
support that will be part of Level 3 for this.

Added for Document; we'd want a good use case for  
DocumentFragment, or indeed any Node, since the cost of 
implementation could be quite high.

The DOM currently does not do such checking except for XML 
Names; the rest will be in Level 3.
