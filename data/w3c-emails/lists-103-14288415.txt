Please see highlighted typographical errors:

descendant 
A descendant node of any node A is any node below A in a tree model
of a document, where "above" means "toward the root."  shouldn't his read:
where "below" means "away from the root."


equivalence 
Two nodes are equivalent if they have the same node type and same
node name. Also, if the nodes contain data, that must be the same. Finally,
if the nodes have attributes then collection of attribute names must be the
same and the attributes corresponding by name must be equivalent as nodes.
Two nodes are deeply equivalent if they are equivalent, the child node lists
are equivalent are equivalent as NodeList objects, and the pairs of
equivalent attributes must in fact be deeply equivalent. Two NodeList
objects are equivalent if they have the same length, and the nodes
corresponding by index are deeply equivalent. Two NamedNodeMap objects are
equivalent if they are have the same length, they have same collection of
names, and the nodes corresponding by name in the maps are deeply
equivalent. Two DocumentType nodes are equivalent if they are equivalent as
nodes, have the same names, and have equivalent entities and attributes
NamedNodeMap objects. 

root node 
The root node is the unique node that is not a child of any other
node. All other nodes are children or other descendents of the root node.

Isn't descendents misspelled? Shouldn't it be "descendants"?
