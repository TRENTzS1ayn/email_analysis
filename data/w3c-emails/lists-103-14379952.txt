Hi, All

One comment on new features of DOM3.

Node3:
------
  > textContent
  the attribute is one of possible rendering results. It will be
  just impossible to please all applications even if the attribute
  will be replaced by the method with a few arguments.
  Should DOM provide an attribute/method which address very limited
  amount of cases? Such a functionality can be easily implemented
  by an application on top of Node "navigation" APIs.

Misha
