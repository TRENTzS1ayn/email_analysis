Hi,

I've got a question on measuring HTML elements. IE and now Mozilla both
implement offsetWidth and offsetHeight. IE also has other properties for
getting the size of HTML elements such as scrollWidth and scrollHeight for
getting the content height of an element rather than what is actually
displayed (like a div with a size < content size). Measuring elements is
extremely useful when creating DHTML pages. I'm wondering why there is no
specification in the DOM for this kind of functionality? Is it an oversight,
or out of the scope of the DOM, or am I just missing something?

Thanks,

Cameron.
