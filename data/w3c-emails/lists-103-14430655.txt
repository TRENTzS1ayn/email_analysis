Hello

What happens if there are two validation errors in the same document?

Does the specification let me get both errors after trying to load the document once, or I do have to :

Load the document (1st time)
Get the error and fix it.
Load the document (2nd time)
Get the error and fix it
Load the document (successfuly)
