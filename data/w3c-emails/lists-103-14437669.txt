>What happens if there are two validation  errors in the same document?

The current DOM recommendation doesn't address  validation at all. DOM
Level 3's Load/Save and Content Model chapters will address this.

The answer will still probably be dependent upon your particular parser,
since recovering from an error and continuing to validate can sometimes be
challenging; some parsers may be more successful at doing so than others,
or may make more of an effort to do so. We're designing the API so that
multiple errors can be reported, but how well that works in practice is
probably going to wind up being a quality-of-implementation issue.

However, the Content Model chapter -- if implemented; it's going to be
optional -- will allow you to revalidate a DOM tree without having to
reparse it, which at least partly addresses your concern.
