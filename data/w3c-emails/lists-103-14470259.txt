It is a practical consideration to be able to set and retrieve information
on how the browser renders a page. I'm not a browser developer, but I'm sure
all browsers know the size of an element internally, surely they would have
to to be able to render a page. It would be great to have a standard way of
accessing this information.

I'm quite suprised this issue hasn't been covered in the DOM before.

It would definetly help anyone writing DHTML applications IMHO.
