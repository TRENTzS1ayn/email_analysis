But we haven't yet given them a better alternative, and I believe we aren't
ready to make a more explicit restriction until we've done so.

As a long-term plan, checking for this would be a good thing. When that
check will be added to the DOM spec, and when that check will actually be
performed, are yet to be determined. Probable answers at this time are "DOM
Level 3" and "only on demand".

(I believe we did actually discuss this question before releasing DOM Level
2, and the consensus was that enforcing this in the factory method would
have been premature at best. I'd have to dig into the archives to find an
explicit citation, and I'd rather not make that effort unless someone
thinks I'm misremembering...)
