There are actually two copyright notices for use with W3C 
specifications; one for documents and the other for software and 
DTDs/schemas. 

The software notice is at
http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-software.html

One possibility is to use this, with the proviso that Java bindings 
not use the org.w3c.* package, and that (as John Cowan proposed) 
a comment is added that the modified binding does not conform to 
any W3C standard.

Would this satisfy the needs of the open source community?
