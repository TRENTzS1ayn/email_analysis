Hi -

I was given a XML DOM parser to use on my project.  Does anyone have any
code examples (C++, Java, or Smalltalk) of how manuever around the tree?  I
can iterate thru it but I want to konw how to get to certain levels of the
tree or look for certain tags easily.  I have not yet found a way.  Thanks.
Kristi
