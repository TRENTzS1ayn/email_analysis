Hi

I've been reading the DOM 3 Content Model and Load and Save Specification
and have some questions. I would very much appreciate if someone could
comment on this.

+ the AttributeCM interface is said to inherit from Attr in page 31 but that
is not in the IDL definition. Is this an editing mistake?

+ The DocumentCM interface inherits from Document. Is there some relation to
the DOM::Document?

+ Still about the DocumentCM interface:
is  "CMExternalModel * getCMs" a valid IDL statment? Why isn't something
like CMExternalModelList specified?

Thanks and best regards
Ernesto Santos
