Hi,

Changing the value of a default attribute (Attr.specified = false) will
change it to a specified attribute, as does cloning and importing.

However, although the specification does have something to say on the
subject of changing the prefix of a default attribute, it isn't clear
wether or not the specified flag should be set to 'true' by the
implementation.

I infer that the specified flag should stay false; but I'd like to hear a
confirmation about this.
