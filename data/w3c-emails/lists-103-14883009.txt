4Suite is a collection of Python tools for XML processing and object
database management.  It provides support for XML parsing, several
transient and persistent DOM implementations, XPath expressions,
XPointer, XSLT transforms, XLink, RDF and ODMG object databases.

4Suite Server is a platform for XML processing.  It features an XML data
repository, a rules-based engine, and XSLT transforms, XPath and
RDF-based indexing and query, XLink resolution and many other XML
services.  It also supports related services such as distributed
transactions and access control lists.  Along with basic console and
command-line management, it supports remote, cross-platform and
cross-language access through CORBA, WebDAV, HTTP and other request
protocols to be added shortly.

4Suite Server is not meant to be a full-blown application server.  It
provides highly-specialized services for XML processing that can be used
with other application servers.

All the software is open-source and free to download.  Priority support
and customization is available from Fourthought, Inc.  For more
