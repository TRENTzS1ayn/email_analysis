GDOME_ELEMENT_NODE is not defined by the DOM. It sounds like you're asking
about a specific usage of the DOM, and we can't advise you on that.

In general, Node.childNodes is not required to contain anything. For
example, consider a Text node, which will never have any children.

The kinds of nodes which are permitted as children of each node type are
listed in a table in the DOM Core specification.
