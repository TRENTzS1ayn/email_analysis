The definition of version '1.0' is driven by the DOM Level 1 specification.
The DOM Level 2 specification doesn't say anything about
hasFeature('Core', '1.0') and I don't think it has to, given that you can't
expect a DOM Level 1 implementation to return true.
hasFeature('XML', '1.0') must definitively return true for a DOM Level 2
implementation since DOM Level 2 is build on top of DOM Level 1.
