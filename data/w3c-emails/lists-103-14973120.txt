1. (p.14) Why methods cloneCM() and cloneExternalCM() were included in
    interface CMNode?  Should cloneCM() belong to interface
    CMModel and cloneExternalCM() belong to interface
    CMExternalModel?  My argument here is a node can be of other
    types than CM_MODEL or CM_EXTERNALMODEL.  What happens
    if a node was not CM_MODEL and CM_EXTERNALMODEL types
    and cloneCM() or cloneExternalCM() were invoked?
2. (p.17) The element name along with the content specification in the
context
    of a CMNode[p.14].  However, I didn't see element's name get defined
any
    where.
3. (p. 12) getCMNodes() returns CMNameNodeMap, not CMNodeList?
    In the same interface, it has an insertBefore() method.  So, it says
that nodes
    in the content model is inserted in a certain order. Why not
returning an
    CMNodeList by getCMNodes()?
