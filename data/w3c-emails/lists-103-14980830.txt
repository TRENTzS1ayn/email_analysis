(p. 14) Issue key-2
   In what space is this key unique (Document, DOMImplementation)?

   Shouldn't this be DOMImplementation?  If a node3 can be adopted
   from one document into another and "key" is readonly attribute, "key"

   must be in the scope of DOMImplementation.

(p. 16) Issue isSameNode-2:
   Is this really needed if we provide a unique key?

   It seems to me isSameNode() is redundant if unique key can be
   truly unique within one specific DOMImplementation.
