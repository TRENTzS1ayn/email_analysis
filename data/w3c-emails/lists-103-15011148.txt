I am looking for the Mozilla equivalent of the following IE properties:

document.body.topMargin
document.body.leftMargin

Setting these values to zero in IE eliminates the narrow space between the 
edge of the IE browser and the contents of the window.

I am not able to position my applet at 0,0 in the browser window. It seems 
to be offset from the top left corner by about 15 pixels.
