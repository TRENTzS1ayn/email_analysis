Hi,

I found the description of CMChildren in the DOM3 CMLS module a bit 
unclear.  CMChildren is said to be "an element in the context of a 
CMNode".  On the other hand, the operation 
ElementDeclaration.getCMChildren() which returns a CMChildren is said to 
"gets content model of element".  "An element in the context of a CMNode" 
and "content model of element" do not sound equivalent to me.

I also have some problem understanding the following attributes of CMChildren:
- listOperator (whose description is "Operator list") and
- subModels (whose description is "Additional CMNodes in which the element 
can be defined").

Any clarification will be appreciated.

best regards,
Ernest Wan
