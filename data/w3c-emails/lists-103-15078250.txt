Sorry Ernest, no answer from me. I would just like to say that I am also
confused by these interfaces. I would like to say to potential answer givers
that it would be useful to have an example object-representation of the CM
with e.g. a DTD declaration like
    <!ELEMENT example (((child1, child2*)*) | child3+)>
because what kind of hierarchy of list-operators, CMChildren and submodels
would you get here?

Thanks in advance for helping us out,
