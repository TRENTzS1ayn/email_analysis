Excerpt from [1] :

    An implementation is expected to preserve all rules
    specified in a CSS style sheet, even if the rule is
    not recognized by the parser. Unrecognized rules are
    represented using the CSSUnknownRule interface.

Excerpt from [2] :

    The CSSUnknownRule interface represents an at-rule
    not supported by this user agent.

The two definitions of CSSUnknownRule seem inconsistent, the
latter dealing with at-rules only.
