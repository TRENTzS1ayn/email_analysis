CSSStyleDeclaration provides means to determine the style properties 
currently set in a block or to set style properties explicitly within 
the block. All methods in CSSStyleDeclaration assume that there is only
one answer per property name. But this is false, unless part of the
cascade is done :

   P { color : red ! important ;
       color : blue ;
       color : yellow ! important }

Without applying some of the rules of the cascade, the CSS OM cannot
answer that the value of color assigned in this block is |yellow| with
and cannot answer it is an important declaration.

Anyway, I think that the CSS OM should provide access to ALL explicitely
set values for a given property, in order of declaration, without
applying the cascade.
