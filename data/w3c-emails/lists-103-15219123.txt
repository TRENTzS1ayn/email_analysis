Since CMModel and CMExternalModel derives from CMNode, the WG decided to
provide a single "clone" method in the CMNode and other objects derived from
CMNode will inherit the cloning feature. But you are right, the names should
be just "clone" rather than cloneCM and cloneExternalCM. This is a mistake
and will be fixed in the next draft.

Thanks for finding the problem. We shall fix this in the next release.

The reason we have CMNameNodeMap so that you can find an the elements
easily, like finding an ElementDeclaration, AttributeDeclaration, etc.,.
With CMNodeList you have to loop through the list to get to a declaration.
Although the order is maintained by an underlying implementation. The WG
will evaluate whether we also need to expose the ordered set or not.
