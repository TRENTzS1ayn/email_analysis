I'll see who I can get to do this. 

At this stage, we 're discussing making the license be a mixture of 
the standard W3C software license, and the status of the DOM 
specification, which will probably look like 
1) the specification (excluding the bindings) is covered by the W3C 
document license
2) the bindings are under the software license, with the additional 
conditions (also that IDL bindings have to change the pragma prefix)
