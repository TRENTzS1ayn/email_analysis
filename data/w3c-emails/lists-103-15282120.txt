Hello DOM-World,
After working for a while with DOM2 and looking over the spec of DOM3, it 
still seems that there is no way to perform a truly object-oriented 
traversal of a DOM tree. Using the existing model, I can not see a way to 
traverse the DOM without actually using a switch statement based on node 
type.

This seems to me a fairly non-scalable, hard-to-maintain and inelegant way 
to traverse a tree of objects. I am sure it has been considered by the W3C 
to add the ability to use a visitor pattern or a similar object oriented 
design pattern for traversal to the node interface. I would like to 
understand why it has been decided against such an addition.

Given that the DOM is also used in many XML applications, the ommission of a 
good object oriented mechanism is particularly problematic.

In such an application it is likely that a class factory is used to create 
particular subclasses specific for each element type, providing specialized 
functionality for the application actually building the DOM from an XML 
file. Using a switch statement to call specialized functionality on 
traversal is, in my humble opinion, a very unsatisfactory way of action. Yet 
with the current DOM design there seems to be no alternative.

Please consider the addition of a simple visitor pattern interface to the 
node interface. After all, it is an extremely simple addition that can 
safely be ignored by anybody who does not desire to use it, yet permits to 
use the DOM as a primary configurable data structure in a larger scale OO 
application.

Thanks!

P.S:
The visitor interface would require:

In the node interface:
A method
accept(IVisitor v);

A new interface IVisitor which contains one method:
execute(Node n);

Implementations:
In a reference implementation of a class that implements the node if, this 
function would just be like this:
public void accept(IVisitor v)
{
    v.execute(this);
}
Subclasses of nodes that have children would additionally call
accept(v);
for each of their children.

Implementors of the IVisitor interface would implement overrides for execute 
that take as an argument the particular subclass of the node interface they 
are interested in.
