This question is specific to a particular DOM implementation; try the
support area for that DOM and parser.

(If it's Xerces/XML4J, the standard mistake that causes this problem is
mixing two different runtime libraries. See the documentation that comes
with the package, or the Xerces mailing list at http://xml.apache.org/)
