The DOM does not expose the namespace nodes. The main reason is that the
Infoset is not yet a recommendation.

Your example is wrong according to the Namespace recommendation and can't be
represented in a DOM document:
[[[
In XML documents conforming to this specification, no tag may contain two
attributes which:
  1.have identical names, or 
  2.have qualified names with the same local part and with prefixes which have
    been bound to namespace names that are identical.
