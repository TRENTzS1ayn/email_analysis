To:<www-dom@w3.org>

createElement method on L2 says in short that attribute nodes are automatically to
be created if any. Does this rule also apply to the new createElementNS method?

Next, I have the following issue.

What is the namespace name of the attribute which has been created auto by
DOM in cases where the prefix of the attribute's qualified name is "xml:" ?

Here is the example of DTD definition:

<!ATTLIST A xml:lang CDATA #FIXED "A LANGUAGE">

Will the attribute node gets created by DOM covertly as having
http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace as its namespace?

Namespaces REC states that xml: is bound to http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace.
Therefore naive users will assume that DOM is aware of it and creates the 
node properly.

In general, I know L2 makes namespace prefix and name independent by design.
However, the case shown above seems to me the one for which short description
should be added.
