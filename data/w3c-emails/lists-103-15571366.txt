If the NodeList returned by a DOM call isn't live, you can't claim to
comply to the DOM specification.

If you really want a non-live "snapshot" array, I would recommend that you
create a new class and a new method to retrieve it -- as long as you're
going to be incompatable anyway, you might as well make the difference
visible and official.
