Understood.

It's generally not a matter of "wanting a snapshot" as much as caring
whether or not the result of get_elements_by_tag_name() is or is not
live.  If one cares, be sure to select an implementation that does not
have that feature or it is disabled.

Like the Python folks, it's likely that the "core" XML modules in Perl
will be small and lightweight implementations, and possibly not 100%
conformant.  Whereas the larger, more conformant implementations will
be seperate add-ons.  By far, most if not all of our users seem very
comfortable with this approach.
