>If I have a readonly Document Node

At this time, there is no way to make a Document node readonly using the
standard DOM API. The only readonly nodes we currently support are those
within the scope of an EntityReference.

You could have a readonly Element node, of course.

>and I call getElementByTagName on it,
>should I return a readonly Nodelist?

There's no such thing as a writable NodeList (NodeLists can only be changed
by changing the source document), so the question isn't meaningful. Of
course the nodes within the NodeList are the same Node objects that appear
in the DOM tree, and hence may themselves be readonly.
