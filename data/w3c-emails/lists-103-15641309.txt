I'm afraid I really don't see a meaningful difference, in that case,
between calling mynode.accept(myvisitor)  and calling
myvisitor.execute(mynode) directly. A difference only arises when accept()
starts doing other things... and as I noted, the moment it does so you run
into compatability problems between your visitors and visitees, and I don't
see a way to define that cleanly at the API level.
