I agree with this decision based on experience.  4DOM implements a visitor 
pattern which predates DOM Level 2.  I have many times observed that 
NodeIterator and TreeWalker are much more natural idioms for DOM processing 
than our GoF-based visitors.

Too bad the liveness requirement makes performance such a problem, but that's 
a different story...
