A correct implementation does not model the <?xml version="1.0"?> tag; it
is not a Processing Instruction (even though some DOM implementations have
modelled the XML declaration as a PI Node). Besides, a PI doesn't have
attributes.

This isn't available in DOM level 2 at all. DOM level 3 does give access
to the information given in the XML declaration through attributes of the
Document Interface:

  Document.version
  Document.encoding
  Document.standalone
