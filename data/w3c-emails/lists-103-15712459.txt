Again, we're talking about implementation instead of specification, but as
far as I know, the XMLDecl is not a child of any parent. The Document is
only supposed to have one child, right? The document element.

Xerces has an implementation-specific XMLDecl interface. I think the XMLDecl
object is just stored in the Document, and thier Document interface
extensions allow you to get at it. The XMLDecl interface provides for
accessing its version, encoding and standalone attributes.

Jeff,

I would think that it would be an attribute of that
node. So
document.childNodes[index].getAttribute("version")
would do the trick, assuming a correct implementation.
