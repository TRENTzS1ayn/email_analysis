We invested a huge amount of effort in making NodeIterator's liveness
overhead as lightweight as possible, consonant with the goal of giving it
the desired "maintain relative position" navigation semantics. It should be
significantly better than NodeList.

If that's still too much overhead, and you can live with "current node"
navigation semantics, TreeWalker should be about as lightweight as you can
get.
