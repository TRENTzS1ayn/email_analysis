Setting aside the fact that I can't seem to keep myself from responding to
list messages prior to RTFM (honestly, I knew that the Document can, along
with a single Element, have Comments, PIs, and a DocumentType -- I just
glazed over that stuff), the Level 2 DOM still doesn't provide for a
Document Declaration node. So if an implementation wanted the Document to
provide access to the XMLDecl version attribute, it would have to implement
an extension. Correct?

>The Document is only supposed to have one child, right? The
document
element.

The Document may also contain a DocumentType node, and
ProcessingInstructions, and Comments. See the table of legal
children in
the DOM spec.
