Hi Stanley

There is no principal difficulty implying that we could not write tests that
lack the liveness of the features you mention. As the authority on success
or failure of the test suite will be the DOM Specification, however, passinf
or failing that particualr test will also test if these items are live or
not.

Again, tests not presupposing that these things are live could be written
and incorporated, but they will fail for implementations that do not support
live lists and maps.

Dimitris,

Here is part of the email thread on the www-dom@w3.org.

There are a lot of implementation (that includes ours) prefer a "faster"
non-conformant implementation:
    NOT keeping DOM NodeList or NamedNodeMap LIVE.

Will you consider that in your test suites?  Namely, either exclude
this "liveness" test or treat it as an optional feature?

Thx,

-Stanley
