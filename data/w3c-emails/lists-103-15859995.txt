Sure. But the original request was that we find a way to eliminate that
runtime typecheck. If you're going to do the switch, you might as well do
it in the scanning loop rather than in the object, for reasons previously

I've lost track -- Have we returned to a consensus that the Visitor design
pattern is not an unquestionable win after all? Or are there still points
we need to analyse?
