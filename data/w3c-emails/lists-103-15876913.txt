I would like to get some feedbacks from this list on having
a DOM Bindings repository on the W3C site. The documents followed
an offline discussion with some of the members of the Python
community. 


http://www.w3.org/2001/01/DOMBindings
(and http://www.w3.org/2001/01/DOMBindingsSubmission).

The problem:
- The DOM specifications are only including OMGIDL/ECMAScript/Java
  bindings.
 (the main reasons are of course needs and interests.)

The proposed solutions:

1- Put a page on the W3C page with links to the bindings (note: "bindings"
  not "implementations"). No review or endorsement from the W3C. I'm not
  fond of this idea since I don't think it will improve a lot the current
  situation.

2- Include them in the DOM specifications. That's no easy since it required
  reviews and work from the DOM WG but that's still a possiblity. This kind
  of approach will be under the official W3C Process.

3- something between 1 and 2: the DOM Bindings repository. No endorsement
  from the W3C but a public review of the bindings. There is no internal
  consensus that this is a good idea and this is why I'm looking for
  comments. One of the major comment was that it will be hosted by the W3C
  and will gain an implicit endorsement from the W3C (which you can't have
  without the approval of the W3C members). Someone already proposed to host
  the repository outside the W3C site but is it really what the community is
  looking for?

Any ideas or comments?
