  Interesting... I seem to be the editor of the Python DOM bindings;
should I be involved in this, or would such a restriction be limited
to W3C members?

  Actually, would it make sense to break out the Java and ECMAScript
bindings into separate documents?  These are of no interest to large
portions of the DOM-using development communities.

  This would be acceptable.

  This would be problematic, as many of the players in the Python/XML
community are not members of the W3C and will not be able to join just
to work with the DOM bindings effort.

  What is a "public review" in this context?  Does it simply mean that
it would be easier to find information on bindings for languages not
directly handled by the W3C?

  The Python community already has a working group for XML topics, and
there hasn't been any discussion there about requesting endorsement
from the W3C -- the Python community generally ahbors adding process
to what is essentially a technical issue.
  On the other hand, I'm not at all opposed to a repository of
bindings documents, regardless of it's endorsement status with the
W3C.
