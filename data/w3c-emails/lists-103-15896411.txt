What I would suggest is that the W3C keep supporting the three types of
bindings that they currently support (OMGIDL/ECMAScript/Java) for
consistency and speed sake.  Then, after a working draft becomes a
recommendation, have a bindings recommendation referenced from the DOM
recommendation.

This would consist of having three "areas" stored for the recommendation.
The DOM recommendation itself, a bindings reference page that the
recommendation refers too, then the DOM bindings.  In this manner the DOM
recommendation itself would not change, just a reference (the binding
reference page) would change.
