For those who want to know how Mozilla is supporting the
DOM Level 2 Range module, here is an article:

An interesting thought about the W3C DOM:
[[[
Every implementation of W3C?s Document Object Model will include their own
extensions to the implementation.  The reason why is that the programmers find
that in order to get the job done they need more that what the Recommendation
calls for.

Some of the extensions might be useful for an updated version of Ranges in the
future.
