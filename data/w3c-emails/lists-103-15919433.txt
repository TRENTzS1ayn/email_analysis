Regarding the Python DOM Bindings discussion, Uche Ogbuji included your email
address in the offline thread. Regarding the DOM Bindings repository, it would
be a public repository, with public-only comments. Hum, rereading the proposal,
this is not obvious. I need to clarify that.

On one hand, I would say yes. It would also resolve the case of the numbers
that are possible to be included in the DOM spec. with separate documents,
there is no more limits. On the other hand, having separated documents increase
... the numbers of documents. Our communication team wasn't pleased at all of
the split of DOM Level 2. It will increase the number of documents in /TR a
lot. So, for the moment, the only reason why we didn't do that is a practical
reason.
An other possibility would be to remove the bindings from the specs and put
them somewhere else (let's say /DOM). They will be no longer normative in that
case and I don't think that we want that.

"public review" is that it will give a chance to people to reject the proposed
bindings. If someone sends an other (incompatible) version for the Python DOM
bindings, I won't a good reason to not list them in the DOM page.
