Actually, I would argue that a switch on a type field is *NOT* necessarily a 
safe programming construct. There once was an article, when procedural 
programming was new, called: GoTo considered harmful. Many of the same 
arguments hold up for switch statements in object oriented programming :-)

As I understand, the result of the discussion was:
- I owe you a use case where the switch statement is really a problem.
- We identified a problem with visitors for library design: As all execute 
methods need to be defined in the Visitor baseclass, a base visitor 
implementation can not be part of the library. I am not sure if this is a 
fatal problem, but it certainly makes a big dent in the area of elegance :-)

So as I doubt I can find a use case that is ugly enough with switch 
statements to overcome the second concern listed above, I am afraid I'll 
have to live with a dispatch loop based on switch statements :-(

Thanks for all the discussion...
