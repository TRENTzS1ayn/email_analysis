  I've now dug back through my inbox and found those emails, and read
them.  Thanks for the pointer.

  I understood that the repository would be public; I still don't know
what the comments are -- comments *by* the public, or comments by the
W3C *to* the public?

  There are no limits either way, unless your bits are heavier than
mine.  ;-)

  Ah... a classic document management problem.  I'll consider that a
W3C internal matter, and keep out of it.

  I have no reason to suggest that the status of the Java or
ECMAScript bindings be changed; I think careful standardization is a
good thing.

  This is a little odd.  If there is a reason for the public to reject
a particular binding, that implies that non-rejection is meaningful in
some sense.  If W3C endorsement is not meant by keeping the bindings
document in the repository, I'm not sure what is being rejected.  If
it's a matter of people saying they don't like a binding for whatever
reason, that's fine, but I'm not sure what is gained over having a
mailing list archive for that.  (Which is not to say there shouldn't
be a forum associated with the repository; it's just unclear what the
goal is.)
