Thanks to all who sent review comments, both to this list and to various
members of the DOM WG personally. 

We now have a document available at
http://www.w3.org/DOM/L2LCcomments_public.html
which shows the DOM WG response to each comment (apart from typos and
simple requests for clarification, of course!). This is also linked from
the DOM home page at http://www.w3.org.

I know it took a long time to get this document out; we were discussing
the issues raised until last week!

thanks again,

Lauren
