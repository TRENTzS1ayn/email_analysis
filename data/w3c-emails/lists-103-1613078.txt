hopefully after yesterday's announcement that sun is withdrawing java
from the ECMA standardization process (a process they initiated),
people will choose another language for reference implementations.

even if there are no suitable standards-based languages, there are
certainly a number of suitable "open" alternatives (python comes to mind)
that are developed in an open spirit consistent with that of the w3.

thanks
