I'd like some clarifications on the DOM 2 Traversal and Range Specification.
Specifically chapter 2 i.e. Range

In section 2.2.1 you talk about

para 2.   If the container is an <em>Attr</em>, Document, DocumentFragment,
Element or EntityReference node, the offset is between its child nodes.
para 3.   The boundary-points of a Range must have a common ancestor
container which is either a Document, DocumentFragment or <em>Attr</em>
node.
para 4.   The container of a boundary-point of a Range must be an Element,
Comment, ProcessingInstruction, EntityReference, CDATASection, Document,
DocumentFragment, <em>Attr</em>, or Text node

You talk about attr node being able to contain boundary points and be an
ancestor container. I couldn't understand the scenario in which this
happens. Could you please shed some light on this. Also, you talk about

para5. That is, the boundary-point of the text range cannot be in the middle
of a start- or end-tag of an element or within the name of an entity or
character reference.

I construe this to mean that the entity references maynot contain a position
in their names i.e. btw. '&' and ';', but an entity reference may be the
container of a boundary point of a range as in para4. Does this mean you are
talking about, when the entity reference is expanded it may contain the
position, or what?. Could please explain this also.

We are actually attempting to use this specification in Netbeans to add some
xml support. But, it is still a draft proposal, we have added some
collection of features, but there were significant limitations to our
previous approach. Which we would like to correct before we get down to the
actual implementation.
