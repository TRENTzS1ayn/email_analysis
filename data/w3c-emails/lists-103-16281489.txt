I have got to find a "Entity and EntityReference Objects for Dummies"
document somewhere. I am just NOT getting it. The spec is too concise for
me. I need some unbridled prose to help me understand what all the
relationships are, where and how they live, what in the source document
prompts a DOM implemenation to create an EntityReference node, and how it is
supposed to "link up" to an Entity.

Anyone got a URL I can look at for this?

Thanks, Joseph. I've now printed out the FAQ, and I will keep it by my side.
