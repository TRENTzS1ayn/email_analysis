Are you saying that the answer to "why not?" is just
"these seem different"?  I hoped for a real justification.

If it's a "set", then the fact that Active ones can invalidate
sure seems like something that non-mutating code would
be able to ignore (except for error reporting) given half a
chance.  What's the justification for preventing that?

Library code might quite reasonably be able to accept
either kind of NodeSet implementation.  The current
scheme requires double the number of such library APIs,
by pushing implementation attributes into the interface
even for cases where those attributes are irrelevant.
