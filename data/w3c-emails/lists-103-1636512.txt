It would be Really Nice to have a formal validation suite. Writing a good
one is a nontrivial effort. Think of it as an opportunity for someone to
contribute to the Cause...

(My minimal test harness for Events wouldn't help much; it focuses on
mutation events and on the corner cases in my own code, and it isn't
self-analysing.)
