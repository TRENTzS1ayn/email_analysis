What I have in the test definition schema are elements that are
patterned after Dublin Core expressed in RDF and XML, but simplified.

Basically, you would have a metadata section like:

<test>
<metadata>
<title>somethingTest</title>
<description>This test does something<description>
<!-- alternatively these could use resource attributes
                   to identify parties by URI's but that seems like overkill
                   at least initially    -->
<creator>Mary Brady</creator>
<contributor>Curt Arnold</contributor>
<!-- identifies a passage in the spec or 
other resource by URI -->
<subject resource="http://www.w3.org/1999/DOM-Level-1...#ID-xxxx"/>
<date modifier="creation">2001-07-05</date>
</metadata>
</test>

The only thing that I have tried to keep really RDF in XML (as best
I know how) is the list of test subjects extracted from the DOM spec.

How do you have your metadata now?
