Hi, there!

I just got started with XML::DOM. It is very good. But I don't see many 
examples on the internet site. That gets me in trouble. So, I am asking you 
for help!!!!

What I am trying to do is to merge two different XML documents. If I do the 
following thing, I get DOM Exception errors. It says that I am trying to do 
this from two different document sources. Looks okay to me, but it seems 
that I have to do something else to merge two different XML documents, but 
nowhere can I find an example for this. Will anybody know how to do this?


my $parser = new XML::DOM::Parser;
my $doc = $parser->parsefile ("foo.xml");
my $ctl_doc = $parser->parse("<Sample>This is a test</Sample>");

$jobrun_info_node = 
$doc->getElementsByTagName("JobRunInformation")->item(0);

$jobrun_info_node->appendChild($ctl_doc);

$doc->printToFile ("out.xml");
