I think we all reconsider our options from time to time, and this will
be seen as a negative, but until something else emerges that solves
the implementor's requirements as well as Java did, it is hard to make 
a case for switching right away.

There are no compliance tests.  The spec is the sole source of info
to determine whether the implementation is compliant or not.  Tests
would be desirable IMO, but are always incomplete, and would have to 
defer to the spec for additional cases, which can never be entirely
covered.

I think that part of this exercize is to find places where the spec
is not clear enough for a developer to know whether the spec is being
followed or not.
