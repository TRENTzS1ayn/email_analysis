Exactly why I think it's wrong to make one of them "optional".

Please go read that part of the spec to see what I've been talking
about:  some of the relevant flag settings are "optional".  I'd like
your next response to that point to indicate you at least can see
the issue I've raised ... :)

Architecturally, such issues can't matter ... unless things are set up the
way they are now, so that the "filter down" (at build-time) approach
can't work reliably!  (See above.)

Stylistically, it certainly does matter whether the default policy settings
aim for the 80% or the 20%.  I think the defaults now aim for the 20%,
but I get the feeling some people like it that way.

As I said.  Again, go read the WD ... I think that since some of the text
needs to change, it'd really be better to use a word that captures the
boolean nature of this beast, such as "flag".
