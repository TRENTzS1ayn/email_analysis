My original note reported five separate issues, including both
the suboptimal defaults (one issue) AND this separate one:

> Additionally, setting these flags to 'false' should be required, not
> optional; only the "comments" flag requires that.  (That's implied
> by changing to defaults of 'false'.)  Having "false" be optional
> forces applications to manually filter out such sugar, and makes
> this feature flag much less useful than it ought to be.
