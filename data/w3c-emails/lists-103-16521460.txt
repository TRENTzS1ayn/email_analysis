I didn't see the package.html file that is needed to get
top-level descriptions of a package.  Example use is available at
http://www.web3d.org/TaskGroups/x3d/sai/javadoc/overview-summary.html

The package.html files go in the same directory as the source.
Attached versions are for source directories.
org/w3c//dom, org/w3c//dom/events and org/w3c/dom/views

The short descriptions of each org.w3c.dom packages were taken from
the top of the corresponding DOM draft/recommendation documents.

Javadoc documentation on how to prepare package comment files is at
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/tooldocs/win32/javadoc.html#packagecomment

These are important, please include them.  Thanks for your efforts.

all the best, Don
