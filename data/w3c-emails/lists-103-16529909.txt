Hi,

I have started to implement the DOM L1 in c available here:

http://auditorymodels.org/domc

This is the correct spec right?

http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-DOM-Level-1-20000929/level-one-core.html

Is this mailing list the authoritative source for implementation
details? I'm a little green on the whole XML thing so I thought this
would be a good initialization project (and I need it for something else
of course). I'd greatly appreciate any comments on this code.

Thanks,
Mike
