Hi,

Is a NodeNamedMap ever used to hold anything but the Attrs of an
Element? Might an Attr be an entry in more than one
NamedNodeMap?  A simply way to implement NamedNodeMap in
c is to just add nextAttr and previousAtt members to Node and
make NamedNodeMap a struct like:

struct DOM_NamedNodeMap {
   unsigned long length;
   DOM_Node *first;
   DOM_Node *last;
}

If the answers to the above questions are "no" I don't see a problem
with this technique. Do you?

Thanks
Mike
