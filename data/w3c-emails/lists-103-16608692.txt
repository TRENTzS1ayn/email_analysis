I had forgotten to respond to the DOM Xpath announcement earlier.

I want to thank the DOM WG for undertaking this work.  I certainly voted and
lobbied for such work whenever possible, including during DOM chartering.
It's great to see this happen.  I know members of the DOM WG were concerned
about introduction of a query language into the API, especially given the
XML Query work, and I wanted to again thank them for putting their concerns
aside in favour of standardization.

Cheers,
