In response to the Chairs request for the advance of the Document Object
Model (DOM) Level 2 to Candidate Recommendation status, I am pleased to
announce the DOM Level 2 as W3C Candidate Recommendation, and encourage
implementations and technical feedback from both W3C members and the
developer community at large.


Candidate Recommendation is a new document state that was proposed at
the November 1999 Advisory Committee meeting, and is now part of the W3C
Recommendation Track.

>From the W3C Process Document, at:
http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/Process-19991111/tr.html#RecsCR

A Candidate Recommendation has received significant review from its
immediate technical community (resulting from the Last Call).
Advancement of a document to Candidate Recommendation is an explicit
call to those outside of the related Working Groups or the W3C itself
for implementation and technical feedback. There is no requirement that
a Working Draft have two independent and interoperable implementations
to become a Candidate Recommendation. Instead, this is the phase at
which the Working Group is responsible for formally acquiring that
experience or at least defining the expectations of implementation.

Abstract

This specification defines the Document Object Model Level 2, a
platform- and language-neutral interface that allows programs and
scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure and
style of documents. The Document Object Model Level 2 builds on the
Document Object Model Level 1.

The DOM Level 2 is made of a set of core interfaces to create and
manipulate the structure and contents of a document and a set of
optional modules. These modules contain specialized interfaces 
dedicated to XML, HTML, an abstract view, generic stylesheets, 
Cascading Style Sheets, Events, traversing the document structure, 
and a Range object.

Status of This Document

This specification is now in the Candidate Recommendation phase. 
This means the specification is stable, and there will be a period 
to allow implementation of the specification. After this CR phase ends, 
on 19 January 2000, the Working Group plans to present the
specification for
consideration as Proposed Recommendation.

The collected comments from DOM Level 2 Last Call are available at:

http://www.w3.org/DOM/L2LCcomments_public.html

Comments on the current document are invited and are to be sent to the
DOM mailing list www-dom@w3.org. An archive is available at:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom/

Should this specification prove impossible or very difficult to
implement, the necessary changes to make it implementable will be made.
If this specification is possible to implement, the only changes which
will be made to this specification are minor editorial changes and clarifications.

This document has been produced as part of the W3C DOM Activity. The
authors of this document are the DOM WG members. Different modules of
the Document Object Model have different editors.
