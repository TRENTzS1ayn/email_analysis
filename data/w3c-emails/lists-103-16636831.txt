Because :)  

Concurrency control would imply a certain way of working with the DOM
that can't be assumed between various
languages/platforms/implementations.  There's no reason why you could
add such support to your DOM implementation and expose it using the
feature set.  We do that in dbXML for database binding and DOM
compression.
