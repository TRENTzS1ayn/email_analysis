  Yes -- they are used to hold the entity and notation definitions in
the DocumentType node.

  I don't think Attr nodes can appear in more than one map.
Whether or not this is a reasonable implementation approach depends
on how you handle default attributes derived from the DTD; if you
support a DTD, this may not be a good approach, especially if you
support DOM mutation.
  (And yes, I think mutation should be a separate feature from simple
read-access!  But that's a different topic.)
