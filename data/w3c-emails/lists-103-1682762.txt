It's just that as written, the Java/JavaScript/IDL code in the DOM is under
the W3C document copyright rather than the W3C software copyright.
The document copyright (rightly) forbids changing anything, but software
that contains unchangeable components is not Open Source
(http://www.opensource.org/osd.html).  Making the DOM code available under
the software copyright, extended to say "If you modify this you can't
use w3c.* packages or claim DOM compliance any more", does the trick.
