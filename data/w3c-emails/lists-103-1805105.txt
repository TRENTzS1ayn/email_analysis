This is an issue for the first version of the DOM [1]. We changed the
license in the latest version of DOM Level 2 [2]. We will change the
license of DOM Level 1 with the publication of a revised version.

In [3] :

"This formulation of W3C's notice and license became active on August 14 1998
 so as to improve compatibility with GPL. This version ensures that W3C software
 licensing terms are no more restrictive than GPL and consequently W3C software
 may be distributed in GPL packages."

A list of W3C Open Source Software is available on the W3C web site [4].
