FourThought LLC (http://FourThought.com) announces the release of

                             4DOM 0.9.0
                      -----------------------
                An XML/HTML Python library using the
                  Document Object Model interface

4DOM is a Python library for XML and HTML processing and manipulation
using the W3C's Document Object Model for interface.  4DOM implements
DOM Core level 2, HTML level 2 and Level 2 Document Traversal.

4DOM should work on all platforms supported by Python.  If you have
any problems with a particular platform, please e-mail the authors.

4DOM is designed to allow developers rapidly design applications
that read, write or manipulate HTML and XML.

News
----

Changes:

- Major re-write to match the general consensus DOm binding for
  Python.  Code formerly in the form "node.getChildNodes()"
  is now to be used in the form "node._get_childNodes()" or
  simply "node.childNodes".  Similarly "text.setData("spam")"
  becomes "text._set_data("spam")" or text.data = "spam"

- Update to full Level 2 support in core and HTML, including
  namespace-support.

- Many bug-fixes
