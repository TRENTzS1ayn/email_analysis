Am I entirely missing something?  Why are there all these proposals for adding 
the trappings of separate recommendations into the core DOM?  Namespaces make 
sense because they are a fundamental part od XML, and will probably be 
incorporated into the XML 2.0 spec, but why should DOM define a 
getElementByXPathExpr or the like?  I would see this to be the task of the 
XPath spec to define an interface for XPath processing given a DOM.

For instance, we just added an "Evaluate" function to 4XPath, which takes an 
XPath string and a DOM Node (for context) and returns a NodeList.  4DOM users 
don't have to worry about all the machinery of XPath, but 4XPath users, who 
already need 4DOM anyway, now have XPath query support in addition.  It would 
be nice to have a standard interface for this, but I don't think DOM level N 
is the place for it.

And if it is, how do you choose which specs get grafted into the DOM?  Is it 
only W3C specs?  If not, what are the criteria?

IMHO, The DOM should be a simple, low-level interface for XML and no more.  
Other specs should refer to the DOM, but not vice-versa.
