This is to announce the successful implementation 
of DOM Level 2 Events in TclDOM version 2.0,
the Tcl language binding for DOM.

UI and Mouse Events have been implemented, on top
of a generic event system that will also support
Mutation events.  The event system supports event
capture and bubbling.

Please note that this announcement is for the
Level 2 Event support only - implementation of 
version 2.0 of TclDOM and TclXML are still ongoing, 
and Swish remains in beta release.

I have also updated the TreeDOM megawidget to generate
mouse events on nodes, and hooked this into the next
the version of Swish (Zveno's XML editor) by way of
demonstration (a new feature displays the path of
the selected node, this uses a capturing listener).

Snapshots of the new versions of the packages may be
found on the Zveno FTP server, ftp://ftp.zveno.com/.
Look for TclDOM/tcldom-2.0a2.tar.gz, TclXML/tclxml-2.0b2.tar.gz
and swish/Swish-1.0b6.tar.gz.  These have been tested
with Tcl/Tk 8.3.0.

Work is continuing on the Beta 6 version of Swish to
switch it over completely to the new event model.
I believe this will result in extra functionality
and greater robustness.

Questions, comments, etc to me.
