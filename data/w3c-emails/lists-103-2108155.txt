I'm sure that's just a typo. getElementsByTagNameNS is supported on both
Element and Document, and the text wasn't updated when it was copied from
one to the other.

Good catch!

Is there anything else that strikes you as strange? It's supposed to be a
simple adaptation of getElementsByTagName to the namespaces world...
