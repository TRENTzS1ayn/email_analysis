Hum, seems we really need to change the name of this method.
It makes sense to rename append for consistency. Here is
the new interface :

// Introduced in DOM Level 2:
interface MediaList {
  attribute DOMString        mediaText;
          // raises(DOMException) on setting

 readonly attribute unsigned long    length;
 DOMString         item(in unsigned long index);
 void              deleteMedium(in DOMString oldMedium)
                              raises(DOMException);
 void              appendMedium(in DOMString newMedium)
                              raises(DOMException);
};

Philippe.
