Hi,
I was planning to write a small XSLT engine with bare minimum subset of
XPath, just for educational purposes. I planned to use Jaxp for traversing
the input XML and XSL style sheet documents and on finding a match to a
template, just replace the subtree under XML document with that under XSL. 
Anyone who knows about Jaxp-Is using Jaxp the right approach??
Thanks
Pravin
