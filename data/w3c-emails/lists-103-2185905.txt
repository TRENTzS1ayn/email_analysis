Those aren't DOM APIs. They're custom features of the DOM implementation
you're using. I'd suggest you ask the folks who wrote it for assistance.


The DOM doesn't provide an API for XSLT patterns. We expect that at some
point an API for XML Querying will exist which subsumes these, but that's
definitely in the future... and it's not clear whether the DOM or Querying
group should be defining that API.

The Traversal chapter, in DOM Level 2, supports filtered NodeIterators and
TreeWalkers. These might be useful in implementing your own search
routines.

If not, you can always write code that directly explores the DOM.
