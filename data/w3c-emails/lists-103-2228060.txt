I know that this was probably deferred to DOM Level 3 for reasons having to
do with DocumentTypes being read-only, but I believe that there either:

Should be a createEntity() method on Document or, the comments on
importNode() regarding importing Entities should be changed to indicate that
an attempt to import an entity is not supported.

Here's my rational for this change:

At present, there is no way to create an Entity node using current DOM
API's, however, a DOM 2 Compliant implementation must support the
importNode() method, which is a back door method for creating an Entity.
There should either be a way to create Entities that is directly supported
from Document, or the ability to Import entities should not be allowed in
DOM Level 2.
