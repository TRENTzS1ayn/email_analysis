Philippe,
Here is some feedback from me personally and does not necessarily represent
the
SVG working group or my company (Adobe).

Some things which might be good topics for DOM3 which I didn't see in the
requirements document:

1) The requirements document talks about views, but doesn't explicitly say
anything about XSL-FOs. XSL supports a notion of transforming source XML into
some other structured form (usually more XML). The current design of XSL-FO
creates a transient set of objects, but I don't believe these are accessible
from the DOM right now. I think it should be mentioned explicitly that DOM3
will consider including access to all XSL objects (included generated ones).

2) The Views section has the following note:

(ED: We need a FAQ entry elaborating on why the presentation
characteristics are
generally not mutable.)

UNIX taught us about 30 years ago that it useful to string together multiple
transformations. I don't believe anything is ever final -- everything is
always
available for further transformations. Thus, I disagree with the above note.
Architecturally, I believe the W3C needs to factor into all of its
architectures, including the DOM, facilities that allow for the possibilities
of multiple transformations, and also for the possibility that transformations
can come from things other than XSLT.

3) Both SMIL-Boston and SVG include animation. The animation component of
SMIL-Boston (called SMIL-Animation) is designed to be a general animation
facility that can be incorporated into arbitrary languages. I wouldn't be
surprised to see an implementation of SMIL-Animation applied to [X]HTML, for
instance. I think the Views requirements needs to say explicitly that DOM3
will
consider how animation might fit into the notion of views.

Thanks.
