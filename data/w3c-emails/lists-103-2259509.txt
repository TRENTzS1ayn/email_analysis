Correct.

Yes. Furthermore, CSS generates an implicit rendering tree, and it is very
tempting to define a DOM for views that can be used to access the implicit
rendering tree of CSS and the explicit but transient rendering tree of XSL
FO, using the same mechanism.

This wil be very helpful for dynamic behaviours, scripting, defining how
SMIL animation interacts, and so forth.

Unless they are being animated? See SMIL.

So do I.

Yes.

I would also consider this a high priority. Its interesting theat Jon and I
camre to similar conclusions from the requirements document, but then we
have both been involved in the SMIL animation stuff which, built on top of
DOM 2, then talks about  the difference between source (DOM2) and rendering
values; it is the latter that are animated.

In general, I consider it crucial that style sheet languages, DOM 3 Views,
and SMIL  all fit together into a consistent framework. I am very pleased
to see DOM work on views, since CSS has had support for generating multiple
views (eg screen, projector, print, aural) for some time; it is great to be
able to pin down the rendering structure a bit more and to work on
programatic manipulation of it. This  all helps with building the UI
infrastructure.
