On reflection: I believe we decided on that because it's easier to support
this capability now, in anticipation of Level 3, then to change it later.
Some folks have complained loudly when an operation that used to be an
error stopped being an error, believe it or not.

It may or may not be meaningless in Level 2 but I think this falls in the
category of "easy (it really is), harmless, and you're going to have to do
in in Level 3 anyway."
