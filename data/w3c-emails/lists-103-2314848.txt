You can use XPath 1.0 with MSXML's selectNodes/selectSingleNode functions to
get the filtering capabilities that you desire. The only catch is that you
have to call setProperty specifying the selection language as XPath:

set doc = new msxml2.domdocument
doc.setProperty "SelectionLanguage", "XPath"
set nl = doc.selectNodes("/descendant::book[child::author = 'Aaron']")

If you don't set the selectionLanguage, MSXML defaults to XSL patterns,
which is significantly different than XPath. As pointed out, these APIs are
MSXML specific and not part of the DOM. Although, I strongly believe that it
would be *extremely* beneficial to have a standard query API for executing
XPath queries built into the DOM spec. It seems like a no-brainer.
