I'd urge people on this list to read the latest public draft of the DOM
Requirements at
http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-DOM-Requirements-20000412
and make specific suggestions as to what you think the priorities for Level
3 should be if they are different from the Working Group's.  If something
like the MS selectNodes() method is imporant to you, the sooner you make
your opinion known the more likely the WG will be able to squeeze it into
Level 3.
