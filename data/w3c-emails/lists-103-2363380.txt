The issue of having importNode work for Entity and Notation nodes seems
similar (to me) to the ones w.r.t. having cloneNode work for those node types in
DOM level 1 (and Document and DocumentType nodes, which also 
don't have create methods in DOM level 1).

I recall that we discussed clarifying that this feature (cloneNode
of un-creatable nodes types) would be implementation dependant. 

Whatever happened about that?

Maybe the same type of wording be used for importNode of un-creatable
node types in DOM level 2?
