It's not in the latest version of the spec, which suggests that either we
didn't agree on it or it got lost between discussion and publication. Time
to dig into the archives and look for a supporting statement...

If we did reach that agreement, then I agree it should probably apply to
both methods.


Personally, I perfer to avoid "implementation dependent" whenever possible.
It tends to lead to help-desks having to spend time defending your
choice... and no matter which choice you make, some user will be trying to
interchange code with an implementation that decided differently.

But this might be enough of an edge case for that not to be a problem.
