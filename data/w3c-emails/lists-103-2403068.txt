Just to be pedantically correct ;~) "XQL" generally means the proposal put
forth by several companies in 1997 in a W3C Note; this basic syntax was used
in XPath and XSL Patterns, with some modifications.  The eventual product of
the W3C XML Query Language Working Group doesn't have a name yet, but "XQL"
will probably *not* be it. It is likely to somehow incorporate XPath, but
have considerably more power.

I happen to agree that XPath would be a useful basis for a couple of DOM
Level 3 Core methods, e.g. NodeList getElementsByXPath(DOMString
xpathExpression) and a NodeIterator and TreeIterator constructor that takes
an XPath expression.  This idea had just about ZERO support last summer when
the basic Level 3 agenda was discussed, so if you care about this you'll
have to lobby hard for it.
