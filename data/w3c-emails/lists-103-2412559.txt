Yes, I agree that term XQL has become overloaded because of its history. I
was using it to refer to the work of the XML Query Language WG and not the
original notes. I wasn't aware that they weren't planning to use XQL to
refer to their work. Any idea why?

It's surprising that it would receive such little support. What is the
reasoning?

FWIW, I believe the API should be more general than something like
getElementsByXPath, because 1) XPath expressions return node-sets, which may
contain other node types than Element, and 2) it should be able to take
other addressing expressions (for future extensibility).

I'll start my lobbying...  ;)
