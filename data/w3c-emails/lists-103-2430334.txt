I sent this to xml-dev to see if I'm the only one in the world that cares
about this.  ;-)

BTW, I already sent the correction on the address (www-dom@w3.org)

>
> After looking over the recently released DOM Level 3 requirements
> document, there has been some discussion on adding an addressing
> API (similar to the selectNodes function in MSXML). The proposed
> idea is to introduce a method on the Node interface that takes a
> scheme specific addressing expression (e.g., XPath 1.0, the
> product of the XQL WG, etc...) and returns a NodeList:
>
> NodeList getNodes(scheme, expression)
>
> The scheme identifies that language used in the expression.
> Today, the main standard addressing language in place is XPath
> 1.0, but this makes the API extensible for future versions of
> XPath or other languages (similar to the way XPointer works).
> With something like this in place, DOM developers can harness the
> power of XPath to simplify typical navigation tasks in a standard way:
>
> NodeList books = doc.getNodes("xpath",
> "/books//book[@topic='xml']/author");
>
> The default scheme could also be specified for the entire
> Document so it doesn't have to specified on each method call.
> Similar functionality could also be added to the the Traversal
> API (as another constructor type to NodeIterator and TreeWalker).
>
> In order to help the DOM WG decide on such an issue, the goal of
> this email is to gather the general interest level from the xml-dev'ers.
