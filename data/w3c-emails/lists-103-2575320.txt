Agreed, but until something becomes a W3C recommendation, I don't think it
has a legitimate claim on a name/acronymn (at least in the W3C space). Just
because one of the original notes that led to XPath was called XQL, doesn't
mean that the XML Query Language WG shouldn't be able to call the product of
their work XQL, especially when it makes so much sense - but I *do* agree
with your statement about it generating confusion.

Actually, in this particular case I don't think I've seen any official
implementation documentation that refers to the technology as XQL (e.g., in
MSXML it's referred to as XSL patterns, etc.).

Yes, I can appreciate this...the same is true for all the different XML
Schema initiatives that have developed over time. It's a matter of knowing
*exactly* what your processor implements and being very anal about how names
are used.
