Regarding:

> doc.setVariableBinding('foo', 123);

I don't like that idea. This would mean that either the current node or the
document node would need to be able to store these bindings, and that they
are visible to every user of this DOM.

Perhaps it would be a better approach to look at Microsoft's DOMSelection
interface (see
http://msdn.microsoft.com/xml/general/msxmlprev01262000.asp#msxmlprev_newint
erfaces) -- an object that represents the query (which would allow to parse
the query once and to re-use it several times without reparsing). I think
this would be the right place to hold variable bindings as well...
