In the new GUI application that my team is developing, we are using XML as
our native file format.  Because of its rich functionality, we have required
that at least Internet Explorer 5.0 is installed so that we can use MSXML.
There are several places where we can do things with much fewer lines of
code by using "selectNodes" that we could any other way.  There are several
benefits of "selectNodes" to us:

*Allows us to load a document that should be one of ours, figure out
its version and type, create the appropriate object, and load it with the
appropriate document and view.
*Allows extremely complex and flexible searches.
*Our "Find" dialog builds up an XSL/XPath pattern that will perform
the appropriate search.
*Allows us to much more easily add the "generate report" and "analyze
structure" features to our application.
*Alleviates us in many cases from walking the tree when you know
exactly where something should be.
*Makes code more readable.
*Alleviates us from the need to invent our our own query language and
our own query processor to retrieve nodes in an XML DOM.


We would very much like an equivalent of "selectNodes" (such as getNodes)
included in DOM level 3.
