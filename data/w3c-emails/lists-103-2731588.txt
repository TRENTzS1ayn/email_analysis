I think we could have the same transactional model as Oracle has.
So we can set up savepoints and then make rollback to any of those
savepoints.

Say we have a transaction that sets savePoints like
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
------
|startTransation():-*->savePoint(1):-*->:savePoint(2):-*->...savePoint(n)
|
|                                                <------------rollback();
|
|                                                |commit();
|
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
------
than we make a rollback to savePoint2.
Commit can be made at any time after startTransaction() was issued.
I think this would work very well for me.

Definitely someday; this is not in the requirements for the Level 3
Load/Save functionality, but there are at least some of us who have
expressed interest in the past.

If you could elaborate on your needs and suggest some features, that would
help.
