OpenDoc ... there's a  term I haven't heard in awhile ... It's dead for all
practical purposes AFAIK ...  I couldn't find a reference to it on the Web
dated after about 1997.  [I'm waiting to be set straight by someone from the
OMG ;~) ]

There is an entry in the DOM FAQ contrasting the "document object model"
with the "object model" in COM, CORBA, etc; I suspect that the same thing
applies to OpenDoc:

What is the relationship between COM or CORBA and the DOM?
The Document Object Model, despite its name, is not an object model in the
same way as the Component Object Model (COM). The COM, like CORBA, is a
language-independent way to specify interfaces and objects; the Document
Object Model is a set of interfaces and objects designed for managing HTML
and XML documents. The DOM may be implemented using language-independent
systems like COM or CORBA; it may also be implemented using
language-specific bindings like the Java or ECMAScript bindings that we
define.

Are they compatible, exclusive or what???
