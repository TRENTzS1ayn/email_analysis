     It seems to me that Joe is speaking more to the case where the DOM is

     providing a way to
     delegate responsibility for evaluating XPaths (or other types
     of queries in
     the future) into the implementation is vital.

I had a need for this, and was shown

(http://www.246.ne.jp/~kamiya/pub/XPath4XT.html)

Which puts xpath into James C's XT (with slight tweaks).
Don't know if it was common knowledge.
