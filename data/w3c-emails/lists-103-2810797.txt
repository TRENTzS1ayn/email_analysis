"new".

e.setAttributeNode(a) associates Attr node a with Element node e.

a.setValue("new") modifies that node, discarding its previous contents and
replacing them with a single Text node containing the value "new". It does
not change the attribute's owningElement.

When you issue the last line, you are retrieving a reference to the same
Attr node, as modified by the second line.



If you don't want that behavior, clone the attribute before adding it, or
before modifying it, and alter the copy which has not been associated with
the Element.
