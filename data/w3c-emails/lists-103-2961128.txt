I'm not familiar with Oracle's model, but this sounds quite useful.
Only instead of a flat series of savepoints, I'd prefer to have a
hierarchy of transactions. So you could start a transaction whilst
in another transaction and commit it when that sub-transaction is
done, or rollback without screwing the parent transaction if it
fails.

Looking forward to being able to write multi-user file editors
with XML as the underlying file format. :-)
