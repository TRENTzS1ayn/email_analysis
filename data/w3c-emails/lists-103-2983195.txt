I would think that it's for much the same reason that things like
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException and NullPointerException extend
RuntimeException -- almost any program that uses the DOM is theoretically
capable of raising a DOMException, but this almost invariably indicates a
bug rather than an expected but unusual condition.  There's simply no good
reason to check for DOMException in most cases, because if you get one it
means you probably need to rewrite your program.
