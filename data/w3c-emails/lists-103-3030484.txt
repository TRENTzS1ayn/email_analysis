No, it's not. You append a medium and not a list of media.
In your case, media.getItem(1) should return "print, baille".

But we also have:

mediaText of type DOMString 
 The parsable textual representation of the media list. This is a
 comma-separated list of media. 

So, I guess the comma should be definitively excluded from the syntax of a
medium:
SYNTAX_ERR
  If the medium contains a comma character.
