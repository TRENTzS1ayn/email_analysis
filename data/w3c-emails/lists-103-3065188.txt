Can you please tell me what is the expected behavior in the following case:

I have a MediaList named 'media'  and I say
media.setMediaText("print { h1 {color: blue} }" )
will this generate a SYNTAX_ERR exception?  

According to the CSS2 grammar this is legal syntax 
[media: MEDIA_SYM S* medium [ ',' S* medium ]* '{' S* ruleset* '}' S*]
so I wouldn't expect such an exception.  

However, the CSSImportRule interface contains a mediaList attribute and it
doesn't make sense to allow the following insertion,
[assume I have an import rule, importRule]
importRule.getMedia().setMediaText("print { h1 {color: blue} }")
because an import rule cannot contain a rule.

Thanks for the clarification,
Blaine
