No, you're mixing media rules and lists of media descriptor. 

The MediaList interface represents the list of media descriptor and,
for CSS2, has the following syntax:
 S* medium [ ',' S* medium ]*

The proposal from Johnny Stenback seems reasonnable to me:

INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR
 If the medium contains characters that are invalid in medium names in the
 underlying style language.

In others words, for a MediaList object within a StyleSheet with type
'text/css', the syntax of the list of media descriptor must follow
the CSS syntax.
