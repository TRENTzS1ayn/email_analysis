Wow! All I can say is that the map is now my desktop wallpaper. I'd like to
add to the question and see if there's a complete mapping of methods for
Level1/2 as well. Also, are there any plans by W3C or Netscape to produce a
book similar to The JavaScript Bible that has object property/method
listings with examples? This would be a fantastic gem for those of us who
learn more by example.

Have a good one!
