This is a Microsoft DOM extension, not a W3C DOM method.  Wrong mailing
list!

But FYI, I've been bit by this too ... it's not a Javascript or DOM issue,
it's an IE security issue (can you IMAGINE the havoc if Javascript could
insert little viruses on every machine that browses a website?).  There may
be some way to persuade IE that a particular script is safe for save(), but
again this is the wrong crowd to ask.
