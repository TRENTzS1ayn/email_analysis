Hi,

How can i change content according the new dom standard so it will work in
IE 5 and Netscape 5, when the content exists of text ant html elements. I
would like to make something  that asks de client for text and html-elements
and puts that on a page.

Danny Goodman wrote this about it:
I quote from the artikel: "When the dynamic content involves combinations of
HTML elements and text nodes, the DOM methodology gets more complex, since
you have to create the elements or text nodes and assemble the objects in
the desired sequence. "
Unfortunatly he did not gave an example of the code to make this.

Can you please tell me where i can find information about this? And an
example?

Thanks,


Charles.
