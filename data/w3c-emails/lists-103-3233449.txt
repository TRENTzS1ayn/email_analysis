The standardized solution for your need would be XPath which is probably
avaialble as off-the-shelf code. I know Xalan/LotusXSL includes such a
routine.

But that doesn't output the syntax  you've shown. If you really need that
specific syntax, you get to invent your own code to generate it and/or
respond to it. It shouldn't be hard; from the target node, walk up the
parents and at each step count across from firstChild... then reverse the
order, of course. To evaluate the position string, just run the same
process in reverse, counting across the children at each step.
