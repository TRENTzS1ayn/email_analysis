Hello!

I'm making an ISAPI DLL that parses an XML file to retrieve the XML data in 
a repository. I'm using the MSXML parser, using IXMLDOM structures. Well, I 
send the XML file as string parameter to this DLL and I'm trying load it 
using the "loadXML" method. I'm beign some troubles with this loading and I 
really don't know what's the matter? Anyone haven't this trouble yet?

Thanks for reading,
Jair.
