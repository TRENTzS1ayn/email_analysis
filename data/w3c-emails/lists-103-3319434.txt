Lo all,

Am I correct in assuming that all DOM parsers have the ability to 
output the parsed XML in Canonical XML format?

The reason I ask is that I need to be able to read/write the data 
contained in an XML file. The trouble is that since I am using a 4gl, I
cannot use c++ etc function calls. So I was hoping to get a DOM 
parser
that put everything out in canonical format, which I could then read.


TIA

John
