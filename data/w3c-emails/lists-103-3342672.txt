Did you intend to say "Canonical XML", invoking the Canonical XML standard,
or is the XML standard good enough?  You should be able to read and write
it in XML format, whether or not it is Canonical XML.  Canonical XML can
even break things for you in some cases, so it would be important to
understand what you are trying to accomplish beyond reading and writing the
document.
