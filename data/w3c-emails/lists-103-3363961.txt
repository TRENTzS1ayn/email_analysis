                      -----------------------
                An XML/HTML Python library using the
                  Document Object Model interface

4DOM is a Python library for XML and HTML processing and manipulation

DOM Core level 2, HTML level 2 and Level 2 Document Traversal.

4DOM should work on all platforms supported by Python.  If you have
any problems with a particular platform, please e-mail the authors.

4DOM is designed to allow developers rapidly design applications
that read, write or manipulate HTML and XML.

News
----

 - Moved all static variables to class variables
 - Fixed printing to work with empty elements
 - Removed all tabs from files
