I meant I wanted a parser to parse a document and output the 
result to a text file in a nice format I could read. Since I am writing 
in a 4gl and cannot use any c or java routines I was hoping 
something might have already been written for me :)
I have read a page on jclark.com about canonical XML and it 
seemed right up my street.

Oooh no, I have nowhere near enough time to write a DOM in my 
4gl.
