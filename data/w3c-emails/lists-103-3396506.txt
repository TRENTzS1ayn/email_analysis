No -- since there's no such defined concept as a "DOM Parser".
The DOM spec omits this, as well as other key features.

Does it parse a DOM tree and emit SAX(2) events?
Does it parse XML and produce a DOM tree?


Any time you're dealing with conversions between DOM and
any other data structure (e.g. XML text encoded in EUC-JP,
any representation of such text, a database, etc) is
exclusively a proprietary operation.
