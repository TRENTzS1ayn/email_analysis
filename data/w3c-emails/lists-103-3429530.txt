Actually, slight  correction: The HTML DOM _does_ actually have a way to
invoke a parser. How it actually does so is up to whoever wrote the
particular implementation of the HTML DOM you're working with; the DOM just
defines a way to make the request.

(I'm mostly working with XML these days; I keep forgetting that the HTML
DOM differs in some ways.)
