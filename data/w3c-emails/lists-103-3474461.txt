This is one of the goals of the DOM. The official DOM recommendation is here:
http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-DOM-Level-1

The next version is not yet a recommendation:
http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2

For the status of current implementations of the DOM in the browsers, I found
this link:
http://wsabstract.com/javatutors/dom.shtml

I don't know if it's a good one or not.

For any questions regarding IE or NS implementations, please send them to their
mailing lists. This mailing list is reserved for comments about the DOM
specification
itself, and not about the implementations.

Regards,
Philippe
