I'm not an expert in Xerces but you should be allowed to get a DOMImplementation
object (see org.apache.xerces.dom.DOMImplementationImpl.getDOMImplementation())
Using this object, you can use the createDocument method to create a DOM
Document:
http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2/core.html#Level-2-Core-DOM-createDocument

Note:
- Since DOM Level 2 is not a recommendation yet, the implementation
of DOM Level 2 in Xerces is still in beta stage.
- DOMImplementationImpl is not an official DOM method. The bootstrapping problem
in Java will be resolved in DOM Level 3.
