It is possible... here is an example. Note I have not yet worked out how to
get the finalised document to serialise itself!

import javax.xml.parsers.*;
import org.w3c.dom.*;
try {
      DocumentBuilderFactory dbf = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance ();
      DocumentBuilder db = dbf.newDocumentBuilder ();
      Document doc = db.newDocument ();
      Element root = doc.createElement ("mytest");
      doc.appendChild (root);
      root.appendChild (doc.createElement ("header"));
      root.appendChild (doc.createTextNode ("\n  some data is text\n  "));
      root.appendChild (doc.createElement ("footer")); 
} catch  (Exception e) 
{}

Subject: creating XML document from scratch


hi,
I want to create a DOM document without originally having an XML
document.  So, instead of parsing an XML document and getting the DOM
document, I want to just create an empty DOM document and then fill in
whatever elements, etc. that I need.  After extensive searching through Java
docs (Xerces implementation), it seems that creating a document from scratch
is not possible using the DOM.  Is this true or am I misunderstanding the
documentation?  I'm sorry if this question has already been answered in FAQ
or the archives but I could not find anything in either source and I just
joined this list.  Any help or clarification would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks a million in advance,

Heather
