"We're making mistakes as fast as we can..."

As I said: It's on the list of issues for DOM Level 3. Level 2 considered
it but decided it couldn't be done properly without DTD support.

Early filtering of the tree ("lazy initialization", as you called it) is
certainly possible. Maybe the Load/Save chapter of DOM Level 3 can look at
that side of the issue. If not, I expect custom solutions will continue to
exist on a DOM-builder-by-DOM-builder basis, though that wouldn't be as
portable.
