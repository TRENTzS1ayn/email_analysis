Reworded. It makes it harder for the new developer that doesn't know all the
ins and out and leads to frustration and not new XML / DOM applications.

Making some good stuff as well.

I agree this certainly can't be done without a DTD.

Good idea- early filtering would work great for applications that validate
the XML that don't need the nodes
but comes at the cost since the non-validated document would still end up
with the nodes
since the DOM couldn't know what text is not needed.
