It is EXTREMELY unlikely that the interface hierarchy will change. Current
inclination is to have a pair of tests:
     Via the Text node: Does this contain only whitespace?
     Via the Element or the Element Declaration: Can this Element
          contain only other Elements.

Details beyond that are still in flux. We still don't have a formal
_internal_ working draft for Level 3, though we're working toward one.

>p.s. Can CDATA sections be located in "ignorable" areas?

Good question. I would say they shouldn't be, since the point of whitespace
in element content is just to allow "pretty-printing" (indenting and the
like), and if you're using a CDATA Section it's because you're trying to
make an explicit statement about document content. But we'd have to check
the XML 1.0 spec to be sure.
