CSS_DIMENSION is for unknown dimension. In CSS2, all lengths, angles, times
and frequencies are dimensions.
The DIMENSION token is part of the CSS2 grammar:
http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/syndata.html#tokenization

setProperty("font-size", "10m", "") will create a dimension even if
you won't be able to use it in a CSS2 engine.
