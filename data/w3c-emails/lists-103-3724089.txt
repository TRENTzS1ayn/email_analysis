Not according to January errata to the XML specification.

... even though in key places, the XML 1.0 spec had made
clear that CDATA just uses an alternate set of delimiters.
The errata have gone to some work to preclude that reading.
More SGML legacy has slipped into XML doctrine.

Lesson for anyone doing syntax design in the future:  there
is a reason for avoiding such context-sensitive mechanisms.
In one phrase:  needless complexity.
