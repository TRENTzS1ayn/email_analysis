Hi,
  I need to read in a DTD from a file that is provided by a third
party.  From the DOM created from this DTD I need to create a GUI which
will allow me to enter information into text boxes to insert into the
XML.  For Example:

Start with:

(DTD)
<!ELEMENT cdlib (cd+)>

<!ELEMENT cd (artist+, title+, format?, description?)>
<!ELEMENT artist (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT title (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT format (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT description (#PCDATA)>

Next Step is:

(GUI)
------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------
cdlib
------------------------------------------
cd + - 
------------------------------------------
             ________________________
Artist      |AnArtist________________| + -
             ________________________
Title       |ATitle__________________| + -
             ________________________
Format      |AFormat_________________| -
             ________________________
Description |ADescription____________| -

------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------

Next Step is:

(XML)

<cdlib>

   <cd>
   <artist>AnArtist</artist>
   <title>ATitle</title>
   <format>AFormat></format>
   <description>ADescription</description>
   </cd>

</cdlib>

Unfortunately I need to develop this Application in Delphi :(.  As you
see, the idea is to have an application that is fully dynamic.  I have
found some XML parsing components, but they don't seem to allow you to
parse a DTD to create anything but a DOM Document Type.  From here I am
unsure what the next step should be.  I also here that the DTD section
of the DOM is likely to change greatly in level 3.  Is the project just
a pipe dream :)?  Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks,

David Charlton.

P.S.  Sorry about the lenght of this e-mail.  From my postings on other
groups I have found that a simple paragraph describing the problem just
doesn't show the big picture clearly enough.
