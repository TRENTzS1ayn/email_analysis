Hi David,

1. the format (syntax) used for XML DTDs is not XML itself
2. the DOM is an object view for XML instances

--> a DOM tree is not intended to represent a XML DTD

But, if I get you right, you're going to write a XML editor
which is configured via a XML DTD. So, why do you want
to transform the XML DTDs into DOMs?

Carsten
