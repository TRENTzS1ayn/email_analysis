I didn't say that a DTD by itself was an XML Instance. It isn't, and
attempting to parse it as one will yield errors. However, an XML instance
can certainly include an internal subset, or can reference an external DTD,
and a validating XML parser will handle these.

If you "just want to parse the DTD", you have to express that request in a
format that your parser can handle -- which may mean providing a dummy
instance document, or may mean calling the parser differently, depending on
your parser's APIs. The DOM currently doesn't address how parsers are
invoked; DOM Level 3 is looking at that issue as part of the "Load/Save"
activity. Meanwhile, look at the documentation for the parser you want to
use.

The DOM currently has no standardized mechanism for representing them. DOM
Level 3 is looking at that issue under the "Content Model" activity.
Meanwhile, some parsers -- including XML4J -- have custom data structures
for that purpose.
