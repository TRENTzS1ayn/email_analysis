Maybe I am misinterpreting something.  It is my understanding that the DOM
Level 2 is used to modify properties values of a CSS level 2 document. 
However, the CSS2 grammar [http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/grammar.html], which
is more restrictIve than the core CSS Grammar does not contain any
expressions with the DIMENSION token.  Does this mean that a function such
as setProperty parses against the core CSS grammar and not the CSS2
grammar?
