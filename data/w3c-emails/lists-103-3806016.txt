I noticed that further up the method's description, this previous is
stated, so please ignore the previous question.  I do, however, have
another question about setStringValue().
Which of the following is the correct way to use setStringValue in the
following cases?

setStringValue(CSS_STRING, "\"this way\"" );
or
setStringValue(CSS_STRING, "this way" );

setStringValue(CSS_URL, "url(###)" );
or
setStringValue(CSS_URL, "###" );

primitiveValue.setCssText("a, valid, list") // no exception raised

primitiveValue.getValueType();// now returns CSS_VALUE_LIST
primitiveValue.getPrimitiveType() == ????.

^^^Sorry added some information that I forgot about in my previous post.
