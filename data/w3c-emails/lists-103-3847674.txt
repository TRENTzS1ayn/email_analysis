OK. So which of the "may/should/must" applies? It sounds to me like you
are saying "may", in which case no content author can depend on this
behavior, meaning it is rather useless to specify since the author would
have to explicitly check if such behavior were implemented. If the
answer is "must" then that's a different story.
