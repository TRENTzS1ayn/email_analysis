I understand that the display of elements does not need to be cleanly
nested visually. However, this doesn't mean that DOM implementation could
supply coordinates of mouse evvents in coordinate system of the target
element. To be able to do so one should simply subtract the sum of all
offsets of the top left point of all ancestor elements. In that way DOM
users could work with coordinate systems that have origins at the top left
corner of each box.

Also, Netscape and IE support this (although in an incompatihle way).

Sincerely yours

You may be able to extract that information using the DOM Level 3 "Views"
features, when that becomes available. It's _NOT_ a simple problem;
remember that there's nothing which obligates the displayed form of
elements to be cleanly nested, or even contiguous,
