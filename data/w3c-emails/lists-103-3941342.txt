The CSSPrimitive value is part of the CSS "core" object model and not
the CSS2 extension. Regarding the core syntax of CSS, "12kms" is not an
error. Appendix D of the CSS2 spec describes a more restrictive grammar
for CSS2. The CSS Object model is used by others CSS application, such as
SVG, and is not restricted to CSS2 only.
