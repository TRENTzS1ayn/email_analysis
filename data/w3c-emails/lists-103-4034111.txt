If someone posts a DOM event to a child of the <DIV/>, normal DOM event
handling says that the event's flow is subject to both capture and
bubble... so unless an earlier handler cancels the event flow, it should
reach the <DIV/>

But I'm really not sure whether an HTML system will ever post a keyboard
event to any node except an input element. I _think_ that's something for
the HTML spec to determine, rather than the DOM...?
