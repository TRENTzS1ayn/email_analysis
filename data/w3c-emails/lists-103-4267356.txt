Tcl does a pretty good job of handling character encodings.

With TclDOM, documents in memory are stored as UTF-8 (whether
created from scratch in memory or parsed from XML).  In Tcl you
can serialize the document as a string.  If you are writing
the XML to a file you have complete control over the encoding
of the output stream, using standard Tcl channel commands 
(Tcl uses "channels" rather than "file descriptors" to account 
for platform differences).

Hope that helps,
Steve Ball
