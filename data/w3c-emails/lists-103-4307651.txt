http://home.pacbell.net/david-b/xml/ ... the "DOM2" implementation.
Conforms to the latest version of the spec ("CR") as best as I
can tell.  Supports quite a few of the optional modules. It's open
source; the distribution includes source, javadoc, and some examples.

I suggest you also grab the "utilities" package, so that you can
easily hook it up to your preferred SAX parser.  If you don't have
one, it includes a variety.  (Validating and non, a "DOM walker",
SAX2 wrapper around Swing's HTML parser, and SAX2 wrappers for some
other parsers.)
