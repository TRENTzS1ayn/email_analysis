See also http://xml.apache.org -- the "Xerces" parser, which is based on an
improved version of IBM's XML4J package, includes a DOM that supports much
of DOM Level 2. For now the new APIs are reached via a separate package
name (it was com.ibm.xml.domx; I'm not sure what that's been changed to in
this release), to avoid confusion over what is and isn't part of the
official DOM spec; that distinction will go away when DOM Level 2 becomes a
RECcomendation, and folks should be able to just change their imports and
recompile.
