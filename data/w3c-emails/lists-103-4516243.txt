1. Obtain an _implementation_ of the Java bindings.  Try looking around
   <http://xml.apache.org>, for example. 

2. The implementation will normally come with a parser that constructs a
   DOM parse tree from a document read from a file.

3. In your application, import the implementation's parser class, and also
   the DOM interfaces, using (for example)

   import org.w3c.dom.*;

4. Do whatever it takes to run the implementation's parser over a file.
   This will eventually return an org.w3c.Document object, to which you can
   then apply the various methods given in the DOM spec. 

DOM level 1 specifies what you can do with a Document once you have it, but
says nothing about how you can obtain a Document in the first place.  It
also says nothing about how you convert from a DOM tree back to text, if
that's what you want to do.

You may have trouble finding a Java implementation for the HTML interfaces;
I think that most freestanding implementations only implement the core.  If
you want to do this inside of a browser, you may be out of luck -- I'm not
sure whether applets are given access to their enclosing document.  If they
were, it would probably give rise to some rather interesting security holes.
