Just a sanity check: John, have the recent answers (that the DOM is just an
interface, and that you need to obtain or write code which actually
implements that interface and supports the language bindings you want to
use) addressed your question? Or did we misinterpret what you were asking?

The challenge is indeed going to be finding an HTML DOM that will talk to
Java -- or finding more than one, if you want to do this portably.
Unfortunately, not all browsers support accessing their DOM from Java.
