I cannot believe that I missed this in earlier reviews, but the Event
interface in  DOM 2 Events is missing a timestamp for the event.  Without
this, many common UI functions (like filtering small motions between click
down and click up) will be hard or impossible to do well. In addition, for
SMIL Boston to work with DOM Events, we would have to define a parallel set
of Event interfaces that add the time.  This would be a royal pain.

I know that DOM 2 is officially nearing PR, but this is a really serious
issue for SMIL, and scripters.  When I spoke to Philippe about this, he did
not know of a reason that this had been deliberately left out.  If there was
a reason, I would be interested to hear it, and to hear the proposed
work-around.

Thanks - Patrick
