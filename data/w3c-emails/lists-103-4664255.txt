As you said, this isn't a DOM question, but a Java question. Internally,
Java strings use UTF-16, so encodings are only an issue when reading data
into Java or writing it out. The Java libraries have some support for this;
see the encoding parameter of InputStreamReader, for example. They may not
support all the encodings you want to use, in which case you'd have to
provide your own conversion code.

The simplest answer from an XML point of view is just to use a
parser/generator package that understands the encoding(s) you want to use.
