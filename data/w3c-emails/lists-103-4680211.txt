I applaud the sentiment ... ;-)

However, if there's an issue with that "start of epoch" date, it
may be OK to have it be unspecified ... since the motivation is
to detect relative times.  Individual hosting environments would
specify their start-of-epoch date.

A 64-bit millisecond timestamp seems the right model to me.  Apps
won't have to worry about it rolling over, yet the events (UI only!)
will be easily distinguished.
