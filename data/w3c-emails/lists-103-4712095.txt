SoftQuad Software has both an HTML and an XML editor with
close-to-WYSIWYG capabilities using CSS which have a DOM interface (not
yet 100% Level 1, but we're getting there!) The DOM is reachable via
COM, so you can use any scripting language that works with the Windows
Scripting Host. More details at www.hotmetalpro.com, or www.xmetal.com.
