The Emil? XML editor <http://www.in-progress.com> has a DOM1 based plugin
API. DOM can also be used when writing scripts for the application. The
next release of Emil? is likely to support DOM2 (I am working on it right
this instance).

The same DOM interface can also be used with our other web software,
included the Interaction web server companion and XPublish XML website
publishing system. All these applications are implemented in Common LISP
and can be extended using scripts or compiled code in the same language.
The DOM binding for Common LISP is documented at:

  http://interaction.in-progress.com/developer/dom/

Emil? and our other XML software are deliberately not WYSIWYG. I am a firm
believer in separating content from presentation.
