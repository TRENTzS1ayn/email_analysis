If you just say "markup", I think the formulation is right, although I
don't understand why the first case situation is not merely a special
case of the second one?  Also, there is another somewhat murky point:
the sequence of so-called "information items" that an element defines
may (or may not) contain "entity markers", which probably are related
to the question of whether entities are expanded or not (something
that's elaborated on elsewhere in DOM2); so you're probably not
painting the full picture here.

If you say "mixed content", no, then your formulation is not quite
right I believe.  This is because mixed content could be just
character data as a special case.
