We had quite a lot of feedback on the DOM Level 2 CR and made a 
lot of clarifications to the spec. (Still in the process, actually).

Some of the feedback we received convinced us that the internal 
subset string that we added in the CR draft (after feedback on the 
Last Call draft) was more trouble than it was worth, particularly 
since we're starting work on Level 3, which will address the issue 
properly. So we're taking out the internalSubset parameter on 
createDocumentType. 

The suggested changes to method names on Range were made. 
(isCollapsed -> collapsed and some capitalisation changes).

Expect a more complete response to comments soon; we're still 
working through the details.

I would like to hear of any implementations of Level 2 that are done 
or almost done, so that I can be sure we have sufficient 
implementation experience. You can email me privately if you don't 
want to tell anyone else yet; just tell me which modules you've 
implemented or will soon have implemented (estimated time frame 
would also be good).

thanks,


Lauren
