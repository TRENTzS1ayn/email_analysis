Hi,
Right! I want to expose the new CSS3 User Interface Enhancement
properties to the HTML DOM. I want to manipulate the new properties with
HTML DOM, CSS mechanisms and through some scripting. I am trying an
experimental implementation as my Master's thesis work. 
Yeah! I would like to know more about CSS processing engine. I
have HTMLDOM builder and CSS parser. I want to automate the annotation
and arrive at an enhanced ( with new Attibute and value pairs ) HTML page
for further manipulation through again DOM. Would you please suggest me.

Thanx.
