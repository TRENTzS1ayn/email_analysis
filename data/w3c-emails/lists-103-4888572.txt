Sorry; I was jumping to a FAQ when you may have been asking another
question entirely...

That should be doable, assuming that your browser makes its DOM accesssible
to Java. (Not all do, yet.)

You'll have to work out what format you want to recieve that data in,
extract the information once you recieve it. Then you can use the DOM APIs
to update the document's contents with the new data.
