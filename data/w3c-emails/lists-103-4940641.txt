I am trying to copy a node from one document and insert it into a separate
document tree. I tried to cloneNode(true) it and insertBefore() into the
new document, but a DOMException with a code of "WRONG_DOCUMENT_ERROR" is
raised. Why is this a limitation, and is there an easy perform this
operation with standard DOM methods?

I am using IBM's xml4j java parser (XERCES).

Thanks,

Robert Rangel
