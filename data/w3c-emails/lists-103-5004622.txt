Dave,

The current release does only support IE5.  However, we continue to work on
Mozilla and will be releasing a demonstration package for Mozilla in a few
weeks or so.  We contributed a very small change in the Mozilla codebase to
enable Weblets and as of M13 that change is included in the Mozilla source
tree.  In the future we hope to see Weblets for other popular browsers.
Also, I might note that Weblets is about DOM programming in general, not
just HTML DOM.  As a result, we will be releasing support in Weblets for
other "things" that provide a UI via the DOM.

Regarding your problems with the IE demo package - We unfortunately did not
clearly document that JDK 1.1.* was required for the current release.  We
fixed this documentation problem but it sounds as if we posted the
clarification too late for you and I apologize for that.

Keep your eye on the alphaWorks site
(http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/weblets) for future announcements about
Weblets coming soon.  We are wrapping up a developers kit that, among other
things, will include an installation program that should make using the
devkit much easier.
