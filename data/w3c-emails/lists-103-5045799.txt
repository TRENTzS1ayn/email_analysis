Here is some feedback on parts I've looked at.

It's the logical structure. What about simply:

  In the DOM, documents have a logical structure which is
  very much like a tree; to be more precise, which is like a
  "forest" or "grove", which can contain more than one tree."

?

Actually this one really is naively.

Well, what we meant is that for HTML, uppercase is the canonical form in
the DOM. I guess your question means we failed to make that clear.

In theory HTML is an SGML application and any SGML constructs could be
included in an HTML document. In practice most browsers don't know
anything about SGML though. So, as far as the DOM is concerned, XHTML
can, since it's XML, but HTML cannot.

Hmm, I'm not sure about that one. I agree this text is bogus but I think
you're going too far. Maybe the following would be correct. I'll need to
check with the WG on that one.

      Two nodes are deeply equivalent if they are equivalent,
      their child node lists are equivalent NodeList objects, and
      their attributes are [deeply?] equivalent.


Well, thank you very much for this careful review!
