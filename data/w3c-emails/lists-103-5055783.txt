On second look, the original is clear. If you want to change it, here 
is another try:

     In the DOM, documents have a logical structure which is very
     much like a tree; to be more precise, the structure is like a
     "forest" or "grove", which can contain more than one tree.
or
     In the DOM, documents have a structure which is very much like
     a tree; to be more precise, their logical structure is like a
     "forest" or "grove", which can contain more than one tree.

My fault. I'd attribute my comment to a reading error. (If anyone 
else was confused, perhaps a sentence would fit in section 1.1.6. on 
String comparisons [1]. It's on the same page, and comes before 
Document and Element.)

Thanks for your gracious reply.
