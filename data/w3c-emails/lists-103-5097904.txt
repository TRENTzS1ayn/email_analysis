I'm still a little confused about the actual implementation of this.  For
example should the Java interface for 
LinkStyle be:

public interface LinkStyle extends ProcessingInstruction
{
    public StyleSheet getSheet();
}

rather than just:

public interface LinkStyle
{
    public StyleSheet getSheet();
}
??

Thanks,
