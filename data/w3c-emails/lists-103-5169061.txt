Unfortunately that would defeat the use cases that whatToShow was designed
to handle, such as "hide the EntityReference nodes".

Unless we make the skip-versus-reject behavior of whatToShow
user-selectable, or provide a second field for whatToReject... but that
feels like scope creep to me.

You can write the desired filtering behavior today. The question is whether
the current behavior is excessively confusing even when documented.

How would this differ from, eg, (NodeIterator.getFilter()!=null)?
