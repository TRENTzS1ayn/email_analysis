Dave,

DOM allows me to access a childNode directly by using the item(index) method
off of the nodelist that is returned from childNodes, rather than walking
the nodelist.

So, I was expecting that if I had the reference to the childNode, it would
have an index property that I would be able to use for routines like this,
rather than having to examine the nodelist itself.

Am I really expecting too much? :-)
