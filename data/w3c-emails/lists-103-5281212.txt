Right, the "list" can be implemented as an array (easy to implement
the "item" method) or as a linnked list (more awkward) or some other
data structure.

Perhaps.  If you got used to using it, the linked list implementation
would accumulate some bizarre costs since it'd need to recompute that
property pretty often ... but that'd be more reasonable than asking for
a specific "is this child before that one" primitive, as you'd seemed
to be suggesting!
