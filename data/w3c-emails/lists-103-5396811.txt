That's true in Javascript, which is not very OO and forces you to write
filters as pointer-to-function. In languages such as Java, the disable
could be done on a per-instance basis of the filter object... so that the
disable could be shared when that object is shared, and disjunct when
separate instances were used.

Allowing a filter-disable mechanism on Iterator has all the same issues as
making the iterator's filter attribute mutable. The WG decided against
doing so in Level 2. We can reconsider it in Level 3.
