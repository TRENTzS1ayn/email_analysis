If we could use DOM to uncomment javascript code, it could lead to high
performance gains at the browser end. Let me elaborate.
function performAction()
{
   use DOM to uncomment performActionCore();
   performActionCore();
}

function performActionCore()
{
/*
lots of JS coding, all commented

*/
}

This would amount to implementing loading Javascript On-demand! Any furthur
thoughts??
