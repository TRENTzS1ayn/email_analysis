the problem is that the browser(at least IE) scans all imported javascript
code for finding syntax errors at the load time. this elongates the load
time unnecessarily. if the code is commented at load time, the page loads so
much faster

I'm not sure I understand what you mean by "uncomment", and why it'd gain
you any performance.

As far as a DOM view of an HTML page is concerned, your example's all text
nodes. Removing the /**/ is entirely a string-processing operation, at this
level.

You might want to take a look at the Bean Scripting Framework (BSF),
available on www.alphaWorks.ibm.com. That's intended to be a fairly general
approach to invoking scripts on demand, in any of a variety of languages...
and javascript is one of those languages. Of course this requires that the
application recognize the text as a script and pass it to BSF for
evaluation.
