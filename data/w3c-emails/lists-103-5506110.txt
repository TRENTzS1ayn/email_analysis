How about: because some implementations might be able to
provide an O(1) implementation, whereas an external routine
would be likely to be O(number of siblings) or thereabouts.

There're several other queries like this which could usefully
be added and which might allow for similar optimizations:
precedes in document order; is an ancestor of; least common
ancestor; depth from root etc.

Cheers,


Miles
