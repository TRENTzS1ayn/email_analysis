The original comment was more along the lines of "can't do
this, why?  aaagh!" as I recall ... not the "it's too slow"
that you seem to be suggesting it was.

It's common that some special purpose task can be sped up by
putting it into infrastructure.  But that in itself is rarely
a compelling motivation for making it a "standard, everyone
must implement this" part of an infrastructure.  If everyone
has to pay for it, everyone _ought_ to benefit more or less
equally from it.
