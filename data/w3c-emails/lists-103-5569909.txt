There's language in L2's description of hasFeature that addresses this.

We might want to tweak that wording slightly. It currently says "The legal
values are defined throughout this specification and listed in the
Compliance section." I suspect that we meant to say "The values used by the
DOM Specification". We should also probably be more explicit about the fact
that names without periods (ie, without prefixes) are reserved for use by
the DOM spec.
