I had a similar comment, showing the rather horrible situation
that folk are in today if they want to populate a Document with
a correct DocumentType .

In short, the basic problem is that the current DOM APIs have two
ways to express "Document Type":  as a subtype of Document, and as
the real DocumentType object (which is however largely unusable in
the December CR).

One could eliminate the "change type" case by making that illegal.

As I'd commented in my post (archive URL above), there seems to be
an assumption that document type is an _external_ notion, which is
manifestly not the model of XML.  MIME does it that way, for a much
weaker notion of "type", though.
