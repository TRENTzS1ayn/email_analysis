I'd not call that a "failure", but you could argue that point
if you felt like it.

Comments aren't there for program use, shouldn't be customized.
It'd be like designing hubcaps to make sure they work as shovels;
sure you can sometimes do it in a pinch, but don't rely on it.

As for PIs ... they're either built in to the application (e.g.
ones marking an editor cursor) or levarage the NOTATION mechanism
half-suggested for that purpose, and so must appear after the DTD.

Ergo, no failures involved.
