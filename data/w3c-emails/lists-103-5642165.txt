Actually "Document" and "Document Element" are the two concepts you
seem to want -- "Document Element" is the root tag and its children,
"Document" contains that, along with any comments/PIs and optional DTD.

"Document" is indeed the container for an entire XML document.

DOM doesn't actually facilitate sharing DOM data structures anywhere.
You can return DOM nodes that proxy to shared non-DOM objects, and some
folk do.  The problem is that each node has a unique owner (can't share
between documents) and parent or "associated element" (so can't share
within one document) node.
