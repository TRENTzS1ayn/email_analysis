Accessible != customizable.

As I said, just because you can use a hubcap as a shovel doesn't
mean such usage should be a basic design consideration for a car.

Likewise, just because legacy non-extensible systems (HTML) do
something does not mean its hacks (e.g. css/JavaScript/... in
comments) and limitations should be the foundation to build on
with a designed-for-extensibility XML future.
