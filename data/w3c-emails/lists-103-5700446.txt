Shared data structures for external DTDs are exactly what I demand. 
Therefore I wrote, that factory methods for externalDTD nodes should
be placed in the DOM implementation interface, which keeps track of
them.  These external DTDs must not be part of a document tree (hereby
I mean a tree for the whole XML document including the internal DTD),
but there must be nodes in the document tree (to be more exactly:
ExternalDoctypeDeclaration nodes) that point to the external DTD nodes
of the DOM implementation interface.
