As I wrote in an earlier post:  Creating customized external DTDs is a
legitimate use of PIs before the DTD.

Beside that:  The minimum requirement for a final DOM version is that
it offers a way so that each well formed XML document can be parsed
properly.  What you demand is a stricter XML version which forbids PIs
before DTDs.  As long as the current XML version defines the prolog as

[22] prolog ::= XMLDecl? Misc* (doctypedecl Misc*)?

and *not* as

[22] prolog ::= XMLDecl? (Comment | S)* (doctypedecl Misc*)?

the DOM shall seek to support a proper treatment of PIs and the DTD in
their order of appearance.
