OK.  But it has to "tell" my application, that the XML document has a
PI before the DTD so that my application can generate -- in my parser
scenario -- the external DTD before the external DTD is parsed. That
is what I ment with my statement:

That's roughly the scenario I had in mind.  Only to make my point
clear:  The parser starts parsing the document and first of all
stumbles over a PI, which tells it to immediately create an external
DTD; the parser waits until this DTD has been created, stumbles over
the external DTD declaration, reads it and goes then on parsing the
original document.  --  To program an XML editor to write a document
that instructs our parser to show the described behavior, it has to be
possible to create DOM trees with PIs before DTDs.  And this is *only*
a question of "representing the document properly" (quoting you).
