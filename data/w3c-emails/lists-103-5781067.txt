I agree. The DOM isn't "final" yet, and hasn't stopped seeking. Level 2 is
an incremental improvement, but there are many issues still to be addressed
in Level 3 and beyond.

The likely alternative, at this point in the design cycle, would be to
defer the question to Level 3 and have no factories for either Document and
DocumentType in Level 2. Given that choice, I'd rather go with what we
have, even if it's only a small improvement. It _will_ be helpful to
applications which want to generate DOMs as output; for most non-parser
code, the sequence of DocumentType to Document to content does make sense.
