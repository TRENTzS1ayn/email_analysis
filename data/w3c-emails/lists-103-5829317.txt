importNode copies the other node "by value" -- it extracts all the
information and uses it to produce a new node (or nodes) belonging to the
target document. The data being copied must already be available via the
DOM Node API; you're importing from another Document, not from a URI or
file.

If all you have is a URI, your application will have to use that URI to
retrieve the data, pass it through a parser and find the node it's
interested in (or otherwise find that data and express it as a DOM Node).
After you have done so, importNode can be used to copy it.
