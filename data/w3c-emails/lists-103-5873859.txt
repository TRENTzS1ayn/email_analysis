Instructions can be found on  http://www.w3.org/DOM/. Tried to post them
here, but the mailing list handler gets confused and thinks that I'm
attempting to drop my own subscription. Entirely too "helpful"...

Of course the server itself should probably be posting a reminder of how to
disconnect once a month or so... or perhaps should attach it to the bottom
of each post.
