Not portably, in DOM Level 1 or Level 2. DOM Level 3 will address DTDs
(and, we hope, schemas). But given that we're still in the early
requirements phase for Level 3, it will be a while before this becomes
official.

For now, you'll have to rely on custom features built into the
parser/validator/DTD model you're using. There are certainly examples of
doing this; IBM's "Xeena" XML-editor relies on the fact that XML4J/Xerces
makes this information available.
