As presently specified, DOM2 does not indicate how to obtain an instance of
DocumentTraversal.  It appears that this interface should be implemented by
whatever class also implements DOMImplementation, and that you should be
able to cast that to DocumentTraversal if the implementation reports that it
supports DocumentTraversal.

I think some clarification is needed, even if just to say that the way to
get one is implementation dependant.
