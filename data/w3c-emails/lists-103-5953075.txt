Really?!!  That's disgusting -- it forces the use of a cast. 

OK, so it's no worse than anything <em>else</em> in the DOM, which simply
<strong>cannot be used safely</strong> without run-time type checking.  That
doesn't make it right.

I guess I'm just too much of a language purist for this business -- I've
always been of the opinion that if you're forced to resort to a cast in
order to do something, you've found a serious design flaw in the API.

A better alternative would be a getDocumentTraversal method on Document or,
better, DOMImplementation: it would of course return null if the Traversal
feature was unimplemented.
