>Really?!!  That's disgusting -- it forces the use of a cast.

Same solution as in factories for the other optional Level 2 modules.
Hanging it off a factory method/getter elsewhere in the DOM would be no
cheaper.

You only have to cast once per document, of course, if you cache the
DocumentTraversal view.

or,

I believe we did look at that alternative. I'm not sure I remember exactly
why it was rejected.
