The "name" is an attribute of the Node, and is made up of the namespace URI
and the localname. The binding of Node (and thus name) to namespace URI
occurs at the time the Node is created. It isn't expressed as a seperate
"name" object, but I think it's equivalent to what you're asking for. Since
object creation can be expensive in some environments, and names are
immutable, I don't think a separate name object would be an improvement.

The DOM doesn't currently check for validity; that's a Level 3 issue.  Did
you mean "not well formed"? Under the current design, the DOM doesn't
enforce all the XML well-formedness rules; that too is a Level 3 issue.

If your point is that validation currently interacts badly with namespaces,
I agree. But until schemas are released or someone redesigns DTD validation
to be namespace-aware, there isn't a lot we can do about that.
