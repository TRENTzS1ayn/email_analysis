Well, only sort of.

?
As they are immutable, were they to be interned, there would't need to
be recreated. It's an old argument.

I meant "not conforming to the namespaces in xml specification, as the
'prefix declared' constraint is not met". Keeping a DOM in conformance
with said spec is not a reasonable endeavour. As such, the namespace
attributes have no purpose in the DOM. One might one to keep them around
as hints to the serializer, but they're not of much other use.

No, that's a separate issue.
