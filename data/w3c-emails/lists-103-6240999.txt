Dear W3C Advisory Committee Representative,

In response to the request for the extension of Candidate Recommendation
Status for the Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2, W3C extends the DOM
Level 2 as W3C Candidate Recommendation, through 20 March 2000. 

The W3C DOM Working Group has requested the extension as 

1. The WG is still reviewing public comments.
2. The WG is seeking additional implementation feedback.
3. The WG would like to have a review of the implementation report with
   W3C.

Of the feedback reviewed thus far:

Some of the feedback the WG received convinced them that the internal
subset string added in the CR draft (after feedback on the Last Call
draft) was more trouble than it was worth, particularly work on Level 3
has started; Level 3 work will address the issue properly. The WG has
taken out the internalSubset parameter on  createDocumentType. 

In addition, the suggested changes to method names on Range were made. 
(isCollapsed -> collapsed and some capitalisation changes).

You may review the new W3C DOM Level 2 Candidate Recommendation at:
http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/CR-DOM-Level-2-20000307

The disposition of public comments are at:

>From the W3C Process Document, section 6.2.3 at:
        http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/Process-19991111/tr.html#RecsCR

A Candidate Recommendation has received significant review from its
immediate technical community (resulting from the Last Call).
Advancement of a document to Candidate Recommendation is an explicit
call to those outside of the related Working Groups or the W3C itself
for implementation and technical feedback. There is no requirement that
a Working Draft have two independent and interoperable implementations
to become a Candidate Recommendation. Instead, this is the phase at
which the Working Group is responsible for formally acquiring that
experience or at least defining the expectations of implementation.

Abstract

This specification defines the Document Object Model Level 2, 
a platform- and language-neutral interface that allows programs 
and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, 
structure and style of documents. The Document Object Model Level 
2 builds on the Document Object Model Level 1.

The DOM Level 2 is made of a set of core interfaces to create 
and manipulate the structure and contents of a document and a set 
of optional modules. These modules contain specialized interfaces 
dedicated to XML, HTML, an abstract view, generic stylesheets, 
Cascading Style Sheets, Events, traversing the document structure, 
and a Range object.


Status of this document

This specification is still in the Candidate Recommendation phase. 
This means the specification is stable, and the period to allow
implementation of the specification is extended. The new Candidate 
Recommendation period ends the 20 March 2000. 

Comments on this document are invited and are to be sent to the public 
mailing list www-dom@w3.org. An archive is available at
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom/.

Should this specification prove impossible or very difficult to 
implement, the necessary changes to make it implementable will be
made. If this specification is possible to implement, the only changes 
which will be made to this specification are minor editorial 
changes and clarifications.

This document has been produced as part of the W3C DOM Activity. The 
authors of this document are the DOM WG members. Different modules of 
the Document Object Model have different editors.
