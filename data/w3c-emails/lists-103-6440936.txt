The Extended Document Object Model Package for Delphi contains two
components and several functions and procedures which support the
processing of XML documents. The component TDocumentObjectModel
transforms an XML Document into a tree-like structure and provides
several functions to manipulate and evaluate it. The component
TXmlToDomParser transforms an XML file or an XML string into a
TDocumentObjectModel structure. A detailed documentation is included.

The XDOM 2.0 is a Delphi3 implementation of the DOM 2 Core and the
Traversal feature, as specified in "Document Object Model (DOM) Level
2 Specification. Version 1.0. W3C candidate Recommendation 07 March,
2000" ("http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/CR-DOM-Level-2-20000307" --
copyright (c) World Wide Web Consortium, (Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, Institute National de Recherche en Informatique et en
Automatique, Keio University), all rights reserved).

Due to a few problems in the official specifications of the DOM some
modifications had been made in the XDOM 2.0.  To improve the
functionality of the implementation several additional procedures and
functions had been implemented as well.  To indicate this
modifications the name of this DOM implementation had been changed to
eXtended Document Object Model (XDOM).

The binaries and source code can be downloaded from
"http://www.philo.de/xml/".  Its private as well as commercial use is
free of charge.  People are encouraged to participate in the future
development of the XDOM by sending bug reports, additional components
or source code examples.  To coordinate this activity a mailing list
has been established.
