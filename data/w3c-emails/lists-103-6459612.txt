In trying to implement the DOM style sheet feature I come across the
problem where to locate the factory methods for styleSheet,
styleSheetList, LinkStyle, and DocumentStyle. 
DOM2, p.133 reads: "The DocumentStyle interface provides a mechanism
by which the style sheets embedded in a document can be retrieved. The
expectation is that an instance of the DocumentStyle interface can be
obtained by using binding-specific casting methods on an instance of
the Document interface."  That treats a styleSheet as related to a
Document node and suggests implementing the factory methods at the
Document interface.  But there are two problems:

1. PIs related to style sheets can occur outside the root element. (As
I was told before, PIs outside the root element would be addressed in
DOM3.  I just want to warn that the binding of the DocumentStyle
interface to the Document interface might be a hidden preliminary
decision of this issue.)

2. Since a style sheet might be attached to different documents, it
would be naturally to implement the factory method for the styleSheet
on the DOMImplementation interface and likely to have a DocumentStyle
method on the DOMImplementation as well. Instead of the disabled
attribute of the StyleSheet we would need a list of all documents
which apply the style sheet.
