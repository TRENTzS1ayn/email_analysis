Note that the points Ray brings up about the possibility that someone still
has a reference to the removed node are precisely the reason we've tried to
be very careful about always saying that nodes are "removed" rather than
"deleted". A removed node continues to exist until some memory management
scheme destroys it, presumably after the application has released all
references to it. Exactly how that memory management scheme works is left
up to the specific DOM language binding and implementation.
