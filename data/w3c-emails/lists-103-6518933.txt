Actually, this does belong on the list, in case anyone else is confused --

All public W3C documents are available from their website. The easiest
approach for DOM-related information is to go to http://www.w3.org/DOM .
For related projects, see the list at http://www.w3.org/TR which includes
both Recommendations (as close to an "official standard" as W3C ever gets)
and specs which are still under development and haven't yet been approved
by the W3C's membership.

At the moment, most the discussion in the www-dom list focuses on the DOM
Level 2 Candidate Recommendation document; any quotations and/or citations
should refer to that unless explicitly marked otherwise. A few quotes refer
to the FAQ, the requirements. I believe there are links to all of these
from the DOM page.

DOM Level 3 does not yet have any formal documentation. We're still working
on requirements and an initial sketch. We hope to have those available
fairly soon. The "Level 3 open issues" list is not curently a public
document; you'll have to take my word for it when I assure you that we're
aware of an issue and have logged it there for further consideration.
