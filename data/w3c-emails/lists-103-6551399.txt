The DOM hasn't architected a mechanism for recognizing whitespaces in
element context (sometimes called "ignorable whitespace"). That requires
DTD support, which is expected in DOM Level 3.

Meanwhile, you're stuck with searching your parser's documentation to see
if they have a custom/nonportable mechanism for recognizing these.
