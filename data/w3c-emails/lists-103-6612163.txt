Let's say you have a simple nested tag like:

<STRONG>Hello, <I>I'm </I>doing fine</STRONG>

I'm having a hard time understanding how one can use
any combination of DOM functionality to reconstruct a
document with nested tags. In my primitive
understanding, the nested tag element is a child
object and as far as I can tell you can query the
parent for WHAT the child is, and in what order the
child appears among other children, but not WHERE it
is in the text of the parent. Please enlighten me.
