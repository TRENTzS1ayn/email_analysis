Why aren't the OnSelect and OnSelectStart specified in the DOM spec?
They have both been present in Internet Explorer since version 4 on all
platforms.

It's also possible to cancel the event thru setting the event.returnValue to
false.

The support of these events is a must to do some real DHTML applications.
There must be way of prevent the user from selecting the text or elements of
a document.
