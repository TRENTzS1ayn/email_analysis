In the example given of:

<STRONG>Hello, <I>I'm </I>doing fine</STRONG>

I think the confusion is in how many children the STRONG element has.  From
my understanding it would have three children.

1. A text node containing "Hello, "
2. An element node with name "I" with a child text node of "I'm "
3. A text node containing "doing fine"

I believe the question was based on the assumption that there are two
children.

1. A text node containing "Hello, doing fine".
2. An element node with name "I" with a child text node of "I'm ".

If that is the case then the point of not being able to identify the
location of the embedded node within the children of STRONG.
