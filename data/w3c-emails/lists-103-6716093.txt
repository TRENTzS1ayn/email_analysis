The description is wrong. You should read "DOMString" instead of 
"CSSPrimitiveValue". I'm going to fix that.

counter functions can only contains identifiers and strings. Both of them
are clearly identify in counter and counters. Changing them to CSSPrimitive
values will add a unuseful layer to access the identifiers.
