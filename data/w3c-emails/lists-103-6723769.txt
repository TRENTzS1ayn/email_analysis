There is a relation from the style sheet to the document through the
StyleSheet.ownerNode attribute. We don't have a factory method to
create a style sheet associated with a document. See also

PIs outside the root element are addressed in DOM2. They are childs
of the Document.

Actually, there is a method to create a stylesheet from
a DOMImplementation, see 
http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/CR-DOM-Level-2-20000307/css.html#CSS-DOMImplementationCSS
But, since there is no way to associate the style sheet to a document,
this method is useful only for the CSS editors.
A style sheet can be associated to only one ownerNode, so it can be
attached to more than one document.
