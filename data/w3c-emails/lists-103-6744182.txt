One reason is that names with colons were used by by 
users of namespaces throughout level one.  This would 
produce localnames that have colons in them, which seems 
wrong.

This mixing situation is bound to produce errors in any
case with the application using NS methods.  I like an 
obvious error more than a less-obvious one, that just
causes the program to malfunction for less-obvious
reasons.  So I like a null localname.
