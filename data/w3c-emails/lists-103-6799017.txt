Hello,
  Sorry for the static, but I cannot seem to find a copy
of the DOM 0 spec...I looked around, found lots of links
to DOM 1, but I wanted to look at 0? Anyone know
where this can be found? Perchance does anyone know
of ps/pdf copies?

  Plz email me privately, as I am not (currently) on the list.
Thanks all!
