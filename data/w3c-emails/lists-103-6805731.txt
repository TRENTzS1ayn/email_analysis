See the glossary provided with DOM Level 2.

DOM Level 0
          The term "DOM Level 0" refers to a mix (not formally specified)
of HTML document
          functionalities offered by Netscape Navigator version 3.0 and
Microsoft Internet Explorer version
          3.0. In some cases, attributes or methods have been included for
reasons of backward
          compatibility with "DOM Level 0".
