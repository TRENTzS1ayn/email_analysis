In Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2 Specification, Version 1.0, W3C Candidate Recommendation 07 March, 2000, under Section 5.2 CSS Fundamental Interfaces appears the following:

"The interfaces within this section are considered fundamental, and must be supported by all conforming DOM implementations."

In contrast, in "What is the Document Object Model?" under "Compliance", one finds:

"A compliant implementation of the DOM must implement all of the fundamental interfaces in the Core chapter with the semantics as defined. Further, it must implement at least one of the HTML DOM and the extended (XML) interfaces with the semantics as defined. The other modules are optional."

There seems to be a conflict between these two statements, with the former requiring the CSS module and the latter making it optional. Also, the former uses the term "conformance" while the latter uses the term "compliance". Is there something I'm missing here?
