Good catch. I believe the quoted phrase intended to say "all DOMs which
implement the CSS feature" have to support the CSS fundimentals. We should
fix this.


The CSS module, including the fundimentals, _is_ optional. See section 5.1:

   A DOM application can use the hasFeature method of the DOMImplementation
   interface to determine whether the CSS interfaces are supported or not.
   The feature string for the CSS Model is "CSS".
