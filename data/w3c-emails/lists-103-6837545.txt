In Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2 Specification, Version 1.0, W3C Candidate Recommendation 07 March, 2000, under Section 5.2 CSS Fundamental Interfaces, under Interface CSSValue appears:

"CSS_VALUE_LIST The value is a list CSSValue."

What does this mean? For example, does it mean the following?

"The value is a CSSValue list and an instance of the CSSValueList interface can be obtained by using binding-specific casting methods on this instance of the CSSValue interface." 

If so, then I'd suggest using the latter language to describe this constant.
