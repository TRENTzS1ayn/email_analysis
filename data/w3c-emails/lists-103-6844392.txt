If I may offer a bit of word-smithing, I'd suggest the following:

Replace the introduction sentence in 5.2 with the following:

"The interfaces found within this section are not mandatory. A DOM application can use the hasFeature method of the DOMImplementation interface to determine whether they are supported or not. The feature string for all the CSS fundamental interfaces listed in this section is "CSS"."

Then, in 5.3, after the first paragraph, add the following:

"If the CSS extended interfaces listed in this section are supported, then the CSS fundamental interefaces are mandatory and the hasFeature method of the DOMImplementation interface must return true for the feature string "CSS"."

Regards,
Glenn

The sentence in section 5.2 should be :
"The interfaces within this section are considered fundamental,
and must be supported by all compliant DOM implementations with
CSS support."
