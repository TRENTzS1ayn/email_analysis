In Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2 Specification, Version 1.0, W3C Candidate Recommendation 07 March, 2000, under Section 5.2.1 Override and computed style sheet, regarding the getComputedStyle method of the ViewCSS interface:

Is it the case that the returned CSSStyleDeclaration will or will not contain inherited properties for the given element? If they are included, I'd suggest adding language to that effect.
