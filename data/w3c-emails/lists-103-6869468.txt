In Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2 Specification, Version 1.0, W3C Candidate Recommendation 07 March, 2000, under Section 5.2.3 Element with CSS inline style, regarding the ElementCSSInlineStyle interface:

Is it to be presumed that this interface is obtained by means of binding-specific casting on an instance of the Element interface? If so, then I would suggest adding language to that effect.
