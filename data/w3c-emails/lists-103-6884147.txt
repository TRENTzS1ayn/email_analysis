It contains the "computed" style. I don't think we need to provide a clear
definition of what "computed values" means. The link to the CSS2 spec
provides the correct definition [1]. The computed style is the result of
the specified style which contains all inherited values [2].

Thanks a lot for your careful review of the spec,
Philippe.
