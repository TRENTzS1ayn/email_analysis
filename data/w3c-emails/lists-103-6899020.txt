In Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2 Specification, Version 1.0, W3C Candidate Recommendation 07 March, 2000, under Section 5.3 CSS Extended Interfaces, just prior to the description of Interface CSS2FontFaceSrc appears a table whose descriptions states:

"The following table specifies the type of CSSValue used to represent each descriptor that can be specified in a CSSStyleDeclaration found in a CSSFontFaceRule for a CSS Level 2 style sheet."

In this table, the entries for "src", and "width" specify "list of CSS2FontFaceSrc" and "list of CSS2FontFaceWidths", respectively. However, neither CSS2FontFaceSrc nor CSS2FontFaceWidths are derived from CSSValue (and thus are not candidates for valueType CSS_CUSTOM), nor are they covered by a CSSPrimitiveValue.

My question then is how are CSS2FontFaceSrce or CSS2FontFaceWidths to be interpreted as a "type of CSSValue"?

A similar question holds for CSS2TextShadow which also does not derive from CSSValue yet is shown in the larger table at the beginning of section 5.3 as being used in a "list of CSSTextShadow" for the "text-shadow" property.
