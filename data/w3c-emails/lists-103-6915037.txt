The answer is that if you claim to support the CSS module, you 
need to support the fundamental CSS interfaces, and may choose 
to support the extended CS interfaces. The CSS module as a 
whole is optional. So the first quote should probably be

"The interfaces within this section are considered fundamental CSS 
interfaces, and must be supported by all conforming 
implementations of the CSS DOM module."

Would that make it clearer?
