I'm currently undertaking an implementation of the
proposed DOM L2 UI Event spec for TclDOM - 
the Tcl language binding for the DOM.

It all looks fairly straight-forward, except for
one thing: how is an Event Listener associated with
a particular node?  Specifically, an EventTarget?  

The spec says:
"The EventTarget interface is implemented by all Nodes 
in an implementation...".  However, EventTarget does
not derive from Node, and there are no methods to
create an association.  For Level 2, is this something
extra that must be provided by the implementation?

I can see how an EventListener is associated with
an EventTarget (via addEventListener).  The Event
interface has a field for the current node, which
I suppose could be initialised to a particular
node before calling dispatchEvent.  I just can't
see the coupling of a Node to an EventTarget.

Please illuminate me!

Regards,
Steve Ball
