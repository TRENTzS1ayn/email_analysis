I would suggest using standard language found elsewhere in the document, e.g., "this interface is obtained by means of binding-specific casting on an instance of the Node interface."

Yes. The idea is that if your implementation supports the event module

There is no direct coupling. They are different interfaces that need to
be implemented by the same classes.
