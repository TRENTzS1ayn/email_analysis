Hi,
I'm trying to write a testcase for textarea.rows to test the mozilla
browser.  When you specify no rows value, it seems to default to 1,
however there is no supporting documentation for that answer.

The developer noted to me that the DOM does say that an integer
attribute that is not defined gets the value 0, however a textarea with
a value of 0 rows would be rather silly, especially since the rows
attribute is optional.

Nav 4.7 defaults to 1 row, but IE 5 defaults to 2 rows.

Please let me know what the default value should be as soon as possible.

Thanks very much,
Jan Carpenter
