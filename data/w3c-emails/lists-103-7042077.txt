In the DOM 2 spec [07/03/2000] under Section 5.2 the CSSStyleDeclaration
interface fails to state what a valid index range is.  Does it begin at 0?

I noticed that the list type interfaces in the spec. are somewhat
inconsistent in the way that they define their valid ranges.  Some state
it at the beginning of the interface's description, some state it in the
index's description, some state it in the length attribute's description,
while others use a combination of the previous.  It can get a little
confusing if one does not read throught the entire list interface
description.
