Weak rationalle: An Attr, like most other nodes, is always associated with
an owning document. It isn't associated with an Element until it's bound to
one via setAttributeNode[NS].

> wouldn't it make more sense to have the factory method in Element?

There is one: the setAttribute() call. More convenient if the Attr's value
will be a single Text node, less convenient if it will be more complicated.
