I also agree it isn't a good idea to specify these as additional valueTypes. My original comment was just to add clarifying language that when these interfaces are used that the CSSValue base instance should use CSS_CUSTOM.

What do you mean ? By suppressing the CSS_CUSTOM type and adding them into
valueType space ? Then we will have to reserve somes codes for CSS3, SVG ...
I don't think it's a good idea to go in this direction for the CSS properties.
