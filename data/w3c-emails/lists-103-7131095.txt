Well, in that case an awful lot of people are being ridiculous!

Converting XML to HTML is a common task.

DOM SDKs generally emit XML when asked to serialize their
content.  Of course, using a DOM SDK it is perfectly reasonable
to create a XHTML document, and serialize that.

Another approach would be to traverse the DOM tree of your XML
document and create the appropriate HTML as you go.

Finally, a very common approach is not to use DOM at all,
but rather use XSLT for converting XML to HTML.

HTHs,
