DOM2 doesn't appear to provide any method for determining the position
of an event relative to the start of a document, when the page has been
scrolled.

Netscape used a pageX/YOffset property, and Mozilla is implementing this
too.

MSIE uses the scrollTop property.

(And does anyone know what, if anything, Opera's using...?)

Will/can the DOM provide a standard for accessing this basic data,
because if browsers provide differing proprietory properties for this
data (as is happening right now), then we've immediately lost
cross-browser compatibility.
