Can someone shed some light on the ownerDocument of nodes created by a
DocumentFragment?

The Rec says the DocumentFragment interface extends the Document
interface but says little about DocumentFragmnet implementation.
DocumentFragment inherits all createXxx methods of Document. Should its
implementation of these methods be different, or can it delegate them to
Document? Specifically, what should be in the ownerDocument of these
newly created Nodes - the DocumentFragment that created them, or the
DocumentFragment's ownerDocument?
