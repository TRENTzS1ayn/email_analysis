Can anyone tell me how I access an IFRAME's source documents contents using
either DOM1 (Core) or DOM1 (HTML) ?

The equivalent IE code is "frameONE.document.body.innerHTML" where frameONE
if my iFRAME.

I've tried many ways navigating through the page contents but to no avail -
I always get stuck at the IFRAME node itself and can never get it's source
contents.

Thanks

Tony
