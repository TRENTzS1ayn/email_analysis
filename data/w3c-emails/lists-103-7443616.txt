I'm not sure which question you're asking.

The DOM Level 2 Event distribution architecture supports both event capture
and event bubbling.
You must explicitly register for the events you're interested in; you can't
say "capture all events".

This should be reasonably clear in the current Candidate Recommendation. If
not, tell us where the confusing points are so we can try to improve them.
