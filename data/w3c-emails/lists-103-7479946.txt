I note that in the DOM level 2 Events spec, the load event is specified
only for a document, frameset and object, not for img. The
implementations in Mozilla and Opera seem to bear this out.

Is there a good reason for this?

Is there an alternative recommended way to preload images and fire events
when they are ready? (Short of moving to <object> and strangling backwards
compatibility.)
