Hi Andrew,
You can preload images via JavaScript. This is how some designers change
images on mouse over by changing the image from their preloaded image array.
According to HTML 4.0, <script> is allowed in head, and my recollection is
that <head> is guaranteed to be loaded first. I'm not sure on the loading
thing though.
Hope this helps,
Eric :-)
