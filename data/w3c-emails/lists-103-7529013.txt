Mozilla, and Netscape 6 PR1 have partial support for DOM Level 2. They lack
support for traversal, range and mutation events, and not all of the event
handling is working. Mozilla M16 build supports more than the Netscape 6 PR1
(which is based on the M15 build) but isn't as stable. The Mozilla M17 was due
last week but is delayed for 2 weeks (or more). The milestone builds (Mxx) are
more stable than the nightly builds. The next beta from Mozilla to Netscape
will be based on the Mozilla M18 build. For more information on Mozilla see
mozilla.org.
