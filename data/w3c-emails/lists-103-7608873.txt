I mean, if I want to create an XML document using the DOM API then which
interface to implement, which method to call?
Simillarly for other operations there should be some kind of starting point
in the documentation. The documentation is in a very poor state right now
because I have to read the methods and guess what it could possible do.
regards and thanks for writing in . I am going to read the link you had
kindly sent.
