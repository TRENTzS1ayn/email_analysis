Here's a simple example using Xerces (see http://xml.apache.org):

To create the short document <x><y></y></x>:

DOMImplementation domImpl= DOMImplementationImpl.getDOMImplementation();
doc = domImpl.createDocument( docURI, "x", docType );
Element root = doc.getDocumentElement();
Element anotherElem = doc.createElement( "y" );
root.insertBefore( anotherElem , null );

A good way to learn is to download a good package such as Xerces, read the
JavaDocs,
and just play around. The OpenXML packages are good for parsing and
serializing.
