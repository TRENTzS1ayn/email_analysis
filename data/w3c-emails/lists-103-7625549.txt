If the value is inherited, you use the computed value of the parent so
you will need the computed style in any case.

This is not what is implemented in the currentStyle property of IE.

<style type='text/css'>
p { color: rgb(50%, 50%, 50%); }
</style>
<body>
  <p>Bla<em>bla</em></p>
</body>

p.currentStyle.color and em.currentStyle.color return rgb(127, 127, 127)

I agree that this proposal is useful but it needs more clarifications.
Your proposal seems a new idea even for the existing browsers ...
