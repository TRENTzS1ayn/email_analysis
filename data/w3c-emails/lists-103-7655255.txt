| The DOM specs says that DOMString is a sequence of 16-bit units.
| Does this mean that this string should be a unicode string.  

Yes.

| Or will it be acceptable if I implement DOMString with simple short
| integers.

Exactly how to represent Unicode strings will depend on the
programming language you use, and you should definitely try to do the
same as other implementors in the same language. 

If you can tell us what language you are using giving more information
becomes much easier at once. :-)
