I have gone for the IBM XML4C offering and have a c++ wallah 
knocking up some code, as we speak.

Is the XML4C constantly upgraded or is that on hold and a different 
version that is part of the Xerces project used instead? Or are they 
the one and the same?

XSLT is something I may have to look into :(
Is this the forum to discuss it; especially as it will be vaguely linked 
to DOM questions?
