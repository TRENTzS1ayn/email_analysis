This is the wrong forum for that question -- www-dom is really for
discussion of the DOM itself rather than of parsers -- but as I understand
it most new development goes into the Apache version, which thus always has
the latest fixes ... and the latest bugs. The IBM-labelled versions
(XML4C/XML4J) are released less frequently, have been tested a bit more
thoroughly, and include some code that the Apache versions don't
(compatbility libraries for folks using the older IBM interfaces, improved
internationalization support, that sort of thing).

Quoting http://www.w3.org/Style/XSL/:  "Discussions about XSL are carried
out on the XSL-List at mulberrytech.com and on
comp.infosystems.www.authoring.stylesheets."

The linkage of XSLT to DOM is, indeed, pretty vague. Some XSLT processors
accept DOMs as input or produce DOMs as output, some may expose their
internal models as DOMs for folks writing "extensions", and some may use
the DOM as their internal model (not that anyone could ever tell from
outside)... but that's about as far as it goes.
