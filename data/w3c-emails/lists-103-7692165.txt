Unlike the informations I received three months ago regarding for
the report of implementations, it appears that we have only
one implementation of the CSS2 extensions of the CSS Object
Model, exactly the following interfaces:

CSS2Azimuth
CSS2BackgroundPosition
CSS2BorderSpacing
CSS2CounterReset
CSS2CounterIncrement
CSS2Cursor
CSS2PlayDuring
CSS2TextShadow
CSS2FontFaceSrc
CSS2FontFaceWidths
CSS2PageSize

The goals of these interfaces are to address complex CSS properties
with optional values and to provide, in some cases, an adequate interface
to a CSS property (see the play-during property for a good example)
Of course, we can expose them using the CSSValue* interfaces but it will
require extra work for the CSS DOM user.

We won't be able to move to PR if we have only one implementation of
this part.

So, if you have an implementation of this part, please show up asap.
Otherwise, the DOM Working Group will need to drop this part from the current
DOM Level 2 draft and only keep the CSS2Properties interface in the CSS2
extensions of the CSS Object Model.
