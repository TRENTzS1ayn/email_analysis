And whether the document being represented is in fact XML or HTML.
HTML DOMs don't even need to expose objects implementing either Entity
or EntityReference.  Further, it is explicitly stated that in HTML
all attribute values are simple strings with no EntityReference nodes.
(The same is not said for the content of elements, however, and perhaps
should be.)  There is also no way to create a new EntityReference node in
an HTML document.

All these lines of evidence converge to imply that entity references in
HTML documents should surface as single characters in Text nodes, just
like the equivalent character references.  I suggest that an editorial-level
correction be made to DOM Level 1 to say so.
