Have a question regarding

Interface HTMLInputElement 
readonly attribute DOMString type;
http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-DOM-Level-1/level-one-html.html#ID-882764350

it seems strange that this attribute is read only. how is able to create a
"password" or "hidden" field as opposed to the "text" field, when this is
read only?

if I do the following I would obviously get an error (as I do in Mac IE 5):
var formElement = document.createElement("INPUT");
formElement.setAttribute("type","hidden");

I'm I missing something, or is there some other way to create a hidden or
password (or button,etc) element?

thanks
