I don't believe DOM 1 requires setAttribute to produce an exception when
it would be used to modify an attribute which is also exposed through a
distinct property that happens to be readonly. I'd guess the
implementation you refer to is taking an overly conservative view if it
is producing an exception.

If I were implementing this, I would distinguish the semantics of
setAttribute for elements instantiated during the parsing process and
those created explicitly in the DOM. For the former, I would preserve
the readonly semantics for setAttribute implied by their corresponding
properties in the HTML* interfaces; on the other hand, for those created
explicitly, I would not restrict mutation.

Regards,
Glenn Adams
