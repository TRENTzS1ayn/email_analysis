Did a quick websearch for "dynamic XML". What I found was XML equivalents
of "dynamic HTML" -- that is, combinations of XML and scripting (examples
at xml.apache.org/cocoon/dynamic.html,
alphaworks.ibm.com/aw.nsf/techmain/dynamicxmlforjava ), or solutions that
generate XML on demand, dynamically. Neither seems to  apply to this
question.
