This is where you have been mislead.  The specification states:
"The CSSValue interface represents a simple or a complex value. A 
CSSValue object only occurs in a context of a CSS property."  If the 
CSSValue had no knowledge of its property then there would be a problem
with both the retreival of cssText and the parsing of the text during a
set.  Hope this helps.
