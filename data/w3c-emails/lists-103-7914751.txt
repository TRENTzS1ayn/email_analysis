Blaine,

Ah, there's the catch. Knowing which property a CSSValue is for will
certainly help implementation, given that a CSSValue can be rendered in
several ways depending on the property.

Whether or not such a design is very elegant is a different matter, and I
guess that, with CSS already having several ways to represent lists, there
may not be much else that can be done.

Thanks for pointing that out.

Garret
