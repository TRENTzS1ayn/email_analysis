Either way, I think it's important that the DOM2 spec makes it clear
and explicit whether null or the empty string should be used, or if
both are (must be) accepted.

It's not very important which one is choosen, but I would prefer to use
the empty string as no namespace and explicitly disallow null. That
would be consistent with SAX2.
