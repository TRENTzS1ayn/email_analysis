The current Counter interface contains 3 DOMStrings.  The modifications
made to the these strings modify the underlying style property.  With this
scheme it is possible to set counter style properties with invalid data. 
Is it acceptable to invalidate the data this way or should there be
separate set and get methods on this interface and the have the DOMString
become detached form the tree when it is retrieved (along with exceptions
being thrown on the set).
