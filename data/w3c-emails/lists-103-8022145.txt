Thanks!  That helps me understand the libxml effort.  A couple of 
questions.  You cited
http://cvs.gnome.org/bonsai/rview.cgi?cvsroot=/cvs/gnome&dir=gdome
as "A new DOM module", but all I see is a CVS archive.  Is there some 
document that could be pulled out at posted for non-Gnome people to help us 
understand what is in there?

Also, what's your feelings about the possibility for the libxml DOM  to 
become the de-facto standard C binding for the DOM? Or is this a hopeless idea?

Mike
