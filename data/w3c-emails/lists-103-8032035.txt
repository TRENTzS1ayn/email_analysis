That's fine with us.   As Mike stated, there are no proprietary dependencies
in the APIs that were published; the only problem that had to be solved was
coming up with different  API names, e.g., for the parse functions, to avoid
multiply defined symbols, a problem that doesn't exist with OO languages.

How do we go about submitting it for quasi-standard status?

Thx,
Ben
