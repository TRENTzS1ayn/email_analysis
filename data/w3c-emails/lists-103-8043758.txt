 I think the "quasi-official" thing is to present it to the W3C as a
"Submission", see http://www.w3.org/Submission/.  While that would have no
official blessing by the W3C, an acknowledged submission is published on the
W3C site and would be available to anyone looking for something like this
even if they didn't know who wrote it.

Does this sound right, Philippe (or Daniel)?  I'm just remembering WG
discussions from some years ago when we concocted the idea of asking new
bindings to be submitted as W3C Notes.
