> Some clarification please.   In the DOM2 spec of December 10, 1999,

We decided to add (and link for the paragraph) the following definition
in the glossary:

tokenized 
 The description given to various information items (for example, attribute
 values of various types, but not including the StringType CDATA) after having
 been processed by the XML processor. The process includes stripping leading
 and trailing white space, and replacing multiple space characters by one.  See
 the definition of tokenized type.
