After a few emails, we clarified the spec as following:

Note that although the XML specification defines that using the empty string
for a namespace URI is equivalent to unsetting the namespace, because the DOM
does no lexical checking, the empty string will be treated as a real namespace
URI in DOM Level 2 methods. Applications must use the value null as the
namespaceURI parameter for methods if they wish to have no namespace.
