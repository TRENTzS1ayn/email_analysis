Say we have two different implementations of the org.w3c.dom one being
openXML's and another being some other package out there.  Now when we parse
an HTML file and produce a DOM out of it we are not assured that the two DOM
representations will have the same structured tree because of differences in
parsing and malformed html.  Wasn't the whole idea of the DOM to keep things
structured.  shouldn't these two parsers create the exact same DOM?
