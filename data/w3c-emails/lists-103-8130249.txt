You may not like this answer:

The W3C DOM does not support malformed HTML.  It's up to the HTML processor
to either reject it as unparsable, or to repair it before the DOM is built.
The details of that repair are out of our scope.

A suggested, but not officially endorsed, repair algorithm appears in the
W3C's "tidy" tool.

Getting everyone to agree to yield the same results -- tidy's or any other
--  would be a task for the HTML Working Group. Given that they seem to
instead be moving toward an XML-based version of HTML, in which malformed
documents are not possible and consistant parsing can be guaranteed, I
don't know if they can enforce particular repairs or are interested in
doing so. Ask them?
