If the HTML is valid, you will get the same trees. Given the number 
of ways HTML can be invalid, there's no way of specifying the DOM 
to make all processors give you the same trees under any 
circumstances. So you'll have to clean up the HTML first, e.g., by 
running it through an HTML clean-up script.
