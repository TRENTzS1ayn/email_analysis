I think for HTML you should get the same tree, since most of the 
optional things (e.g., entities) are in XML, not HTML. I guess some 
processors could decide to throw out comments, although the 
HTML processors I know of don't. The HTML DOM module 
specifies a few things that need to be in the tree, such as the 
TBODY elements, which may not be in the source document, so I 
can't think of any place (again, modulo comments) where you 
would get variations on the tree of a *valid* (not just "good") HTML 
4.0 document. Can you point some concrete places out to me that 
the HTML module doesn't explicitly cover?
