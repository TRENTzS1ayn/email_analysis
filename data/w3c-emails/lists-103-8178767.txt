What W3C DOM API produces a DOM tree given an input
source document?  The closest I see to that is the
HTMLDocument.{open,close,write,writeln}, and that
clearly doesn't work for XML ... and of course, there
would still be the bootstrapping problem of how to
get one's hands on an HTMLDocument without relying
on some other non-DOM (proprietary, ...) API.
