OK, now I get the problem. You're right, the HTML DOM doesn't 
define *how* to get to the internal structure model that allows the 
HTML DOM API to act on it to create elements etc. However, it 
does define pretty clearly (at least, I think it does) *what* you 
should find once you get there. So, although it doesn't define the 
process, it does define the end result.
