Hello,

I'm developing DOM + SVG based product. In SVG, we can use the <use> tag to
reference other elements, defined somewhere. I understand that as node or
element referencing (in the DOM-style). So, maybe it will be useful to add
some functions to access "referrers" by the referenced element. I'm not sure
that this accords to Node extension, as I said in subject (maybe Element,
not a Node).

Anton.
