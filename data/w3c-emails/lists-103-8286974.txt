I think you'll better look at the spec yourself.
http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/struct.html#Head said : <<


SVG makes extensive use of URI references [URI] to other objects. For
example, to fill a rectangle with a linear gradient, you first define a
'linearGradient' element and give it an ID, as in:
<linearGradient id="MyGradient">...</linearGradient>

You then reference the linear gradient as the value of the 'fill' property
for the rectangle, as in:
<rect style="fill:url(#MyGradient)"/>

>>

The second example on which I can explain what I want is below :

<?xml version="1.0" standalone="no"?>
<!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD SVG 20000802//EN"
  "http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/CR-SVG-20000802/DTD/svg-20000802.dtd">
<svg width="10cm" height="5cm">
  <desc>Example Use01 - Simple case of 'use' on a 'rect'</desc>
  <defs>
    <rect id="MyRect" width="6cm" height="1cm"/>
  </defs>
  <use x="2cm" y="1cm" xlink:href="#MyRect" />
  <use x="2cm" y="2.5cm" xlink:href="#MyRect" />
</svg>

I want the following : I have the reference to "MyRect" element (or Node). I
want to get all referencers to this object. In the above example there are
two "referencers" - second and third line in the source from the end.

I think I'm not wrong with the mailing-list (I guess this topic is not for
www-svg@w3.org). I'm not an expert with all XML-based applications, but I've
heard smth about XLink. If we use this application, possibly, we do need the
same feature. Finally, in the spec example I've quoted in the beginning,
this feature (again possibly) will be useful for CSS (styling in SVG is
inherited from CSS).
