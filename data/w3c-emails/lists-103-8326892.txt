You could write a script or Java (or whatever) program to "procedurally" 
build an output XHTML (well-formed HTML) document from an XML document, or 
you could use XSLT to take a "declarative" description of how to map XML 
inputs to HTML outputs.  There is no standard DOM interface to an XSLT 
engine, but  most XSLT engines out there  have DOM-like APIs that generally 
let you take a DOM tree and transform it with a stylesheet to produce HTML.
