Should the setCssText method of a CSSRule that contains a style
declaration [eg. CSSStyleRule] behave similarly to the setCssText of
CSSStyleDeclaration.  I.e can it be used to add CSSValues to the rule's
internal style declaration.  Example:
styleRule.setCssText("H1 {font-size: 10pt}");
styleRule.setCssText("H1 {ascent:10}"); 
Should the last line remove 'font-size' from the style's internal style
declaration or will it simply append the 'ascent' value, leaving the
'font-size' value intact.  The latter behavior seems the more reasonable
solution, but it is not stated in the specification.  If the former
behavior is followed then there will be problems dealing with outstanding
CSSValues.

Thanks for the clarification.
