We recently considered these points.

Keyword conflicts inherited from DOM Level 1 were deemed unrepairable
without breaking backward comptability, and allowed to persist. It is
assumed that whoever creates an IDL Binding will translate appropriately.

New conflicts introduced in Level 2 drafts should be fixed in the next
public draft (which will probably be the PR).
