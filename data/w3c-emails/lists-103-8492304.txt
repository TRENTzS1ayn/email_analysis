Exactly. In CORBA, a sequence<unsigned short> may not be null. It is,
mathematically speaking, a union of
- the empty sequence
- Z (unsigned short)
- Z x Z 
- Z x Z x Z
...

null is not a possible value of a sequence. In the specific example,
is there a need to distinguish between the empty string as a
nodeValue, and a null nodeValue? Otherwise, saying 'may be empty'
sounds better.
