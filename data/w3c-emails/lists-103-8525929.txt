This is not exactly true. "modifications or derivatives" is about the
document itself. So yes, according to the DOM Level 1 copyright, you had no
right to modify or create derivatives of the DOM Level 1 bindings. It
doesn't prevent you to use them, btw.

yes, we discovered that the DOM Level 1 document copyright statement is too
restrictive for the bindings (in others words, the copyright for the bindings
in DOM Level 1 was an error). So, following a comment from the Debian
community, we changed the copyright statement to match their requirements
of open source softwares.

Good catch, this needs to be synchronized before the REC !

Thank you,
