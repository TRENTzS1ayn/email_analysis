As I said, this is a known error in the DOM Level 1 spec (and it's going
to be fixed soon since the DOM WG is planning to update the DOM Level 1
spec).
The bindings of the DOM specification are under the Software notice:

btw, for the update, we never received any answer from the open
source organization (http://www.opensource.org/osd.html) after our
request to obtain the OSI certification ...
