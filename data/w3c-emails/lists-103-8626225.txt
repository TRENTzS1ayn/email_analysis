As far as the DOM is concerned, yes. It's the serializer's responsibility
to do something appropriate with it -- complain, or change the > into &gt;,
or whatever seems reasonable -- and/or your application's responsibility
not to create this situation in the first place.

We expect DOM Level 3 will add the ability to request a well-formedness
check, which will report this sort of thing.
