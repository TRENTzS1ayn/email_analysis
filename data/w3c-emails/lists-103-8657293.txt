That's about what I expected. The problem is that the DOM has committed to
showing people their "junk",  so we have to decide whether the content of
that comment should be reported as " -- " or " &#45;&#45; "

Which we should pick depends on when numeric character reference processing
occurs versus other parts of XML syntax processing... and I'm still a bit
fuzzy on that detail.
