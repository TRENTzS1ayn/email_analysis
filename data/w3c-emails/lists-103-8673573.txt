For completeness:  A a comment with a nodeValue ending in the
character '-' is also well-formed (see XML Erratum 27).

The XML spec says that comments are not part of the document's
character data (? 2.5), likewise prod. [15] does not refer to
'CharRef' (prod. [66]) when defining 'Comment'.  This seems to me to
be a strong indication, that the character sequence '&#45;&#45;' in a
comment is ontologically nothing else than a character sequence.
