Since writers often use comments in all languages to exclude
parts of a document or program from processing (what we
call "commenting out" source text, I would suggest that any
implementation that stores comments ought to store them as
unmodified strings. 

Consider the effects of expanding on this common situation:

<?xml version=1?>

<!--
<!ENTITY a "a string"> -->

<p>some text.</p>

<!-- more text we don't want to display, with &a; -->

In fact, I would go so far as to allow embedded
CDATA sections in comments.
