Cancellable mutation events comes to mind.  For DOM structures which
responds to changes in itself - perhaps by modifying itself further - there
is a very strong need for consistency and constraint in the way event
listeners are invoked and they way they are allowed to behave.
Otherwise, all hell will break loose.

Cancellable mutation events aren't DOM 2 - so two phase events may or
may not yet be an issue.  I haven't thought much about them beyond this
situation, but I'm sure there would be uses elsewhere.

It certainly would be a future issue if not an issue now.

I haven't been able to do this on the standard DOM 2 API, but that doesn't
mean it can't.  I would be very interested if anyone has a clue on how it
can be done.
