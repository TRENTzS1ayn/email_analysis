W3C is pleased to announce that the Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2
has been released as a Proposed Recommendation. The W3C Advisory
Committee has now been asked to advise on its disposition, according to
the W3C Process, at:

http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/Process-19991111/tr.html#RecsPR

This announcement has three parts:

1. The DOM Level 2 Proposed Recommendation URIs
2. A content summary of DOM Level 2
3. Results of the DOM Level 2 Candidate Recommendation Phase

All modules of the Proposed Recommendation evolved from the latest DOM
Level 2 Candidate Recommendation, available at:

2. Content Summary of DOM Level 2

The DOM Level 2 is the major deliverable required by the
charter of the Document Object Model Working Group. 

This specification defines the Document Object Model Level 2, a
platform- and language-neutral interface that allows programs and
scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure and
style of documents. The Document Object Model Level 2 builds on the
Document Object Model Level 1.

The DOM Level 2 is made of a set of core interfaces to create and
manipulate the structure and contents of a document and a set of
optional modules. These modules contain specialized interfaces dedicated
to XML, HTML, an abstract view, generic stylesheets, Cascading Style
Sheets, Events, traversing the document structure, and a Range object.

The Working Group has published 7 drafts since December 1998, including
a Last Call Working Draft on 23 September 1999 and 3 Candidate
Recommendations starting from 10 December 1999.

The following excerpt is from Status of the Document section of the DOM
Level 2 Core Proposed Recommendation, at:
 http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/PR-DOM-Level-2-Core-20000927

This status section is duplicated in each of the DOM Level 2 Proposed
Recommendation modules.

   "This is a W3C Proposed Recommendation for review
by W3C members and other interested parties. W3C
Advisory Committee Members are invited to send formal
comments, visible only to the W3C Team, to
dom-review@w3.org until October 25, 2000.

   Comments on this document are invited and are to be
sent to the public mailing list www-dom@w3.org. An
archive is available at
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom/.

   Publication as a Proposed Recommendation does not
imply endorsement by the W3C membership. This is still
a draft document and may be updated, replaced or
obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is
inappropriate to cite W3C Proposed Recommendations
as other than 'work in progress.'

   This document has been produced as part of the W3C
DOM Activity. The authors of this document are the
DOM WG members. Different modules of the Document Object
Model have different editors.

A list of current W3C Recommendations and other technical
documents can be found at http://www.w3.org/TR.

The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) Working Group has
determined that the DOM Level 2 specification is stable,
contributes to Web interoperability and is ready to enter
the review process by the W3C Membership."


=================

3. Results of the DOM Level 2 Candidate Recommendation Phase

The general goal of a W3C Candidate Recommendation period is to
gain implementation experience and to demonstrate implementation
interoperability.

The Working Group surveyed DOM developers and solicited reviews of the
documents with this question in mind. Information about reviewers and
their comments is available from:

Public Disposition of Comments:
http://www.w3.org/DOM/L2CR2comments_public.html

The reviews of the developers raised a number of issues that the Working
Group resolved and documented in its issues list.

Implementations have been made of every part of the spec, but
the interoperability between different implementations has not
been as exhaustively tested. However, what  interoperability testing
has been done has yielded only positive results.  A significant number
of different implementations from different sources were involved.
As other specifications depend on DOM Level 2 (SMIL, SVG, MathML), and
as the experience to date has been successful, the Director has approved
DOM Level 2 to be presented to the AC for consideration as a
Recommendation.

The deadline for receiving responses is 25 October 2000, 2400 GMT.

Every effort will be made by the W3C Team to reply to each comment,
including public comments. 

The Director's decision as to the status of the DOM Level 2 Proposed
Recommendation is to be announced no earlier than 8 November 2000.

For Tim Berners-Lee, W3C Director, and
Philippe Le H?garet, DOM Activity Lead;

Janet Daly, Head of Communications
