I am not really sure if this falls in the DOM area, so apologies in advance,
just in case this is off-topic.

The early versions of Netscape added the "alert()" (and similar) methods to
the build-in JavaScript functions. After +/- 5 years, this is still the only
cross-browser (DOM0?) method of displaying dialogs. All graphical platforms
I know of support the notion of "modal" and "modeless" dialogs.

The serialization format for these "forms" would of course be HTML.

Are there any plans for incorporating functionality like this in to a future
DOM spec?

Regards,
Taras
