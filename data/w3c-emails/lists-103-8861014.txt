This all depends on how each node is represented and how much markup vs
data the document contains. You will have to measure it in your specific
implementation to get a definite answer.

Memory usage doesn't even have to be larger for an in-memory representation
of a DOM file. You can build a DOM interface for a string that contains
just the characters of the XML file. You can even build a DOM interface
directly to the file using pointers into the file as nodes, resulting in
very low memory use (and a very slow DOM interface for more complex
navigation).

Our Emil? XML editor [think Emacs with Mac ease of use and specialized for
XML editing] demonstrates that a DOM interface doesn't require an object
structure. Emil? has a DOM interface for its in-memory textual
representation of XML documents. That way, the editor doesn't have to
maintain a redundant DOM object structure for the same information
(although it also uses a DOM object structure depending on the situation).
It also allows DOM to be used locally in a document without requiring that
the document is well-formed at all times, which is a plus for text-based
XML editing.
