I don't think there are any plans. As far as I know, it isn't something
we've looked at in detail.

Alerts seem to be part of the information/decoration surrounding a
presentation of the document (which I believe some folks have referred to
as the tool's "chrome"), rather than part of the document per se. So
personally I'm inclined to consider them out of the scope of the Document
Object Model and refer this question to another committee. But it's
possible that the Views And Formatting editorial team might want to make
this part of their work; that's the portion of the DOM which comes closest
to discussing rendering and presentation.
