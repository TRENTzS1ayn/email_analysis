The dialog could be seen as just another document. The relevant methods
(something like "showDialog(...)" and a way to return, say, a ECMAScript
object as a result from the dialog) just provide a very thin connection
between the two documents.

I see that functionality like this is on the border of the DOM. But as it
is, none of the current w3 groups will take it, while there is a great
potentian for improvement of functionality.
