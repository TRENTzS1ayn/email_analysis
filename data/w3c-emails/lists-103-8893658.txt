[[[
DOM Level 1 Second Edition Working Draft Released

  29 September 2000: The W3C DOM Activity [1] has released the Document Object
Model (DOM) Level 1 Specification (Second Edition) [2] as a Working Draft for
public review. The DOM is a platform- and language-neutral interface that
allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content,
structure and style of documents. The second edition is not a new version; it
is designed to bring the DOM 1.0 Recommendation up to date with the first
edition errata. Please report errors to the mailing list www-dom@w3.org
(archive [3]) by 27 October.
