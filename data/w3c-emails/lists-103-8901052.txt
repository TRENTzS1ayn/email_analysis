No ... it isn't an optimisation.  If you want to have the event
fired twice, simply add the same event twice but with different
object identities.

You see - it is possible to achieve two event fires with the
scheme I described.

Considering the "unoptimized" version - It is not possible to
achieve one event fire if addEventListener was called twice.

So rather than being an optimisation - it is really about
providing the most functionality to a wider range of users.
(Or at least that's the way I thought of it at the time I
was designing stackable registration - I kinda like that
name :)

True in a way - but really, as humans we forget, produce
errors or overlook issues no matter how hard we try not
to.

"With enough eyeballs all bugs are shallow" - including
design flaws for that matter.

We really need to push prototype implementations and their
experimental use to the public in order to get good comments.
Which probably includes putting the prototypes into places
where they are or can be used most often by most people
(ie. browsers)
