This may seem a stupid question, but will
there ever be the possibility of detecting
when an event listeners are added or
removed from event targets?

This may go two ways:

An event listener detecting that it has been
added to an event target via some callback.

An event target detecting the addition and
removal of event listeners via some additional
mutation events.
