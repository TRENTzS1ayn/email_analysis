It's impossible to answer "will there ever be the possibilty of". We can
say that this functionality isn't in DOM Level 2, and there's no current
plan to include it in Level 3.

If you really need it, motivate it -- provide a use case that can't be
addressed equally well by having whatever user code adds/removes the event
handler explicitly dispatch an application event to that handler, or to
something else in non-DOM code.
