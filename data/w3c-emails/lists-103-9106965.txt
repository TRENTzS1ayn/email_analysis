In both the DOM Level 1 and Level 2 specifications, the HTMLSelectElement
interface has a "value" attribute.  I believe this to be an error, as
evidenced by all of the following:

- The SELECT element in HTML 4.01 has no "value" attribute.
- The Netscape JavaScript documentation does not list a "value" property for
Select objects (see
http://developer.netscape.com/docs/manuals/js/client/jsref/select.htm ).
- The HTML 4.01 specification states that when a form is submitted, SELECT
elements' names are paired with OPTION elements' values in building the form
data set; there is no mention here either of a "value" property for SELECT
elements.
- The description of HTMLSelectElement's "value" attribute in the DOM
specification is hopelessly vague: it reads "the current form control
value".

I alluded to this fact in email to this mailing list over a year ago (see
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom/1999AprJun/0094.html ), but
received no reply.  So I'll state this again: I think that the "value"
attribute should disappear.  Could we possibly get this change into the
upcoming DOM Level 2 recommendation, or is it already too late for that?
