CreteElement creates na element with the tag name passed to it as an argument. DOM specifies that if there are some default attributes that must be attached to this Element node, i need some clerification on it.
 Is that mean, if i have created an Element node say "H1", do i have to associate some font-size and font colr as black, etc. to it. Am i right?
