The value property is very usefull for getting what is selected in a
<SELECT>. I do agree that the spec is vauge but I think that should be fixed
rather then removing the property entierly.

The two cases that I thing need specifying/clairfying is when no element is
selected (can only occur when size > 1) or when more then one element is
selected (can only occur when multiple is set).
