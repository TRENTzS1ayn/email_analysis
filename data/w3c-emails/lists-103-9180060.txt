You'll need someone more expert than me to give you a definitive answer,
but I've used the 'onchange' attribute of SELECT to indicate when a new
OPTION is selected, and this _has_ to assume that SELECT has a value.

It's true that HTML4.01 doesn't explicitly specify a value attribute for
SELECT, but it does seem to be implied:

'Menu' is a control type. (HTML4.01 17.2.1)
  
SELECT has a 'control name'. (HTML4.01 17.6)

"Each control has both an initial value and a current value, both of
which are character strings" (HTML4.01 17.2)

And SELECT may have an 'onchange' attribute which implies a value.
(HTML4.01 17.6)

But there's no mention of what the value represents, nor of what the
initial or default values might be.

However, checking in IE5 and Mozilla, the value of SELECT does indeed
return a string corresponding to the value of the currently selected
OPTION.

Useful though it may be, I'd hesitate to regard it as definitive.

Probably wouldn't be a problem if HTML4.01 had been more explicit.
