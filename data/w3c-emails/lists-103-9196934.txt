My idea to implement exclusively HTML Document interface is because it has few methods associated which are required by the script writers, like write, etc. If i do not implement this interfcae then i would not be able to complete support DOM0 level scripts. Since rest of the interfcaes like HTMLLinkElement, etc. are not make meaning to me if i create an element in DOM tree for Linkelement and set all the attributes of this node as per the given HTML document, so anyway i am going to have an object for Link element with all possible attributes associted to it.
 Do u still think if i use this approac i can not support backward script which are DOM0 compliant only?

Yes, if you want to claim compliance with the HTML DOM spec.

No, if all you want is compliance with the core DOM... but in that case you
probably shouldn't implement HTMLDocument either, since that's likely to
confuse your users. The main reason for HTMLDocument is that it _does_
produce all the specialized subclasses of Element.

 As you suggested, the HTML interfaces aren't much more  than a convenience
layer.


(DOM Level 1 requres that you completely implement either the HTML
interfaces or the Extended (XML) interfaces. We're considering backing off
that and allowing folks to claim compliance with only the core.)
