Personal opinion: If you implement org.w3c.dom.HTMLDocument, you really
should implement the factory methods properly, which means implementing all
the other DOM classes -- otherwise I think you're misleading the user. Of
course you do have the option of implementing only some of the additional
methods and only claiming to be a normal org.w3c.dom.Document "with
additions"; that might be a good compromise.

"Complete DOM0 support" is not well defined, since different browsers had
different DHTML features. There seems to have been some interest recently
in coming up with such a definition; the video industry's TVWEB project has
something they're calling DOMT which attempts to describe that space, for
example, and we've talked to them a bit about that as a sanity-check.
Certainly DOM Level 1 was intended to be compatable with previous practice,
but depending on how you define DOM0 you may need the HTML DOM and/or some
way of supporting events (ours or roll-your-own) and/or other features that
the W3C DOM hasn't yet addressed.
