It's that time of year again ;-) where I get to go to conferences and 
tell people what's new in the world of DOM. I'd like to be able to 
talk about some of the implementations and applications out there 
that use DOM Level 2, since it just went to PR.

So if you know of, or have, something interesting that uses DOM 
Level 2, please let me know. If you have a URL that I can point 
people to, even better, and best of all is if you have some samples 
or demos that illustrate your points. 

I'm talking at XML DevCon on November 13, and at XML 2000 on 
December 3rd, so those are the dates to bear in mind if your 
implementation or application isn't public yet but soon will be.

thanks,

Lauren
