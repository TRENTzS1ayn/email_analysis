It might be a good idea to explain in the Traversal recommendation why
NodeIterator needs to have a detach method for releasing resources but
TreeWalker doesn't. In the Xerces implementation it seems that this is used
to change the fCurrentNode attribute (see NodeIteratorImpl.java) when the
Node it refers to is removed from the Document. It is unclear to me why
TreeWalker doesn't need the same thing.
