I'd actually like to have bubbling and capturing specified as orthogonal
dispatch mechanism such that an event can:

+ capture and bubble
+ capture and not bubble
+ not capture and bubble
+ not capture and not bubble

And also for event listeners to register for these orthogonally.

The last would be ideal for optimising controlled environments.

As I understand, currently capture implies not bubbles and bubbles implies
not capture.

If that is the case, I'm mildy disappointed at that design decision.
