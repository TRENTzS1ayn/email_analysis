Hi,

getElementsByTagName will return a new NodeList object containing all the
matched Elements.  According to spec., NodeList objects in the DOM are
live.  This seems to be a requirement too strict to be fulfilled because the new
list could be different from underlying list.  Whenever changes made to the
underlying document structure needs to be reflected in all relevant NodeLists?

Is this a strict requirement needed for all compliant implementations?

Thanks,

-Stanley Guan
