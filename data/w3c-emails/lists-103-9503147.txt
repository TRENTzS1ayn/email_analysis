It has both; the Level refers to a piece of functionality (what's in 
level 2 builds on what's in Level 1, etc) whereas versions refer to a 
new release or version of the same piece of functionality.

So at some stage in the future, there could very well be a DOM 
Level 1 version 2.0, for example, which would be a new version of 
the functionality in DOM Level 1.
