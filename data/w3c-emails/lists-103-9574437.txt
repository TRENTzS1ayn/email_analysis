Hello,

I've looked at a couple of the current CSS OM implementations [Steady
State and Jackaroo] and neither implement the setCssText methods of
CSSStyleDeclaration and CSSRule methods correctly.  That is, neither
update/invalidate outstanding CSSValue references when these methods are
called.  It appears that in both these implementation, outstanding old
CSSValues keep old data and simply detached from the CSS their trees,
rather than being invalidated or updated if the values still exist after
set call.  Implementing these methods seems trivial at first, but it is
full of pitfalls.  Does anyone know of any implementations out there that
implement these methods correctly?  Thanks for the information.

Blaine
