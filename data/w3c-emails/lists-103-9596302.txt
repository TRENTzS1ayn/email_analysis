Dear all,
I have a string which is contained HTML tag in it (not well-formed XML, for
sure). Is there any way to load the string onto a document object (DOM)?
My second question is regarding IXMLDocument Load method; can I use that
method in a server script without decreasing performance of the server?
Thanks in advance.
