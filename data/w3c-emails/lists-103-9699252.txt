This list exists to answer questions from users of the DOM, and permit
folks to submit comments in response to public working drafts. Since we're
so late in DOM Level 2, and so early in DOM Level 3, there's not a lot
being said. If you've got questions or comments, post 'em...

For a more lively discusssion of practical DOM programming, you may want to
check either the XML developers' list (xml-dev, hosted by xml.org), or the
list associated with whichever DOM implementation you're using.

If you're working for a W3C Member organization, you may want to check out
the DOM Interest Group mailing list; that's a good window into how the
development process is going.
