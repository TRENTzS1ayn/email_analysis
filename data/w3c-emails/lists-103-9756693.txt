Hi,
    I'm trying to convert a document from the org.w3c.tidy.dom format to the
org.apache.xerces.dom format, and I can't find the way. The only thing I
have found is that it should be possible with DOM 2.0 implementation, but,
as things are now, what would be the easiest and more direct way of
converting nodes from one implementation to another? I have tried deep copy,
node-by-node copy, and no way. I get runtime or compilation errors. Any
hint?
