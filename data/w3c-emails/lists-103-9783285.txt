Fast guess: It looks like you are trying to use importNode to import an
entire Document. You can't insert a Document into a Document. Try changing:
      Node myNode = tidy.parseDOM(in, null);
      Document myDoc = new DocumentImpl();
      myDoc.appendChild( myDoc.importNode( myNode, false ));
to
      Document sourceDoc = (Document) tidy.parseDOM(in, null);
      Document myDoc = new DocumentImpl();
      myDoc.appendChild( myDoc.importNode( sourceDoc.getDocumentElement(),
true ));

Note the "true" in that last line. I presume you _do_ want to import the
entire subtree...

CAVEAT: This is nonportable code. Even ignoring the direct referenct to
DocumentImpl, there's no promise that you can simply append a root element
to an empty Document... and in fact there's no standard way to create an
empty Document at this time. A more portble solution would be:

      Document sourceDoc = (Document) tidy.parseDOM(in, null);
     Element sourceRoot=sourceDoc.getDocumentElement();

     // This one line currently needs to be aware of which DOM you're using
     // Since you said you were using the Xerces DOM:
     DOMImplementation
myDOMImpl=org.apache.xerces.dom.DOMImplementationImpl.getDOMImplementation
();


     // I'm assuming here that tidy's DOM is a Level 1 DOM. If it's Level
2,
     // you'll want to alter this line appropriately. (Best solution would
be
     // to use hasFeatures to check whether the source DOM is Level 1 or
Level 2)
     // I'm also assuming you aren't assigning a DocumentType.
      Document myDoc = myDOMImpl.createDocument(null,sourceRoot.getNodeName
(),null)

     for(Node n=sourceRoot.getFirstChild();
          n!=null;
          n=n.getNextSibling())
     {
           myDoc.getDocumentElement().appendChild(
               myDoc.importNode( n, true )
               );
     }


Re the null pointer exception:  Outside of the fact that you can't insert a
Document into a Document... this looks like either Tidy returned null and
you didn't notice, or Tidy isn't implementing the DOM correctly, or there's
a bug in the Xerces implementation of importNode. Debug your way into the
code and check which. If you need assistance, there's a mailing list for
Xerces development -- I don't remember the details offhand, but you can
find out more about it at http://xml.apache.org/xerces

Hope that helps...
