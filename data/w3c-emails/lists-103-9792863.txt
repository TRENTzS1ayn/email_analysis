Hi, Juan,

As far as I know, XercesJ as well as XML4J parser have adoptNode()
function which allows to move a node from one document to another. I
believe you should first use Document.importNode() to get a copy of your
node and when use DocumentImpl.adoptNode() to actually move a node to a
DOM tree.

Please, note that adoptNode() is still in 'experimental' stage (it might
be available in DOM Level 3) so adoptNode() might fail (depending on the
content). But you should at least try it out .. 

Hope it helps.
Elena
