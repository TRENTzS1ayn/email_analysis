Unfortunately, obtaining the DOMImplemetation object is a "bootstrapping
problem"; this is the point at which your code needs to be aware of exactly
whose DOM code it's actually going to use, and the details will vary from
one code base and language to another.

If you're calling it DOM_DOMImplementation, I suspect you're trying to use
the version of the DOM which is packaged with the Xerces-C parser. Xerces
can be downloaded from http://xml.apache.org

I'm not very familiar with the C++ version of  Xerces. But the sample
programs that come with it _should_ include an example of how to obtain the
DOM_DOMImplementation object.


We're investigating whether there's some way to avoid this implementation
sensitivity, or at least provide a default or system-level configuration
option. Unfortunately the best answers for doing so rely on dynamic code
loading, which is only available in some languages and platforms. We have
an approach that looks pretty good for Java, but it wouldn't work for many
other languages. We're still deciding what to do about that; watch for news
as the DOM continues to evolve.
