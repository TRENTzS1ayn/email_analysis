I am not finding anything in the DOM spec about this, but I just want to make 
sure that the following is a carry-over from old Netscape versions rather than 
part of their Netscape 6 DOM-1 compliancy....

Is referencing an HTML form-field value allowed by specifying  
document.<formName>.<fieldName>.value ?  Or does it need to be  
document.getElementById("<fieldID>").value  to be DOM-1 compliant?

We're just trying to develop our HTML pages to DOM-1 specifications.

Thank you.
