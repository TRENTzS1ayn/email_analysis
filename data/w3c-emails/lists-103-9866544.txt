> What you are referring to is valid DOM-0 (legacy) functionality 

Hmm, do you have a DOM-0 spec that shows that it's
not just some implementation-specific thingie?  :-)
To my recollection, no spec for a "DOM-0" exists.

I think it's EXTREMELY unwise to rely on anything
that can only claim to be a legacy.  Use DOM L1
functionality wherever possible.
