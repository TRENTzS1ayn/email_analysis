Hi. 
I'm new to DOM.
1) I don't understand why a document has to own all nodes it can
reference.

2) If I get a reference to DOM document, what should I do to be certain
that the changes I do, don't reflects in the original data structure?
Should I use importNode (to a memory-only document) or cloneNode?

thanks in advance.
