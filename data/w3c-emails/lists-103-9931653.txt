Results of Proposed Recommendation Call for Review

During the Proposed Recommendation Call for Review period, all reviews
supported the 6 DOM Level 2 documents to advance to Recommendation.
After the deadline, however, two sets of comments came in concerning the
DOM Level 2 HTML specification. Both endorsed the advancement of
the other 5 specifications, and were willing to see the DOM Level 2 HTML
document to advance, although they had concerns about backwards compatibility.

One other comment was made regarding the package name in the language
bindings. The Working Group addressed this issue and made a resolution
on that issue during the development of Working Drafts; and reminded the
commenter of this decision.

After reviewing the comments and considering the possible options, the
Director chose to advance all but the DOM Level 2 HTML Specification to
W3C Recommendation. The DOM Level 2 HTML Specification is now published
as a Last Call Working Draft, to allow the W3C Working Groups to review
it and for the Working Group to determine that compatibility issues are 
well addressed with the new version and that existing applications gain
real benefits from the change, with the goal of resuming the W3C
Recommendation track.

Description of what Recommendation means

W3C Process Document, Section 6.2.5
http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/Process-19991111/tr.html#RecsW3C

Requirements for Entrance 
Director approval based on Advisory Committee review. 
            
Associated Activities 
Management of errata and clarification if necessary. 
            
Duration 
Indefinite. 

Next State 
Not applicable, though the document may be superseded. 

A Recommendation reflects consensus within W3C, as indicated by the
Director's approval. W3C considers that the ideas or technology
specified by a Recommendation are appropriate for widespread deployment
and promote W3C's mission. W3C will make every effort to maintain its
Recommendations (e.g., by tracking errata, providing testbed
applications, helping to create test suites, etc.) and to encourage
widespread implementation. 

Status of the Document

All five DOM Level 2 Recommendations share the same Status section, as follows:

This section describes the status of this document at the time of its
publication. Other documents may supersede this document. The latest
status of this document series is maintained at the W3C.

This document has been reviewed by W3C Members and other interested
parties and has been endorsed by the Director as a W3C Recommendation.
It is a stable document and may be used as reference material or cited
as a normative reference from another document. W3C's role in making the
Recommendation is to draw attention to the specification and to promote
its widespread deployment. This enhances the functionality and
interoperability of the Web.

This document has been produced as part of the W3C DOM Activity. The
authors of this document are the DOM Working Group members. Different
modules of the Document Object Model have different editors.
