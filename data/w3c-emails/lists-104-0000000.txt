It's defined very carefully, though tersely. A somewhat more readable
description is available at http://www.w3.org/DOM/faq.html#nodelist

The NodeList should always look as it would if you had just requested it.
When you remove the node, it drops out of the NodeList. When you insert it,
it will be inserted into the NodeList IF the insertiion point is within the
subtree of the node on which getElementsByTagName() was issued.  Note that
the location where it's inserted may be different from where it was
removed, since the NodeList displays the nodes in document order.
