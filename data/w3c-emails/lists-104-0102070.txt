Understood.  Please note that the package.html file is

- extremely terse, containing top-level documentation common to each package
- not javadoc output itself, just an input to javadoc
- kept with source code with each package directory
- contains important information that is not possible to include in source
- aids clarity for users, especially in understanding package differences

I'm happy to discuss this further by phone if you wish, Phillippe.
Thanks for considering this request.

all the best, Don
