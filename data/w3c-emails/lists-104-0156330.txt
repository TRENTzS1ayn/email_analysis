I believe we've said officially that DOM implementations _may_ throw
implementation-specific exceptions if/when their implementation-specified
bounds are exceeded. Normally that's taken to mean things like running out
of storage. Running out of time strikes me as entirely analagous, so if
someone wanted to throw a timeout exception I'd consider that reasonable...
and out of the scope of the current DOM spec.

In any case, this issue would pervade the entire remote-DOM implementation,
and hence is not an XPath issue per se.
