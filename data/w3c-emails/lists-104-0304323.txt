Setting the nodeValue property of the Node interface may cause a
DOMException with a code of NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERROR.  The spec
says that this may occur "when the node is readonly".  There are simliar
exceptions raised by other properties and methods.

I can't find a discussion in the spec that explains what it means for a
node to be readonly or where one might encounter such a node.  Could
someone please clarify?  In particular, will JavaScript programmers
manipulating HTML documents within a web browser ever encounter readonly
nodes?  

Thanks!
