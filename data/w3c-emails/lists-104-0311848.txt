See recent discussion in the archives of this mailing list: Descendents of
an Entity andEntityReference nodes and their descendents are read-only. So
are Notation nodes (The DOM's index and glossary pages are useful for this;
looking in the index found this fairly quickly)

This exception may also be thrown in some cases if the specific operation
is forbidden in this node -- eg, trying to set nodeValue for an Entity
node.

The DOM does not say there aren't any other ways that nodes can become
read-only. We may add APIs to control that in the future. And some DOM
implementations have implementation-specific mechanisms that may cause this
to happen.
