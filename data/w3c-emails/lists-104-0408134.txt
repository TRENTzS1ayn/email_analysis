When a CSS stylesheet contains an @import at-rule with a specified list 
of media types, it generates in the CSS OM a CSSImportRule having a 
MediaList attribute and a CSSStyleSheet attribute, itself having a 
MediaList attribute...

So the question if the following one : are these two MediaLists strictly 
and dynamically equal ?

Question Cc:ed to www-style so CSS WG knows about it.
