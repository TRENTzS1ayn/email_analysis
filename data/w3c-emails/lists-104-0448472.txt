Thanks for the clarification, Joe.  I hadn't looked at the "readonly"
entry in the Glossary, and hadn't yet read about the readonly Entity,
EntityReference, and Notation nodes.

This tells me exactly what I need to know for my JavaScript book.  This
exception may be thrown when you set any read-write property of any
node.  Since it is universal, I'm not going to bother mentioning it in
my descriptions of every read-write property of every node..
