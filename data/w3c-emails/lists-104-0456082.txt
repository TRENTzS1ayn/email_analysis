I agree that the "this" is badly overloaded here, and that the antecedents
are not obvious.

Possible rewording:


The Document object associated with this node. For most nodes, this refers
to the Document whose factory methods created them (and which can be used
to create other nodes compatable with them). When a node is either a
Document, or a DocumentType which is has not yet been associated with a
specific document by the DOMImplementation.createDocument method, its
ownerDocument is null.


Better?
