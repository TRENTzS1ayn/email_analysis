There is an attribute attributes on the Node interface,
readonly attribute  NamedNodeMap         attributes;
In some language bindings (e.g. Java) this will be translated into
getAttributes. Why it is defined on Node and not Element is another
question. I suppose the text you mention should read
"Elements may have attributes associated with them; since 
the Element interface inherits from Node, the readonly attribute
attributes on the Node interface method may be used to retrieve
the set of all attributes for an element."

Must... resist.... temptation....
