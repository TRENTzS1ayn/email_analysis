CSSStyleDeclaration.cssText can throw an exception on setting.  In
particular:

SYNTAX_ERR: Raised if the specified CSS string value has a syntax error
            and is unparsable.

What does this really mean?  All CSS is parsable.  If one encounters CSS
that does not make sense, the assumption is that it's a future version
of the standard and its quietly dropped.

For example, which, if any of the below statements should throw
exceptions:

cssText = "/*";
cssText = "abcde";
cssText = "font-color: black; font-size: bold; font-family: monospace";

This seems to need some clarification.

I've cced this to www-style so both groups are aware of it.
