Hi,

Currently, there's no way to add a DOM_Attribute to an in-memory DOM tree
that is an ID, even if it should be according to the DTD. Also, when
importing a DOM_Element that has an ID attribute, the attribute is imported
along with the element, but not recorded as an ID.
I would like to suggest that either- the DOM_Document should check it's
DocumentType to see if new or imported Attributes should be used as an ID or
to add functionality to specifically request that an attribute be treated as
an ID (e.g. DOM_Document::createIDAttribute()).

Let me know what heppens next,

TIA, Evert
