If the DOM knows that an attribute is an ID, based on the DTD or Schema, it
_should_ do the right thing automatically whenever you change the
attributes. But as of DOM Level 2, there is no API for providing that
information to a DOM, so whether or not this happens is entirely
implementation dependent. If you don't like what your implementation is
doing in that regard, contact its authors and/or investigate other
implementations.

See the Working Draft for the DOM Level 3 "abstract schema" APIs.
Implementations which choose to support this feature will have a way to
examine and (optionally) manipulate the Schema/DTD information, and
presumably would also commit to maintaining the ID list correctly.
