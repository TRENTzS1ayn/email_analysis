 By Definition, if you're retrieving it from a NamedNodeMap the order of
retrieval is not guaranteed. Quoting the DOM spec: "... NamedNodeMaps are
not maintained in any particular order. Objects contained in an object
implementing NamedNodeMap may also be accessed by an ordinal index, but
this is simply to allow convenient enumeration of the contents of a
NamedNodeMap, and does not imply that the DOM specifies an order to these
Nodes."

But folks keep asking. Might be worth adding a FAQ entry to re-state this,
and the justification behind it...
