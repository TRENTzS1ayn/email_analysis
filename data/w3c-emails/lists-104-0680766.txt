The HTML WG took over responsibility for the XHTML DOM some 
months ago, so you should probably ask them. The reason was 
that the DOM WG should concentrate on generic XML, and leave 
the DOMs for specialised schemas to the relevant WGs, who 
understand what their schema needs. This applies to SVG, 
MathML, and also HTML. The HTML DOM was a special case that 
the DOM WG worked on for historical reasons.
