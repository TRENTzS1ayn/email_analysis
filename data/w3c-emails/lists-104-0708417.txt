Manipulation of Abstract Schema's (DTD's or XML Schema's) is part of DOM
Level 3.
DOM Level 3 is currently in draft. DOM Level 1 and 2 have no such
support, they only offer interfaces for the document instance.
 
see also: http://www.w3.org/dom <http://www.w3.org/dom> 
 
X-Hive/DB is as far as I know currently the only product that supports
the working draft.

Hi, 

1. I would like to ask whether I could parse a XML schema to create a
memory tree so that it can be populated and manipulated later? 

2. If yes, which parers that implements DOM is able to do it?

3. Which DOM (1 or 2) allows this to be done?

Thanks in advance, Braden.
