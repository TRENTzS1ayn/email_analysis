Vinay,

I am sure you don't mean to be rude, but you should realize that the
presumption implicit in your final statement, "Expecting a reply from
your side" is that we are obligated to help you. Of course we are not. A
more appropriate English phrasing might have been, "Hoping someone can
help me with my problems."

Regarding parsing - per Merriam-Webster OnLine, http://www.m-w.com/
   Main Entry: pars?er 
   Pronunciation: 'p?r-s&r
   Function: noun
   Date: circa 1864
   : one that parses; specifically : a computer program that breaks down
   text into recognized strings of characters for further analysis 

I think you will need to make a greater effort to find further
information on your own. A local bookstore or web-based bookstore should
supply a good selection of text resources. The W3 website,
http://www.w3.org, provides a great deal of information on XML assuming
that your parsing interests relate to XML. Finally, a search of the web
using any engine will produce many more details.

Good luck,
Jim.
