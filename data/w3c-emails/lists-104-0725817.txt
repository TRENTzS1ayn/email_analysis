I was looking over the W3C DOM Level 2 specifications, and I am quite surprised to see no coverage by the DOM WG to define event handlers for HTML and XHTML.  These event handlers exist in HTML 4.0, XHTML 1.0, and XHTML 1.1 Recommendations, in the DTDs.

Are there any plans by the DOM Working Group to formalize a standard list of event handlers for the HTML DOM?
