Hi,
i am new to XML.i started with DTD's.i am practising with some examples.
i am using IE 5.0 version.first i tried a sample program with internal DTD.
the xample is follows:-

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE note [
  <!ELEMENT note (to,from,heading,body)>
  <!ELEMENT to      (#PCDATA)>  
  <!ELEMENT from    (#PCDATA)>  
  <!ELEMENT heading (#PCDATA)>  
  <!ELEMENT body    (#PCDATA)>]>
  
  <note>  
  <from>Jani</from>  
  <to>Tove</to>  
  <heading>Reminder</heading>  
  <body>Don't forget me this weekend</body>
  </note>

actually the child nodes, (to,from,heading,body) should follow the same
sequence in the xml document.
but even though i interchanged the sequence in the XML document, it did not
give me any error.
do i need to set any properties in the browser?.

regards
raju kvk
