Fixed.

To avoid confusion with outputString, we renamed it to visibleOutputGenerated.

The sentence seems pretty clear. As an example, 'Ctrl+a' doesn't normally
generate a visible output, while 'a' does.

keyVal will hold the value of the last used key. For 'ctrl+a', you will
obtain the following sequence:
(v == virtKeyVal, k == keyVal, o == outputString, vo == visibleOutputGenerated,
 m == modifier, 0 == 0/null)

ctrl+a

keydown   [v=^,k=0, o=0, vo=0, m=0]
textEvent [v=^,k=0, o=0, vo=0, m=0]
keydown   [v=0, k=a, o=0, vo=0, m=right_ctrl]
textEvent [v=0, k=a, o=0, vo=0, m=right_ctrl]
keyup     [v=0, k=a, o=0, vo=0, m=right_ctrl]
keyup     [v=^, k=0, o=0, vo=0, m=0]

I'm double-checking my example with Tom and will fix the draft.

Fixed. (btw, 'views' was missing in DOM Level 2 events context info. oops).

hum. could be confusing with visibleOutputGenerated...
