This mailing list is for questions about the Document Object Model API.
Questions about specific implementations should be sent to the folks
supporting those implementations, Microsoft. General questions about XML
usage should probably be sent to the XML-DEV mailing list
(http://xml.org/xml-dev/index.shtml), or some similar resource.

Brief off-the-cuff guesses: Did you turn on validation in your parser? If
it's a SAX parser, did you install an error handler?
