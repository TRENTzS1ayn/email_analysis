We didn't change our choose since:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom/2001AprJun/0258.html

Here is the announcement for the page:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom/2001AprJun/0285.html

and here is the page:
http://www.w3.org/DOM/Bindings

Feel free to send me a pointer to your own bindings and I'll add them on the
