This can be done today in a Level 2 DOM, by writing an appropriate
NodeFilter and using either NodeIterator or TreeWalker... which is actually
a very general solution, and probably makes a lot more sense than adding a
bunch of individual methods matching on various aspects of the node and its
context.

If that doesn't address your needs, tell us why not ...
