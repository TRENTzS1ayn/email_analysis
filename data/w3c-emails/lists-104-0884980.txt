Hi.

I just discovered that DOM L2's createTextNode doesn't declare a
DOMException. However I would have assumed that trying to create a text node
using a character which is not allowed in XML (such as Control-E, U+5) would
throw an exception.

Am I missing something, or is this a bug in the specification?

Julian
