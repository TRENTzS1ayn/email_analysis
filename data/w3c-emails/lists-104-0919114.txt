In practice shouldn't Node have a void */Object attribute on which to
hang user data? I'm writing an ncurses, DOM, MVC thingy and in order
to communicate keystrokes from the controller to the form components
in the view through the DOM model it's obvious that a data pointer is
necessary. Or did I miss something?
