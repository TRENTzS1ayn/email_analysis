This is a very timely subject!  The working group will meet next week, and
this is on the agenda.  I personally agree that we need a standard interface
to attach a pointer / reference to arbitrary data to a DOM node.  The
working group proposed a DOMKey mechanism to make it easy for applications
to maintain an external mapping between DOM nodes and arbitrary data, but
this has proved unworkable.  

I believe the main objection to an arbitrary data pointer is that it would
be difficult to guarantee that a DOM implementation would "do the right
thing" when a node is cloned, destroyed, etc.  Anyway, anyone wanting this
feature in Level 3 should make their strongest case for it immediately!
