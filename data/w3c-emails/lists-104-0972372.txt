How do you express the term 'ID' in non-english languages?  Obviously
the answer depends on that language, and we shouldn't make any
assumptions or enforce a language-specific identifier.  This is why DTDs
(or whatever) allow for an attribute to be defined as an identifying
attribute, rather than some special 'ID' named attribute.  Furthermore,
someone may define a document where they're using the name ID for
something other than a unique identifier, and the case may be that the
ID value is duplicated in the same document, this would break the
behavior of getElementById.
