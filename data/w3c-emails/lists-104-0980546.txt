I think you need to look deeper into the XML 1.0 specification that
states specifically that element, attribute, and entity names are case
sensitive.  The default behavior of the DOM is case sensitivity for all
methods, including getElementsByTagName.  

This goes into my statement about languages.  Upper and lower case are a
very western concept in languages.  There are only a handful of the
world languages that actually utilize case sensitivity, and the rest
don't.  So providing case insensitive functions introduces both a burden
on the implementor to perform the case rolling depending on locale, and
introduces an undefined behavior in languages that do not support case.
