Whether the domain values are URIs or short strings specified in the
DOM spec doesn't make any difference to me, since I'd expect language
bindings to provide convenient named constants I can refer to.
Judging from the current round of DOM 3 drafts, I'd expect the W3C to
go for short strings, and forget to deal with namespace control within
that space.  (Such as reserving some prefix for future W3C use, and
recommending some Java-esque reverse-domain prefix convention.)

Reception seems to have been poor when I suggested clarifying that for
the Load/Save specification, but I don't remember the exact response
off the top of my head.

(I still think that's important, and using URIs at least implicitly
hints at that, if the W3C doesn't want to be specific on this topic.)

Yes, which is nice.  It might even be reasonable for the DOMError
objects to provide a sequence of domain/code pairs, so that if an
error matches some non-W3C error, and later a W3C-specified error code
is defined, both can be associated with the error.  That feels a bit
heavy, but then, we are talking about the DOM, and error handling
never has the same performance requirements as normal processing.
