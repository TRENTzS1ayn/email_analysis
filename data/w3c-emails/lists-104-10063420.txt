Sorry about that. The mailing is already moderated but obviously we have
a problem somewhere. An unknown email address, including from @w3.org,
should not be able to go through. I asked our system team to have a look
at it and see what's wrong with our system. This might be related to our
changes on the server a few months ago. Hopefully, they'll be able to
find a solution asap.
