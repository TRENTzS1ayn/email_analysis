DOM XPath module last call issue a5 was about spelling out that namespace
attribute DOM nodes would not be returned by the XPath APIs.  The resolution
of the issue is a clearer section dealing with the mapping of these and
other node types.

See the issues list for more complete information at 
http://www.w3.org/2002/03/DOM-Level-3-XPath-issues/all.html#a5

Please let us know if you are, or are not, satisfied with this resolution.
