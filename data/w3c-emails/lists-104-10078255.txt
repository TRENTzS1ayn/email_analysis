DOM XPath module last call issue a6 was about additional standard interfaces
for creating variables or extension functions.  The resolution of this issue
is that it was decideded that doing this now would add more complexity to the
current API.  The current standardization effort does not prevent standardization
of this in a later specification.

See the issues list for more complete information at 
http://www.w3.org/2002/03/DOM-Level-3-XPath-issues/all.html#a6

Please let us know if you are, or are not, satisfied with this resolution.
