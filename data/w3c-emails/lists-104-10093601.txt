DOM XPath module last call issue a7 is about designing the DOM XPath API
interface so that it can be easily extended to support XPath 2.0.  The 
resolution of this issue is that the type of XPath results has been changed
to allow a new type of request and result for XPath 2.0 operations.  The 
working group also intends to submit a note showing a straitforward XPath 2.0
extension.

See the issues list for more complete information at 
http://www.w3.org/2002/03/DOM-Level-3-XPath-issues/all.html#a7

Please let us know if you are, or are not, satisfied with this resolution.
