DOM XPath module last call issue a9 was about the specification saying nothing
about use of the XPath id() function.  The resolution was by adding a conformance
section which explicitly describes how this function must work.

See the issues list for more complete information at 
http://www.w3.org/2002/03/DOM-Level-3-XPath-issues/all.html#a9

Please let us know if you are, or are not, satisfied with this resolution.
