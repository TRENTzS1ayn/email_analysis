DOM XPath module last call issue b2 was about use of unsigned values.  The 
resolution of this issue is that it was decided that the precedent of using
unsigned was well established and was appropriate.

See the issues list for more complete information at 
http://www.w3.org/2002/03/DOM-Level-3-XPath-issues/all.html#b2

Please let us know if you are, or are not, satisfied with this resolution.
