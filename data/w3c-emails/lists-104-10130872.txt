DOM XPath module last call issue b3 was about whether the resolver argument was
required to resolve the XML namespace.  The resolution was that it was agreed 
that this needed to be clarified, and the resolver is now required to always
resolve that namespace correctly.

See the issues list for more complete information at 
http://www.w3.org/2002/03/DOM-Level-3-XPath-issues/all.html#b3

Please let us know if you are, or are not, satisfied with this resolution.
