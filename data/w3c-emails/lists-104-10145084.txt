DOM XPath module last call issue b4 was about use of the word
may when "might" was intended.  For resolution, the word "may"
was changed to "might".

See the issues list for more complete information at 
http://www.w3.org/2002/03/DOM-Level-3-XPath-issues/all.html#b4

Please let us know if you are, or are not, satisfied with this resolution.
