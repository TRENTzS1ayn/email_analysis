DOM XPath module last call issue b5 was about the descrepancy between DOM
ownerElement and XPath parent attributes in the new XPathNamespace node.


The resolution of this issue is that the new DOM interface is being consistent
with existing DOM interfaces as well as the infoset, which does not provide
a parent of the XPathNamespace node.  The writers of the XPath spec forced
this incompatibility, producing a parent of a node of which the node was
not a child.  No change is desired in the DOM data structures, because it
would be inconsistent with other DOM interfaces and the mapping of the
infoset to those interfaces.

See the issues list for more complete information at

Please let us know if you are, or are not, satisfied with this resolution.
