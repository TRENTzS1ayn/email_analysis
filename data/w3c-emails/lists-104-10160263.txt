DOM XPath module last call issue a6 was about the choice of interface attributes
to represent the prefix and namespaceURI.  The resolution is no change because
the DOM has chosen to follow the established mapping between DOM nodes and
infoset properties.

See the issues list for more complete information at 
http://www.w3.org/2002/03/DOM-Level-3-XPath-issues/all.html#b6

Please let us know if you are, or are not, satisfied with this resolution.
