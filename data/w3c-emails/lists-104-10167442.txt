DOM XPath module last call issue b7 was about creating a namespace resolver from
the current context node if none was specified.  The resolution of this issue
is that it was decideded that this is not a desirable change, so no change was 
made.

See the issues list for more complete information at 
http://www.w3.org/2002/03/DOM-Level-3-XPath-issues/all.html#a6

Please let us know if you are, or are not, satisfied with this resolution.
