DOM XPath module last call issue b8 was about the lifetime and liveness
of an XPathNSResolver.  The resolution of this issue was to add wording
talking about the liveness after it is created using a node.

See the issues list for more complete information at 
http://www.w3.org/2002/03/DOM-Level-3-XPath-issues/all.html#b8

Please let us know if you are, or are not, satisfied with this resolution.
