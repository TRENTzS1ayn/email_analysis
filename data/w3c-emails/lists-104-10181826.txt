Alternative suggestion:

There had been discussion of moving the ownerElement attribute back into 
Node, to make it a general equivalent of XPath's concept of parent, saving 
them the coding hassle of 
        (node.getType()==Node.ATTR_NODE) ? node.getOwnerElement() : 
node.getParent()
and making the relationship between the DOM and XPath views somewhat more 
straightforward. This would also have to skip past EntityReference nodes, 
since those don't exist in the XPath model; I don't remember any other 
complications but it's been a while since I've looked at it.

Relatively simple architectural change, non-breaking, should be low impact 
on implementers and it'd close this issue in a manner which (I think) the 
XPath folks would actually be happy with rather than tolerant of.

Has this been considered and voted down, or did it simply fall through the 
cracks?
