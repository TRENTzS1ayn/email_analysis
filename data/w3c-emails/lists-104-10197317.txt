DOM XPath module last call issue Query1 was about the treatment of general entities.
The resolution of this issue is that it was clarified that unexpanded entities will
be ignored, as XPath says they should be.

See the issues list for more complete information at 
http://www.w3.org/2002/03/DOM-Level-3-XPath-issues/all.html#query1

Please let us know if you are, or are not, satisfied with this resolution.
