DOM XPath module last call issue query2 was about encountering CDATA
section nodes.  The resolution is that the description of the mapping
between text in XPath and DOM already covered it.  CData section nodes
are hardly distinguishable from text nodes.  No change.

See the issues list for more complete information at 
http://www.w3.org/2002/03/DOM-Level-3-XPath-issues/all.html#a6

Please let us know if you are, or are not, satisfied with this resolution.
