DOM XPath module last call issue xsl7 was about a typeo and dependency on level 3
namespace lookup method.  The resolution of this issue is that the typeo was fixed
and the dependency was eliminated.

See the issues list for more complete information at 
http://www.w3.org/2002/03/DOM-Level-3-XPath-issues/all.html#xsl7
