Dear DOM WG,

The I18N WG has asked me to write to you to say that we regret that we
cannot currently find the time to review the DOM Level 3 Events
Specification [1].  We did, however, spend an enormous amount of time on
our review [2] of the DOM Level 2 Events Specification and, while some
of the issues we then raised have been resolved, others have not.  We,
therefore, ask that you treat our comments of 1999-10-19 as comments on
the DOM Level 3 Events Specification.

We will still try to find someone to compare our comments with your
latest version, but it currently looks unlikely that we will succeed.

Thanks,
