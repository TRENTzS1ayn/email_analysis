DOM XPath module last call issue caro1 was about representing an empty
node set as a snapshot.  The resolution of this issue is to do nothing,
as the current description in the specification seems clear and consistent
that a zero length would be expected and null items if requested.

See the issues list for more complete information at 
http://www.w3.org/2002/03/DOM-Level-3-XPath-issues/all.html#xsl8

Please let us know if you are, or are not, satisfied with this resolution.
