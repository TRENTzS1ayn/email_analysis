DOM XPath module last call issue caro1 was about returning a null
instead of raising an exception when an index number that is too
high is specified as the snapshot index.  The resolution of this 
issue is to do nothing, as the current description in the 
specification seems clear and consistent with the rest of the DOM
specification.

See the issues list for more complete information at 
http://www.w3.org/2002/03/DOM-Level-3-XPath-issues/all.html#caro2

Please let us know if you are, or are not, satisfied with this resolution.
