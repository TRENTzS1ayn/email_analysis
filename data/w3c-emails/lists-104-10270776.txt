DOM XPath module last call issue caro3  The resolution of this issue is to do nothing,
as the current description in the specification seems clear and consistent that
a null is returned.

See the issues list for more complete information at 
http://www.w3.org/2002/03/DOM-Level-3-XPath-issues/all.html#caro3

Please let us know if you are, or are not, satisfied with this resolution.
