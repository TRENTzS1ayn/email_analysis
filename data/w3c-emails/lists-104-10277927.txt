DOM XPath module last call issue caro4 was returning a null string value
from the result interfaces.  The resolution of this issue is to do nothing,
as the current description in the specification does not permit nulls, as
is true of all other DOM APIs that do not permit nulls.  The alternative would
be to change all API descriptions in DOM to explicitly disallow nulls instead
of following the rule that a null would have to be explicitly allowed.

See the issues list for more complete information at 
http://www.w3.org/2002/03/DOM-Level-3-XPath-issues/all.html#caro4

Please let us know if you are, or are not, satisfied with this resolution.
