DOM XPath module last call issue caro1 was about clarifying in
the specification whether a null could be returned.  The 
resolution of this issue is to do nothing, because unless the
specification permits a null explicitly, then a null is not
permitted.  The working group has repeatedly rejected adding
to every described method that it cannot return a null.  There
is clear precedent throughout the DOM API.  None of the constructors
anywhere state that a null may not be returned, but they may
not because the description did not specify it.

See the issues list for more complete information at

Please let us know if you are, or are not, satisfied with this resolution.
