DOM XPath module last call issue caro6 was about clarification of
whether the XPathNSResolver must always be bound to some node or
whether they may be created using other techniques.  We find that the
specification does not "hint" about this, but clearly spells it out
that they are associated with a node if created through that constuctor,
but may clearly be created in other ways by the application.

See the issues list for more complete information at 
http://www.w3.org/2002/03/DOM-Level-3-XPath-issues/all.html#xsl8

Please let us know if you are, or are not, satisfied with this resolution.
