I am certainly happy to discuss this and see where it goes.  I see merit 
in it.

I suspect, as I said previously, that it will not answer the question 
being asked in B5 or others who think it should be called parent.

One problem that limits the usefulness is the lack of a similar accessor 
in the Traversal module on the Treewalker interface, which may be used 
to process the result of the XPath query, especially where a 
EntityReferences may be present.
