Hi,
perhaps this needs rephrasing as no one has answered. Are changes 
to the tree (eg adding new namespace attributes) supposed to affect the 
results of these methods?

Subject: namespace lookup methods

Hi,
I'm implementing isDefaultNamespace and lookupNamespaceXXX. To 
start with I implemented them by just looking up the appropriate 
attributes. I then implemented getBaseURI and came across the idea of a 
synthetic infoset. Are the namespace lookup methods supposed to work on 
the infoset or is my implementation correct?
