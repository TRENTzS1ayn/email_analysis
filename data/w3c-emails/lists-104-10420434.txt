Hi,
I'm implementing the Level 3 XPath module and have a query. I 
understand that namepsace nodes are created at parse time and are not 
affected by changes to the tree. What happens when we create a new element 
in a certain namespace? Do we also create namespace nodes if appropriate? 
If so then it seems that we are saying its not just a parse time thing. If 
not then a query such as

/root/newEle/namespace::*


would return a different result if we serialised the document (after 
namespace normalisation) and then reparsed it.
