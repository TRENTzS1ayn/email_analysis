> How do I start ?

You start with a document.createElement("table"), then you create the
rows, insert in the table, insert the table in the DOM.

May I recommend reading a DOM tutorial such as
http://www.w3schools.com/dom/default.asp ?  This has examples and such
as well...

Wallet [n]: Mythical object rumored to carry
mysterious, disappearing substances referred to as
"money" or "cash" (not to be confused with the C
Shell).  The association of this "money" to real life
is currently being researched by R&D (put Reality in
the Background; Dammit).  Full results are expected
RSN, however, preliminary results indicate that this
substance "money" is often required to obtain such
necessities as computers, pizza, hard drives, caffeine,
a network connection, and resolving the conflict
between ordering the pizza and maintaining your network
connection.
