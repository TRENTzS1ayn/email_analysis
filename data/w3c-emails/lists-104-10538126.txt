Thanks for the citation. I checked it, but I didn't find an answer to my
question. Can you quote me the text in Core that permits nodeName to be
null?

I understand that the prefix attribute can be null. I also understand that
for XPathNamespace, the nodeName is supposed to be the same as the prefix. 
My question is, should I assume the logical implication, that if prefix is
null, then nodeName should also be null? I hesitate to do so, since I see no
explicit statement that null is permitted for nodeName.
