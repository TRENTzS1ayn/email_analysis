Correct.

No.  This does not appear in the XPath or DOM model or in the infoset.

I believe nodeName should be null in this case.  The namespaceURI is a 
deprecated relative URI, so the value of namespaceURI is unpredictable, 
at best.  but they may be treated literally as you have shown here.

Yes.  But not xmlns.  Only xml.  The rule here is whatever the XPath 
specification says.

xmlns is never included.  The order of these is implementation-dependent.

This is a case that we did not specifically consider when creating the API.

It is obvious to me that prefix should be null in this case, as it is in 
other similar cases in the specification.  This should be made clear in 
the specification.  We did not think of the default namespace when 
creating that part of the API.

I agree that it is a problem with nodeName being null because we have 
never said it may be null except by implication that it must match the 
others.  I am not sure what to do in this case.  I will have to think 
about that.  Perhaps we need to reconsider the decision to make nodeName 
match prefix, because it is unnecessary and may be confusing, as we now 
see.  Another alternative would to have the value of nodeName be 
something like "#namespace", as it is #text for text, etc.

By the way, are you implementing this?  If so, in what language, if I 
may ask.
