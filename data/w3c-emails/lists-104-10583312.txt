I have been unable to make the concept of ownerElement work the same as 
XPath all the time, even if moved to Node.

The problem is that the XPath Parent of the document element is the 
Document, which is called the root in XPath.

ownerElement appropriately returns an Element node, so it cannot return 
the same thing as XPath's parent axis in this case because the root is 
not an element, but is rather a Document.
