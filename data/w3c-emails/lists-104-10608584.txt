So call it getOwnerElementOrDocument(), returning Node just as getParent 
does... though that name's a bit verbose. On the other hand, I don't think 
getXPathParent() would fly, for various reasons...?

We know what we want to do, we know why we want to do it (efficiency and 
code clarity), we just need a clean way of expressing it... and I need to 
convince folks that it's interesting enough to be worth supporting.
