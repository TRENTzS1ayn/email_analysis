We added the following in the Events draft:
      Copying a Node does not copy the event listeners attached
      to it. Event listeners must be attached to the newly
      created node afterwards if so desired. Therefore, when
      Nodes are copied using Node.cloneNode or
      Range.cloneContents, the EventListeners attached to them
      are not automatically attached to their copies.

We added the following in the Events draft:
      Moving a Node does not affect the event listeners attached
      to it.  Therefore, when Nodes are moved using
      Document.adoptNode, Node.appendChild, or
      Range.extractContents, the EventListeners attached to the
      moved Nodes stay attached to them.

This should address those issues.
