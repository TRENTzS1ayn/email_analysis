No, we didn't change from DOM2:
[[
Before processing these events, the implementation must check for event
listeners registered to receive the event and dispatch the event to
those listeners. These listeners then have the option of canceling the
implementation's default action or allowing the default action to
proceed.
]]

We rephrased the paragraph following your own request but we didn't
change the semantic associated with default actions and preventDefault.
