Hello!

 I really need help. In order to create my own dom-tree I happily
instantiated elements. But now I came to the point where its getting
quite difficult.
Imagine you have an xml-document with the following tags:

<Analysis Name="bla" Type="blabla" >
<Analysis Name="blu" Type="blublu" >
<Analysis...

The problem is that I never know how many Analysis Elements I have to
instantiate, so I will put it in a loop. But then of course the next
problem occurs. I cannot name the elements differently.
I tried it this way:

while( i!= 0){
Element Analysis = domDocument.createElement("Analysis");
Fault.appendChild(Analysis);
}

obviously this doesnt work.

So the next thing I tried was:

while( i!=0){
Fault.appendChild(Analysis);
}

I thought this would attach the Analysis-Element i-times to the
Fault-Element. But it did it only once!
It seems like it is not possible to attache one Element twice to the
same tree.
Why?

And even more important, does anybody have a clue how I could solve this
problem?
I really dont know further.

hoping for any answers and your knowledge,

Irene
