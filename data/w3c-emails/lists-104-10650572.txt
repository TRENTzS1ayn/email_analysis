I have received an assignment about research on document object model. I 
haven't still found answers to the following questions:

1) Where is DOM used now, and does it have a future?
2) Who owns DOM and what does it cost?
3) Why should a commercial organization get interested in this technology?

I would appreciate if you reply to me at your earliest possible as my 
assignment due date is getting closer.

Regards,

Athar
