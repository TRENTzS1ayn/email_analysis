>1) Where is DOM used now, and does it have a future?

DOM is used extensively on the web, and it most certainly does have a
future!

> 2) Who owns DOM and what does it cost?

Noone owns DOM, as it is not a product. As Gareth said, some searches
on Google and a look at w3c.org will answer all your questions.

> 3) Why should a commercial organization get interested in this
> technology?

If they are developing websites I would imagine they are already
interested, otherwise I feel that they would have very little
interest in it.
