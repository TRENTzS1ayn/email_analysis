Not just on the web, pretty much anything XML related is likely to use 
the DOM at some point. It's pretty much everywhere you look. It'd be 
quite boring if it were limited to website development, but thankfully 
it's not and is used all over the place. In fact, most commercial 
entities that have anything to do with XML, even remotely, is almost 
certainly using the DOM somewhere.
