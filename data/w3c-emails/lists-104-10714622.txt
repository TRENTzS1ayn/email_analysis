I just noticed that the DOM-2 HTML Spec of June 5, in Section 1.6.1, indicates that the DOM type which corresponds to CDATA is DOMString and the type which corresponds to NUMBER is long int.

This results in an inconsistency based on certain proposed changes from DOM-1 to DOM-2. In particular, the following properties have been assigned in integral type, yet are specified in the HTML/XHTML DTDs as CDATA:

HTMLInputElement- size
HTMLImageElement- border, height, hspace, width, vspace

I believe these should be reverted to the use of DOMString as specified in DOM-1, and that implementations (IE, Mozilla) be brought into conformance with this definition. [As an aside, changing HTMLImageElement to use integral types for the above properties creates an additional inconsistency with HTMLAppletElement and HTMLObjectElement for similarly named properties; reverting to DOMString would eliminate this inconsistency.]
