I don???t think you mean "logical" order, but, rather, "presentation or
display" order. Most readers interpret document order as "logical" order.
Also, if you do base the definition of rowIndex on presentation order,
then you need to posit an indefinite height presentation container (in
a top-to-bottom block progression direction writing mode); otherwise,
page breaks that would cause repeats of header and footer sections must
be accounted for in determining the row corresponding to a rowIndex;
i.e., the same row may be assigned multiple rowIndices on different pages.
To pose it another way, in terms of your "logical" model, do the footer
rows at the end of the first page come after or before the header rows
repeated on the second page?

Overall, I think that the current language is probably the correct language,
and that the interpretation of rowIndex should *not* be based on presentation
order as this is dependent upon the formatting and layout model being used,
which is independent of DOM semantics, at least at level 2.
