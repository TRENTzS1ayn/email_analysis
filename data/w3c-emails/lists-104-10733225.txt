I agree that "logical" is not the best word choice. In any case, both IE
and Netscape use that order when indexing rows.

>>>Overall, I think that the current language is probably the correct
language

Whether logical, presentation, whatever, existing implementations do not
follow the current language of the spec, but rather this language: "When
determining rowIndex, The ordering of rows is such that THEAD rows are
first, followed by the rows of each TBODY section in document order,
followed lastly by TFOOT rows."

Respectfully,
Brad

I don't think you mean "logical" order, but, rather, "presentation or
display" order. Most readers interpret document order as "logical"
order. Also, if you do base the definition of rowIndex on presentation
order, then you need to posit an indefinite height presentation
container (in a top-to-bottom block progression direction writing mode);
otherwise, page breaks that would cause repeats of header and footer
sections must be accounted for in determining the row corresponding to a
rowIndex; i.e., the same row may be assigned multiple rowIndices on
different pages. To pose it another way, in terms of your "logical"
model, do the footer rows at the end of the first page come after or
before the header rows repeated on the second page?

Overall, I think that the current language is probably the correct
language, and that the interpretation of rowIndex should *not* be based
on presentation order as this is dependent upon the formatting and
layout model being used, which is independent of DOM semantics, at least
at level 2.
