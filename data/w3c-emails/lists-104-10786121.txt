I disagree. DOM Level 1 HTML failed to fulfil its contracts of not
breaking the backward compatiblity with DOM Level 0. This comment was
brought to our attention in at the end of 2000 and we already made the
commitment to fix that. I don't think it's wise to revert the decision.
width and height are numbers in DOM0, therefore we cannot change them
back to numbers unless we expose them in a different way. It is clearly
stated that DOM Level 2 HTML is _not_ backward compatible with DOM Level
1 HTML.
