Huh? Hmm, now that you mention this I can't find anywhere in the spec 
where it's stated that methods such as getElementsByTagName() are indeed 
case in-sensitive in the HTML DOM, at least that's how the most widely 
used HTML DOM implementations chose to implement this (i.e. web 
browsers), and I'd be surpised if this was not the intent when the specs 
were written. This should probably be changed in the spec.

Case should not matter in a pure HTML DOM.
