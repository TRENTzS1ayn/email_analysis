I recently wrote an article on the DOM with a (small) emphasis on
accessibility. Its purposes is to expose the current situation, the
goals of the DOM and an emphasis on accessibility. This is work in
progress and the current version could be found at
http://www.w3.org/2002/07/26-dom-article.html

Comments/corrections are welcome,
