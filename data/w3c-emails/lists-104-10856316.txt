Philippe,

Thanks for the new text explaining CustomEvent.  It is indeed much
clearer.  My only suggestion is that you rewrite the sentences beginning
with "This problem could be resolved using two techniques...".  This
part of the text is a distraction discussion of options considered in
the design, rather than a simple description of the final specification.
