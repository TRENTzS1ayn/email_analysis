You state:

Why can't they give you access to the content in the first place? The 
reasons vary. Possibly they require a level of security that your 
browser does not provide. They may have written content that can only 
be read with a specific extension. Or, perhaps they include 
programming code in the page that is not compatible with your browser.


These are all true but you ignore far and away the most important 
reasons: the developer of the page is either unwilling or unable to 
look beyond the most common browser. Sometimes this is simple 
incompetence. More frequently, the page designer is more concerned 
with cool features than with presenting the information in a useful 
form. Sometimes it's both. Either way, the fundamental problem is not 
technical. It's human, and it requires a human solution. My personal 
favorite is educating management on just how many dollars their web 
team is wasting and how much business they're throwing away to "look 
cool."
