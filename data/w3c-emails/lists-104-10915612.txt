The specification says:

---
insertBefore
  ... If refChild is null, insert newChild at the END of the list of
children.
-----

IMHO a more logical, elegant and practical approach would be to change
that to:

---
insertBefore
  ... If refChild is null, insert newChild at the BEGINNING of the list
of children.
-----

Why? The method is called insertBEFORE, and we have appendChild to add a
child at the end of the list of children. What do you think about it?
