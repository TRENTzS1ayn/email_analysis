MUCH MUCH too late to change such a basic behavior. Whether you like it or 
not, you'd better get used to it.

Besides, it's perfectly reasonable as it stands. If you want to insert at 
the beginning, that's inserting before the first child. If you want to 
insert at the end, there is nothing to insert it before, hence you're 
inserting before nothing, hence inserting before null.
