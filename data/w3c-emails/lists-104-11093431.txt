Hi there,

I got a problem and i was wondering if you could help me out.

Breifly this is what im doing:

  - A W3C document object is being returned to me.
  - I have to take that object (XML doc) and style it using XSL.
  - I am doing the conversion using XTags.
    ** XTags are currently built on dom4j.
  - Is there a way to make the w3c document object a dom4j document     
object so I can make the conversion???

Thanks
