Since the DOM doesn't yet provide APIs for controlling a parser, we really
do have to tell you to ask whoever wrote the parser you're using.

DOM Level 3's Load/Save chapter is intended to provide a standardized API
for parsing into a DOM. But that's still a working draft, and of course not
all DOMs will be required to support it even after it becomes a
Recommendation. Again, contact the folks who wrote your implementation to
find out whether they support a prerelease prototype of these APIs.... but
be aware that as a Working Draft it may be subject to frequent changes, and
you may have to recode to track the prototype as it tracks the draft.
