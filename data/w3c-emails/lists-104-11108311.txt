Well..  as the spec also says (at
http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-DOM-Level-3-Events-20020712/events.html#Events-EventTarget):

  The EventTarget interface is implemented by all Nodes in an
  implementation which supports the DOM Event Model. Therefore, this
  interface can be obtained by using binding-specific casting methods on
  an instance of the Node interface.

So in fact, it _is_ expected that any Node will implement EventTarget
and that there is a method of getting from the Node interface to the
EventTarget interface...
