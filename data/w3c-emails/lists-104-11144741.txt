It is indeed a clear mistake in the CustomEvent interface. Even if it is
expected that every node would implement the EventTarget interface, this
module could be reuse outside the context of a DOM tree (with the DOM
CSS for example).

Given that they are duplicate, i.e. the same event listener, does this
really matter?

The same event listener, i.e. the same function reference is the case of
ECMAScript or the same object instance in Java.
