I fixed it in the draft before sending the previous message, so expect
to see the change in the next version. I don't think that no one can
argue that setCurrentTarget must take a Node instead of an EventTarget.
The group responsible for this document is the DOM WG. Regarding
discussion of such specs, this mailing list is the right place for that.
As soon as I am done with the rewriting and finished to deal with the
issues (see other messages on TextEvent for example), I'll ask the WG to
publish it. Given the rewriting, I believe we should have a new last
call period again.
