I question whether it's appropriate for DOM to define as many virtual keys as it already does. Many of these keys are very device- or platform-specific.

Also, you mention Unicode, which seems orthogonal to the discussion of virtual key codes. Aren't VK_ codes intended for key events and not character events? For example, there are not separate VK codes for '3' and '#' because they occupy the same key on the qwerty keyboard.

Here is the list of DOM Level 2 key codes [1] that are not part of the
DOM Level 3 key codes and that we might want to add again. I didn't take
the time to sort them yet (or look for their definition in the Java
documentation). Martin, can you have a quick look at them and tell me
which ones are already present in Unicode? Thanks - Philippe.
