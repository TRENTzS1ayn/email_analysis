Keycodes are device specific in any case so relying on them for
keydown/keyup would be inappropriate imho. Instead we rely on the
character that would be generated by pressing the key. The specification
is unclear however on which character should be generated, i.e. with or
without the modifier:
- A generates a 'a' on keydown/up, shift+A generates 'A'.
- 3 generates a 'a' on keydown/up, shift+3 generates '3' (and not '#').
Yet another inconsistency in the keyboard character system...
