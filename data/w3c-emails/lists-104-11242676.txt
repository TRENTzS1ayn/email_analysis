correction:
- A generates a 'A' (and not 'a') on keydown/up, shift+A generates 'A'.
- 3 generates a '3' on keydown/up, shift+3 generates '3' (and not '#').
(using a Linux system and Mozilla 1.1. I need to try with other
OS/navigators as soon as I am back home)
(I stole an example page on the web and improved it slightly in order to
test different OS/keyboards [1])

Agree. This was indeed the intent: virtual keys are for keys without
unicode character representation. If we reintroduce the keyCode, it will
be possible again to rely on the device specific layout btw, but we'll
make clear in the specification that its use should be avoided as much
as possible.
