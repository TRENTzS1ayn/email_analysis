Hi all,

there's something I don't think I overread it anywhere. the (read-writeable) 
attribute Document.documentURI may contain either the URI of loaded document 
or null if unknown/undefined. 

Hey, it's not "readonly". So, what happends on writing to it? get's the 
Document object reloaded with the new document refered by that URI?

This, and surely some more issues, are very important for me to be clarified, 
since I'm working on a implementing DOM in C++ ;-)

Thanks,
Christian Parpart.
