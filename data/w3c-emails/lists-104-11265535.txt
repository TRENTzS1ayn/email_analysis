Hi all,

After reading _multiple_ times the specification for that function,
Node Document.renameNode(in Node, in DOMString NSURI, in DOMString QName),
I am really confused about the content. 

Clear is, that only Element and Attr nodes may be renamed. Although the spec 
says that it must be done without removing-recreating the node, when 
possible. Then, it comes up with a long and not easy to understand 
description (for me) on how to remove the given node and create a new one, 
what rulez to take care about.

I have no use-case for removing and recreating the given node. I'd just change 
the qname and the namespaceURI. Am I wrong?

Best regards,
Christian Parpart.
