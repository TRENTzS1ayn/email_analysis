Yes. The question is whether to try to do something that includes
a wide range of keys on a lot of keyboards, or something that only
includes the keys on most keyboards. My tendency is for the former,
with the clear addition that a DOM implementation is only required
to support equivalents for those keys that are actually present.

"On some querty keyboards" is probably slightly more precise.
