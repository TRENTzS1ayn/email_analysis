Events 3.0:

From spec:
-----------
DOMAttributeNameChanged

Fired after the namespaceURI and/or the nodeName of a Attr node have been
modified (e.g., the attribute was renamed using renameNode). The target of
this event is the renamed attribute.
-------------

shouldn't the target be the element that contains the attr, and relatedNode
be the attr?
how can bubbling etc. work if the target is the attribute, since the
attribute isn't part of the tree..

thanks,
