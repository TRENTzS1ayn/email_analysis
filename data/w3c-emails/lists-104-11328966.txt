Xerces2-J does implement all the namespace algorithms defined in the
Appendix.
For details of the implementation see
org.apache.xerces.dom.DOMNormalizer.namespaceFixUp(..) and
org.apache.xerces.dom.NodeImpl.

To use this functionality you need to build Xerces with DOM Level 3
support (or cast to Xerces implementation):
http://xml.apache.org/xerces2-j/faq-dom.html.
