DOMSubtreeModified  events "may be fired after a single modification to the
document  or,  at  the  implementation's discretion, after multiple changes
have occured."

It would be nice if there were a processSubtreeModifiedEvents function that
would  dispatch  DOMSubreeModified  events  without  resorting to employing
another  thread.  I'm  using  C  but  I  can imagine with Java or any other
language  it  may  not  aways be easy or practical to make your code thread
safe.

My  UI  needs  to  redraw  when  a  subtree is modified but I don't want to
introduce  the  complexity  of using a thread to draw the UI in response to
these  events.  I  would  much  rather  just  call processSubtreeModifed at
strategic locations.

Thoughts?

-- 
A  program should be written to model the concepts of the task it
performs rather than the physical world or a process because this
maximizes  the  potential  for it to be applied to tasks that are
conceptually  similar and, more important, to tasks that have not
yet been conceived.
