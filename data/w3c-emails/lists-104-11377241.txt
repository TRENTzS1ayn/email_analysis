the escaped c-string output would be: "0\n\nbar\n"

Okay, I implemented it expecting that it is allowed. That means,
invoking setData(null) or createTextNode(null) will create an empty stream, a 
string that exists but with length zero.
This make handling easier for, e.g. later possible concatation 
(appendData("bar") etc.)
If you'll implement it to be a null string, that means, that this does not 
exist, you should ensure that returning someText.getLength() really 0, and 
getData() an empty string (to reduce further possible bugs)

> If it isn't allowed, what exception should I throw?

NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR, INVALID_ACCESS_ERR, DOMSTRING_SIZE_ERR,
INVALID_MODIFICATION_ERR, VALIDATION_ERR

All types I mentioned about makes sense in MY opinion. However, everybody may 
interpret it'self.

Not good, not good, really ;)
