A while ago, someone reported problems in the javadoc documentation of
the Java interfaces:
- the set* methods didn't documentation.
- the get* methods contained the exceptions for the set* methods.

It is now fixed (along with other troubles). Check the errata list for
the updated java bindings for DOM Level 2.
