This must mean that some people do not read the DOM specification in its
entirety when they start using the DOM.

I second the motion.

If they can't simply be deprecated, I would still use deprecation style
(so forcefull) language, example:
public Element createElement(java.lang.String tagName) throws
DOMException
  <p>You should not use this method, use createElementNS(null,
tagName) instead.
  See <a href="*">the DOM specification</a> for details.</p>
  Creates an element of the type ....
the same for createAttribute, setAttribute (there are a bunch of others,
but most are getters so there it is not that important?).

Kind regards,
