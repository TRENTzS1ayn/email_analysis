Realistically, nobody but an implementer reads the spec. Everyone else 
reads tutorials, of varying quality.

But many aren't reading tutorials either. Like it or not, that's an 
indication of the DOM's success. It's 
easy enough to use that people can dive in and operate it "by guess and by 
 golly", and popular/powerful/widespread enough that people _want_ to do 
so.

Everything in the DOM FAQ *should* be something you could find in or infer 
from the spec, if you read it carefully enough and understand all the 
implications. But people don't always realize what's important, or don't 
have the sophistication to draw  those inferences. This is why FAQ 
documents exist, after all.
