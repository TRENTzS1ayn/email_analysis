Colliding interfaces on a single object: Good point, and good catch. If
that's going to happen, method names should indeed be renamed.

I don't have an opinion on whether it will be true in this case, but note
that we often sketch things as separate interfaces, then merge them into
the previous interfaces once we're sure they're stable. That makes seeing
the changes a bit easier for the team which is working on them.

I'm not sure what you mean by "Java namespace". Package?
