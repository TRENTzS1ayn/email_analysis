YEMEN ARRESTS LIMBURG SUSPECTS YEMENI security forces have raided a building in Al-Mukalla, arrested several suspects and found bomb-making materials believed to have been used in the attack on the French-flag VLCC Limburg on October 6, the Yemen Observer has reported. The arrests follow a statement last week by Minister of Interior Rashad Al-Alimi acknowledging that the explosion and fire on the ship, which killed one crew member, was a terrorist attack. 

French and American investigators said they found traces of TNT around the hole of blast on the tanker as well as the remains of a small boat.  

Meanwhile it has emerged that Singapore had imposed 'no-go' around its petrochemical facilities well before the International Maritime Bureau  called for such measures to imposed globally.. 

The Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) told the Singapore daily Shipping Times: "Certain key areas within the Port of Singapore have been declared as prohibited areas. The restrictions cover the approaches to these facilities, which are used by tankers. All vessels and craft approaching these areas are required to obtain clearance from the MPA. The relevant security agency also patrols the waters to ensure compliance with the restrictions." 

Regulations restricting the movements of all vessels within specified areas by, "restricting and prohibiting all vessels from entering, anchoring, mooring, transiting or being in the areas for any other purposes unless specific approval has been obtained from the Port Master" were brought in a year ago.  
AMER OUT OF CHAPTER 11 AMER Reefer Company Ltd has emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection following the completion of restructuring. 

Yestrday the operator of 7 modern reefer vessels today announced that it had completed the restructuring of its US$100m 10.25% issue of preferred ship mortgage notes due in 2008 that had been placed in March, 1998. 

The New York Court that had given Amer sought protection under  the Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Code in March last year confirmed that all proceedings against the company had been withdrawn and all obligations discharged. 

Restructuring involved provision of US$43m by a syndicate of banks headed by Nordea Bank, Oslo, to finance the company upon cancellation of the Amer Reefer Notes. Protracted litigation and negotiations have taken place via the New York Court and Judge Arthur Gonzales. Additional sums required to cancel the notes, including interest paid since July 2002, are estimated to total nearly US$46m.  

Mandate Shipping will now own 100% of the equity in the Amer Reefer Company and will effectively convert the 33% of the bonds it holds in Amer, into equity. 

Ravi Mehrotra said that the collapse of the reefer market at the end of  adversely affected  the Amer Bond Issue, which was "very unfortunate for everyone".  

He added: ?When things became difficult and we feared the Company might be broken up altogether, we were very thankful for the on-going support of the Lauritzen Cool Pool, our banks, our suppliers and staff ashore and afloat."  
PASSENGER COMPENSATION CONFERENCE "CRUCIAL" SAYS O'NEIL IMO Secretary-General William O'Neil has stressed the crucial importance of a successful outcome to the Diplomatic Conference meeting this week and next at IMO to amend the liability regime relating to damage suffered by passengers on international voyages.  

The International Conference on the revision of the Athens Convention Relating to the Carriage of Passengers and their Luggage by Sea, 1974 started at IMO's London headquarters yesterday and will conclude on November 1. 

In his opening remarks to the Conference Mr O'Neil said that the successful adoption of the protocol would ensure that all those likely to be affected by a shipping incident will receive prompt and adequate compensation based on internationally accepted criteria.  

The draft protocol which the conference is considering has been finalised during several sessions of the IMO Legal Committee and Mr O'Neil commended that body's work in preparing the document.   
IMO SET TO IMPROVE SHIP PASSENGERS' LIABILITY AND COMPENSATION REGIME Compulsory insurance for passengers on ships will become international law under the proposed revision to the Athens Convention Relating to the Carriage of Passengers and their Luggage by Sea, 1974, set to be adopted at a diplomatic conference being held from 21 October to 1 November at IMO headquarters in London. 

 The proposed amendments to the Convention are contained in a draft Protocol to the Athens Convention. The draft Protocol introduces, among other things, the requirement of compulsory insurance for passenger claims, and proposes changes to the fault-based liability system, introducing the concepts of strict liability and reverse burden of proof in certain circumstances, and makes a distinction between shipping-related and non-shipping incidents.   

 The limits of liability are expected to be raised significantly under the draft Protocol, to reflect present day conditions and the mechanism for raising limits in the future will be made easier.  

 The successful adoption of the Protocol will ensure that all passengers likely to be affected by a shipping incident will receive prompt and adequate compensation, based on internationally acceptable criteria.
