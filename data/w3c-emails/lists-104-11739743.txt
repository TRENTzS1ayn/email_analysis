The DOM WG discussed this issue and decided to take no action in 
responce to this issue for the DOM HTML Level 2 specification. The 
reasons are that there are no (or at least not enough) implementations 
out there that support external usemap's, and this is still an open 
issue in the HTML WG. Therefore this issue is now closed for DOM HTML 
Level 2.
