Dear Sir/madam,  
   
STATUS-ONLINE.COM   -USD $ 620 
  
Please note that after years, the registration on the domain name STATUS-ONLINE.COM was not renewed and this domain became available to register.  
   
Consequently, we have been approached to market this domain name that has been tracked and registered by a client. As a result, STATUS-ONLINE.COM is now available from us for IMMEDIATE transfer.   
 
With so many companies using these initials along with what many would consider to be a genuine investment, we expect to find an interested party for this excellent .com. 
  
This is a VALUABLE and HIGH PROFILE domain and we believe that this development could be of genuine interest and benefit to your operation. Please note that the domain name market is extremely solid at the moment and similar domains are currently selling on afternic.com, greatdomains.com (domain auction sites) and by domain name brokers, in some cases, for many thousands of US dollars.   
   
Please note that transfers take just 15 minutes and are extremely straightforward - absolutely NO technical knowledge required!   
   
For our client's peace of mind, we use an escrow service for all transactions and domains are ALWAYS secured by the buyer prior to us receiving any fund. We pay all fees connected with the escrow process.   
  
If you would like to use WWW.STATUS-ONLINE.COM for your online business, please contact us at your earliest convenience - we will be on hand should you require any further assistance or information.   
   
We thank you for your attention and sincerely apologise if this e-mail has not been of interest to you.   
   
Sincerely Yours,   
   
Suzanne
