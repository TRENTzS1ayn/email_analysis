I had seen this in the previous DOM Level 3 Core draft, but it also had this comment (in red):

ED: Although the following defines a set of new interfaces that extend the DOM Level 2 interfaces the current plan is not to actually add any new interfaces but instead to expand the existing ones.

I didn't see anything quite this explicit in the DOM Level 3 Events spec.  I'd prefer eventual merging.
