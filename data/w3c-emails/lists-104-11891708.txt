In isolation, I would agree with you. However, I believe the intent was to 
allow stand-alone implementations of the XPathEvaluator which could be 
combined with DOMs that don't directly support this feature; the process 
of obtaining the evaluator would be different but thereafter the code 
would be the same, minimizing the multi-pathing/recoding needed to go from 
built-in to stand-alone implementations or vice versa. If we accept that 
goal, we do need to be able to pass the node explicitly.
