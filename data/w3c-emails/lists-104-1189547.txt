What happens with EventListener's that are registered on adopted Node's?  Typically, these are not stored with the Node, but are stored in a Map in the Document.  If they were to migrate with the
Node, typically an implementation would have to identify all listeners that listen to the adopted node or any child, register them on the new document and then remove them from the map of listeners on
the source document.
