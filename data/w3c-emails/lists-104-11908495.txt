While I definitely can  agree with your thoughts why XPathEvaluator is _now_ 
as it is, I also can understand Dominic Chambers. The problem is, that I 
can't imagine _ANY_ usecase for a standalone XPath Module implementaion. Why? 
Because I don't know any XML/DOM implementator who doesn't want to implement 
the XPath module, too. It would be a missing feature by the implementator 
wich would just let me choose another implementation instead of writing my 
own XPath module for that DOM implementation.

It's usually for a W3 reference implementation to cover most parts 
recommented. E.g. you'll never find a standalone Events module 
implementation, a standalone LS or AS implementation for (probably a 
specific) DOM implementation. It's more usual to cover them all in one 
package, isn't it?

Think of Xalan/Xerces, Mozilla, MSXML, libxml, (libXee, ) probably Saxon, and 
others.

Greetings,
Christian Parpart.
