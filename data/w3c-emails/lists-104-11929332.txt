While I do agree with the fact that the XPath module will be implemented
in standalone implementations, I don't think that supporting the
XPathEvaluator on Document is easier than supporting on the Node
interface. In both cases, the implementation will have to extend somehow
the interface (using a subclass mechanism or a delegate model) and
register it in the DOM Core implementation. This is why we have
getInterface in the Core in fact.
