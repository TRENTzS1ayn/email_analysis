As Ray says, "layers" aren't standardized by the DOM spec. You might want 
to read through the DOM Level 2 Recommendation to get an idea of what it 
actually does cover, or find a good DOM tutorial in lieu thereof.

I believe most modern browsers support the DOM APIs. There is a partial 
list at http://dmoz.org/Computers/Programming/Internet/W3C_DOM/, but your 
best bet for a complete answer would be to contact the folks actually 
supporting each browser and ask them which level of the DOM they support 
and what limitations (if any) exist in their implementation.

http://www.w3.org/DOM/ points to some other useful resources.
