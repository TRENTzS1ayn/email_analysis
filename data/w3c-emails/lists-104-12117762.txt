Hi all,

the DOM Level 3 Core spec currently provides for an event to be sent to the
UserDataHandler when a node is deleted. However, it appears that there is no
way in some languages, such as Java, to guarantee that this will ever be
called (because finalize may never be called).

Given that, the WG is wondering whether this should be marked as not
supported in some language bindings or dropped and left to language bindings
to define when necessary.

To help decide on this issue we would like to get feedback from others on
how they see this working in other programming languages.

Thanks.
