On the Issue wholeText-1, how to define logically adjacent text nodes, I 
proposed this be defined using the XPath concept of a text node; i.e. 
the wholeText of a DOM text node would be the XPath text node that 
contains that DOM node.

This means you would need to expand the entity references to get the 
whole text, though.
