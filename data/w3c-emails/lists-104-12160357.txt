The usage of "level 0" to refer to the pre-standardization DHTML APIs has 
been colloquial usage for  years now -- note the date on the document you 
cite.  Nobody else has seemed to be offended by the term, or to read it as 
implying endorsement for any particular product.

If anyone is really "taking DOM-0 as standard", then they haven't read the 
DOM Recommendations and changing the DOM's glossary probably isn't going 
to change their minds.

I agree that the term is slightly unfortunate, but I don't think changing 
it at this late date is either necessary or sufficient.
