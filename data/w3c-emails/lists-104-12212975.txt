If you aren't going to specify the order as explicitly called out by the 
XPath spec, I think it's wiser to not specify any order.

It _IS_ inherently and deliberately ambiguous.  Unordered means no 
promises about order order, not a promise of interoperability with some 
ad-hoc most-common-this-week behavior.

If that isn't acceptable, don't use the "unordered single node" call; ask 
for the ordered set and take the appropriate member thereof, and hope that 
your implementation was clever enough to compute this incrementally and 
not waste time on the ones you don't care about.

You're fairly explicitly asking for alignment with the current behavior of 
specific implementations. That's not an appropriate space for the DOM to 
be playing in, until and unless the XPath folks make that behavior part of 
their standard.
