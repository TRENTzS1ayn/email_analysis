I wouldn't be. In some applications it's critical. In many it's 
irrelevant, and that's fine; those can happily use an implementation which 
doesn't support it, and most such implementations will satisfy a wide 
range of users... but not all, and those who do need it have no other 
(portable) option.

I wouldn't object to making this a sub-Feature so DOMs which promise _not_ 
to call it could explicitly say so and that would be a (more) clearly 
acceptable option.
