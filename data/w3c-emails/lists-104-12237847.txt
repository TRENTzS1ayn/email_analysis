Following Director's review and given the results from the test suites,
DOM Level 2 HTML is now a Proposed Recommendation:
http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/PR-DOM-Level-2-HTML-20021108

The status of the document still links to the results of the previous
test suite but we should update that for the final W3C Recommendation.
The other news is that DOM Level 1 Second Edition will be able to move
forward as soon as DOM Level 2 HTML is a REC. 

Special thanks to NIST for submitting and maintaining the tests.

Philippe
