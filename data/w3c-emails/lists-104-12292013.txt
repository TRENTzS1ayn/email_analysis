Is the issue that calling the button.focus() method does not result in the generation of a "focus" event on the button?

The HTML "focus" event is fired when the focus changes due to some user action.

There is also the DOMFocusIn DOM 2 UIEvent that is fired when any focusable element receives focus.

Dear W3C experts:

I'm just starting to dig in the W3C-recommendations,so I might miss
something very elementary, now. But I'm very confused by the following
opposition:

In the DOM2-Events-recommendation "focus" is a valid method for the
object "button, but in the DOM2-HTML-recommendation it's not mentioned
(just like in the DOM1-HTML-recommendation).

Could someone explain this? Thank you.
