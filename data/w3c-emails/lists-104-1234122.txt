Hello All

I have developed one application using MSXML3.0 parser.The application is
offline test and it is developed in VB.When user downloads this application
one XML file gets download which contains all the questions.I have used web
browser control to show the question so that the look and feel of the
application will be same as online application.
Application traverses the XML file and retrieves question information one by
one.then it makes a HTML file dynamically using the Question text and then
Question is shown in the Web browser control.

This application works fine in Windows 98 machine but It is not working on
NT machine.It does not give any error but Browser control does not show
anything

What must be the problem??
