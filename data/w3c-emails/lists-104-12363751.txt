DOM XPath module last call issue diether3 was about the use of 
XPathResultType in the XPATHExpression.evaluate function not allowing 
maximum optimization in many use cases.   The working group felt that 
the case given is wrong. As the specification says, if you request 
ANY_TYPE, you will only ever get back ANY_UNORDERED_ITERATOR_TYPE, which 
is the easiest to compute, and this is about the most efficient way to 
detect whether there are any results without getting them all. You have 
to explicitly request the other types to get them.

See the issues list for more information at

Please let us know if you are, or are not satisfied with this resolution.
