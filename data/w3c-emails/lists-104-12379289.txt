DOM XPath module last call issue diether4 was about using a special 
IEEE754Number type.  The working group agrees and has added language to 
require the binding to specify further conversion if double does not 
match IEEE in a particular native binding.

See the issues list for more information at 
http://www.w3.org/03/DOM-Level-3-XPath-issues/all.html#diether4

Please let us know if you are, or are not satisfied with this resolution.
