DOM XPath module last call issue diether5 is about adding an 
XPathStringValue property to every Node which allows easy access to a 
Node's XPath string-value (since 'string-value' is not equivalent to 
'textContent').  The working group feels that it could be useful, but 
there are presently sufficient other methods for obtaining similar 
results, either requesting a single result as text, using wholeText on a 
text node, or by calling textContent on an element. It will not be added 
at this time.

See the issues list for more information at 
http://www.w3.org/03/DOM-Level-3-XPath-issues/all.html#diether5

Please let us know if you are, or are not satisfied with this resolution.
