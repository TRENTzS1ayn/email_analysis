DOM XPath module last call issue diether6 is about having a reset method 
on the iterator in case the user wants to iterate the result several 
times.  The working group feels that each of the use cases presented is 
better served by a snapshot than by a iterator.  The working group chose 
not to add a reset method to the iterator at this time to avoid 
additional complexity.

See the issues list for more information at 
http://www.w3.org/03/DOM-Level-3-XPath-issues/all.html#diether6

Please let us know if you are, or are not satisfied with this resolution.
