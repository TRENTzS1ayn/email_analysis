DOM XPath module last call issue diether7 was about the suggestion to 
modify the multiple use or "simulated" interfaces approach in favor of 
using specific interfaces.  After considering the alternatives, the 
working group has chosen to keep the existing single interface rather 
than adopting multiple variations in the belief that it makes the actual 
use by the user in various languages easier than if the user had to cast 
or otherwise adapt to multiple return types.
