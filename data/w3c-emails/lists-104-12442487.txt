I lead the effort to try to produce such a standard for what I believe 
you are requesting.  Unfortunately, it did not have the backing of 
enough participants besides myself (not any that I can remember towards 
the end).

It is an important issue, but until a lot of member companies take 
interest in the work that was done and left due to lack of interest, I 
do not see how it would move forwards.

Any outside companies or organizations are certainly free to work 
towards a standard either using the initial draft (very unproven and 
incomplete) or their own.

I agree with you 100%, but there isn't a lot that can be done until we 
have a group of companies interested in it.
