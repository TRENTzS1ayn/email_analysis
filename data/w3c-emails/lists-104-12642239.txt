I accidentally sent this to www-style.  MAJOR apologies to www-style.  Now
sending to www-dom as intended.

Hi Ray,

Thanks for your slightly more verbose reply.  I think I now have an
increasing understanding (although not yet complete) on our different
perspectives.  For example, you think that I do not know that HTML is not a
format specification (even though CSS positioning allows some).  In fact,
one of the main reasons I am having this discussion is because I want to
unshackle my products from formatting dependencies of my (or others)
proprietary format/layout engine, so I can more fully support W3C
standards! :-)

ACTUAL vs. COMPUTED:

See the subject of my thread.  My original post talked or linked to
discussion about the difference between ACTUAL and COMPUTED style values.
What Mozilla (and apparently IE) does is COMPUTED, but you, I (and others)
need ACTUAL.  There was link to Bugzilla where Boris Zbarsky stated they
removed the ACTUAL values (which was wrong per spec of getComputedValues()
and definition of computed in CSS, he said "you don't want to know" in
response to someone asking how ACTUAL values were returned) and restored
COMPUTED values.  According to the CSS spec definition, the ACTUAL values
are the values actually rendered.  I do not have the link to the CSS
section in front of me, but it talked about the minute rendering
differences (e.g. "a few pixels shift") possible between COMPUTED and
ACTUAL.  So I also need more than COMPUTED.  COMPUTED, as you and I agree,
is not enough to reliably model the View.  Computed values may useful for
some other purposes, but we agree they are not very useful for this
proposed module.

"Q _with_ A" vs. ABSTRACT

Where we differ is on the type of abstraction for the answering View
questions, and this relates to how we can relate it to the existing DOM if
at all (and possibly CSS if my idea wins).

You seem to prefer an abstraction that relates to your concept of how Views
are typically rendered.  You argue these are questions that can be
answered.  Which is a separate issue from your other assertion that my idea
makes questions that can not be answered.  Actually I think both methods
create many more questions that won't be answered.  In the end, it is the
one that answers the most relevant questions first, which is preferred.  I
can make an abstraction of nuclear physics that is incredibly general, but
that doesn't mean the questions that are important can be answered by that
incredibly abstract model.  I think we probably agree that pure
abstractness is not necessarily the highest priority attribute, nor is it
unimportant.  We need abstractness at the most efficient level.  I did say
that your abstraction was "clever".  I just didn't think it was (most)
efficient or necessary at this point.

I realize that CSS does not specify position for non-positioned content.  I
had already mentioned that several times.  I also said "with caveats" more
than once.  However, we agree that most interesting to us (at least now)
are presentations that do render the content on a plane with a known
position at some point in time.  CSS expects this to be true, because it
exposes positioned content, even if this is not always used for specifying
the content.  CSS also exposes models for alternative media that it
expects.  Thus I think it is reasonable to leverage the years of work that
went into CSS and reuse those properties (with caveats) but return the
ACTUAL values rendered.  For the high priority left, top, etc, a caveat
could be that even non-positioned elements get position at point in time in
View.  Actually the View could expose hasFeatures() to determine which
caveats apply.  IMO, the main difference from this and what you had is that
instead of redefining NEW properties, we build off of the existing CSS
properties.  We must assume that a lot of thought went into how CSS things
could be rendered.  So it should be reasonable to assume that many CSS
properties will have analogs in ACTUAL rendered space.  In fact, CSS
defines ACTUAL values.  It is just they have not yet been exposed.

However, a document.getActualStyle() is, as your say, an unanswerable
question, because it is a multi-variant equation (you referred to it as
"in-compound" answer).  That is why we need to specify the other variables,
which include the View and possibly time (as your point out), in order to
get an answer.  The time could be an optional parameter which defaults to
time of question, which was my assumption previously.

The other possible benefit of exposing one-to-one analogs of CSS properties
(where possible, remember "with caveats") is that the application can know
how to edit what it is getting data about from the View.  In fact, I think
this is the CRITICAL reason why your abstraction fails in the real world.
If one has to develop an equally abstract model of the relationship between
what they edit (the content) to what they can get presentation data on,
then I think you have increased the complexity by an order of magnitude.

DOM vs. View Properties

There are some properties which are owned by the View, which include it's
features, it position, size, type, etc..  The transformation into ACTUAL
values of the style of the DOM, is owned by the View, but since it is
one-to-one correspondence to the CSS-OM, then exposing that properties
(also) in DOM using OO techniques is a convenience and intuitive.  And I
think I can demonstrate how that can be done without requiring some extra
coding for each Node than would be required with a method call in View to
get transformed property.  Also I like the OO elegance of thinking of the
View as a Matrix which returns the CSS.  Of course, as I said in first
sentence of this paragraph, the View gets some of it's own methods, such a
HitTest() or Match().

FORMATTING vs. VIEW

I am against using the module to specify (write) format.  I think (at least
initially) the module should only read format.  That was my point against
include "Formatting" (as a verb) in the name of the module.  I can
elaborate on my reasoning, if you do not agree.


I can go into more detail on my previous pseudo code and errata, but I
think we should first address the fundamental abstraction.  So I stop here
and wait for your reply.

Thanks,
Shelby
