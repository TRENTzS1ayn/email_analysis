Ray,

Regarding your assertion that the W3C DOM is pure markup and contains no
presentation state, I think there are many examples in existing W3C DOM
standards where this is violated.  For example, look at the HTMLSelectElement:

http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/PR-DOM-Level-2-HTML-20021108/html.html#ID-94282980

The selectedIndex, value, options, blur, and focus function both as read
properties of the current presentation state as well as the  markup.

I think that resoundly blows a hole in the abstract idea that the DOM can't
have presentation interfaces.  Thus is a precedent for 1:1 correlation
between markup and presentation.  I think it is logically consistent that
the DOM can represent both the markup state and thru extended interfaces
also return the current transformed state.

Again I do not think specialized interfaces for modifying the transformed
state are to be encouraged.  Where ever possible it is logically very
important that one try to use markup to set state.
