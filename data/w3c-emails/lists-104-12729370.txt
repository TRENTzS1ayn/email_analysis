Suggest that some facility be added to these W3C.org mailing lists archives
online, so that they can easily be read in forward order.

The only way I have found to read them in forward order, is to start at the
last message in thread, continuously choose "In reply to" link until at
first message, then use <irony>Back button to go forward</irony>.  :-)  And
that doesn't find all the branches.

Of course, one can sort in thread order, but does not seem possible to send
a link to a burried thread or easily located a burried thread, in thread
forward order.
