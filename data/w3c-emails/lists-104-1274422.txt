The DOM 1 specification (including the draft of the 2nd edition) and the
DOM Level 2 HTML working draft specify that the createCaption(),
createTFoot(), and createTHead() methods of HTMLTableElement create a
<CAPTION>, <TFOOT>, or <THEAD> element, or return the existing one if
the table already has one.

What the specification omits to mention is whether the newly created
element is automatically inserted into the document tree at the
appropriate location within the table.

I assume that these methods are intended to insert any newly created
elements into the table automatically.  Is this assumption correct?

Can this be clarified in the second edition draft of the Level 1 spec,
and in the current working draft of the HTML Level 2 spec?
