Ray, I really wish you would call me, because this thread is becoming a
"debate of attrition" where neither of us is really addressing the other's
points.  For example, I was not talking about the modularity or
reuseability of abstract.  I said specifically, "the more abstract
something is, the less useful".  I am refering to utility as accomplishing
a feature set.

We are losing sight of our goal, which is to find a solution.  Not to
divert from each other's points.  I think we need verbal communication.
