Okay, so  you're saying that the value attribute of a select element s is the
same thing as
s.options[s.selectedIndex].value.  This is a useful shortcut.  Still, since
HTML does not define a value
attribute for the <SELECT> tag, I think the spec needs to be clarified to say
exactly what this value
property is.
