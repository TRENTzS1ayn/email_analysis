First, note that I have started a new thread based on what was discussed in
this thread, now that I have accepted the existing Segment model of DOM
Views and Formatting proposal is the correct starting point for future work:

Proposal for Improved/Simplified ViewsAndFormatting Segment *abstract* model

Regarding the discussion about XBL (and XUL) below, I have started a new
thread in www-style with my conclusions after further analysis:

XBL is (mostly) W3C redundant, and CSS is wrong W3C layer for semantic
behavior *markup* 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2002Dec/0171.html


If no one else replies to this thread, then this is probably my closing
message on this thread.
