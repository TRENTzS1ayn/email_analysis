As of the latest public draft:

http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-DOM-Level-3-Core-20030226 

the getFeature method in DOMImplementation and Node are returing a Node instead of a DOMObject. Based on the descriptions in the method, it looks like it should be returning a DOMObject. Now that DOM XPath is in CR, I want/need the getFeature function to work so I can use it to go from a Document to an XPathEvaluator.
