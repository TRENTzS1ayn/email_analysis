    Abstract
    --------
    This specification defines the Document Object Model Level 3
    XPath. It provides simple functionalities to access a DOM tree using
    [XPath 1.0].

    Status of This Document
    -----------------------
    This is a Candidate Recommendation of "DOM Level 3 XPath" and is
    based on the feedback received during the Last Call period. The DOM
    Working Group expects to request that the Director advance this
    specification to Proposed Recommendation after the DOM Working Group
    documents two interoperable implementations of at least one normative
    binding. Basic tests of features of this specification will be
    produced and used in this effort. The two implementations must be
    produced by different organizations. The Working Group expects to
    satisfy those requirements by 26 May 2003 and afterwards submit the
    tests to the DOM Test Suite. Please send reviews before the review
    period ends to the public mailing list www-dom@w3.org. An archive is
    available at http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom/.

    Individuals or organizations are also invited to send a message to
    the public mailing list if they intend to produce an implementation
    of this module.

    It is a draft document and may be updated, replaced or obsoleted by
    other documents at any time. It is inappropriate to use W3C Working
    Drafts as reference material or to cite them as other than "work in
    progress". This is work in progress and does not imply endorsement
    by, or the consensus of, W3C.

    This document has been produced as part of the W3C DOM Activity. The
    authors of this document are the DOM Working Group members.

    An implementation report is also available:
