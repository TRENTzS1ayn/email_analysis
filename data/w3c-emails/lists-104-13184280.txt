Under the schema-location property of the DOMConfiguration interface 
we have currently:

  A DOMString object containing a list of URIs, separated by white 
spaces (characters matching the nonterminal production S defined in 
section 2.3 [XML 1.0]), that represents the schemas against which 
validation should occur. The types of schemas referenced in this list 
must match the type specified with schema-type, otherwise the 
behaviour of an implementation is undefined. If the schema type is 
XML Schema [XML Schema Part 1], only one of the XML Schemas in the 
list can be with no namespace.

If validation occurs against a namespace aware schema, i.e. XML 
Schema, and the targetNamespace of a schema (specified using this 
property) matches the targetNamespace of a schema occurring in the 
instance document, i.e in schemaLocation attribute, the schema 
specified by the user using this property will be used (i.e., in XML 
Schema the schemaLocation attribute in the instance document or on 
the import element will be effectively ignored).


Here's the problem as I read it: the first paragraph implies that 
this property contains only URIs of actual schema documents, whereas 
the second paragraph implies it contains both actual URIs and 
namespaces URIs for targets (sort of like the xsi:schemaLocation 
attribute) . I'm not sure which should be the case here, but I would 
very much like to see the language clarified on this point, one way 
or the other.

The right answer may in fact be schema language dependent, but if so 
this should be explicitly stated and examples for the common cases 
given.
