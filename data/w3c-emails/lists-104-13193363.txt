Hi there,

The current public version of the core spec,

 http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-DOM-Level-3-Core-20030226/

as well as the current CVS version, has a missing '}' in the polish
attributes part of the normalizeNamespaces routine.
The placement of the '}' should now follow the current indenting of the
routine if I am not mistaken. I mean to say that the algorithm now has
the indentation:
     if ( Attr[i] has a namespace URI )
     {
        if ( something something)
        {              
           something something       
        }    
        else
        {
            // Attr[i] has no namespace URI
            
            if ( Attr[i] has no localName )
            ....

but should be
     if ( Attr[i] has a namespace URI )
     {
        if ( something something)
        {              
           something something       
        }
     } // new '}'
     else
     {
        // Attr[i] has no namespace URI
            
        if ( Attr[i] has no localName )
        ....
?

Kind regards,

--Sander.
