 From 
http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/CR-DOM-Level-3-XPath-20030331/xpath.html#Conformance:

An implementation is DOM Level 3 XPath conformant if it supports the 
Core module defined in [DOM Level 2 Core] and the module defined in this 
specification. An implementation conforms to a DOM module if it supports 
all the interfaces for that module and the associated semantics.

How would this apply to implementations of DOM L3 XPath that are 
external to DOM Core implementation?  For example, Xalan-J has an 
experimental implementation of DOM L3 XPath that operates on an 
arbitrary implementation of org.w3c.dom.Document.  Would that preclude 
Xalan-J from claiming conformance with DOM L3 XPath?
