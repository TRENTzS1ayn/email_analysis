Yep, Mike caught the editorial error as well:

Indeed, I took into account the editorial version of Core when I
committed the test files in the CVS repository. However, as you noted,
there is a backward compatibility issue and getFeature needs a little
bit of more work (which is done already but not included in the draft
yet).
