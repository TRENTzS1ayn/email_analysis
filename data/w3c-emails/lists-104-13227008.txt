As of the spec:

http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-DOM-Level-3-LS-20030226/load-save.html

The DOMBuilder section has this description:

---
Asynchronous DOMBuilder objects are expected to also implement the
events::EventTarget interface so that event listeners can be registered
on asynchronous DOMBuilder objects.
---

However, in order to implement the EventTarget interface, the DOMBuilder
(which does NOT inherit from Node), needs the getFeature method. This
will allow someone to go:

DOMBuildermyBuilder;
EventTargetmyTarget;

   myTarget = (EventTarget)myBuilder.getFeature("Events", "3.0");
   myTarget.addEventListenerNS("http://www.w3.org/2002/DOMLS",
      "load", myListener, true, NULL);
