Hi,

I was wondering if the DOM Working Group would consider splitting the DOM
HTML features document.referrer, document.cookie, and document.domain out
of the HTML-specific interface, and into a general "browser" interface
that applies to all XML documents as well. (I understand that not all DOM
implementations would want to support these features, which is why I am
not suggesting they be made part of the DOM core.)

There isn't really anything HTML-specific about these three attributes,
and I think authors would benefit from being able to use them from other
contexts, such as SVG, without having to cast their document object to an
HTML object despite there being no HTML on the page. :-)

Cheers,
