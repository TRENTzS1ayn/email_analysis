========================================================================
A small enhancement:

http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-DOM-Level-3-Events-20030331/events.html

In the section for EventTarget, there is a paragraph that describes how
move from a Node to an EventTarget:

---
... and, therefore, this interface can be obtained by using
binding-specific casting methods on an instance of the Node interface.
---

Firstly, I feel that it should refer to getFeature (similar to the
description for XPathEvaluator). Secondly, it should not refer to the
Node interface as the EventTarget is used on non-Node interfaces
(such a DOMConfiguration).

Perhaps something like:

... and, therefore, this interface can be obtained by using
binding-specific casting methods or by using the DOM
Level 3 getFeature method.
========================================================================
This is a typo error:

http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-DOM-Level-3-Core-20030226/core.html

In the section for DOMConfiguration, the parameter "infoset", says:

---
Note that querying this feature with getFeature returns true only if the
individual features specified above are appropriately set. 
---

It should be hasFeature, not getFeature.
========================================================================
A typo error:

http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-DOM-Level-3-Events-20030331/events.html

In the description for the isCustom() in Event, then return value
is described as:

---
boolean true if preventDefault() has been called for this event.
---

This is obviously a cut-and-paste error from the next function
isDefaultPrevented(). It should be something like:

boolean false, unless the event implements the CustomEvent interface.
