There is a mention of DOMBuilder.setFeature in the description for 
createDOMBuilder
(http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-DOM-Level-3-LS-20030226/load-save#LS-DOMIMplementationLS-createDOMBuilder), 
though the definition has been removed.

There also seems to be nothing in the draft that would mandate a parser 
be namespace-aware.  Unlike other parser configuration options, it would 
be very difficult to write code that could adapt if some implementations 
presented namespace-aware DOMBuilders and others didn't.
