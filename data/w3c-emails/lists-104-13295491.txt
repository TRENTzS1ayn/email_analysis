There is a parameter for namespaces. The description of
DOMBuilder.config contains the following:
[[
In addition to the boolean parameters and parameters recognized in the

and the Core module has a "namespaces" parameter, which activated by

parsers for DOM Level 3 Load and Save are required to support the
namespace processing.
