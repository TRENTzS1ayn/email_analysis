Correct. In fact, I expect that all DOM 3 drafts will need an update on
that front, including the XPath draft.

DOMConfiguration is not EventTarget, at least from the specification
point of view. While it is true that you can make the DOMConfiguration
to be an EventTarget, this is outside the scope of the specification and
we are only requiring the objects implementing the Node interface to be
EventTarget.

That would cover Nodes and DOMImplementations. While it is our intent to
enforce Nodes to be EventTargets, we stay silent on purporse for
DOMImplementations.

It should be getParameter in fact, and not getFeature.

Good catch!

Thanks for then comments. I'll add them, including my reply, in our
issues list for the record. As usual, since the DOM 3 Events is in Last
Call, if you are not satisfy with the answers, don't forget to say so,
