I have no objection of doing so and we could certainly add it on our
wishes list:
http://www.w3.org/2001/10/23-DOMOpenList
... but that would require that the Working Group do produce work on a
general "browser" interface, which we don't for the moment. Our current
plans are to finish DOM Level 3 (which is really late on schedule) for
the moment but, for the moment, we don't plan to produce more work after
that.
