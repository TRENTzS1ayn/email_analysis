Hi,
thanks for your reply. I agree with your opinion regarding 
errors. At the URL you give it states

"Users should refer to the specification of the error in order to find its 
DOMString type and relatedData definitions if any."

DOMConfiguration specifies the relatedData, but not the type. Does this 
mean I can just make it up? Or should I leave it blank?

Gareth
