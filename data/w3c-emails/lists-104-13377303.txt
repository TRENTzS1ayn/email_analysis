Hi,
thanks for your very quick reply. I must be missing something here 
as this is still not clear to me. Here is my situation:

Namespace normalization is occurring and one of the error conditions is
encountered. 

I report a DOMError through the ErrorHandler.

From 
http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-DOM-Level-3-Core-20030226/core.html#DOMConfiguration

I understand that relatedData should be a node.

I don't understand what type should be. It is not described at the same 
location.


At
http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-DOM-Level-3-Core-20030226/core.html#ERROR-Interfaces-DOMError

it says that when the error is specified then this information will be 
provided. It gives an example where type is "infoset-baseURI". I am trying 
to find what type should be for the error conditions I am encountering. I 
would assume it was something like "DOMNode".

many thanks again,


Gareth
